I've read 8-10 dating books, and this book has the best format and the best content.However, if you are not sure you are ready for dating, then I think you should take a step back, see what your issues are, and how you can deal with them. Each time I thought I was ready for dating, it turned out I wasn't. I met a great guy a few months ago, and unfortunately because I don't love myself, I couldn't trust that I deserve happiness.If you have healthy self-esteem but need some pointers when it comes to dating, then this book is exactly what you are looking for. Some women (me included) think that bending over backward for a man is the way to his heart. It's not. This book taught me that. Men love mystery. They love the chase. They don't want someone who will sleep with them on the first or second date, reveal their soul after a 4 hour conversation, and jump through hoops for the relationship. Look at nature, look at the shows about animals. The male species is supposed to pursue the female species. If you are pursuing men, then read this book. They like to do nice things for women. They love the thrill of the chase.If you are unsure whether or not you are ready for dating (maybe you've had bad relationships in the past that make you doubt yourself), then work on your self-esteem. Until you learn to love yourself, you won't allow anyone else to love you. I know from personal experience. I couldn't trust that a great guy cared about me. I thought once he saw the true me, he would run away. But he was amazing and I pushed him away because I couldn't trust in it. This book is not what helped me deal with my issues, books about self-esteem, self-love, self-acceptance are what have helped me with that aspect of my life. If you struggle like I do, then read You can Heal Your Life and Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends on it."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I've read this and also Why Men Mary Bitches and cannot say enough good things about these books. I never realized what a Door Mat I was --just doing normal stuff we girls do when we start falling for a guy-- until I read the \\"Bitch Books.\\" (BITCH = Babe in Total Control of Herself). I just became a Dream Girl to a great guy. It worked for me. If you're repeatedly wondering \\"what went wrong this time?\\" then look no further. Get it, read it, love it!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"\\"Let him chase you until you catch him\\" is a very nice sound bite but I wish Sherri would have elaborated more on that point in her book. If we succeed at getting guys to chase us, at what point do we stop running and surrender? In my opinion, Sherri doesn't give much guidance on how to discern the nice guys from the jerks; the implication is to treat them all like jerks until they prove they are worthy. Sherri tells us our best defense against getting played is to withhold sex. Guys that really like us, according to Sherri, will wait to have sex with us. I know from experience, ladies, it's just not that simple; the players and fakers can play the waiting game too. A better book to learn about how to read men is \\"Manslations.\\" This book tells you what clues to look for in a man that indicate he's worth your time and states that if you don't see these things coming from a man, you just pass on the frogs until you find the prince. The prince is out there! His book was easier to follow and made better sense to me."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I have ALWAYS had the needy problem with my boyfriend. It starts by me showering him with gift and attention, he doesnt appreciate it, I get hurt and nag, he runs away, I nag cause he's running away, he runs away even more. It's REALLLLLYY frustrating when all we girls ever want to do is just show our guys how much we love them and then expect that they reciprocate or at LEAST show they appreciate our effort. I have just read the book and havent applied any of the techniques as of yet but I will very shortly. I have a huge feeling it will work considering every time I give up on naging my bf and leave him alone he comes running back lol.I gave up A LOT of time with my friends because he would wine about hanging out. But whenever it came down to HIM giving up quality time with HIS friend, HECK no that would neverrrr happen. This book really helps me see that I shouldnt be so weak and just drop all my plans because my bf asks me to hang out at the last minute. It's not healthy for girls to do this but unfotunately it happens ALL the time.I've read that some of the reviews say that it didnt really work (or wouldnt work) because it made the guy give up the chase quickly cause she may have seemed to be too aloof or playing a game. From this I would recommend that people dont take the advice of this book TOO far. For example, u should show the guy that u care about him but NOT more than what he is showing u. It's not like u have to be totally aloof and pretend that he means nothing to u and act like u could do better. No. Act like u like him like he likes u but dont have a meltdown and freak attack when he starts acting distant or taking u for granted. Instead just ease down on doing the stuff u feel he is taking granted of and back off. Dont yell at him if he cancels plans. Just say something like \\"that's ok baby we can hang out another day. I really needed some time to get my work done anyway.\\" Or wtvr else. And then occasionaly understand that U should break plans as well if ever the occasion comes. Dont try and bend over backwards to see him if he doesnt do the same for u.This book shows u that it's not that ur bf doesnt love u, it's just that he's different from u. He needs different things in a relationship than u do. And it's best to read this book in order to understand their perspective and not feel so bad about urself if things arent going great at the moment in ur relationship. This happens to sooooo many people and I feel this book explains it perfectly on how to react to certain situations in a relationship when ur inner needyness of a girl is dying to pop up. Keep this book at close hand!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I have read this book at least 2 times. It is amazingly written, concise, everything is explained to the point and simply. I would definitely recommend this book to every lady out there who feels her man is not the same as he was the first months since they've met.It's true what they say - if you want to change the world, start with yourself. And if you want your man to change, stop trying to change HIM, change your attitude and respect yourself to the point, where he will start respecting you back!If you're not sure how to do this, then READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Pros: The book is humorous and does have a point. I love the fact that unlike many books on relationships, it is really specific with examples, not vague. It's a great tool to show women how to establish their boundaries so that they don't get walked over and make a man the center of their life, just part of it. Most men claim they want a \\"nice\\" woman and they do. But it seems like when a woman may think she's just being nice, being friendly or caring by initiating calls and cooking for him all the time, doing, doing, doing, then a man starts to think she's being too available, not mysterious enough, too accommodating and too motherly. Even guys who are generally nice behave this way towards the woman who is \\"too nice\\". And they think it must mean she's desperate and needy. Then he will start withdrawing and the \\"too nice\\" woman wonders what when wrong when she was being so loving.. It's sort of like the whole \\"nice guy\\" thing that most women get turned off by. This mainly applies to the courtship phase. Masculine men do enjoy the chase and mental challenges when they test you. as much as many will deny it, but I've seen it time and time again. I've been too nice to men, not the degree the book describes but I've experienced similar outcomes from being too nice.Cons: The author says she's not advocating gameplaying but many of her examples were gameplaying..and although she states the book is meant to be humorous, I feel like a lot of women will take these literally. e.g. the girl who pretended she was coming over in the rain, just to get back at the guy who booty called her. Or telling a guy you aren't looking for anything serious when you really are but you're hoping to have him try to win you over. Um many guys will think you really meant you aren't looking for anything serious and proceed with a casual relationship or look for a woman who does want something. That IS gameplaying and hoping to manipulate. All that might get a man to continue seeing you but it won't necessarily get his heart.I also take issue with relationship advice that pretty encourages women to \\"suck it up\\" and make it seem like we should be in a battle with men and stuff emotions down, and Argov does this frequently. It's as though she's encouraging women to be more like \\"one of the guys\\" in some ways and telling women to steer away from some of our feminine qualities. I believe in the feminine energy-oriented relationship advice out there for us of expressing authentic feelings and just not being dramatic and making your man feel blamed (as we wouldn't want to feel blamed too, right?) Otherwise we're being artificial. So I disagree with where she says to state things in a more \\"business like manner\\" such as \\"I think that\\" or you will seem \\"too emotional\\". That's just putting walls up and I think this all may just give more connection but not deep romantic commitment. It's definitely better to express authenticity and vulnerability using the phrase \\"I feel\\",again without being too dramatic.I still give it 3 stars for it's humor and that it did such a great job in stressing that you have to teach a man how to treat you and showing you how to do it. That was the best piece I got out of it. But really check out the materials out there that stress and focus on the parts regarding feminine energy and being open... that's a more authentic way of being and will get you to love without the gameplaying."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Well Holy Shit...

Men don't actually like bitches, not as wives, anyway. They might be ok for casual relationships. You can use tricks, but people know when they are being manipulated. Putting yourself first and taking responsibility for your own happiness, health, financial well-being, and so on is useful. A relationship is a two way street, though. I was married to a woman like this. She left, and left our child with me. I was glad to be rid of her. She made her new husband's life hell; she recently wanted to get in touch with me. I said no. My brother was married to a woman like this. She left him, twice. She came back, wanting to hook up a third time, and he just said no. This book could have been written for men, entitled, \\"Why Women Love Jerks.\\" I have seen many attractive, bright women, marry jerks. It is a total mystery to me. Marriage is considerably more than playing games. Men over 30 know when they are being played. Men over 30 are extremely sensitive to women with this kind of behavior- they have all heard horror stories by that time- and those with any sense cut them off quickly, and in a low key way. When men need a prima donna, they get a cat.Secrets About Men Every Woman Should Knowis somewhat more focused. This is a great book for women who watch soap operas, read lots of romance novels, and prefer fantasizing. The \\"bitches\\" in Spanish soap operas are not the heroines, though, they are the \\"malas\\", the villainesses, because Hispanic women are considerably more grounded in reality. I remember a woman who was totally gorgeous, in college. I spoke to her. I could tell from her first sentence she was in this class. Great! Useful feedback! I never spoke to her again. Only American women would seek to be a bitch, in their relationships with men. Hispanic, Asian, Eastern European, and African women have no problem at all holding their own, taking responsibility for their own happiness, health, and so on, and for the most part they don't need to be bitches to do it.Bitch: In Praise of Difficult Womenis another book somewhat like this. Men without serious psychological issues get enough difficulty in the workplace, and certainly don't want this in their relationships. I have to wonder if this book was written out of revenge."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"When I picked up this book, I had been suffering the aftermath of three failed relationships in a row.

Within 72 hours I had my boyfriend asking me repeatedly if I still liked him. Not only was he instantly treating me better but he has now said he thinks we could be soul mates and he can't wait to see me again very soon (we don't live together.)

At the time, the book was all the rage and was on all the morning circuit TV shows, like Good Morning America. The authors proclaimed the same ideas as this one: act aloof, don't call him back, don't care if you don't have him in your life, etc. Some of the girls I was *briefly* dating must have read this book as I did (yeah we guys do that to know your games). I emphasized *briefly* because as I figured these girls were either (A) not really into me or (B) either read the book or instinctively following the same game-playing ways.As a non-game player who's mature and secure with his manhood, if its (A), well then it's (A). The world is big and there's plenty of women who've I had no problem getting. So, God bless them and I hope they found what they're looking for (my apologies to U2). I never thought twice about them, except maybe for that truly one hot chic who I wanted sooo damn badly in the biblical sense. I was too self apparent and non-game-playingly honest about it too. I should have lied a bit maybe...Anyway that is case (A). If it was (B), then good-riddens! I really would not want them to call me back. Like I said I'm not into games. You like me and I like you, what the hell is then wrong with you playing stupid games? What are you?: some insecure little girl. Grow up, and if you do, then give me a call.It was funny how often I found out later from the proverbial grape vine that that girl or this one who played Ms. Aloof, then lamented when I moved on and dated, say, her friend instead or someone else she knew. \\"Oh man, she was really into you big time!\\" I was told by one female friend of a girl that was a Ms.-Aloof type. What was more funny was that those \\"friends\\" of the Ms.-Aloofs were so into me. It's like they wanted to check out what all the fuss was or have the guy that would not have her supposed \\"friend.\\" Yeah, you women are like that and we guys are psychologically adept at recognizing this in you.The really sad thing is, you would think this childish, puerile game playing would die by your mid to late 20's, but sadly it doesn't. There's some older women I know that are 30-somethings and still doing this and then, once again, you hear from their friends how they're really into you and wondered why you gave up on them and what you were doing, who you were seeing, and what you've been up to dating-wise.I now suspect that these lame women then write these kinds of books, because as the saying has it \\"misery loves company,\\" and every little Miss Havisham needs her little properly trained Estella to vicariously live through to validate her otherwise lonely existence.My advice, if you're either a guy or woman, first be honest with yourself. What do you want at the moment: sex, something possibly more, a real relationship? If it's the latter, you don't have to fall all over the guy and declare that. Yeah, you'll scare him the hell away. But you can say that you're tired of the bull and stupid games and not looking for that crap and want something more substantive and meaningful than just a lay. Or if you want just a lay, then say it from the onset, but don't expect he'll be really thinking you're long term material. However a double standard it is, he just won't really respect you as a girlfriend that way and most likely will cheat if he is with you as a \\"boyfriend.\\" Having him wait a little, if a LTR is what you want, isn't a bad idea. He'll know you're sincere and not see you as a sex object-or at least not *just* as one.This book just reminds me as that female equivalent of that looser male club called Sexual Payback, where some guys set up girls to date, have sex with and then dump. The guys, being loosers and hurt themselves, hurt not the proverbial b*tch slut cheerleader but the nice lonely girl with the glasses or the quiet book worm or the like. So stupid and cowardly. It's the same idea in this book but on a psychological basis. Only the proverbial \\"good guy\\" you women lament aren't there are the ones that will get hurt by this-and they'll never call you back either. The rest of the guys won't care and just use you.I believe in Karma; it's real. I've seen its power both personally and from observing its effects on others. What you put out in the world gets returned to you my friends. Some of us learn that lesson quickly, and others keep having that same lesson repeated over and over in their lives. Sooner of later it all comes back to you.Thank God, there are actually some sane, intelligent people that aren't childish or damaged goods out there and morally strong in character to not fall for this crap. Now that is genuine self-respect that no stupid book can ever give.To really love and be open to finding it, you have to be ready to get hurt. There's no two ways about that. Some flee from even the remotest possibility of hurt, and when they do they ultimately retreat from life itself. Life often might not be fair, but we decide our paths more than mere fate would if we let it.Peace and love to you and may you too find what you're looking for,GF."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I recently read this book after discovering a copy of it a friend's place. I thought interesting enough title. Always amused at books by women telling other women how to get men.If you are into playing games then go ahead and read this book. However, don't be surprised if a lot of them leave you sitting at home lonely on date night. While I do agree with the basic premise of this book, don't be a doormat and value yourself, I cannot agree with much else. You don't have to be a \\"bitch\\" to get a man. Some of the advice is just sad, at one point I just wanted to say give me a break. For instance, the nice girl will sit in quietly in a chair while he is watching sports, or doing some other activity that simply bores her and not say anything, while the bitch will complain all the way through it. LMAO! The author reasons that the bitch will make it known that she can't be walked over. Here's a novel idea, if he is doing something that doesn't interest you or doesn't include you LEAVE and find something else to do or don't see him that day. If you are truly miserable why are you there? Also, by staying and going on a bitch and moan fest, you are communicating the opposite of what you want. By sitting around complaining you are saying that I am so miserable but don't have anything better to do, so I am going to nag you to death until you change. And from growing up in a house full of men let me tell you, the way to get what you want is to never bitch and moan, yeah it may work the first few times, but eventually they tune you out and don't hear you anymore.I live in L.A. and let me tell, the more of a loser a guy is, the longer he will put up with these antics. However, if you date men that are high in demand, or if you live in a major city where there are plenty of beautiful women, you will be lonely. There is simply too much competetion for a man to spend a whole lot of time chasing after you! Unless, again he is a loser! A non-loser would not allow himself to be treated in such a manner for long, and a smart man will realize what you are doing and only pay attention to you until he attains the booty. Then guess what, you have been placed into booty call land and will be used.Why would anyone want to be with a person that would allow themselves to be treated in the manner that this author suggest? Crazy making is what it is. Playing games is not going to lead to a healthy and happy relationship, nor will it prevent you from being hurt. Folks, relationships are a gamble there's no guarantee that you will not get hurt. I don't care what you do. You will do more, to learn how to see red flags and cut off the relationship at that point. The more of bitch you act and the more games you play just insure one thing, you will never find what you truly want.My advice: Don't give too much until a person proves they are worth it, multi-date, and have your own interest. Dating is like buying a car, you have to be willing to walk out and move on to the next person to truly get what you want, if person A is not giving you what need or want and you communicate that to A and A still has issues move on to person B or C or D until you get what makes you happy.Peace!Den"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This book should come with a coupon for Hagen Daas, because you're going to end up on the sofa eating comfort food and wondering what went wrong.

In the beginning he treated me like an absolute queen, said everything I wanted to hear, and we had a ridiculous amount in common. I was swept off my feet and had never been treated so wonderful before... I even saw him as possibly being the \\"one\\". Where did it go wrong? Why did he all of the sudden want nothing to do with me? And why is this a repeating pattern with all the guys I date? Things are great, and then they suddenly walk away and I never speak to them again.I read this book and it all became crystal clear. While in the relationship, I thought I was making an effort to NOT be clingy or needy or anything of the sort. Now I realize I was giving off that vibe without even REALIZING it. I always went to his place, I left the decisions for what we were doing up to him, I wouldn't make plans with my friends until I knew if I was doing something with him that night... I basically let him control me without even knowing it.The point of the book ISN'T to act like a complete and total bitch, or even play a \\"game\\" persay. It's about keeping your life in tact. I am going to make a conscious effort in my next relationship to keep my life as close to possible as to how it was before I met him. If my friend calls me and asks me to do something, I'm not going to wait around to find out what my boyfriend is doing first before I say yes.

Which is not always the case."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I resisted this book for years simply because of the title. To be honest, I feel that the author does a huge disservice to herself by using the word \\"Bitch\\" in her title. My first instinct was to immediately reject this book because by nature (and as my friends will attest), I'm known as my very positive, easy going, sweet, and loving individual. I try hard to be considerate of everyone around me (male or female), and quite frankly, I shy away from the negative bitch types that I come across in real life. I was also tired of all those dating books which told you what to do and what not to do in the dating world. They silently infuriated me because I didn't want to live my life against a list of actions to do and avoid.However, after receiving an effusive recommendation from a close friend of mine (who's also a very positive person), I decided to throw away my caution read this book and it has quite literally changed my outlook on life.Let me first clear up a misconception that was my own: This book does not tell women to change themselves in order to get a man. It does not tell you to be negative, house an attitude, or think that you're better than the world around you. The simple message I came away with after reading this book was that you must BELIEVE in yourself and your unique characteristics, and that in turn, will draw in the RIGHT man for you.My biggest problem in the dating world was my confidence and this book helped me recognize this. Like so many women in their early 30s, I really wanted to be in a relationship and when a guy would show me attention, the first emotion I'd feel after the initial excitement was an anxious one. My pride aside, I quite frankly saw him as my \\"savior from the loneliness single world\\" (since so many of my friends were getting married), and I wanted to do everything in my power to keep him.And what I'm discovering is that this attitude is exactly what will push him away!!! And trust me, it has in the past!This book has taught me to repeat to myself the following adage: \\"This is me in all of my splendor...and it doesn't get any better than this\\". It sounds corny yes, but I saw a mantra close to this whenever I feel nervous/anxious about being single and it builds up my own self-worth and this in turn draws guys in. Because you know what? It's not about going out there and finding a man...it's about being happy with who you are, and if a man comes along that adds to that happiness-then so be it. It's so incredible freeing because it teaches you to love yourself for all you have. That a man isn't important, and ironically--that attitude in and of itself will serve to DRAW all types of positive people to you (and quite possibly a guy you connect with.)This review is getting way too long, but that is the gist of my feelings of this book. Is this book perfect? It's not--and that's why I gave it Four stars. There's a section in there that encourages you to cater to his ego by playing the \\"Dumb Fox\\", and while I understand what the author is saying, she does go a bit over the top when she suggests never killing a bug or changing a light bulb for fear of emasculating your man. LOL! If it took an independent woman to attract a man, then it will take one to keep him. Show him that you don't NEED him to survive (I can change my own light if you're gone), but that you don't mind moving aside and allowing him to take the limelight now and then to massage his ego (and he does the same to us!)"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I thought this book was about how to rule the guy. I was so glad to find out I was wrong. I always wondered how certain women get all the guys. Well, it's not about being a bitch, but being able to hold your own. This book teaches women how to not be taken advantage of. It refers to the \\"nice girl\\", which many of us are, not knowing that we are sending off the wrong signals. The book made me feel stronger about myself and dating rather than going in with so many questions and \\"thinking too much\\". I can't say that it is the perfect guide to dating, but the suggestions are fabulous and something all single women should read if you are getting many mixed signals from guys. It doesn't mean he's not that into you, just that you may have to approach things differently to get through to him.I thought the book was excellent. It made me feel better about myself and gave me some confidence about being a stronger woman in any type of relationship."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This should be required reading for all girls at the onset of puberty. The advice is entertaing and because there is truth, very damn funny. After a few relationships, I think most women will learn these truths, but isn't it better to realize sooner than later?

Despite all the machinations and tongue-in-cheek recommendations in this book, it comes down to the basic tenet that self-respectful singledom is much better than cohabitation in loserville. ;-)"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This book is amazing! I stumbled upon this book, by mistake, but her message is no mistake. This is a must read for all women (regardless of age, creed, or relationship status). Don't let the title throw you off...a \\"Bitch\\" is not a cruel, unkind person...quite the contrary! She is a woman who is kind, compassionate and brings the best out in herself, as well as her man. As a single woman, I feel as though I've gotten a sneak peak at the male brain. Sherry's tough love approach to this book, speaks to the concerns all woman face (come on, we all have them!)Let's face it, ladies....men and women do think and behave differently and to suggest anything else, wouldn't be realistic. This book helps celebrate the differences and the will give you the tools, knowledge and frankly the \\"smarts\\" to improve your relationships beyond your imagination.I just wish this book came out years ago.

I felt like the writer wrote the book directly for me. The words come off the page and you feel what she is saying. Like a cocktail with your best girlfriend or big sister. I look forward to following this author and buying future books as well. It was very unique, to say the least. And I highly recommend it for all women 18-45.

This book tells you how to keep that spark alive, how to keep his interest as intense as it was when he first met you, and how NOT to let him take you for granted, as so many men do with their ladies.

After reading this book, I understood the importance of \\"playing the game\\" to weed out the losers and find the man of my dreams.The truth is, a guy who is really into a girl will go the extra mile and court her. And I learned how to protect myself by maintaining a certain amount of aloofness and confidence. Some girls learn this naturally, others like me have to read about it. : )I think some of the negative reviews come from people who didn't read more than the title and the first few pages, or never had to deal with, or were mistreated by, a selfish guy. Maybe they already knew how to take care of themselves or knew what they were doing when it came to dating. I learned a lot about relationships, courting, and proper behavior from this book, and I am so grateful for it.My friend was the one who recommended this book to me. She said, \\"everything I want to tell women is in here!\\" She has guys wrapped around her pinky, and her fiance is wonderful. They have a passionate, in-love relationship, and she got to that point because she knows how to handle herself and doesn't get attached to losers. She will only take the utmost respect. I think this book teaches you how to get it from your partner."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Though this book has a crass title, the author has an incredible sense of the immutable, unalterable laws of human attraction. Her writing style is such that you can't help cringing as she describes the women who act so desperate, or thinking how cool they are when they act confident.The truth is, this book isn't about \\"male vs female\\" psychology. It's about powerful, fundamental truths that are the same for both sexes. These truths can be summed up in a few principles:- Everyone wants to feel lucky to be with whomever they're with- No one wants a clinging vineThe way to get there is to:- Be cool, but not angry- Never try to force or controlIf you know the true meaning of the word, then \\"Blessed are the meek\\" says the same thing.The great thing about this book is it gives you a true feel for how unattractive, or attractive, any of us can be. If you're one who keeps making the same mistakes in relationships and ending up on the short end, read this, and you'll see yourself as your intendeds see you. You'll also see how you will be seen if you play by these rules. You may as well accept and play by these principles - you'll never beat them.Or you can save yourself the money and just ask yourself, in times of weakness, \\"Does the person I yearn for act like he or she feels LUCKY to be with me?\\" If the answer's \\"Not so much\\", you better do something fast to turn it around, or they'll be gone. The good news is you really can do something about it. You CAN act cool even if you're caving inside.A book I like even better than this one is called \\"Love Tactics: How to Win the One You Want\\". This book is also about these fundamental truths, with things you can do to turn a bad situation around in a hurry. It also covers more situations and is more helpful in letting you know what you can actually do in these situations where you're not getting respect. The authors' belief is that romantic desire is composed of three things:- friendship - listening, having fun, being supportive- chemistry - that physical attraction- respect - the other person knows that you're willing to walk away rather than allow anyone to treat you with disrespect.It's a great book .For me these games are over as I finally found my soul mate, the love of my life, the woman of my dreams. But it took me 54 years and a LOT of heartache to get there. I hope you're a quicker study!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Now when i mean great , i am talking about really great. This book was the best I have ever read in my life. Sherry teaches you the simple things you can do. With every chapter, I tried this and the results were amazing. I lent my friend this and she wants a copy to keep for reference. This book i will definately recommend for single women or even women in a relationship who wants to hold their relationship. Its great. I'll give it 6 stars. Yes thats how great it is. The techniques used are remarkable. It's all about being a bitch. Now being a bitch is not being bad. Its being nice but you are letting them know you have a life, and you are living your life,they have to make time for you not the other way around. Too many times we women change our lives trying to incorporate men into it, we cancel plans just for them. This is a big NO. Do not cancel your plans and abide by their every rules. You cant always be available for them. And thats the trick. Its so simple i never thought that would change mens behaviour but it did. Now i have men calling me and tyring to fit in to my life.

This book is for you to respect yourself and your relationship. No where in this book does it say to disrespect your partner or take him for granted. I read this book on recommendation from a friend that said I remind her of the author. I agree with many points of Sherry Argov and respect what she has written. Her second book, Why men marry bitches also backs up her first book and is written with many hours of research...Interviewing MEN.For those of you who are bashing the book because it's \\"sick\\" or \\"stupid\\" or \\"ruined your relationship\\", YOU NEED TO RE-READ THE BOOK. Ms. Argov does not tell you to be stubborn and rude to your significant other. Also, if you're smart enough, you would know that you cannot change anyone else. You can only change yourself. And that is what your man responds to. If you are in a loving relationship and everything is going well, Why would you need to use Ms. Argov's advice anyway? Think about it before blaming anyone else. Please use your brains and love yourself for who you are. Everyone can tell when you are fake and trying too hard (too willing or too stubborn).

Men will respect you more if you hold your ground and say no sometimes than if you bend over backwards and cater to them 110% of the time. However, do not tolerate an abusive relationship. Most of the stuff are good, although I think now that my dating relationship crisis is over and have been happily married for over 6 months, I don't quite remember the rules.

Well, he wasn't expecting that and came back to me, asked for forgiveness, and has changed totally his tune. This book gave me the strength to set some \\"boundaries\\" and set expectations for behavior that's expected acceptable and that which won't be tolerated.This book is not about \\"bitchiness\\" - it's about self-respect and loving yourself... more than any man.I bought this book for three girlfriends and my sister, who's been married for 17 years (somewhat unhappily).

Golden advice."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I read this book because it's \\"One of the ten most iconic relationship books of the past ten years\\" according to the back of the cover (lol) and because who hasn't heard of it? I gave this book four stars because though it has some great advice, there are several points of supposed insight I'm skeptical about. The book appears to be based on a premise that men view women as either a \\"mother\\" or \\"lover\\", and women need to avoid becoming viewed as too motherly. How to do that? That's where it gets tricky...Sherry states a few times throughout the book that she is not encouraging playing games, but it's hard to see some of the advice as anything but game playing. Case in point, the men don't respond to words, only no contact. Although I understand her point that often times requests fall on deaf ears, I find totally not communicating the problem to be a bit disrespectful (the assumption is that men just KNOW what they did to upset you!) and withholding contact as punishing (which seems to be putting women into the motherly role, no?) What I LIKED: emphasis on being assertive and fulfilling your own needs before expecting others (specifically a man) to, coming from a place of want instead of need, giving space and each having your own life outside of the relationship, that you don't have to be a model to value yourself (or to have others value you), that men appreciate succinct communication. This is a great \\"dating\\" book in that it helps you find balance and not get swept away too early in the dating game and it offers good advice on how to weed out guys that are not going to step up vs. men who may have the potential to be healthy partners. What I LOVED: Sherry persistently talks about nice girls (women who give too much) vs. bitches (women who are assertive and find balance). She gives some great examples of how to spot when you are being \\"too nice\\" and how over-giving, over-compensating, being over-empathic are a woman's choice (as in, take responsibility for your actions, it's not all the guys fault!), but these misguided efforts will only leave you feeling tired and used. If you feel you have a pattern of putting/investing too much into relationships without getting much back, this is a great book for you! On the other hand, I'm skeptical of a few points. As I mentioned before, some of the advice IS game playing (the definition of a mind game is covert use of psychological influence), and some of the advice may stray too far away from a woman being true to herself. The greatest limitation of this book, however, is that there is no time line with Sherry's principals which makes following her advice difficult after the initial courtship. A lot of what she says is GREAT while dating, but what might work at the beginning of the relationship may be less than ideal further down the road...as one reviewer mentioned, most guys may like a chase, but eventually their feet get tired! And let's face it, most women want to stop running at some point! A specific example is the principal dealing with keeping the emotional baggage light. That is great advice while dating but what about once you've been together for a while and going through \\"hard time\\" stuff? Following all of her principals (all 100 of them) for a long period of time would be exhausting, even to the most vigilant lady! If you don't have the greatest memory, a summarization of the principals would have made her take home points a bit easier to remember and integrate into everyday life. (And save you the awkwardness of pulling out the book to confer during dinner with your date!)"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I read this book to learn what women think about men and what they think in general about relationships. As an avid student of the Art of War, I think this is a most read for all men that are willing to prepare themselves fully in how to recognize the tactics that women slavishly follow or how to mimic the kinds of men they are looking for. Yes, this is deception, however it is exactly this kind of strategem that the author of this book, Sherry Argov, is promoting. Men used to work hard at guessing what was behind women's motives. Now the task is easy, as women are writing more and more books and in the process, revealing more and more in the process about themselves."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This has got to be the stupidest relationship self-help book I've ever read - and I've read more than I care to admit. Some of the advice is so common-sense that I can't believe anyone would need it (for example, don't quit going to the gymn and don't quit your job for a new guy. Well, DUH.) If no one sees their boyfriend/girlfriend/partner/lover except when it's totally convenient, we are all going to be spending a few too many nights alone.The main point of the book is that you should be your own person, and not totally dependent on a man for everything. There are probably women out there who don't already know this, but not in my acquaintance. Another really atrocious piece of advice was that you should pretend you can't cook. Sorry. I like cooking. Then you're supposed to turn around and praise and coo over the guy because he picked up a hammer to do something (even if he totally bothches the job and you could have done it much better yourself). Of course we should all express appreciation of each other (in all kinds of relationships) but I have never been able to fake admiration for incompetence, and this book isn't going to help me do that.There are bits of good advice scattered here and there throughout the book, but mostly I wanted to throw it across the room. I only read it because a friend gave it to me, because she thought maybe my problem was that I was too nice. More likely, I'm too independent. She thinks that this book is the greatest thing she's ever read about relationships. I don't get it."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I was looking through the comments and found this.By Teri Marshal \\"Military Wife\\" (Phoenix, AZ) - See all my reviewsThis book should come with a coupon for Hagen Daas, because you're going to end up on the sofa eating comfort food and wondering what went wrong. I read this book. I laughed in all the right places, but then I made a terrible mistake. I took Sherry Argov's advice seriously. My marriage was good, but this book made me think I was getting shortchanged. So I took the leap and took control. Now I'm in marriage counseling and wondering if I'm going to be able to hang onto my husband. I did get one thing right, though. After eleven years of wonderful marriage, I managed to get my husband to call me a bitch. I'm trying to get him to believe that I'm in a midlife crisis. Because I can't bring myself to say that I destroyed a great relationship because of something that sounded good in a book.How incredibly tragic. This book that is like a booby-trap to get women to mess up any joy in relationships they might have - or in this case, had held in their hands - until they doubted themselves and looked into the glittering eyes of a narcissist. How sad that where this woman's relationship may be permanently injured by her being conned into taking the advice in this book.The author cares not. She laughs all the way to the bank and stops by Neiman Marcus for a new pair of Manolo Blahniks, secretly laughing at you the readers because true to her narcissistic personality, she 'neglected' to give you the whole truth, or fair warnings.But then she really thinks she is much better than you, and that you couldn't understand the subject of relationships anyway, which is a lie. The whole thing is designed for the sale, not to do any service for women or men. If you trust yourself, and be yourself, you will do much better. Enjoy the person your man is. Have communication and be friends. Laugh together. There is nothing of that in this book. To do this would require mutual respect and honesty.I'll bet she doesn't follow her own advice, but then being a bitch - er narcissist, she holds free to make the rules and change them at will."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Warning, this is a commentary by an individual that is convinced that this country is way too pumped up on self esteem, self empowerment, psycho babble, over medicated and takes way too much advice from self serving charlatans that tell people what they want to hear rather than what they need to hear.Strictly speaking as a man, this book contains yet more advice that if taken will guarantee that the reader will offend yet more men and take away what few chances for happiness that life serves up. Of 70 reviews only three of the reviews said that the advice in the book lead to a better relationship versus two reviews that said the advice ruined a good relationship. The advice is just an updated version of advice for \`women that love too much' that was popular 20 years ago, and that advice was nothing more than retooled divisive feminist demagoguery. Even though the book is about 250 pages long, it could be cooked down to two sentences:1. Good girls are clingy, needy doormats that men only use before moving on.2. Bitches, empowered and put themselves number one, are what men desire.The alleged humor is nothing more than updated feminist humor. Of course you remember feminist humor:Don't imagine you can change a man - unless he is in diapers.What do you if your boyfriend walks out? You shut the door.If they can send a man to the moon - why can't they send them all?Never let your man's mind wander - it's too little to be out alone.In a few years this book will be another thing that women who followed the advice will be trying to sweep under the carpet and pretend it never happened while they are making up yet another self-deluding reason why men do not like them.For those women that have not yet had enough of being lied to, manipulated and used by people with dubious claims backed by thinly disguised advocacy research, then this book is for you. For those women that have had enough of reinventing themselves and truly want to change their lives, then this book is not part of the solution; it is part of the problem.---------------------------------------------------------The more I see of the new fangled way of doing things, the more I appreciate the old fangled way of doing things."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This book was okay.

Now we can move on to the inexcusable other 90% of the material.I read this book in a fit of desperation one evening, emotionally weakened by lack of sleep and in need of the same mindless entertainment and self-affirmation that conducting a late night Google search of your own problem can provide. A friend told me it was a \\"good\\" book.No! No, no. This book has the worst advice I've ever heard and completely contradicts the idea that two people can communicate effectively, ever. I've tried to scrub my mind of the residue from all of the author's horrible advice but one nasty piece comes to mind -- pretend you can't do anything physical around the house, then \\"ooo and ahh\\" over how strong your husband is for something like hammering in a nail? Ladies, s*** like this is condescending and completely insincere. If you value your husband or know him at all, surely you can dig out a real compliment on a quality he's actually proud of.Another theme to ignore if you want a decent guy in your life is the idea that you'd better just clam up when you're angry --to teach him a lesson. There is a term for this, it's called passive-aggressive behavior, and it's a psychological problem that couples go to therapy to try to STOP doing.The author wrote this book for profit, which often requires sensationalism, and against that I have no complaint. However, I was too embarrassed to have this title staring me down from my iPad every time I opened the Kindle app, so I deleted it from my account. If you MUST read advice on relationships rather than talking to your loved one, just use the internet. At least you won't have to pay for it (although figuratively, you might)."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I read this book last summer and used it with the man I was dating, and he almost dumped me!There are some good points in here, about not compromising your value, and being confident in yourself.But then the parts about not showing emotion and showing your true self is just bad advice.

Relationships are much more complex than the book suggests, and I don't believe that men should be trained like pets by using the carrot and stick method. I find this book very shallow, simplistic, and targeted to apply to the masses. Also, I don't like the title of the book. The author could call \\"bitches\\" \\"strong women\\" instead. Both \\"bitch\\" and \\"doormat\\" seem to be derogatory to women, and men are depicted as silly puppies that can be easily manipulated by the \\"stick and carrot\\" method.

I would rather be happily single than stuck with a man who is not enthusiastic about me. I chose to get out of those relationships even though I could bend over backwards if I want to keep the men.I do want to point out that it might be difficult to fake bitchery.

She makes relationships sound like a complicated game, when in fact no game exists. Successful relationships are not chess or high-stakes poker.1. Women, stay in control, always. Why? Because you have the most to loose. Don't get married unless you are certain that you want children. Don't get married/involved in a long-term relationship unless you KNOW that you can survive, financially, independently from him.2. Kick the loser out if he is a drunk. Kick the loser out if he has a problem with drugs. Kick the loser out if he is unemployable. Kick the loser out and get the police to throw him in jail if he ever strikes you. There are plenty of men out there without these problems. Give no second chances.3. Make sure that you are sexually compatible. If sex isn't important to you, make sure that it isn't to him, and vice versa. Remember: when you are both 45 - 60, he will look better than you do naked. Average women will still look at him. Only desperate men look at middle-aged women with stretch marks. It isn't fair, but it's true.4. Find someone with compatible energy levels. If one of you is a homebody and the other isn't, it won't be a happy relationship, ultimately.5. Enjoy similar hobbies. Be prepared to give each other space. Enjoy the same or overlapping types of music, films, books. If you are an intellectual, marry one. Never yoke a stupid person with a smart one, no matter how big the love.6. DON'T GO LOOKING! Relationships aren't important until AFTER you have years invested in them. Being single can be just as emotionally and intellectually satisfying.And that's it! Everything else is small stuff."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I heard and read the fuss over this book and a woman I knew gave me her copy (I will have more to say about her in a moment). Many women not only seem to think this book is disturbing to men but have said so outright and with some misguided, idiotic sense of one-upmanship satisfaction. Indeed, I think many women after reading this, will have their anxieties greatly provoked, given what they are thinking men find appealing about women.The basic premise is that men do not respect women who have no life. Well gee wiz, Sherlock Holmes! The author says a woman needs to \\"hold her own\\" in a relationship, and many women on here and in conversation have taken that to just men they have a proverbial entitlement to b*tch and moan whenever things don't go their way. Wrong baby. You can whine all day and night but an entitlement to what exactly? \\"Holding your own\\" to a man is what you can bring to a relationship, if he is actually considering being with you in one. Any by what you can bring I mean in terms of support, economically, socially, emotionally, psychologically, and in terms of interests and skills. Unless a man is some Donald Trump type, then a college educated man today is looking for a woman that is genuinely intelligent, reasonably educated, can bring financial support to the relationship, has an actual career, preferably an interesting one, and yes of course a physically attractive woman as well-one articulate and emotionally grounded. Now any of these things will prove variable depending on the man and his own status in life, and if he is a Donald Trump, then brain and education are bottom on the list and you better be young and have killer hot looks. But that is a rare extreme.Again, most educated men are looking for intelligent career women. It is not something that is \\"hot\\" or \\"sexy\\" or some fetish to us. It is what is expected in this day an age, coming on the heels where many of us have seen our father's slave economically as the sole \\"bread winner\\" and out mothers, who worked hard in their own right, had it much easier, all while feminist said \\"daddy\\" was suppressing mommy. I can tell you my father would have loved to have had a wife that worked and helped support the house economically and not just domestically (which my father supported domestically as well). I am not impressed in women doing now what men have for many decades down for family and country. Now that women have the opportunities (and some can argue more in some respects) as men, it isn't something to be applauded for since this is old old news. Indeed my mom did start to work in industry late in life, around the time when my siblings and I were going off to college (I'm 30 now). For a woman today to think that having a job or career makes her special is just utter narcissistic folly and in all probability the \\"career\\" is what a robot could do. No man will ever find that in and of itself fascinating or worthy of greater respect. We men have been doing this for generations, so you are not impressing us coming on the playing field we largely created and still outshine you on. Being and education and having a job are base minimums.After education and career status, men are seeking for a real individual. Some other male review mentioned this already and he was dead on. Today's women are a dime a dozen. Many, even in their 30's are trying to emulate other women, buying gaudy, hideous, and expensive shoes and book bags that leaves a man seriously confused over what the appeal is. Many of you dress the same, talk the same, act the same, and think that still you are different from the endless masses. To a man seeing you, all he'll recognize is that many you have blue eyes from green eyes, are a blonde instead of a redhead, and perhaps a bit more chubby than his previous more sports active girlfriend, but that is where the differences end. These are physical differences and subtleties, which soon will lose their appeal if there isn't anything more substantial at play. Do you have a genuine personality? Or is your only sense of self giving some hackneyed reply of \\"holding your own?\\" Exactly how? How can you distinguish yourself from all the others who believe and say the same thing? How does that make you stand apart from them? It doesn't. You are just part of the white noise and background.It is ironic, for just a few short decades ago women bemoan how they wanted men to desire women of substance. Now that men do, women are reverting to all the past feminine and sexually exploitive stereotypes that women of previous generation would have avoided. One wonders then just how far women today truly have come as a whole.What makes a man not just respect a woman but desire her? Is it her body? No. That is lust. Is it her mind? No. That is just fascination. Is it her career? No. That is just an incidental interest. What makes a man fall if love and respect a woman is the same thing that makes a woman fall in love and respect a man: his sense and knowing of self, reliability, commitment and dedication, empathy, and most of all-despite having a life that he could live separately on his own, shares it self-lessly by bringing and giving love to his partner and family. That is what makes a man. And that too is what makes a woman-for it what is being human is about. You don't have to be a Ph.D. to know this or read a book written by one showcasing that suffix at the end of her. And if you think that a pretty shoe, or this book bag, or that career or that thing you do that you believe makes you so unique will set you apart in his mind and earn you his respect or love-you are greatly mistaken and know nothing of men today or yourself for that matter.As for the woman that had lend me her copy, she is an attractive woman who works in advertisement. She makes good money. But she is a clueless materialistic clone-minded self-centered woman that is believing that the world revolves around her and mistakes this belief for \\"holding her own.\\" When she asked me out, I politely turned her down. I am not looking to waste time with women like her and know what I want in a woman and she wasn't it by a long shot. Love is making yourself open in being first open with yourself. That is what makes anyone fall in love with another, and sadly this woman didn't have that openness."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Ladies, men don't love bitches.

In other words, the book backfires, so be careful, Mrs Argov.-The one your mother warned you about."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Give it a rest sweetheart. You like to fancy yourselves \\"independent thinkers,\\" and like the prime exacmple below (i.e. little Ms. \\"Katie\\"), many of you are deeply deluded mental midgets. I have read both this book and some of the choice reviews on here. There may be guys that are angry on here in their posts, but it is not becuase of your suppose independence. It is for the appalling lack of individuality you make false claim to having and the apologia for your even more appallingly short-sighted, backward ways.The \\"I'm too much of a nice girl\\" bathos is truly the pathetic rant of a severely underdeveloped mind. It is not any surprise why so many of you are in your mid twenties and single and having such dating and relationship difficulties. Many of you just do not get it. One review on here was right on the mark; there are many female losers out there--and you are most likely one of them. After all, only a loser would say they are not looking for a man in a review that is about how to get and keep a man--through mostly deceitful tactics that would only work on an 8 year old. Yet you are so dim witted and such \\"deep independent thinkers\\" that you totally failed to even recognized this most obvious fact about what is motivating you.Bottom line, is many of you, like \\"Katie\\" and \\"Oracle\\" above are very needy and emotionally insecure females (not women). Men instinctively pick up on this. Moreover, putting on a b*tch patina will not hide that fact--but rather bring even a greater attention to it for the blarring attempt to compensate for that insecurity. A man can easily piece together the unsaid narrative of a so-called \\"independent woman\\" like you and with ease placate you and manipulate you and then have you alone at the end to at first wonder why and then conclude it was because you were too much of a Ms. Nice type. That is your only fallback poistion.Well, love, there is a progession in evolution here with females like you. You are at stage one: the \\"I'm too nice\\" phase. Next comes the deepening and rapid deluding of self and a concurrent spiralling decline of self-improvement and feeling of deeper entitlement and resentment over the success of others--especially over the fact that many women are actually deserving of love and respect and have great success at love and relationships. These women only serve as constant irritant to you in being a chronic reminder of your loser ways and lack of success. Little males are not the only ones with frail, tender egos--but little females like youself can suffer even more greatly from this ailment.The thing is if you were really an independent thinker, then you would not be on here with the rest of the hundred plus like-minded idiotic clones, saying the same trite things and making use of the same fallback position responses and cliches that can only appeal to a most rudimentary, pedestrian mind, which then most pitifully concludes is possessing a unique insight and real \\"understanding\\" of matters.But carry on little one: You make it easier for the real men out there to spot the chaff and fodder from the genuine and worthy. You are just not the latter--and that is the painful truth you cannot bear to accept and so desperately trying to escape as your reality. For at the end, when all is said and done, it is the latter that men respect and love and the former that they despise and reject."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I thought this book was for men...later i understand what this was about. I have to agree that most men are so stupid that yes some of these techniques will work for them. But let me think about something. Women do not approach guys and especially in cold approaches. SO this is about men in their social circle who women find attractive and they want to have a relatiosship with them (If they just want sex they only have to show them that they like them sexually - and when i mean sexually i mean it - Not the miserable girl that beg with their manners for 50 dates after sex , but be a little playful sluty ). In case of relationships attraction is not a choice. If you like him, you like him and this is the end. If he is so pussy to go for what he wants then maybe by applying theese manners you may intrique him, especially if he is young.But is this an authentic man? I dont think so.The real man goes for what he wants and he approaches women - if he doesnt get her he goes for another one. He is not so emotionally involved in the beggining (as many women are). He begins to be emotional after sex (Im talking about a real man - observe it and you will see that i am right)What is important in the begginnig is the appeareance. Fix your body (the height doesnt count in most cases)Hit the gym,Then go to a place where they are men, and just be near them (I understand that you will not open them (its the ego and it is ok if you are a woman). (Clubs - coffe shops - parties - places with rock music) ANd do not go with more than 3 friends -> its so difficult .I also have to say that these techniques work also from men to women (most of them who have success with women do these things unconsioulsy - since its about women that they can find easily. A hot woman has the more apporaches. She doesnt need these tricks . As also hot men do not need tricks (most of them)If you want a serious relationship, let him take the control.Even when he goes for other women he will return to you. Most men want many women - Its in their dna, and this is the truth. This is not bad since they do not get emotionally involved as they will with you. They dont have to love a woman to make sex.This is what happenes and that why the hot men have so many women that they behave as jerks.Another think i have noticed is that not so good women (fatty and miserable) have a lot of insecurity and wait for the perfect one (Brad pitt clone). Yes this happen to the most ugly girls ironically. The most hot women do not care so much about appeareances but only about sex, fun and security - and thats why they like them.If you are fat you have almost no chance with a hot male (and fotget the alpha male)You have to understand that a man is not a girlfriend with a penis. He likes football, women , work and socializing. He is not albe to speak like a woman.On the other hand if he has no humour - stay away from him, no matter how hot he is. He is a stupid man beyond the men circle.Read the books: How to become an alpha male + Bang to get the idea"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Guys, this is a great book to read for no other reason than it will help you strengthen your game and read what other women are reading about us.

I disliked it immensley. Ever wonder why the divorce rate is so high and why the statistics of women cheating are at par with men? Yea I know....oh brother, she is on her soap box. Obviously I'm not a bra burner, no just like you I want a lasting relationship built on all the good things they are supposed to be built on. I believe everyone should treat their man/woman as if he or she was the only one walking the earth. I cannot tell you how well this works, of course without being a doormat. Relationships are about giving and taking, it's natural for all of us. But we should never take anyone for granted and have illusions of grandure. Eventually the gig is up, how stupid are those around you? Well if you do not surround yourself with intellectuals well than what can I say? I have never had a relationship I regreted and tihs is the God honest truth. As far as I know I have never been cheated on and at least 6 times in my life men have asked me to marry them, no lie. Not once did I treat a men as if the sun rose and set because I exsisted. I am happily married now going on 5 years and my husband tells me he loves me every day and that he hopes he leaves this earth first because he does not want live even 1 day without me. How could I treat such a wonderful being but with the upmost love an respect? There are no guaranties in life folks but we have A LOT of control in our destinies. You ladies keep fooling yourself about what makes a relationship work and what real happiness is...........let me know how the end turns out!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"On the surface Why Men Love Bitches is about attitude and empowerment, but as I read more, I realized that it was based on more traditional dating ideas and roles. It just has a quick coating of attitude and slang, with most of the ideas coming straight out of books like The Rules (with the authors of The Rules being mentioned in the acknowledgements). The main point of this book is not how to be empowered, but how to act empowered enough to catch your guy. Then combine this with manipulation and tricks and he will be yours. This exploitation of women's insecurities hidden in the guise of empowerment is disturbing.It is based around 100 \`Attraction Principles' that run through the ten chapters. These give the reader points to be aware of and rules to follow so they can catch and keep their man.She gives tips, some simple like if he is grumpy, go out and do your thing. Some are more complex: if you want to see more of him and he says he can't go away because of work, get his attention by not whining. He'll become concerned because you mysteriously no longer want it. He'll think that he no longer has a 100% hold over you and this will rekindle the flame of romance (rather than him just think there is no problem as you haven't said anything). The actual advice and \`attraction principals' were very repetitive, just slight variations on what had been discussed in previous chapters.There are some parts that I agree with: having a life - but having a life because you want to have a life, not because you want to be the one in control of the relationship. \`Being natural' is also brought up as men want to be with someone who is natural - and it is possible to seem natural if you follow Argov's rules. Other grating advice was more obviously in the style of The Rules: \`...he should feel like the Grand Poo Bah of his habitat and domain.' Of course he is not actually the Grand Poo Bah, you will just have manipulated him to think that he is. Does honesty play a part in Argov's scheme? I checked the index and it wasn't listed."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"As a man, I bought this book to help me try to understand how women think.

First and foremost, you'll learn that the most important thing is to have a fulfilling life of your own, before you seek a companion. You'll learn what the term \\"bitch\\" describes, as it's not what you're thinking. It is an assertive woman who has her own life, can take or leave her man, and stands up for herself. All the while, this \\"bitch\\" will love her man, and make him feel like a man, like he's in control. Of course we all know better. I recommend this book. It was an easy read, and it opens your eyes to what you may have been doing wrong in the past."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This book is actually about how a woman who has lost her own personal empowerment can take it back easily, and without manipulation. It is not about being mean or spiteful or anything like that. It is not about being manipulative. Don't let the title fool you. It is about how both people can be empowered. It is an enjoyable read, quite humorous and brutally honest. It pretty much confirmed what I already knew but was always resistant to admit. Then, one of my girlfriends and I used some of the techniques with our boyfriends because we felt disempowered and drained. Whaddaya know? It worked like a charm. It was a beautiful thing. Both she and he and my guy and me were happier instantly. It's not about man-hating or anything like that. We love our guys. And they love us, they just have trouble expressing it sometimes. It is because of how men and women are socialized. Like it or not, it is a fact and therefore sometimes can be like a mountain in the way of progression. But it doesn't have to be! That is the hope from the book. This book demonstrates, in a very pragmatic way, how she can sort of steer the relationship to a place where both people will be happier and more fulfilled. All women should read this book, in my opinion...you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"My girlfriend turned me on to this book, I read it, turned it on to three of my girlfriends, they read it.

The book lacks the authenticity women need to be in a real relationship.If you feel that you have been taken for granted, and walked all over, this book will help you to see that.

The author's basic point is correct in principle, that no man respects a doormat, i.e. a woman who puts her man's needs before her own. However, her solution is to dispense some dumb, game-playing advice. And the book basically says the same thing over and over. The author does not seem to know the difference between having self-respect, and playing games to create the APPEARANCE of self-respect. Most men can tell the difference eventually.Despite these criticisms, I thought the book was funny and gutsy. And although the author uses the word \\"bitch,\\" she makes it clear that she is not advocating rude or bitchy behavior of any kind. The term is for fun and to sell books.

I never thought that a man would see being nic as a sign of weakness, but it is so TRUE!!! Every man I have dealt with in past relationships have been spoiled by me but they always walk away. The last guy got a motorcycle and all expense paid trip to FL out of the deal AFTER the break-up and his \\"we can see other people\\" just because I wanted to be \\"NICE\\"! How crazy is that. I still think he sits around with his friends and laugh at me. If only I had this book in the beginning of the relationship, this would be so different now. A must read for every women.

They simply don't engage someone who doesn't give it to them. ~Sherry ArgovWhy Men Love Bitches is a wickedly humorous read! Sherry Argov unveils the male mind and explores the possibilities of a more irreverent attitude to life itself. What is this book really about? Respecting yourself and developing the coveted \\"Je Ne Sais Quoi.\\"Sherry Argov's sassy wit and astute observations will be best received by women who have been too nice and are unwilling to continue on this disastrous and unfulfilling path towards overcompensating and chasing down love. You will learn:How to go from Doormat to DreamgirlWhy Men Prefer the Thrill of the ChaseHow to make the most of your Feminine and Sexual PowersThe Ways of the Mysterious FoxWhy Neediness is always NegativeThe 10 Ways men show they are In LoveThis book will generally be more useful to the single woman who wants to form a permanent bond with the man of her desire. Married women could skip the first third of this book, which mostly deals with avoiding a man's sexual advances until he has shown you the respect you deserve. Married women will find the second half of the book more useful than the first, although the entire book is well worth reading for the sheer comic pleasure.There are 10 chapters with 100 attraction principles. Sherry's Attraction Principles are also listed in the appendix for easy access.The most shocking part of this book might be page 97, where Sherry Argov explains that when a man tells you he is interested in a long-term relationship he may just want sex with no strings attached. Throughout this book you will find a number of tables with things men say and what they truly think. You may find yourself getting angry and losing respect for men in general, but take a few deep breaths. Maybe a little anger is a good thing in this case. It will show you the path to enlightenment.The only aspect this book doesn't really address is the concept of men who have a higher level of female energy. If you took some of the advice in this book and applied it to various relationships, you may end up with no relationship at all. I mean, men are human too and they are as unique as women will ever be. There are some men who want you to say you love them all the time. There are men who are in fear of the word love and will refuse to say they love you even under extreme duress.To be honest, I disagree with her about men being willing to just eat anything although those sections of the book are perhaps the most hilarious and wicked. I've yet to meet a man who did not have specific and often gourmet preferences, favorite foods and a desire for a meal seasoned with love. I've seen men fall for women who know how to cook and who go out of their way to prepare a man's favorite food.This book is very much about playing by your own rules so many of the ideas can be adapted to suit your present relationship. If you are not in a relationship, you can test out these ideas and see if your new sexy, strong attitude attracts the man of your dreams.Sherry Argov will show you all the ways to keep your best card for last. She explains why some women appear to be stalkers and why you should help a man pack his bags if he says he wants to leave. She gives excellent advice on why you should avoid communication with a man when you are extremely emotional and why your sexual desirability has everything to do with your independent attitude. This book is not encouraging you to be an angry bitchy person. Sherry Argov is encouraging women to create an irresistible force of attraction no man would ever want to resist. Definitely hide this book in a safe place. ;)After reading this book, read \\"Perfectly Said\\" by Brian Douthit. It will restore your faith in men and romance. You might also enjoy: 227 Ways to Unleash the Sex Goddess by Olivia St. Claire. For self-esteem issues: Caroline Myss Self-Esteem: Your Fundamental Power.You may laugh your way through this book and then find yourself strangely disgruntled and moody. This too shall pass. I took some of the advice from day one and strangely enough my husband picked up his own clothes and even took out the garbage. Oh, the possibilities. When I told my husband he likes me better when I'm bitchy his response included: \\"Oh, you make me so mad.\\" Then, he literally (yet somewhat gently) threw me down on the bed in a most passionate way and wow, this book works.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This book changed my life. It gave me so much confidence, I feel like I can get any guy. If you are someone who does not like this book, I'm 99% sure it's because you didn't understand it. Like she said in the preface, it is not to be taken too seriously. Her humorous style gives extreme examples that are meant to teach you lessons, not necessarily tell you exactly how to act towards men. You are not supposed to be a bitch to your man, you're not supposed to control him or manipulate him. The main point I took from this book is that you should not obsess over a man you just met, you have to keep your independence and control your feelings so he does hold the reins of the relationship alone. Being needy and nagging shows him that he has control of your emotions. Being independent and confident shows him that he cannot take you for granted. Approaching a relationship with the confidence you gain from this book will make you both happier. If you think this book is telling you to be a bitch, act uninterested, and make him chase you forever, then you took it too seriously. Feel free to show him affection and let him know you love him, but make sure you keep your own life and stay true to yourself. Don't turn into someone who's every emotion is dependent on him."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I loved this book. It made me realize that I was lacking self-esteem and value for my own life. In the past, any time a man would enter my life, i would make my life all about him. There is a quote in the book that struck me: \\"Most women are looking for something in a man that they should be giving to themselves\\". It's so true. Find your own true joy in life first, and then a man will be a nice bonus. This way you are not completely dependent on him for happiness, and you are able to give more freely, because you are not living in perpetual fear that you will be destroyed if he leaves you.This book made me realize that the most attractive quality of all is dignity. As long as you have your own dignity and self-respect, it doesn't matter if a man realizes that or not. If he's not the one who will appreciate you for you, then move on to the next!!!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This book is one of the best I have ever owned. It teaches women how NOT to commit the mistakes that we seem to be programmed to do in relationships. So many women give up their lives (hobbies, relaxation time, etc) for their relationship.

I like that she states several times that this is not about playing games - it's about staying true to yourself and to your interests. I think that idea is very important as several women I know change their lives completely just to \\"fit\\" a man. Anyway, in general this book is great. I wish she had written a chapter (or perhaps even another book) about the same idea (holding true to yourself and your values) while married.

I've recommended this book to many women who, unfortunately, think it's too harsh but yet continue to be walked all over. And some of the men writing reviews need to stop it.

Men want to work for you and this book has the answers!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This is another great, entertaining self-help book you find on the bookshelf of your favorite good old bookstore. These are the tools many of us, women, wish our mother taught us before we start dating. However, I got to say this though. The tools you learn from this book are like different sets of sharp knives. You can use it to craft a nice piece of sculpture in life. You can use it to hurt and abuse men's feelings.I will tell you this, ladies. I am very thankful I did NOT pick up this book when I had my first serious heart break. If you were hurt by men and you have suppressed anger and pain over those relationships, reading this book will only sharpen your \\"play girl\\" skills. Yes, it will help you get men and fool 90% of them. However, honestly, you are using the set of \\"knives\\" to destroy others. Don't do that! You had your heart hurt but that does not grant you the right to go out and hurt others. They did not cause your heartache. That one or several men did. If you seriously was abused and hurt in those relationships, try Don Miguel Ruiz's books or other types of self help books that invites love and compassion towards self first. Find your ways to heal the anger and pain. It is ok you feel angry and resentful to men in general. However, going through the peaks and valleys, you learn more about yourself. You learn the difference of what behavior from men is acceptable versus not acceptable.Use the tools you see in this book as a way to create a nice piece of sculpture in life with the one you are very interested in. What Sherry Argov suggests is very true. At the end of the day, we need to have the self confidence on our own and be secure about ourselves. We are good enough just the way we are. It is by choice we choose to be with a man, not because we are not good enough (Who said I don't look good? Who said I reach 30s therefore I am not desirable? Even if that's the case, who cares... I love myself and that is enough). A man either likes us the way we are or he is not the right person for us. We try very hard to work relationship out but we do not bent our back over and lose our sense of self. It takes two people to make a relationship work. So, let him do his part and you do your fair share. See his actions before putting your heart down for him. Putting your heart down never means you sell yourself short or losing your sense of self and the things you like to do. We treat ourselves with dignity and make things clear to him what is acceptable and what is not. We do not need his approval to survive because we can be happy alone. I learnt the lesson in a very hard way but now I find myself happy in general because I am emotionally independent. The tools here also only work well on men who are secure about themselves. The suggestions here will twist the young, sweet and innocent men's fingers and they will not know what to do with you. The advices do not work well with the controlling men (but if they are controlling towards you, why do you want to be with him?) These tools can drive the insecure men insane. And you ultimately need to pick and choose which set suits what situation, what type of men.Again, tactics suggested here are tools. Don't use it as a manipulation game. Don't play this manipulation game on any guys just to get what you want. You use these tools (by being a mean bitch) to spice the relationship up and creates the spark, the thrill and the chase. You can do this while you two first met. You can carry on this spark till you get married and have kids. But the poor guy does not need you to use these things to hurt him at the end of the day. You ultimately want to have a content, intimate, passionate and loving relationship. Use the tools to help you develop that relationship like a piece of fine art/sculpture instead of destroying others."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I tip my hat to Ms Argov. Her vignettes and insights are captured with humor and chilling realism. Because I'm a man, I started the book by fighting against its basic premise; yet by the end, I grudgingly capitulated to the inevitable conclusion that - in the long run - men need partners who are their equal.This is a must read for men and women alike who are interested in finding and keeping meaningful long term relationships."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I am reading this book again and again. My gosh--to finally have someone sit down and explain it is like--thank you!!!! I never had a mother or a sister to teach me this stuff and now I understand things that confused me.I understand the nonverbal behaviors of men--why they pull back--why I give myself up, what I do that sends the message I am insecure, etc. I believe this relationship book has changed the way I approach relationships permanently.I also understand what attracts a man so much more--I think we think it's all looks or sex. It really is dignity. Most importantly, it felt empowering. I felt good about myself after reading it, and I felt that I have much, much more to bring to my next relationship!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Although I enjoyed reading this book and found it to be quite humorous, I have mixed feelings about it. I agree with the parts that talked about having self-respect and not bending over backwards for someone that continues to treat you like dirt, valuing yourself as a woman, and not be \\"needy\\" desperate, and clingy...but the parts I don't really agree with are her advice on games and trickery to keep a man or get him to long for you. If your interested in someone and he's interested in you (and it's a mutual thing) by all means give him a call or at least act interested! Now if he starts acting \\"funny\\" and uninterested, that's when you stop calling him or even trying to show interest (whether you're a man or a woman). I'm just wondering if this book really worked, then why is SHE still single."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I think it's very interesting that most of the negative reviews about this book are written by men!Of course we women should not need to read a book to tell us how to behave in order to get the men and relationships we deserve. It's something that should feel like second nature to us, a deep reservoir of emotional intelligence that we somehow absorbed from our mothers and the healthy, loving environment in which we grew up. Sadly, the atmosphere we were immersed in and the lessons we absorbed were in no way conducive to our understanding of what makes for a happy adult relationship later on.Our own experiences and our own mothers did NOT teach us what we need to know, hence we were left to our own devices. The results of that spoke for themselves. One relationship after another of trying to prove how good you are, how worthy you are, how special and loveable you are and before you know what's happened you are looking back on a long string of relationships which ended when you became the the dumpee rather than the dumper and you can't for the life of you think what you did wrong.After a while you realise you need to fill the gaps in your knowledge and you set about finding someone who can teach you those valuable lessons that your mother never did. It's easy to sneer at a woman and label her as being pathetic for 'resorting' to a book like this but where else are we going to learn? We have seen where our previous behaviour had gotten us and quite frankly it's not where we want to be so the logical conclusion is that in order to change the outcome you need to change your behaviour.There's a lot of criticism that books like this stop us from being natural and make us behave in ways not authentic to our personalities. But the problem is, our so called 'natural' behaviour shouldn't be regarded as something so sacrosanct because what is it really? It's the result of how our personalities and our expectations have been shaped by our environment and experiences growing up. My personality would be very different had I had a mother who praised me and taught me to value myself rather than one who continually put me down. The personality is not forged in iron but largely dependant upon how you were treated as a child.So do I stay loyal to my 'true' nature, regard advice such as is given in this book as alien to my character and carry on the same as before, getting dumped every so often and going through more damage and more hurt?It feels odd adopting some of these patterns of behaviour because it's not what you have been used to doing but that doesn't make it wrong. You can't guarantee that by following all the advice you will get your dream relationship but there is a heck of a better chance of it happening if you do follow it's advice than if you carry on as you were.If you are a woman to whom this sort of behaviour is second nature anyway then you are very fortunate and you don't need to change but for the rest of us change is compulsory.I've read the men saying they don't like women who play games and their girlfriends' don't play games and they are just honest and open and themselves and they love them to bits. But most of the time the girlfriends' in question who are inspiring such love and devotion are strong, gutsy, women with a sure sense of self love and worth not drippy, dopey little doormats with 'welcome' written on their foreheads. That's WHY you love them, men! Which proves that the message put across in this book is the TRUTH!!!So good on you for those women who don't need to adopt some different tactics but as for the rest of us, lets forgive our mothers who, after all, only learnt their lessons from their own mothers, let take this advice on board and become the lovely, gorgeous, confident, spirited, self loving women we are supposed to be."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"All I have got to say is; it simply works. I will say that without a doubt. Guys are so used to \\"pushover\\" women that do almost whatever they want. As soon as girls go against the \\"grain\\" in the relationship and have they're say in thing then the guys' head starts to spin...like \\"what just happened?\\". It is so damn attractive no matter what a girl looks like.Good example, I worked with this girl. She could have easily been a model, she had all the physical qualities. We hung out for a few times, then I started noticing that she would call me everyday, she would wait for me to get out of work to make plans, she would bend over backwards. I had no idea what it was (at the time), but I just wasn't attracted to her, as I look back I KNOW the reason I wasn't attracted to her was cause she wasn't a challenge at all.THEN, there is this other girl I know. She is quite overweight, not really attractive at all. BUT...She has the confidence about her that is amazing, she never returned my call the same night, she always acted like she never even cared if we hung out...and it blew me away. I wanted her.The fact is. Some women women don't think they could be like that. But let me tell you. If you act like you don't care, then you really feel confident and you feel like you have the upper hand in the whole relationship. It'll change your whole look, mood, etc.Read the book, and if you apply these principles you will get more guys \\"hooked\\" to you then ever."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I haven't finished this book yet, since I just purchased it yesterday, but I HIGHLY recommend it to anyone that has felt like a doormat or felt lacking in anyway concerning a man. I've asked the question, why do men act like that? plenty of times and the answer has been given to me in this book. They act like that (nice in the beginning, then disappear, call every day to nothing at all, etc.) because I allowed them too. I beat Kate Hudson in \\"How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days\\" by losing him in 8. This was simply because I wasn't confident in myself and I offered (didn't give) too much of myself too soon. Looking back and in reading this book, my last encounter probably sensed it and ran for the hills without indicating that anything was wrong. No more, no more, no more. It won't happen over night but it will happen. Acceptance is the first step towards progress. Get this book!! I'm still a nice girl because I will be lending the book to a couple of my friends who think they have men under control but are sooooo out of touch. As far as I can see, this book is their only solution.Thank you Sherry, for the eye opener."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"...and everyone lived happily after.(!)Women have been indoctrinated, or rather infected, since we were little with the fantasy that Prince Charming was going to ride up on his white horse, decide that we need rescuing, and whisk us away to his kingdom and we would live happily ever after...in other words, He's Giving Us A Life.Now, please - I'm not stating that women should abdicate men. There are many wonderful men out there with true hearts desiring to find his counterpart. Interestingly enough it's the woman who wakes up from the dream of being rescued or redeemed by a man who's able to spot the gem. Since she's learned to be happy and has deemed herself worthy of going for the gusto on her own (she doesn't need a man to escort her into the magical kingdom after all, what a concept.)she's capable of entering the relationship without unrealistic and unfair expectations on a man. C'mon guys, you have to appreciate that a burden has been much lifted from your shoulders. Now you can have your Guys night out because she's happily engaged with her friends on a continual basis. Isn't that a pleasure? You're not responsible for her every thought and feeling.Sherry's book isn't so much an attack on MEN as much as a wake up call to women and men that certain behaviors should no longer be tolerated..by either gender, in my opinion. I'm well aware of the fact that there are women who treat men like trash, too. I'm inclined to come down on them just as hard. I was impressed with the men who were able step up to the plate and admit that they have played alot of games with women in the past..I give them alot of credit for having that much courage. They are strong enough to want women who possess the strength to not accept any less than his best. (In fact, many men have shared that they find those women inspiring.) Like really does attract like.Then there were males who screamed long and hard because they felt that they personally were called to task. Healthy women don't expect *all* men to stand trial for the wrongs incurred by men who've done them wrong in the past. We're able to evaluate each man on a case-by-case basis. And how do you assess someone? By observing a person's actions, not words.Guys....No one has the right to try and change anyone...if your way of life is truly fulfilling and producing the long-term results that please you, then tell anyone who has a problem to go away, that's your right. But on the same token, women (and men) have a right to set standards of behavior that they expect to receive in their relationships, and abandon those who use and abuse them. Who can *reasonably* have a problem with that?Develop a rich inner and outer life and learn how nourish yourselves, so you're not starving or begging for love and/or approval from others. I don't have to mention names, but the men who reacted so intensely know who they are. The Shakespearean quote, \\"Me doth think thou protest too much!\\" comes to mind. I have a couple of questions for them:1. Do you have a history of healthy relationships with women? If not, how did you contribute to the devolvement of the relationship? Or was it all her fault?2. Would you encourage your daughters, sisters, and other female relatives to put up with substandard behavior from others?Now don't go accusing me of being a male-basher, because I'm not. I want to see both genders demand respect from each other. (This is NOT being spoiled and having a sense of entitlement as one male reviewer protested, btw.) I am married to a wonderful man who treats me like a queen and I roll out the red carpet for him.I was with Sherry 90% of what she wrote, my only points of contention were the \\"Dumb like a fox\\" section, that contradicted her overall message. Stop pleading and submerging your needs, you are allowed to speak up and be heard. I also was disappointed with the example she gave regarding the man who expected a woman he dated only a few times (they weren't in a relationship in other words.)to wire him emergency money while he was away. Yes, his action was inappropriate at best, but her's wasn't entitled to bragging rights, either. Why didn't she just say, \\"NO!\\" Or \\"HELL, NO!!\\" Or \\"STICK IT WHERE THE SUN DON'T SHINE!\\" And then hang up??Aside from the previous paragraph, Thank you Shery, for caring enough about relationships between men and women to place yourself in the line of fire.With high hopes for each of you to find the loving partner you desire,best wishes."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"In all relationships, compromises are essential, but women tend to sacrifice more due to our nature.

Many women, including myself, could benefit from having more of a backbone when it comes to romantic relationships. In that sense, this book is a step in the right direction. Unfortunately, the book's message is muddied by its endorsement of game playing and manipulation.

Like most women who are eager to demistify men's attitude and way of thinking, I've been an avid reader of all kinds of written information on the subject. And I'm proud of having a collection of real \\"gems\\" written by great authors and brilliant scientists. What sets Ms Argov's Book apart though, is to my opinion, its directness and the \\"communication code\\" she has chosen to convey her messages through.While reading it, I had the feeling of enjoying a friendly chat with a long lost friend of mine, who had my trust and also the wisdom to speak to me openly and advise me about things I tend to do wrongly while confirming my gut-feeling about things I dared to do right against my ingrained \\"good-girl\\" mental models.She uses plain English to break down simple and working tips about the most common everyday issues between men and women who are romanticaly involved. She also places great importance to a woman's individuality which has been brutally hurt the last decades by the Advertising Agencies to the degree they've been positioning the sexy-woman symbol next to the products she must be associated with inside a consumer's mind. She restores a woman's personality back to its well-deserved throne and analyzes with undeniable logical arguments why she must put herself first and how this makes her more attractive in a man's eyes.I'm Ms Argov's loyal reader and I'm sure you'll be the next.How to Seduce Him on The First Date : Instructions Manual (Happier-U)"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I would recommend this book to any single gal out there.

It basically says that men don't like or respect women who are doormats, and tells you some ways to act like a bitch, which is the author's tongue-in-cheek label for the opposite of a doormat. Some things sound very strange though. For example, she says to never cook for a man, and if he asks you to cook, make popcorn and pretend innocently that that's all you know how to cook, or pretend that that's what you thought he meant. It even, bizarrely, gives a recipe for popcorn. In the end, I wound up returning this book, because there is really not enough substance. I already know how to make popcorn."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"While the techniques in this book may work with a few men ( I wont deny that some techniques actually could work) There is no way that a truly respectable alpha male in charge of his life with plenty of options will tolerate any of the following techniques. Do you want a man or a wimp?Interesting relationships are about push and pull, i give you some and you give me some back. Its a way to create tension, without tension there is nothing! If the man is doing all the chasing such as this book suggests, regardless of what you think he will get bored, grow tired or find a way to replace you. If he is a decent person and respects himself with dignity he will walk away eventually and if he doesn't, you girls then have to realize what kind of guy you are dealing with an absolute sucker of a toy! Congrats!While men are competitive in nature and appreciate the chase, no man loves (as this book describes) doing all the work just as you women don't either.\\"If the nice girl leaves, she calls first to tell him where she'll be and what time she'll be back.\\" Yeah obviously thats how it should work if your in a respectable relationship!\\"The bitch lets him think about where she is every now and then\\" yeah go ahead and try that with any respectable guyout there who values himself!The problem with this book is that if these techniques are working on your man then you essentially have a puppet, a goose neck who doesnt have confidence, who doesnt respects himself and who is weak! Just as a man will tire of something so easy, you women will tire of an easy man who will bend over backward at your every call. You also want a challenge, just as we do. The result is two fold, it goes either way. Men and women may be different in most things but when it comes to true universal love we are not that much different. Bottom line is that you both need to meet each other half way or the relationship will eventually fall apart and perhaps even become destructive. Once again these techniques may work but only on a wimp who doesnt know any better. Men want a women, not a little girl and certainly not a bitch!Following this advice will only hurt you long term, you will grow bitter when you realize good qaulity men wont stick around and the techniques will grow on you so much that it might even be hard to reverse before you realize that all your relationships are a game! Just be yourself at all times, allow love to flow, never be afraid to let go and give your true gifts and radiant energy. I love women, but not like this!Wonder why the author keeps her identity a secret? Good luck trying to find a biography on her, she is probably a bitter old single person who still plays these games on guys that dont know any better.Do yourself a favor and read Blue Truth by David Deida or any book of him for that matter."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I loved the book and tried many of the suggestions that Sherry offers.

I understand where the author is coming from and for the most part, I think the principles she provides make sense to a point. Just remember that there are a lot of immature people out there who are \\"users\\" both men and women. Find someone who is as passionate about you as you are for them. Someone who is mature and looking for a relationship with some content. This will eliminate a lot of the game playing. Take time to get to know someone before getting into a relationship. Relationships are like investments. If you just throw your money around pretty soon it loses value. Long-term minded people are careful and take their time.I agree with some of the other people who have commented about clinginess and that sort of thing. If you do that, you need to wake up. As much as you can examine the other person to see if you want to be with them just remember the coin has a flip side. Look at yourself and the person you are interested in or dating from an overall perspective and see what improvements can be made.There is so much worldly advice on relationships, kind of like dieting, that it is confusing but, I believe that you attract others who are similar to you. If you're someone who sleeps around you'll attract the same. If you're nice you'll probably attract someone nice. Birds of a feather flock together!I agree that men are more attracted to a strong independent woman who knows where she is going but, is still feminine and kind. Whatever type of woman you are, you shouldn't (as a single) rely on a man to come along and take care of you. Go out and get your career and success.Anyway, maybe I'll read the book for kicks!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Sherry is an EXCELLENT and THE GREATEST writer there is!!!

While men may request much, they don't usually expect to receive it, and when they do, it is usually the woman who suffers. The sexual attraction that many persons feel is rooted more in emotional support and the importance of maintaining an integrity of style they can admire as substance than the easy acquiescence of giving in to desires. If that isn't the case, most men and women are usually benefited by recognition that it isn't early in relationships before they become captive to the habitual comfort and convenience of proximity that requests less, and can demean both. Such women are not really bitches; men just don't know how to express themselves otherwise because they do not usually have a command of, or spend enough time to properly understand and appreciate their feelings to express them. Such weaknesses are often cured by women who are more assertive, but willing to acknowledge the important boundaries that separate the two, as individuals, without diminishing the potential of their being a couple."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I read this book to learn what women think about men and what they think in general about relationships. As an avid student of the Art of War, I think this is a most read for all men that are willing to prepare themselves fully in how to recognize the tactics that women slavishly follow or how to mimic the kinds of men they are looking for. Yes, this is deception, however it is exactly this kind of strategem that the author of this book, Sherry Argov, is promoting. Men used to work hard at guessing what was behind women's motives. Now the task is easy, as women are writing more and more books and in the process, revealing more and more in the process about themselves."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Sherry is an EXCELLENT and THE GREATEST writer there is!!!

Ladies, that is a clue. I am sorry to say this, but any female who follows the advice offered up in this book is dooming herself to the possibility of a relationship with either a vapid milquetoast loser or a dangerous simmering volcano with a bad temper and a wandering eye. Some of the ideas in this book are so silly that I nearly spewed hot cappucino out of my nose when I was perusing the book at my local bookstore coffee shop. I hate to rain on anyone's parade, but better to hear it from me now than to become disillusioned, bitter, hurt, and lonely later.

Like most women out there, we were both having men dilemmas, in some form or another. No matter what you think you are doing wrong (or right, for that matter), if you are still single you need to read this book. It gives you every aspect of courting and dating and how to handle each situation. In a \\"nut shell\\" it will empower you to become a strong, independant woman, that will make men fall at your feet. After reading the book, we both sat down and discussed our previous relationships. Without any thought, we were able to pin point the cause of their faliure. Both of us have used these techniques, recently, with great success. And (shamefully) when we have broken \\"the rules,\\" we have seen immediate bad results. It is really amazing."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Started dating a nice woman a while back. She really had my interest. Things were great, we were going slow, but we were definately headed in a positive direction. Then things started to change. She started getting standoffish. Sending mixed signals. All of a sudden her comments when we first started going out about wanting a relationship in life turned into \\"taking my time and having fun with my life\\" and \\"don't want to make a commitment\\". This was not the woman I had met months ago. Why the change? She was still contacting me and interested, but there was a marked change in her personality.During one of our evenings, and after a couple drinks, she had mentioned that a friend gave her this book after her last broken relationship with a player who'd been cheating on her with 3 other women. Remembering this, I went out and bought the book to see if it could explain her unusual behavior.Well, she's been following the book as though it were a script.I took the book I bought, and hilighted everything in it that she had pulled on me. I met her for a drink and asked why she was acting so strangely different from when we first met. I got another line from the book. I took the book out of my coat, tossed it on the table. By the look on her face, you'd have sworn I took the book out and smacked her on top of the head with it. She was completely shocked, and the look on her face was nothing short of horror.She had not even remembered mentioning the book to me. All of a sudden all of these stupid little games she had learned in this book to put me on tilt, had her on full tilt. She started to cry. She'd \\"been hurt\\" before, and didn't want it to happen again. I told her the only type of guy she was going to get by reading the man bashing and demeaning b.s. in this book was the type she was trying to avoid. By this point she had me so conflicted and disoriented, I was simply not having a good time with her anymore. The fun thoughts of her during our time apart during that first month or so had turned to confusion and frustration in her absence the last couple months. None of that was building attraction or affection towards her for me. I have not returned her calls or texts since that night. Yes, she had \\"the power\\" for a while there, but once the game was up, it was up, and the confusion and conflict I felt turned to anger. The smart, funny, attractive woman I had met had turned into an unintelligent, pathetic, manipulative, undesireable woman in my eyes. She blew it with exactly the type of guy she professed to want by reading and following this garbage.Follow a majority of the advice in this book ladies, and you'll wind up the bitter 50 year old \\"cat woman\\", living alone, and wondering why you were never able to snag a good guy. Having your own life is a good thing, and is attractive to a real man. Manipulation and being someone you're not is completely unattractive."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"As a man, I like the advice the author gives to women about being independent, and &quot;empowered&quot; is great. There are a lot of women who get in to bad relationships because they have low self-esteem, and accept the abuse dealt to them. The problem is that this book takes this principle too far. I would suggest it to any woman who wants to avoid true intimacy for the rest of her life.Two paradoxical things happen to someone who has been victimized in the past - it sets them up to become good victims again, and it makes them that much better at being an abuser. I don't think there is any doubt that this book is solely aimed at women who have been abused in the past and, instead of trying to figure out how not to be abused again, are interested in &quot;revenge&quot; - becoming the abuser. Again, an excellent way to avoid intimacy, and avoid dealing with all of the feelings that are at the root of this behavior.This isn't to say that the methods in the book &quot;won't work.&quot; There are plenty of men in the world with huge ego's to compensate for their own low self-esteem. Indeed, this book will help you find one and keep him under your thumb. But this isn't really what you want, is it?"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I acted like a super bitch -- and it didn't help! None of the tools designed to shift the parameters of a relationship provided in this book did much for me. Perhaps this book is aimed towards women interested in a different type of men, because I am sorry to say that the man I was dating saw through the tricks being pulled. After a number of dates, our relationship began falling apart as I was getting more bitchy and manipulative, as Sherry's book suggests. At first, the guy fell for it and was upset that I seemed to be losing interest in him. I did not want to see him heart-broken, but continued following the advice given as I wanted to maintain the relationship. But it didn't take long for him to catch on to what was actually happening. He said that my wonderful aura had been lost and said (really) that I was acting like a disgusting bitch. I hate this book!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I have never understood why this constant emphasis on the word \\"control\\" in terms of a relationship occurs so frequently. If somebody wants to have a boss, let them get a job. If you want to be a boss, get yourself a solid education and go out into the corporate world or open your own small business. In our time, being \\"boss\\" should have no place in a relationship if you want it to last. I mean, really, does anyone want someone constantly bitching and complaining about everything around them? Ultimately the one being plagued will get tired of this behaviour and walk out.If you want to jump from man to man every six or so month, then fine, follow the guidelines presented in this book because they will work in the short run. However, if you're looking to find a more meaningful relationship you hope will last beyond a year, don't bother with this one. I am a woman, and I happen to agree with most, not necessarily all, of the reviewers that have given this book negative comments so it's not only men who are put off by Argov's arguments.While I do understand, support and admire the author's attempt to help women realise and or develop their sense of self-worth, I don't believe a lot of her suggestions are the way to go. It has always boggled my mind why it is so necessary that in order for a woman to feel good about herself she has to put down and demonise a man. With this type of attitude (the demonising of men ... and this book does suggest that women do just that, albeit subtlely and humourously) I just don't see how in all our misguided efforts to \\"empower\\" ourselves we make any constructive contributions to making this world a better place."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"If you want to end up as a lonely bitter eternal single this is the manual to follow. Women would be outraged if they found a book like this advising men to act like complete creeps towards them.If you want a quality partner in your life for more than a one night stand, you have to treat them with respect.Don't waste your money on this pathetic book for the sad Sex & the City spinstresses."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This book does what every piece of bad chick lit does - it promises one thing, then completely contradicts itself by giving us another. It says 'Why men like women who stand up for themselves' but then doesn't really tell you to stand up for yourself. Instead, it tells you to run around in circles playing games; making the man chase you. This serves only to make us end up with guys willing to chase, which are usually not the ones we want chasing us to begin with. Even if something isn't bothering you or if things are going along well, you should play a game by making it seem like it is bothering you or things aren't going well, to keep the guy on his toes and make him still want you. Yuck! This isn't about becoming a strong woman; it's about becoming weak, manipulative pain. This book will make you become exactly what you don't want to be - the woman guys love to sleep with and dump the next day. For some fantastic insight into how to be in the kind of relationship you want to be in and lots of insight into exactly how a guy thinks and interprets our actions, readGod Is a Woman: Dating Disasters. It is excellent. Incidentally, it is also by a comedian and much funnier than this so-called 'hilarious' book, which this isn't."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"As with any one-stop solution, everything in this book doesn't apply. Some things will probably work on some guys and not on others. Overall, I would have to say that this book is extremely accurate in respect to me.If I am dating a woman and am evaluating her as a wife, this will give my partner a considerable advantage in our relationship. Here's the problem. Power corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. If I had the power to read my mate's mind, I would not do it. Some things are often best left unknown.I was just recently &quot;dumped&quot; in a relationship. The woman I was with practiced a lot of these methods especially Rules 39, 11, 10, 23, 53, 57, 88, 92, &amp; 96. All of them have the same thing in common, &quot;the threat of no contact.&quot; I was devastated, and I needed considerable help in order to recover.My point is that while a woman reading this book will have an advantage, her man will be at a disadvantage. Relationships are about people not things. If you would like to manage a man like a thing, then this book will get you what you want. If you would like to protect yourself, then this book will definitely help you.By all means, buy it. What I would recommend is that you at least let the person you are dating know that you've read it. At least, give him the chance to understand the consequences of his actions. Otherwise while you may come out in control, there's a chance he may lose control.Finally, ask yourself a few questions. Are you an ethical enough person to practice such techniques? Would you want your man to practice the like techniques on you?This book is both funny and true, but the author fails to point out the potential negative aspects of these practices. It lacks compassion &amp; perspective."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I THINK THIS BOOK IS GREAT AND LIKE A BIBLE FOR GIRLS. I UNDERSTAND WHAT THE GUY SAID IN HIS REVIEW BUT I DONT GET THAT FROM THIS BOOK. ITS NOT TEACHING YOU TO BE A B*TCH OR BE SELFISH. ITS JUST SHOWING YOU HOW NOT TO BE A DOORMAT AND BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF. LETS FACE IT GUYS AND GIRLS ARE DIFFERENT AND SOMETIMES YOU NEED TO SHOW GUYS THEIR DISREPECT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE BY ACTIONS INSTEAD OF WORDS CUZ WORDS ARE LIKE NAGGING AND GET IGNORED SOMETIMES.

I SEE THAT YES YOU NEED TO BE HONEST IN RELATIONSHIPS AND TALK BUT THEY DONT ALWAYS LISTEN OR TAKE IT WRONG. I REALLY DONT SEE ANYTHING WRONG WITH THIS AUTHOR SHOWING GIRLS BEING UP A GUYS BUTT MAKES THEM LOSE RESPECT FOR YOU AND YOU NEED TO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOURSELF AND LOVE YOURSELF ENUF. HAVE RESPECT FOR YOURSELF NOT TO LET A GUY WALK ALL OVER YOU. A GUY WILL LOSE RESPECT FOR THAT BEHAVIOR JUST LIKE I HAVE NO RESPECT FOR MYSELF LOOKING BACK AT MY BEHAVIOR.

SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO PLAY GAMES BUT CUZ YOU KEEP THE GUY ON HIS TOES AND THATS THE GOOD THING TO MAKE THE RELATIONSHIP LAST. YOU DONT WANT TO BE TOO SELFISH BUT NOT TOO NEEDY EITHER. IT SAYS TO BE NICE AND BE YOURSELF BUT NEVER COMPROMISE WHO YOU ARE FOR A MAN. DONT MAKE YOUR WHOLE WORLD REVOLVE AROUND THEM. i THINK THE ADVICE IN THIS BOOK IS GREAT AND EVERY GIRL ESP WITH LOW CONFIDENCE AND ESTEEM CAN REALLY BENEFIT FROM IT. I LET MY EX GET AWAY WITH TOO MUCH INSTEAD OF SAYING I SHOULD LEAVE AND PROVE TO HIM I HAD RESPECT FOR MYSELF. I ACTED OUT OF FEAR OF LOSING HIM WHEN IN ALL ACTUALITY I CAN AND AM SURVIVING FINE WITHOUT HIM. I DONT DESERVE DISRESPECT BUT IF YOU DONT RESPECT YOURSELF NO ONE WILL RESPECT YOU. NOTHING IS MORE ATTRACTIVE TO A MAN THAN A WOMAN WHO HAS DIGNITY AND PRIDE IN WHO SHE IS AND DOESNT LOSE THAT FOR A MAN. THIS BOOK JUST SHOWS YOU THAT YOU SHOULD BE YOU AND BE NICE BUT DONT GIVE GIVE GIVE TO HIM WHEN YOU RECEIVE NOTHING. WHY SHOW A GUY HE DOESNT HAVE TO MAKE MUCH EFFORT ON HIS PART AND STILL GETS EVERYTHING? THE BOOK SHOWS TO LET A GUY WORK FOR AND EARN IT. THEY NEVER COMPROMISE THEIR LIVES SO WHY SHOULD YOU? I RAN FOR MY EX ALL THE TIME AND HE DIDNT DO THE SAME FOR ME. THATS WHERE I MESSED UP.YOU JUST NEED TO LET THEM SHOW YOU THEIR COLORS, WEED OUT THE JERKS AND SEE WHO IS WORTH IT FOR YOU BUT WHILE NOT BEING UP THEIR BUTTS. THIS BOOK IS JUST SHOWING YOU ALL THE COMMON MISTAKES GIRLS MAKE IN RELATIONSHIPS AND TEACHING YOU NOT TO MAKE THEM AGAIN IN THE FUTURE. THATS ALL. IF IT HELPS AND WORKS I THINK ITS GREAT. DONT BE SELFISH AND MEAN-BE YOURSELF BUT BE YOURSELF NOW WITH THE NEW FOUND CONFIDENCE AND STRENGTH KNOWING WHO YOU ARE AND WHAT YOU DESERVE AND DONT DESERVE. IT WILL SHINE THROUGH AND THE GUYS WONT BE ABLE TO RESIST IT. THATS WHY YOU SEE HOT GUYS WITH NOT SO PRETTY GIRLS LIKE MY EX. SHE PROBABLY EXUDES CONFIDENCE AND THAT IS BEAUTIFUL TO A GUY MORE THAN LOOKS. I DOUBT I EVER SHOWED CONFIDENCE CUZ I WAS TOO SCARED TO LOSE HIM AND I SHOWED HIM THAT THRU ALL MY ACTIONS WHICH ISNT GOOD. IF YOU ACT LIKE YOU CANT LIVE W/O A GUY CHANCES ARE YOU WILL BE LIVING WITHOUT THEM EVENTUALLY. I WISH I HAD READ THIS 3 YEARS AGO BECAUSE MAYBE I WOULD STILL HAVE MY RELATIONSHIP OR WOULD HAVE GOTTEN OUT OF IT SOONER IF HE DISRESPECTED ME.IGNORE THE GUYS COMMENTS AND GET THIS BOOK. MORE GIRLS NEED TO HAVE THE CONFIDENCE THIS BOOK IS TELLING YOU TO HAVE INSTEAD OF BEING A DOORMAT AND DOING SO MUCH FOR A GUY AND THEN WONDERING WHY THEY DID THIS TO YOU WHEN THEY LEAVE. BEFORE YOU CAN BE IN A RELATIONSHIP YOU NEED TO LOVE YOURSELF OP NO ONE COULD POSSIBLY LOVE YOU. THIS BOOK IS JUST HELPING YOU REALIZE THAT. BOTTOM LINE. JUST LIKE THE TITLE SAID DONT BE A DOORMAT-BE A DREAM GIRL. YES THE TITLE SAYS WHY MEN LOVE B*TCHES BUT THATS ONLY TO GET YOUR ATTENTION. DONT BE A B*TCH IN THE WAY YOU THINK IT MEANS. JUST LOVE YOURSELF AND DONT SETTLE FOR ANY TYPE OF DISRESPECT. THE REST WILL FALL INTO PLACE AND THEN THE GOOD YOU DO AS A NICE PERSON WILL BE GIVEN TO A DESERVING AND WORTHY PERSON WHO WILL APPRECIATE YOU LIKE OTHERS IN THE PAST HAVENT. WHEN YOU ARE TOO NICE ESP IN THE BEGINNING-ITS DESTINED TO END SOON. DONT ALWAYS POINT FINGERS IN RELATIONSHIPS LEARN FROM WHAT YOU DID WRONG AS WELL. I KNOW I PUSHED MY EX AWAY BY MY ACTIONS AND I AM NOT MAKING THE SAME MISTAKES AGAIN. LIKE THE GUY SAID ITS FOR GIRLS WHO GOT HURT TO LEARN HOW NOT TO BE HURT AGAIN. WHAT IS WRONG WITH REALIZING WHAT WE DO THAT IS NOT ATTRACTIVE AND GETS US HURT. LIKE I SAID THE BOOK ISNT TELLING YOU TO WALK ALL OVER THE MAN AND MAKE HIM A DOORMAT. ITS TEACHING YOU HOW TO NOT BE A DOORMAT. YOU ARE MAKING THEM HAPPY AND HAVING CONTROL WITHOUT THEM THINKING THEY ARE OUT OF CONTROL AND THAT IS KEY."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I usually do not do the \\"review\\" thing. However, I have read this book a couple times and everytime I read it I learn something new. That being said I actually knew a lot of the rules that where out line in this book but it is always helpful to have it in black in white.The 2 reasons I am leaving this review is to say this book is very informative read to the girls, women, ladies or bitches that need a little help in the dating game. If you want a man to respect you and to keep calling then get this book! I have used these techniques successfully and they have worked everytime! Yes I am attractive and have some formal education but that has absoultely NOTHING to do with it. It is about ATTITUDE, CONFIDENCE and SELF RESPECT! Just like the author Sherry Argov said in the book you can be an educated CEO executive or a waitress at Denny's and still get that man to be at your beck and call!This leads me to the reviewer \\"Steven Alexrod \\" who left his review a few days ago. The fact that your review was so damn lenghty says enough. You haven't clue as to what you are talking about. You had the audacity to say women come a dime a dozen and you think men don't?? The difference between that dime and that dozen is QUALITY! You are the epitome of the man that I string along and treat like crap until I'm done and through you back to the wolves. See ladies this is exactly why you never sleep with a guy for at least 3 months. I've actually gotten MORE from guys without doing a a thing! Sherry points this out in the book as well. The longer you make these FOOLS wait the more respect he will have for you. I even had a guy wait 10 months just for fun! Trust me, it works!!Back to the reviewer \\"Steven Alexrod\\" You are the type that talk all the BIG talk but is wrapped around someone's finger. I know guys like you. In fact I am dating a few. Think you know it all and don't no CRAP! Get it together!Again, to my fellow sisters, I don't care if you're green, orange, white, purple or black, fat slim, chunky, pretty, ugly or cute.....This book will help you. The main thing the author Sherry is trying to convey is that confidence and not taking any crap from any man no matter who he is, how much money he has is UNEXCEPTABLE! The minute you put this in your head and apply it to your everyday life men will respect you."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. I actually use many of the tactics that Argov talks about on women. I do feel that following what she says will make a woman more attractive sexually and mentally to a man. She outlines a lot of the mechanics of dating very clearly. I believe most \\"nice girls\\" my age (I'm 21) could benefit a lot by reading this book because most of these women aren't so experienced when dealing with men. If you are a woman and want to make your man \\"crazy\\" for you, then I definitely recommend checking this out.My only gripe about the material is the author doesn't explain enough that men really do enjoy a submissive woman. And no, I'm not talking about being a 24/7 slave to the man, but I really like it when my girlfriend can just say something like, \\"OK baby, I want to do whatever you want to do.\\" As another reviewer said before, it's a matter of ego-stroking that men need. Most of the material in this book is a good guide for a lady to be attractive and stay attractive to a man. I simply would have liked it more if the author said that you can give 100% control over to the man at least once in a long while. And it has to be genuine submission like you really want to. I especially disliked her advice about faking orgasms for your man. I simply would not want to have sex with a woman if she was faking it.However, despite these inconveniences, the book is still overall a very good read and can be very enlightening for women everywhere."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Its every womans must have bible!

I wish I had read it before my last two relationships--but then again, just the word \\"bitch\\" in the title of the book would have turned me off (I was too nice at the time to want to be associated with the B word).Now I am learning to be the challenging, strong, no-nonsense woman that I am, and redo some of the damage traditional upbringing has done to me. It's not an easy process but it's fun!I can never be so mean, however, as some of the examples in the book (ruining my partner's underwear if he wants me to do his laundry, for example). I also have a hard time with telling lies to get what I want or to pretend to be who I am not."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I love this book!

Contrary to what it suggests, not all men are alike, no more than all women are alike. This book seems to categorize all men as chauvinists, and all women (at least the target audience) as dumb blonds. Doesn't necessarily work out that way. If you are having social issues of the sort that this book alludes to, you might want to see a counselor instead of taking advice from someone who is probably (as the title suggests), a Bitch!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I read this whole entire book in literally one night!

My only warning is I am not one for mind games if you truly understand this book it is about not only your own sense of independance and maturity as a woman but also as a human being. There are parts of the book that even give you hints on possible rapists and all using tactics to get in your house or for you to go theirs so they can corner you.

I think it is pop psychology at it's worst and I like pop psych usually.If you are truly a doormat in all facets of your life, can't say no, then buy the book.If you are single, because you have focused on your career and have a limited dating pool then don't buy the book.If you like the book \\"The Rules\\" then again you might like it. I think dating as a grown up requires throwing out the rules, being honest and enthusiastic to meet new people. This book doesn't suggest that as a solution versus once again the single woman is told \\"it is all you.\\" It could really be you, I don't know you ;-)The book is written in a satire format which is amusing, but I read about half of it and said enough.

Its solid and down to earth advice that I believe, when you really think about it, is common sense. Its not a lame self help book because its not filled with little does-he-like-me-quizzes and b.s. sexy tips, it just tells you if you believe in yourself and value yourself, others will to. I've also read \\"He's Just Not Into You\\" and I found that book slightly encouraging if you want to get over a guy, but not good for telling you how to make a change at the core so that you never feel stepped on or like a doormat again.

It is not so much a matter of being in control as it is a matter of achieving a workable dynamic between the sexes.Argov delves into button-pushing and the things men do to test the mettle of women. Staying calm, cool, and collected is highly advisable, including in the board room at the office. Deep down most women know this, yet it can quickly go out the window when it seems that men \\"just don't get it\\", are tuning out, or are shutting down altogether as matters reach the meltdown stage.The author spares nothing as she reveals the tactics of the male player. It is better to cringe your way through this section than to stay uninformed and vulnerable.Argov's insights are empowering for women. Male players may not appreciate this, but for quality men that want workable relationships with women, it will ultimately benefit both sexes for women to digest and apply these premises."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This book is amazing.

I think for a woman who is confused about men, relationships, the way men act and maybe even herself - this is a prefect read. Its a bit over the top with its generalizations at times, say if you enjoy men who aren't uber-masculine. But I think overall it has some eye opening points.While reading this book I discovered so many things about myself and at least ten things or you could call them mistakes I was making in the dating scene and always coming off super needy.

The author uses \\"attraction principles\\" as her ten commandments of dating, which are similar to the bestseller \\"The Rules\\", yet her ideas are fresh and original. In fact, the authors of \\"The Rules\\" endorse this book. I especially enjoyed the chapters about \\"playing dumb\\", \\"renewing the mental challenge\\" and \\"keeping your pink slip\\", which are very much about pride, poise and self-discipline.Though the author's precepts were excellent, I thought the book could have used better editing. I found myself wishing the paragraphs were more succinct in explaining the attraction principles; I didn't know if some of the principles applied to the paragraphs that came before or after. In addition, I felt some of the principles could have been consolidated - there were almost too many to memorize!Nevertheless, this book offers new insights to women who are relationship-challenged. It purports a more unique and challenging perspective than many of the other dating books on the market."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Well, I didn't quite know what to expect when reading this book. But, as soon as I started reading, I couldn't stop. This book is written for a particular girl- one that is too nice and gives too much of herself away in relationships. A girl that cancels time with her friends to see that guy. A girl that can't smell a booty call from a mile away. A girl that feels as if she's sacrificed so much in her prior relationships, and can't stand to be able to do it all over again.I've been there and tried to give so much of myself, and I got nothing in return.... and it sucks.I read the comment where a guy read this book and mentioned that this book tells girls to be \\"cold\\" or \\"distant\\"... but I feel as if it's more like it's explaining how to maintain independence. It encourages you to live your life and not give up the things you like to do in a relationship.... which I believe is fair to say to both men and women. A guy who gives up his hobbies and friends and only tends to a girl is more than likely overwhelming her with attention, and it's important for both persons in a relationship to keep their friends, hobbies, the things they like to do. A relationship isn't supposed to change all of your hobbies and make you drop your friends.I don't think I'm fully enlightened, as some of the things in this book are common sense. However, I do think that this book is quite incredible as it goes against certain ideas that are quite popular in magazines.Overall, a great read."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Great product, shipped quickly.

I am definitely smarter and ballsier than most of the men I meet \\"out there\\" and I seem to lose out to the doormats. Men say they want a challenge but they really go for someone they are confident in knowing they are smarter than and are the leader in all aspects of the relationship. Sure, miserable married men sing my praises all day long, but it gets me exactly nowhere.So, the book in theory is worthy of your time, but it's not the reality of the caveman brain."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Best book EVER!!!!!!!!

It is an enlightening book for most women for sure, me included. However, I found myself trying to memorize all the techniques the author gives for each situation a woman finds herself faced with when dealing with a man and his dog-like ways. That was when I realized that this book can mislead women into believing that they have to calculate their every move when they interact with a man; that, in my opinion, is also what the author calls \\"jumping through hoops\\", which you need to avoid doing at all costs if you are trying to get a man to chase you.There is too much emphasis on not only the negative characteristics of men, which are not invalid because many men are dirt bags (let's admit it), but there is also too much emphasis on men in general and not nearly enough on how women can learn to reverse their \\"nice girl\\" tendencies. You can't just stop being a \\"nice girl\\" after reading this book if you have been one your whole life. The book mentions often how women need to value themselves, displaying behavior to match but there is virtually no emphasis at all on HOW to do any of that. There is a need for more books that educate women on why they behave this way to begin with while empowering and teaching them to value and honor themselves at the same time.Overall, this book is entertaining and has a few gold nuggets but I wouldn't take it too seriously, especially if you are in a happy, loving relationship. This book was written more for single women, I think."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I had to adjust the score on this book because I read a lot of books.

I was able to read this book in one day \\"Why Men Love Bitches\\" isn't about being a bitch to your man or any other man. It's about how women can take back control of their lives by just changing the way they relate to men. It's about NOT canceling dinner plans with your girlfriends when a man asks you out at the last minute. It's about not being a doormat any longer--holding your own with him and keeping your self respect.Too many women have the feeling that if they just give a man everything he asks for, he will be happy and love them more. Exactly the opposite is true. According to several men who were interviewed for the book, men like women with a little mystery, a sense of who they are, and who are not always deferring to them.So, ladies--take back your power. Have the man on YOUR terms and, according to the book, he will be coming back for more instead of writing you off as someone he can control. He WILL get bored with that \\"nice girl doormat\\"--but if you take of yourself first--he will respect that and it will make him want you even more.What I most enjoy about the book is how good-natured Sherry is, the tongue-in-cheek humor about the male-female relationship. Again \\"Why Men Love Bitches\\" has some good advice if you've been walked all over, BUT the games in the book suggested by the author work in some areas. Doing everything what the author tells you will take away the authenticity of the relationships more than enhances them. I would only recommend this book for good points."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"If a man used the principles found in this great book, it works equally on women. The premise of the book is that nobody wants a doormat. There are a lot of \\"nice\\" men who get dumped for being too nice and end up being male \\"girlfriends\\" to women, instead of lovers. The super nice, sweet, overgiving, aways available male ends up destroying \\"chemistry\\" in relationships. The few male dating gurus use a lot of similiar ideas that are found in this book, altered to a male's prespective. The bottom line is simply nobody respects doormats (male or female) over the long haul: ...PERIOD. Women also lose interest in \\"wimpy/wussy\\" men ( translates: needy) just the same as men lose interest in overgiving, super needy women and move on to some \\"bad boy/bitch type respectivly. This is an excellent book to understand and clairify these psychological principles. We have been taught by society to try harder, be more available, be more of a \\"friend\\" etc. Obviously, with a 56% divorce rate..something is very wrong with those basic tennants..without respect, there can be no long term lasting relationship of any kind."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This book really helped me out and it really works.

Like many women it's in my nature to give more than I receive when I'm in a relationship. And I've waited for calls, e-mails, and given up my girlfriends for a last minute date with \`that guy.' But, Argov shows how that nice girl approach may be undermining the ability to have a more fulfilling relationship and self-worth. This book is straight-forward and direct; Argov demonstrates why being a bit \`bitchier' may pay off in the end. While the word bitch may be off-putting it is more about empowerment and leading your own life. The book had me nodding along in agreement almost the entire length. Argov doesn't site statistics for her information - just quotes from men -and while some of the quotes seemed phony, they still serve a purpose - they show you how men really do like a strong, independent woman. The book was worthwhile and will hopefully help me out in future dating situations."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"It's rare that I write a review, but I was so impressed with this book I just had to. This one is a great companion to the The Rules, which I love, except for one aspect: it's really geared towards women in the 20s and 30s. MWLB is for a more mature woman (read 30s, 40s, 50s) who want the same effect as the Rules with a little less strategy."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I'm gonna keep this brief: Sherry is a goddess! Perhaps they should name a razor after her. Her book dispels all the silly myths that women have falsely believed for centuries. She dispenses truth like the fountain of youth. And trust me ladies, after you're done with the book (and that piece of trash disguised as a man) you, too, will feel a whole lot younger.I have an interesting perspective because I am a man. Ironically, I concur whole heartedly with most everything Sherry has to say except some of the material in \\"Dumb like a fox\\". At any rate, I and many guys I know have played (fully consciously) all the tricks on women Sherry discusses in the book. The sad part is, you don't even have to try that hard to pull the wool over most women's eyes. In fact, they'll glad shear the lamb themselves. The point is, Ladies, don't fall asleep at the wheel. So many of you are sleeping and you are heading towards the guard rail. Wake up! Pick up THE GOOD BOOK and read it. Study it. Highlight it and become a disciple.

Like the author says...in the beginning the woman is really negotiating the terms of the relationship..on how she wants to be treated. A lot of women...and yes I was guilty of this at one point are way \\"too nice\\" \\"too giving of their time and sometimes their body\\" TOO SOON. Then the same women sit back ...eat ice cream and wonder what went wrong...then see someone new and repeat the same failed pattern.WAKE UP!Any man(in his right mind) that tells you ...\\"yes I love it when women are my doormat\\" is lying...because..-Men love to chase (its in their nature and should be ALLOWED to do this...let him)-Men don't want to bed you on the 1st date (if he's really into you...but how will you know if you bed him right away?)-Men don't like needy women but they do loved to be appreciated and needed (there is a big difference)-Men will show you with their ACTIONS rather than their WORDS if they want you seriously...lots of women miss this.(he tells me...blah blah...but he never called, showed up...ect.)A \\"bitch\\" in the author's opinion is a georgia peach...soft and sweet...but has a center that is tough. To me the book was about empowering yourself...loving yourself...respecting yourself...and letting negative men go....it has worked for me!This should be paired up with \\"he's just not that into you\\" book...as they both speak a lot of the same language."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Ok. You could not have found more of a \\"nice girl\\" than me. That is, until I read this book. After having several relationships where I always felt used and taken for granted, I decided that I needed to change something. What I didn't realize was that I needed to change myself and please myslef first in order to have better relationships. Well let me tell you: I read the book, I followed the advice, and ever since I have had THE BEST relationship ever. I'm happy, he's happy, it's great. I don't feel depleted. I can be myself. This book really changed the way I allow myself to be treated. My only regret is that I didn't find this book sooner. PLEASE give this book to everyone you know who lets men walk all over them. This book was wonderful, funny, and entertaining. Anytime I start to \\"act up\\", my mother lovingly tells me that I need to brush up on \\"the bitch book\\"!!! It really, really helps!!!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"The book should be retitled \\"Why FEMININE Men Love Bitches\\" because much of this advice, if you follow it, is a sure-fired way to become \\"just friends\\" with a good masculine energy man. Understand that the book is trying to raise a woman's self-esteem--and by all means, pick up a copy if you're new to relationship advice or want to learn a little bit about the mind of some men--but the assumptions the author makes for how we should actually behave based on \\"what men want\\" isn't accurate. It also clearly assumes a caliber of men that is lower than some of us have or want.This book only covers one half of the equation: making a woman strong on the inside, which, yes, is absolutely necessary for a healthy relationship--if she understands where her strength as a woman comes from (this book does not provide that depth of information). But the true appeal and attraction of a woman to a man is that she is soft, she is feminine. And the way a strong woman achieves this is that her inner core is so strong, she can allow herself to follow and trust a man without losing herself. There is nothing more attractive.The author tells women to be \\"logical\\" and don't express emotions, that men don't respond well to feelings. But this couldn't be further from the truth. Men don't like drama but they love a feeling woman. This IS a woman's mystery, that she can lead him into that realm of relationship and being. This is what men chase after, not the woman's behavior, not her \\"personality,\\" but her femininity. Following all these do's and don'ts of this book would not only be exhausting but confusing and easy to forget (any when you do, you'll inevitably beat yourself up, putting you right back to where you don't want to be with your self-esteem). Men are chasing a woman's mystery, but that mystery is embedded in her femininity. What men want is the spirituality of the feminine energy (Carl Young, Aspects of the Feminine). This ironically, is also a woman's boundaries. Not her \\"independence.\\" It's a shallow perspective on \\"the chase.\\" Again, maybe with some men, but not with the ones we want.I know from my own amazing relationship with a very strong man I fell head over heels for years ago, that the only way you, as a woman, will feel really good and natural about yourself is: letting go of controlling others, expressing your vulnerability, grounding yourself in self-control (contrary to our belief, it is not our man but our self-love that is the hardest thing to master).Let's be honest. Do you really want to \\"control\\" your relationship? Isn't his affection, adoration, and commitment what you really want? Deep down, what you want is really for him to WANT YOU. This book, even though it comes across as about \\"self-respect\\" is really attempting to show you how you can make him want you--but by appealing with fear instead of real attraction. It's just not accurate, not for a good man anyway. The author makes the assumption that women need to be respected by being IN CONTROL. The problem is, feminine energy women (which is most of us) feel \\"respected\\" when their FEELINGS ARE CHERISHED, not when they lead or control. In fact, we feel miserable when we try to control. We realize we can be in control but the trade off is that our feelings are not cherished. If you want to be \\"respected\\" like that tough \\"police woman\\" the author seems to admire so much, you'll get respect. But you won't get the love of a masculine man. And that is worth everything on earth.Take what you read in this book with a grain of salt unless you want to attract a feminine energy man or be your man's mom. There's a reference to Aretha's song, R-E-S-P-E-C-T, as if this is how we need to act. But really think about it, doesn't that sound like your mother? That is not the attitude of a strong, feminine energy woman. You want a man to want to be with you because you inspire him to cherish you, not because he is afraid of you or your independence. A feminine woman respects her man, and in turn, a good man cherishes her. That's the formula. If he doesn't cherishes her, she lets him know without making him wrong, without disrespect. And believe me, this woman will steal the heart of your man any day over a \\"bitch.\\" This is the woman men will walk through fire for. Because she is strong within, at the same time, vulnerable, and exotically feminine on the outside. That's the missing half of the equation. I give \\"Why Men Marry Bitches\\" two stars for trying."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Ok, look...I'm a man and I thought I ought to balance this out for you women. When it comes to relationships, men certainly want women who are secure, reasonably confident, and who have their own lives. A desperate doormat isn't exactly what men are looking for in a relationship partner. But somehow, the book seems to assert that men don't like \\"nice\\" girls. This is a problem. You see, while it's true that men don't want \\"doormats,\\" they really DON'T like girls who act aloof, too uninterested, or those who behave dominantly or otherwise like men.So here's my GOLDEN ADVICE:Let the man lead, and be prepared to follow. But if something compromises your values, then stand up for yourself. That's what earns you respect in a man's eyes--that's the difference between the \\"nice\\" (-wrong choice of term, in my opinion-) girl and the one that men are attracted to on a long-term basis. It isn't about acting \\"aloof,\\" or being \\"bitchy.\\" In fact, the type of man that is attracted to the \\"bitchy\\" kind of woman is usually the unsuccessful kind with low self-esteem.Be FEMININE unless you're trying to attract a gay man. This isn't quantum physics. Being \\"feminine\\" doesn't mean that you're supposed to sit quietly and act like you were born with intellectual deficits. You can definitely be pro-receptive; what I'm trying to say is the following: While I don't think you should start approaching men when you're out in public, you can/should certainly get into a man's general vicinity and smile if you make eye contact. Don't do this and keep staring at him like you're desperate, though. Yes, you're allowed to show signs of life! Do give him a brief (almost invisible) non-verbal (or verbal) hint/invitation and then return to what you were doing earlier. Chat with him if he approaches, and if you like him, you can give him your contact information once he asks. If he contacts you, don't act \\"busy\\" or aloof if you really do like him. If you really do already have plans during the time of his invitation, make sure you DO let him know that you really DO want to meet with him WITHOUT sounding desperate. If you're flirting with him on the phone and someone else is on the other line, you should do the non-desperate thing and tell him you'll call him back. Let him set up a date and lead. Make sure you flirt and connect with him while you're together. Hopefully, you're the kind of woman who likes to be led (many men love to lead, and if you're with one that doesn't, you're possibly with a wussy).Here's the IMPORTANT part, again: Once he is dating you, if he says or does something that makes you uncomfortable, DO speak up respectfully, WITHOUT sounding like a bitch. And if everything is going well, then why play games? Be yourself. If it ain't broke, don't \\"fix\\" it! This is or should be the essence of the whole book. The only reason why some men (immature ones at that) like \\"bitches\\" is that the \\"bitches\\" value themselves and don't surrender their self-respect for anyone (although these bitches do it in a REALLY annoying way). After all, how can a man *really* respect a woman if there's no basis for it?I'm trying to think back to the women that really drove me crazy. They were never the \\"bitchy\\" ones. After all these years, I still remember one such girl I met in college. She was beautiful, and she was totally attracted to me...yes, it really WAS obvious, and this only made me MORE interested in HER. Her eyes would light up when she saw me. But I had already made a \\"player\\" impression on her, so she would always hold herself back from flirting with me. NOTE: It was NOT because she was acting \\"aloof.\\" I knew (and she knew that I knew) that she liked me a lot. The truth was that she was a very sweet English literature major that didn't want to get hurt by becoming involved with me. The fact that she was so obviously attracted to me did NOT turn me off, and the fact that she was such a sweet girl didn't turn me off either. On the contrary, BOTH of these were HUGE turnons! I'm telling you: We guys WANT sweet girls..NOT \\"bitches.\\" But the reason it worked for her was that she was obviously NOT a doormat. She had a lot of self-respect and self-control. She had herself together, and it was VERY attractive. Hmmm..not a \\"doormat,\\" was she? THIS is the girl that drives men wild..NOT THE \\"BITCH.\\"If you can be good-looking, sweet, and \\"feminine\\" while putting a value on yourself, then you can (and probably will) catch and keep the sort of man you want, because you will be among the very few women who have successfully combined the best elements of the \\"nice\\" girl, and the \\"bitch.\\"I hope that helps.-A MAN"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I bought this book because I was skimming through it at a bookstore to see how much truth there was in it. I found that a lot of the information in there is every bit as helpful to men as it is women. With the exception of the chapter about having a pink slip, amongst a few other things, the advice in here is good for men on how to be attractive to women.For women, the book is also great. The advice in there is, as hard as it may be for me to admit, a good way for a woman to find a quality man.The only reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it tells the woman to be TOO MUCH of a challenge. There is a difference between not wanting a man and not needing one, and Sherry should have made known the differnce between the two. If a woman shows no interest in a man (or vice versa), he will eventually find someone who shows interest. So while it's good to encourage not being clingy to someone, the point needs to be made that the person you're with has to know that they are desired by you. Other than that it's a great book and I encourage everyone (male or female) to read it if they want a good relationship."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Of course men don't like this book...the info and advice given, unfortunately, is true...all across the boards...bad guy, nice guy, doesn't matter. It's the difference between how men and women operate in romantic relationships. It's about our different needs, recognizing them, and understanding what we need to do to fulfill those needs. It's easy to look at this as \\"game-playing\\" and \\"trickery\\"...but the fact is it addresses a very real and true aspect of male and female human nature.Anything that comes easy to a man, he does NOT appreciate...plain and simple. Men are competitive and they need to \\"win\\" not be handed thins on a sliver-plated. And men enjoy a challenge and roughing it out...not things that are comfy and cozy...they bore of that very easily or they become to \\"comfortable\\". The more you give a man, the less he will want or think he needs to give. To a woman, giving also means getting...it's not about not being genuine, it's about give and take, sharing, cooperation. Women are socialized this way. Men are NOT socialized this way. Men are socialized to be looking out for number one. Getting doesn't necessarily mean giving. And men don't easily \\"give\\". It doesn't mean they are necessarily bad. You can read this in books like Men Are From Mars, Women are From Venus too (written by a man, btw).So, it's about fulfilling mutual needs. A woman needs a man to take action on a continual basis in a relationship. If a woman ends up giving too much, then he won't take action...and no one will be happy.This book isn't what most people think from the title, although it's a great title if you want to sell a book. It's not about being cruel to men AT ALL. It's about understand what motivates a man...and being really nice, giving all the time, showering him with attention 24/7 ain't it.In addition, it's a very easy and entertaining read. It doesn't take itself too seriously, yet has some very spot on and practical advice. Obviously, there will always be things that don't apply to every unique person and relationship, but bottomline, it's a great measuring stick and a great book to put things in perspective for the over-giving woman who doesn't understand why it's not always the best thing to \\"just be yourself\\". You have to be yourself but with some discretion...and understand who you are dealing with...a man!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I was once a nice girl, but thanks to the wisdom that (hopefully) comes with the passing years, I was already well on my way to becoming a bitch when I read this book. It completely validated what I have learned along the way, and gave me more principles that I use when I'm dating or in a relationship. This book is so right on the money that it should be required reading for women of all ages, single or otherwise. I even gave it to my 60-year-old mother to read and she gained insight from it.So many women are so willing to give up their interests, their friends, and their standards in order to catch and try to keep a man. The truth is that men do not respect a needy, dependent, or desperate woman they can walk all over, and Sherry points out this fact over and over. Some people might think that there is too much repetition of this idea throughout the book, but I think it is necessary because of the fact that we women are raised to be \\"nice\\" and to cater to the needs of men. We need to be reminded over and over again that catering to the every need, want, or desire of a man is not the recipe for a happy relationship. When a woman has dignity, maintains her own \\"life,\\" and sets boundaries, she automatically gains the respect of a man. When she is strong and shows him that she's not afraid to lose him, she becomes more desirable in his eyes and he wants her more. This makes so much sense, but so many of us women just don't get it.Besides being interesting and inspiring, I found this book to be downright hilarious. I laughed out loud often while reading it (and again while skimming over certain parts for the 3rd or 4th time.) I loved the story about the woman who, after dating a man for several weeks, always would repeat \\"love you... love you... love you... love you... love you...,\\" and the man commented that it was like dating a cockatoo. Or the woman who wrote her new boyfriend bad poetry and cried while reading it to him. There are stories like these throughout the book, and although many are funny, some are pathetic to see the lengths to which women will go to accommodate men, but all the stories illustrate important points.I have to give this book 5 stars because it's become my relationship \\"bible\\" and I refer back to it when I feel the former nice girl trying to resurface. The principles and ideas in this book work so well and I am more confident and self assured than ever before. In fact, this book works so well that the only criticism I have is that Sherry should have written an entire chapter on how to get rid of a man once you decide you don't want him anymore!Pass up the other dating and relationship books, girls, and get this book. You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"i thought this book is insightful knowledge to every woman and what every woman ought to know about dealing with men. some people hate to acknowledge this, but so what!!! i think women should start dealing with men on a more even playing level. b/c many times women tend to put the man and his feeling, interest, wants and desires ahead of her own. everything that's important to him always comes before herself and the sacrifice is never appreciated are acknowledge when you do. i like this book, it opened my eyes to a lot of things i was doing wrong. it made me feel better about myself, so no matter how the guy i'm involved with would take me and my feelings for granted. i finally began to think about how to make me feel better. some men would consider this book, a book that teaches women how to play games, but it's really not about playing games, it's about being a strong woman. not allowing yourself to be walked over by men you happen to love. it doesn't take away from loving that person, but it helps you to put the love you should feel for yourself in it's proper prospective, instead of placing it on the back burner.

The definition usually attributed to the title \\"Bitch\\" is not what she is urging you to be. For baby boomers back on the dating scene after years of marriage (like me) this book is excellent. Society & our parents RAISED us to cater to men, and in most cases after raising children and being a housewife, you haved lived for everybody else for decades. That will work against you in this day and age. This book helped me to put a relationship that was important to me back on track - without EVER disrespecting or taking for granted the man in my life.

While going through a recent heartbreak, I was drawn to picking up this book at the bookstore, and my eyes nearly popped out at every turn of the page. everything that made me attractive to my guy was in this book - when I was sassy, independent, and had that \\"edge,\\" that attitude within me that I could drop this guy anytime, and my life was great just as it is. This book also had every mistake I made with that guy that made us not work out - I lost my sense of self and independence by turning to him for approval rather than being self accepting and confident in myself. once i switched from \\"bitch\\" - it's really a misnomer, more like confident, independent and attractive because you know you are a great catch, to feeling like i didn't want to lose this guy, then i switched to \\"nice girl\\" mode, which is really more like pathetic sucking up girl who does everything n makes herself into the way she thinks her man wants her to be. but no! what he fell for was the real me, the me before i lost my sense of self and started behaving like i just wanted to please him. soooo pathetic when i look back on it. i cannot believe i let myself fall into that trap, but apparently thousands of women do all the time. i talked to my best friend today about this wonderful book, and she said that her very well respected psychologist just recommended it to her as well!

Maybe, but this book helped certain things I already knew--at least on a subconscious level--\\"click\\" into place.Using the oh-so-scary \\"B\\" word in a tongue-in-cheek manner, Argov's main point is this; build a complete life all on your own, have opinions and interests of your own, and don't drop them like a bad habit for a boyfriend. Worthwhile men won't appreciate it, you'll be miserable, and you won't receive anything of value in return. Trifling men will just manipulate you into giving up more and more of yourself, just to see how much of yourself you'll sell to have a guy. There are many women out there who honestly don't understand that \\"compromise\\" doesn't mean, \\"you give in and he asks for more\\".Do you suspect that you've become a doormat?

It is very hard to open every rule in here especially if we are very interested in a man women can loose a little control. I guess the key is control you,yourself and yourself again.

I am just now out to please myself and if a man is out there to please me too, I will please him as well. Really, I am too old for games and only want the best. This book is pretty much the rules for dating. Do not call too much, do not act desperate, let him compliment you. Do not compare yourself to other girls, DO NOT CHASE HIM, do not keep tabs on him. It is very hard when you get into a relationship and let your guard down and still apply to these rules. You can not always give a man so much freedom because then I think he may roam.

It's sort of become my go-to guide when I need a little reminder of how to toughen up, and get what I want and need from my relationships WITHOUT giving too much. This book shows you how to give just enough while maintaining your dignity and self-respect to get what you want from your man without compromising who you truly are and what you truly want - mostly while letting him think he is controlling the shots while actually it is you pulling the strings behind the scenes!Some might say that this sounds manipulative and that they don't want to play games, but women need to realize that it' not manipulative in a negative sense at all! Men and women think differently...that's just a fact...so learning to relate to a man on his level, or behaving in ways and boiling situations down into way that he can understand...i actually doing you BOTH a favor! You will be happier, he will be happy that he makes you happy, you will want to make him happy too....and it becomes a nice, neat little circle!Many women have a hard time doing this...we wear our hearts on our sleeves, we want to discuss everything, we react emotionally, and we are eager to show a man how amazing we are and how much we have to offer. NO! HALT! STOP RIGHT THERE! This ALWAYS will backfire!!! Why Men Love Bitches....without telling you too much and spoiling the surprise....explains WHY...how men think versus how we see things, and gives us the tools to be the truly amazing women we are while subtly making the man see it, too...and try to convince YOU why you should be with HIM! Now, ladies, doesn't that sound like a nice, refreshing change!?!?I HIGHLY recommend reading Why Men Love Bitches. I hear Sherry's advice resonate in my head all the time and I can attest firsthand that the advice in this book is effective. It takes practice, there are going to be some slip-ups, but over time, you will realize that no matter how hard you try to fight it, Sherry's advice is just....RIGHT!!! I even recommend reading it more than once, just to keep it fresh in your mind until it becomes second nature!

I am aware A LOT of women are turned off by the title of this book. In fact, when I suggested it to a friend she said to me \\"why would I want to learn how to be a bitch, when I am a lady?\\" Sherry Argov does not instruct on the ways and means one goes about becoming one of those obnoxious women who asks for WAY TOO MUCH while giving WAY TOO LITTLE. Oh NO! She teaches every woman how to go from being a mans doormat to his dream girl. Sherry Argov's Bitch is a strong woman who loves herself, who respects herself, who knows her worth, her value, and knows what she deserves and will not tolerate less in her life. I am proud to be a Sherry Argov Bitch!I first read Why Men Love Bitches as I was coming out of a bad relationship. Within the first 10 pages I knew I had found my relationship bible; and that is all it takes to understand why this book should be required reading: 10 pages. Within those first 10 pages I saw the woman I was being in my romantic relationships (the doormat) and the woman I truly am (the dream girl). Sadly, until I read this book, they were never one in the same...but now they are! This book is that EMPOWERING!After reading this book there is no going back to the old way of behaving, because once you read this book, you see yourself and you see men in a whole new light, because you get it. Sherry Argov literally lifts the veil, and epiphanies are had during every single chapter. I have been in a few relationships since I first read this book, and this book is my guide, my bible, my man manual if you will. And I have found the very end, where Sherry lists all her attraction principals to be especially helpful in a pinch. This book keeps me focused, it reminds me of who I am, and why I am behaving the way I am; it keeps me strong.Not only do I HIGHLY recommend this book to you, but I recommend it to every single one of my girlfriends every chance I get; none of whom (after they got past the title) ever found themselves disappointed. So, I feel confident in saying you will not be either! So PLEASE do yourself one of best favors of your life and read Sherry Argov's book Why Men Love Bitches, you will not regret it!PS: I have read both the first version and the updated version and I recommend the new version with the new material.

You need this book. If you have any question in your mind that you are not a strong enough women you need this book. I've always viewed myself as a strong women, until I reached a breaking point after too many ruined relationships. I couldn't figure out what I was doing wrong. I was starting to get the opinion that all men were going to f**k me over. This book was recommended to me by a friend, and since I have received it, I have recommended it to several of my friends, my sister, and even my mom. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

I was happy with the purchase until she had the audacity to imply that a lack of general middle-class wealth implies neediness. Being disabled and unable to work, I live on a tight budget while on disability. I sell my paintings to supplement my income. However, I can by no means fly to Europe or take a trip to the Bahamas. Lack of monetary wealth does not mean lack of dignity or neediness!! If someone is going to judge me on lack of monetary wealth and a disability, then they can move on. I would advise her to watch herself the next time she shoots her mouth off. Things like that are easy to say when you make what she makes."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Everything said in this book is the honest to God truth.

I feel more confident because I know how to handle myself better, and I am seeing an improvement in my relationship with my fiance also. I think one thing I really needed a lesson on was how to stroke my man's ego and make him feel appreciated, because this has been a source of contention-him not feeling appreciated.

Not only was it hilarious the entire time, it was VERY insightful. I found myself identifying with the \\"Nice Girl\\" in past relationships and a lot of times I covered my mouth in disbelief at how much I had really short-changed myself. Luckily, after having my heart broken a million times in my 26 years of life, I had already decided (prior to buying this book)that it was time for an attitude change. As a self-proclaimed nice girl, I always thought to myself \\"I wish I could be a bitch, but I just don't have it in me.\\"This book showed me how to be a bitch without being a BITCH if you catch my drift. I was halfway there, with the person I'm currently \\"dating\\" but still had some nice girl tendencies. This book opened my eyes, and gave me the extra confidence boost to say \\"Yes, I do have it in me to be a bitch. I deserve better.\\" I have a new outlook on not only dating, but my life in general.So Nice Girls, please do yourself a favor and get this book.

It is right on point and gives very good insight into the males ways of thinking and how we should interact with them. We as women sometimes lose our identity to please a man and it never works. I have always held my own in a relationship for the most part, but I have found new insights into loving myself and loving my man without losing myself in the relationship and have found it totally true that a man appreciates a woman more when she stands up for herself, has a live apart from him and does not make him her world but a part of her world.

I saw nothing in MissAnn's review that deserved the attack she received from Jennifer R. And for the record, I would never break previous plans with a good friend just because my boyfriend called me at the last minute, not out of any manipulation or game playing, but simply because that's not what good friends do to each other. And that's not what a man who really loves you expects you to do. It's really pretty much that simple. All the fussing and fighting over it all is pretty silly.I suppose you could say it's all a matter of degrees. There's a fine line between standing up for yourself and just plain being bitter and hateful. You can take it too far, and I don't ever recommend game playing, but it has been my experience from observing what many other women, men truly do take \\"nice\\" women for granted. I wish I had a dollar bill for every time I've seen a man take a sweet, devoted girl who would do anything for him and cheat on her, lie to her, take advantage of her, break her heart and not even care, only to turn around and fall head over heels with a woman who lives her own life, isn't always available whenever he wants to see her, and basically doesn't let him jerk her around. If what the men here say is true, that this book is bad advice, then maybe one fine gentleman here can explain why time and time again, you dump on sweet girls who love you devoutly for women who make you jump through hoops for their approval?"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This is an amazing book.

I use it as a guidebook to get what I want from my love relationship, and as a model to guide my comedy writing about relationships. This book works on many levels in many ways, and is a fun way to learn what drives your own personal dignity and happiness and use them to lead your way through the world."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I bought this book shortly after a 15 month relationship and it was the best investment I've ever made. My ex give me little hints about why things weren't going well in our relationship and most of the hints were highlighted in this book. I read this book in one day (just couldn't put it down) and now I've recommended and bought it for most of my girlfriends. For some reason it takes something like a great book to help you \\"get it.\\" I was needy, dependent and always gave up my life for a relationship...never again.

This book is written with a humorous touch, and the content is all about believing in yourself, having self-respect, confidence...and not being a doormat!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Yes women do tend to lose themselves in their men, I know I did, but as this book explains, it doesn't work. Men get bored and restless and lose respect for you. The reason for this is simple. An adoring female who's life revolves round a man reminds him of his mother. As he starts to identify you with his mother, you become less attractive as a sexual partner and more of a threat to his sense of being a grown man - he then wants to spread his wings and fly the coop or at the very least emotionally distance himself from you to avoid being suffocated, and who can blame him ! As to why women act this way time and time again despite the sheer amount of pain, misery and rejection this behaviour brings them - well that's an interesting point. I have a theory which is this : until the advent of modern civilisation, women tended to get married off soon after hitting puberty. They'd meet, court for a few months and finally get married in their teens, often by the age of 16. Without contraception, girls would be mothers pretty soon after that, so the average girl in their late teens would soon have the natural receptacle for the strong female urge to love, nurture and take care of someone, her very own baby. Her husband, if he ever took precedence would very soon be relegated to 2nd position in her life. In contrast, nowadays women on average become mothers in their late twenties despite starting to have relationships in their teens. So that's an average of 10 to 20 years of frustrated maternal feelings being lavished on the nearest object of affection, the poor unsuspecting boyfriend. So following the rules in this book, contrary to the few negative reviews written is not about manipulation but about correcting an unnatural imbalance brought about by modern society's reworking of human relationships and life patterns. That's why they work and both the women AND the MEN in the relationships that result are genuinely happier."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Wow! If this author had more copies in the Barnes and Noble, she could have sold many copies, because when I asked for a copy of this book, from the front counter - my request started a ripple of dialogue, excitement, and desire to buy this book.Both men and women were intrigued.And while this book title is meant as a tongue-in-cheek message, the real message is in these 9 suggestions for how to stay an adult human being, while interacting with men:1. Give it back to him2. Stay fully in this moment3. Put him in his place4. Show him that you won't put up with his childish ways5. Show him that your confidence means you know somethingthat if he also knew what you know, his life would be better6. Being spicy is sexy7. Congruently show him what you will and will not tolerate8. Your temper, that is, your strong conviction, shows him howto connect with you - be consistent9. Being feisty means you are sexually stimulatingUse these rules, not only in relationships, but also when confronting men, to communicate that you matter."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"When you meet the real deal, the timing will be right, the circumstance will be right, and you won't have to play games. When you meet the real deal, they will call you when they say they will, you will call them back, and you won't have to worry if it's been 3 days or not. When you meet the real deal, you will be at a place in your life where you are ready to fall in love, real love, because you really love yourself, and therefore will be able to give love in return. There will be no red flags, there will be no lies, just openness and honesty. Your best bet is to take care of your whole self, live to your highest purpose, and know that everyone in this world has a light - and make sure yours shines as brightly as possible. Before you know it, when you are having a ton of fun by yourself, when you've been working out and eating healthy, stopping your self-sabotaging ways of drinking/drugs/toxic friendships/etc. and happy with yourself, 100%, looking and FEELING sexy & beautiful from head to toe on the inside and out, one day you'll look up and they will be right there. Real love is out there, you deserve the best, don't settle for less.Get an education, get a career you feel great about, and support yourself. There's nothing more empowering than knowing you paid for that cute new outfit you're wearing or have all that money in the bank because YOU made it. Not relied on someone else to.Just like you should ask only a rich man and not a poor one for advice on how to make money, you should only ask friends who are in authentic, truly happy relationships for love advice. Don't ask your single friends or married eh/bored/miserable friends to get to their sub-par status. They are where they are for a reason. Look up. Not down.Why deal with level 4's when you're a 10? Granted, the ratio of men out there to women is often unfair, especially here in NYC, but settling just to have someone is not the strong choice.Like attracts like. This book is about being a player. Guess what it's going to attract?Guys have Neil Strauss' \\"The Game.\\" That book isn't about getting love. It's about getting something else. I'd love to see a bestseller book out there for guys about getting real love. The one that supports you even when you fail, the one that forgives you when you mess up, the one that is there for you no matter what. It's like the traditional wedding vows say - patient, kind, not boastful, arrogant, proud. And real relationships take real work, it's another full-time job in many ways and you get what you put into it.In short, know that while no one is perfect, that doesn't mean you can't find the person who is perfect for you. And when you meet the real deal, you'll be so happy with them, you'll forget this book ever existed.Single girls, all I can say is keep your standards. Not the kind that are in delirium high-sky range, but the kind that avoids the dudes who are just no good for you. Notice red flags when you see them and accept them.But most of all don't give up! :)"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I bought this book a short while after getting out of an abusive relationship, thinking it would help me hold my own in any future relationships so the pattern of abuse wouldn't continue. This idea, however, backfired. What I found myself doing while reading this book was getting more and more angry at men.I understand that women do need to stand up for themselves in all areas of life. If anyone understands this, it's me. I don't, however, believe that it's a good idea to get embroiled in the battle of the sexes. I'd like to believe that not all men are bad, and that I can be happy in a future relationship without having to resort to any tricks or manipulation.While this book has some good advice (i.e., go out instead of waiting by the phone for him to call) I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has any resentment towards the opposite sex. There are some great books out there which are more healing, and less damaging. Try anything by Kathryn Alice or Kathy Freston, for example. I also recommend \\"Make Every Man Want You\\" by Marie Forleo.Good luck!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I just finished reading this book, and am in the process of reading her other book, \\"Why Men Marry Bitches\\".I have to say that initially, like some other reviewers here, I was reluctant to read the book due to the title and the simple fact that I don't have much respect for so-called \\"girl guides\\". I agree that the title does a disservice to the book, although after having read it, I understand what the author means when she uses the word \\"bitch\\". I was afraid that this would be a book about being aggressive and demanding, but that is not the case at all. I am also an independent woman who is emotionally mature, but I must confess I have behaved too nicely many a time. If you read this book, please understand that it is meant to be humorous. Don't follow everything blindly (especially some of the jokey and outrageous advice). Use your own thinking. Like some people here, I don't think you should serve your date popcorn on the first date. But this doesn't 'mean that her advice isn't sound; she exaggerates of course, but what she means is, please don't bend over backwards for someone you barely know. I read some reviews here who claim that this book is about playing games, or that it says things that are too obvious, or that it teaches women to be abrasive. If you actually read the book you will see that she insists that a \\"bitch\\" is a woman who is nice, polite and gracious. She never, ever advises bitching and complaining; in fact she devotes a whole chapter to precisely why these tactics never work for women. Some negative reviewers insist that the book tells you to be someone else, and that you should be honest and open about what you want in a relationship. I completely agree with the latter; however, the book tells you to do the same thing. It shows you how to communicate with men on their level, without being too emotional; how to make them listen to you and how to get your point accross, and I repeat, NOT through bitching and complaining, but by presenting strong, logical arguments in a calm and rational manner. Surely this can only promote good communication?I can understand some viewers' hesitation about the \\"tactics\\" that she describes, like boosting a man's ego from time to time. I used to think, why should I boost anyone's ego? If he puts up a shelf and the damn shelf is crooked, why should I praise him? Or better yet, I'll do everything myself. The truth is, you need to praise and acknowledge his effort. Women fail to do this and then we wonder why \\"there are no real men left in the world\\". The truth is, for a man to show his generosity, you need to let him do it. Men have sensitive egos (they may deny it but we all know it's true). You put him down once or twice, he'll give up trying and you'll be putting those shelves up yourself for the rest of your life. If that's what you want, fine. But normally it's not, so you start complaining that he never does anything for you. This is how the vicious circle starts. After having read the book, I understand this better. So what if a shelf isn't perfect. You can still thank him for the effort and be tactful about it. Just don't criticize him when he's feeling all proud and manly. Don't criticize him in front of other people. It's basic consideration and common sense, of course. We women like being given presents and flowers, and being paid compliments. Men also like being appreciated. This is only logical. If you are having one of those \\"ugly\\" days, the man who truly loves you will say something encouraging, like \\"you look beautful, and you are always beautiful to me\\". He will sense your vulnerability and show his support. You do the same for him. Both are white lies; you don't always look beatiful, and he doesn't always succeed in home improvement. But you want him to keep trying, and you encourage and support him. I don't see how this is could be detrimental to any relationship.Finally, upon having read this book (and her second book which I most highly recommend), I feel a newfound appreciation for men. We women always puzzle over the things men do and often feel like men just don't get it. Well, the truth is, they do get it. They observe you and draw their own conclusions. They will test you to see your reactions to different situations, just as you will test them. You may call it playing games, or dislike it, but no matter what you think, this is normal behavior. We all test each other to a certain extent, consciously or unconsciously, depending on our individual insecurities and preferences. If you fail to acknowledge this simple fact, you fail to acknowledge reality.I think that this book is not your typical \\"relationship\\" book. It doesn't teach you how to \\"catch\\" a man, or win him. It teaches you how being a self-sufficient, independent, gracious and considerate person will help you attract the right man and more importantly, will keep him interested and focused on your relationship. Please read this book and you will see that the author doesn't condone games; what she does is help women understand men better and learn to communicate with them better. If becoming a woman worthy of respect (your own and other people's) means you must change yourself, then of course you must, otherwise you will never grow as a person. If you don't respect yourself firstly and foremostly, how can you expect other people to respect you? You would think that this is self-evident, but obviously, looking at the world today, it's not. Sherry Argov's book was written to change that."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Regardless of what some negative reviews (and rants) say, this book is helpful to some. Of course, you should read it with a grain of salt and realize that not everyone is perfect ALL of the time, not even this author. Some advice is simply silly, some incredibly helpful. It depends on how you were raised and what type of role model your mother was. Sorry, but not all of us had the luxury of having emotionally healthy and culturally \\"up-to-date\\" moms to guide us. So no, this material is not \\"common sense\\".For those of you who are learning how to be a better and stronger woman, I do recommend this book. However, do not take all of the advice literally and try to practice it like a manual. You will fail miserably. I also recommend \\"Stop Being the String Along\\" by Barbara Rose.

What I didn't like were the subtle manipulative games suggested for women that try to win a man over, and after trying some of those suggestions in this book, they did NOT work at all.I actually had a guy ask me \\"did you read that B**ch Book, because if you did, it's not working.\\"So read it for some of the good suggestions, but don't try the tricks and manipulation, because from personal experience from what I just said above, it doesn't work at all."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"We have all known our share of fabulous people -- albeit they can appear to be outnumbered by the pinheads we have all also known. I respect Argov's view on this topic the fact that her reference point is vastly different than my own -- but while I was truly impressed by the provocative and informative aspect of many of the points she skillfully raised in this book -- I was troubled by a few points. In my humble opinion: 1) the complexity of X:Y relationships are not as simple as a gender issue. The pretext that in order for the girl to 'get the guy' then she has to follow this strategy....is in itself a manipulation of the relationship; 2) some of the points raised are not reserved solely to one's sex, it is my view that men and women can make many of the same mistakes and share many of the same needs and longings; and 3) I personally would have liked to see more time invested in the notion of joint partnership or equality in the relationship, why does one person have to be the 'boss' -- can't they be equal partners, grounded in trust and respect for each other while celebrating the diversity they share? That being said, this is a good reader for all X's and Y's -- especially those in one sided relationships that are borderline abusive at any level...."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Warning: If you're not a woman who understands the concept of putting yourself first and if you don't have a sense of humor, this is probably not the book for you. That includes men who have no idea what women go through or the pressures that have been put on them to be 'a nice girl who is always available and acquiesce to any man who is interested in her.'I'm back in the dating scene after an absence of 15 years so I knew I could use some help. Out of all the books I've read, this one gives the best advice. I'm go glad I didn't heed the negative reviews. Luckily, I'm not as shallow as a wading pool, so I understand that as you grow close to a man, you are going to need to compromise and change some of your early behaviors. By that time, you will know that this is a good man and not a game player. Many men are looking for the easiest way to get a woman into bed. If you doubt me, read Steve Harvey's book, \\"Act Like A Lady, Think Like A Man\\". (Another excellent book about dating and relationships).I was a complete doormat and did not know it. Now I understand why I often got used and dumped. I am not a game player by any stretch of the imagination. I have great respect for men (well, most men) and I understand that they have pressures put on them that make them act the way they do. That said, I don't consider standing up for myself a game. Sherry Argov isn't suggesting a woman play games. She is suggesting you look inside yourself and acknowledge that you are worthy of being treated like the prize you are. If you have to fake rather than believe you deserve respect, you need more help than this book can give you."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"First off, it fascinates me that a lot of the things the author says collaborates with the values taught in Sunday school. The time honored codes of dressing modestly, no cohabitating, and virtue still hold true today (yay!!). However, I bought this book to understand more of the \\"male psyche\\" because men, especially young men, aren't crazy about commitment. I'll outline some great takeaways I got from this book and what I'd say are exceptions to a few rules. :)What I've learned:1.\\"Wait him out.\\" Women struggle mightily with patience. When you are crazy about a guy trying to take it slow is like turning a Thoroughbred into a carnival pony. But seriously wouldn't it be great to have the guy be the one to ask you to be in a serious relationship with him...like wow.2.\\"Live in the moment.\\" If a guy isn't ready to commit yet, just be yourself and have fun. And when he does BE YOURSELF AND HAVE FUN!!3.\\"Threaten to pull the plug.\\" I liked this one best. Instead of asking (pleading, begging...) for a guy to be with you, hint at leaving. Talk about establishing your worth!Exceptions:1.To a certain extent all guys need to be won over by playing hard to get and being playful, but some guys take it to extremes. For these, I think their ideal woman is a gun toting Angelina Jolie character who only speaks in sensual and clever one liners. It's exhausting, frustrating, and impossible to keep up. If you cannot be yourself and have the guy interested, don't try to outmaneuver him at his games. Pick a different guy and play better games with him. ;)"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I loved this book! I got judged by a few narrow minded people bc of the title but the content is actually very intelligent and not what you might imagine. I've loaned it to my sisters and they loved it as well. Don't let the title give you the wrong impression. This book is not about teaching woman to snap their fingers and walk around with a chip on their shoulder. It's about teaching women to have self respect and to value themselves on all levels and how we have unhealthy relationship behaviors taught to us in movies, media, and handed down through the generations from our female role models. This book at no point says to be unkind or hurtful to anyone. Codependency seems to be common with females and it's a hard habit to break. As a mother of young girls I'm glad I can instill in them these principles and prevent them from developing the self defeating behaviors that I was taught."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I give this book 5 stars for entertainment value and 3.5 for actual advice. Nothing in this book is groundbreaking. It's basically same old same old telling women they should empower themselves. So in short, be the bitch:- Don't chase him- Don't smother him with attention- Have a life aka your own hobbies, friends, interestsLike I said, nothing is groundbreaking. But I do tend to agree with Argov. A lot of women will lose themselves and forget they ever had friends or hobbies when they meet a new man. Men on the other hand have a special relationship with each other, they don't abandon their friends after meeting someone new. But, there are MEN who act just like the \\"nice\\" girl Argov describes. Believe me, I've seen them (and they're hard to get rid of). So Argov shouldn't associate the \\"nice\\" girl traits with just women. Not to get all Dr Phil on you, but there is a reason why women OR men will become doormats, and it's usually because of something that happened in their childhood. No woman, whether she's 18 or 45 with \\"experience\\", that grew up in a household where both adults respected each other and didn't play manipulation games will be a doormat. Sure, there are a few tricks every women should have under their sleeves to encourage men to do certain things, but guys have tricks of their own.I have another issue with this book. Besides telling women to empower themselves, Argov provides what seems to be manipulation advice: ignore his calls to let him wonder, \\"cook\\" popcorn so he takes you out, tell him you're coming after he calls for a booty call and never show up.... Then Argov tries to justify this behavior by saying it's not manipulation it's letting him know you won't put up with his crap. One page she's saying \\"play the dumb fox,\\" the next she's saying communicate with him like another man would (aka say no). Logic will tell you that if you're busy and can't return his call right away that's fine, but sitting at home eating popcorn and purposely waiting a day to return his call is definitely no beginning to a healthy relationship. If you don't want to do something, don't do it. Meaning, if he calls you for a booty call, simply tell him no.I also don't like that there's a billion dollar industry trying to teach women how to \\"catch\\" a man. I mean seriously, how many books are out there teaching men how to catch a woman? Or how to keep the spark in a relationship. As a woman, I don't want a guy who constantly keeps checking in, or wants me to check in. I don't want someone who will forget the name of his best friend just because he learned mine. I want both space and attention. It has to be a healthy balance of both. Women lose interest in some men just as quickly as men can lose interest in women.The bottom line ladies, love comes when you least expect it. It's like that key that you put in an \\"easy to remember\\" place, and now can't find it, but you really need it now, and then later find it in a bowl next to your TV. Same with men, if you don't go out looking so actively, they'll find you. Whether you volunteer at the library, take tennis lessons, or take a stand up comedy class. Always have interests of your own. Not only will you acquire new skills, interests, etc, you'll enjoy life without a man. You can be happy in a relationship, and you can be happy alone. Alone does not mean lonely!I say get this book in a library. It's an easy read, you'll be done in a few evenings."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"After reading \\"All the Rules\\" and being disappointed and slightly disgusted, I was apprehensive about reading a similar book but decided to give it a try after a friend told me it was a good read. I was pleasantly surprised. Sherry's sense of humor is great, but her messages are EPIC. Women need to be indepdent, strong and in control of their emotions. She offers countless great qoutes, and also includes very significant quotes from others that are inspirational. This book discusses and teaches women how to be the boss of your life, which in turn attracts and keeps quality men. There were so many good points made. This helps you to understand the psychology of men and why they need to be challenged (backed with facts and examples). It works LIKE A CHARM too. I have to say in the past whenever I dated men I wasn't interested in much, I made myself appear very unavailable, and always made a point that I wasn't looking for a relationship because I am focused on ME. That ALWAYS turned them on and made them eager to lock me down, and I wondered, WHY?! Yet when you go out of your way to please someone and give them your all, it always backfires. They don't appreciate it, stop doing the things they once did and take advantage of your kindness and generosity. I now understand exactly why. I can't even tell you how huge my \\"aha\\" moment was reading this. It all makes sense now. I mean, I already knew most of this but the way she presents it so unapologetically like you need to hear it and supports it with examples makes it all make sense. Men do not want a woman who is eager to please them and center her life around them. They want a strong woman who loves herself and is generally HAPPY with or without them. It's not really being manipulative or playing a game, but you just cannot wear your emotions on your sleeve or give too much of yourself (especially too quickly). Suddenly my past relationship all seems so clear, and I hold much of the blame for why it didn't work! It's like the dots magically connected while I was reading this. I made every mistake possible by giving too much of myself to my ex, and can only blame myself. But at least I know better now. Another good thing is she tells you stay away from jerks and tells you that you hold the power to control your thoughts so there are NO excuses. What I love most is the quotes from men she interviews and the stories which are realistic unlike in \\"All the Rules\\". Sherry's advice for women encourages them to focus on being independent, having careers and hobbies, and taking care of themselves, which will in turn attract men more than being needy and chasing men. I love this in every way and I have recommended it to every woman I know!!! I was extremely moved by this book and how it was written. POWERFUL is the only word I can use to describe it. I am very much looking forward to \\"Why Men Marry Bitches\\" next."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Since I read \\"Why Men Love Bitches\\", I have recommended it to numerous female clients and friends - Sherry Argov is spot on in her commentary and advice. She gets the male psychology perfectly (no doubt due to the countless interviews with men she details in her book). It is humorously written but the topic addressed and the advice given is frankly no laughing matter.There are so many women out there who are extremely frustrated with their dating lives/relationships, are wondering why they can't meet the right person, why they are not married, etc. and are driven to tears by the actions of the men in their world. They are confused as to why things are not going the way they want when, in their view, they have given so much and are nothing but loving, supportive partners. Chances are high that they are being \\"too nice\\", too nurturing and TOO AVAILABLE - all the things a \\"bitch\\" is not (as Sherry would say).The gentleman who wrote the critical review suggesting that the book's advice is not to be followed because women might \\"land\\" the guy but will not be in a happy relationship based upon game playing could not be more off base in his assessment. Instead of giving credence to that particular review, I would suggest women read on to the review of the gentleman who writes that Sherry has basically given away the men's playbook - which, again, makes sense being that she took much of what she writes directly out of the mouths of men.I have seen both sides of the coin - women who have constantly cancelled their plans for the men in their lives, been far too accessible and emotionally needy as well as women who have had the good sense to hold off on giving their affection and nurturing until the men earned it. Of course, the women who were too available or too emotional too quickly ultimately sabotaged their relationships (or quashed them from the get-go). I have also seen the advice Sherry gives regarding how to deliver your message sweetly but firmly and also how to communicate with men through actions over words work like magic - men understand you best when you \\"speak\\" to them in their own language. We all make mistakes and no one is perfect 100% of the time, but in the end she is telling you the recipe for success with the men in your lives. And as someone who has both done a tremendous amount of research on this subject and who speaks to countless men (and women) on dating and relationship issues on a daily basis I can assure you that Sherry's advice and insights are based on proven science and the study of how men have been programmed to think by thousands of years of evolution.\\"Why Men Love Bitches\\" is a must read for all women (even the ones in happy relationships - it will keep you on your toes!). Five Stars to Sherry!Marni Galison, President and FounderSunday at Noon[...]"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This book was recommended to me by a close girlfriend of mine. I was obsessing about the fact that I was the one always making the plans. I would call him \\"just to see what he was doing\\" and get upset when I didn't get the same attention mirrored back at me. I began to lash out by being passive aggressive and nagging. As I lunged forward, the guy pulled back.Some people honestly think this book is about manipulation and playing games, I suppose it's how you look at it:The author makes many points to tell her reader to respect themselves as well as the man involved. At no point does she tell you to treat the guy like dirt and you shouldn't. She continued to drive home the point that you were your own woman before you met him, with your own schedule and routine, and that there is no reason that you should bring all of that to a screeching halt just because you've met a new guy and you're waiting for him to call.I consider myself pretty independent. I'm a 27 year old woman in NYC with a good job, great interests outside of work and a healthy social life but I have to admit that when getting involved with someone past 4 or 5 dates I slowly start to change my routine and get caught up in the new relationship. I applaud Argov for showing that being a \\"b*tch\\" forces you to maintain your own life and sense of self-worth while still being a pleasant person.I respect and love the long-term relationship I'm currently in and this book helped me relax. I took the advice given in this book and my boyfriend (who can spot manipulation a mile away) never got defensive or mad but he did notice a difference and did become more responsive (within reason) and has even pointed out that I seem more chill, secure and confident...and I do - because I realize I have every reason to be confident in who I am and what I have going on in my life. I don't have to be on his ass 24/7 and questioning \\"gosh, does he really like me?\\"Read the book with an open mind - the humor in it is a little eye-roll inducing but the overall message is a good one. I didn't give it a full 5 stars because I found her to be a little harsh at times, and a 5 star book is hard to come by in any genera.I also have the other book Why Men Marry Bitches - it has a lot of the same topics but goes a bit further after the first half and discusses topics such as living together, talking about the future and while the marriage is in full gear."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"My friend gave me a stack of these books after she got married. Book reviewer that I am, I couldn't just \\"not\\" read them. Many books on this topic are a bit lame. They are either for women who are truly clueless, or they are really focused on one area of self-development, i.e. confidence.This is a great book if you are already plenty confident, have gotten to a great place in your life for understanding who you are and then already know well the type of man who is right for you (the last part being the absolute hardest).This book, then steps in with seemingly general wisdom on making sure you understand all the nuances of being treated right. It answers the problems of \\"ok, so I'm being nice\\" what is \\"too nice\\" and how will I know when what I'm doing is setting myself up for a dangerous precedent. This book is perfect. It goes through the entire scenario to explain to you why you might want to think twice about being \\"available\\". Why it will end up in that dangerous spiral of hurt feelings and nagging. For many women, this is the advice they need, i.e. how to train and set behaviors correctly at the outset so that you never have certain types of problems.I couldn't give it full stars because there are a couple areas that are not addressed. First, this book, as I mentioned, is really only right if you are already confident and really understand what type of man you should be dating. I know tons of girls that go out with guys who like to treat women like a doormat. No amount of the rules in this book is really going to stop you from being treated poorly by such a guy. Hence, if you read this book and then go out with a guy like that, you'll come away feeling that you have failed. This book should probably address that issue a bit.Second, I do actually think adding a chapter on building confidence is important. As I think of my girlfriends who \\"should be confident\\", in this area they really aren't. That said, many of the actions in this book could only be carried out by a woman who is confident; so perhaps in going through the paces a woman can become her actions?"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I found this book not only informative but also entertaining. I just got out of a long term relationship and was ready to start dating again. I did everything wrong. I called the guy the next day, I was there for him whenever he needed me, I drove to his house all the time. Yes all shameful things, but i'm only telling you this to prove a point about the book. It was correct in saying he would quickly grow tired of you and walk away. That was exactly what he did. Now that I have read the book and understand the errors of my ways, I no longer hang on to the guy. I'm there for him when I need him. It is amazing how much it works. Yes, they call me wanting to know whats going on. It is so nice to have to the ball in my court. I also recommend the book \\"You Lost Him at Hello\\" by Jess McCann. I found that these two books complemented each other very well."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I used to be the girl who was 'too nice' and hoped a guy would respect me and treat me well, but deep down, I didn't even respect or value myself. I had low-self esteem when it came to dating and sex. I was the girl that felt pressured/manipulated into sex too early in order to 'appease' the guy. This is because I had doubts about wether I was good enough or not. I let him control me. I lost all my bargaining power by giving into sex too early. After meeting loads of players and getting trampled and used, I began to feel hurt and angry. I realised how manipulative men are, and how I fell for their manipulative tricks. Men almost always had one-up on me, especially the older guys. I thought to myself, I am always the caring one, but it needs to work both ways!! But after reading this book, I realised, you have to respect yourself and put yourself first. You have to be in total control of yourself. This book isn't about being manipulative and unfairly capitalizing off other people, it is about learing how to put yourself first, which is what everyone should do. Sadly, some people go through their whole lives without learning how to put themself first. Ever met the 40-year-old, \\"dumb\\", \\"nice\\" guy that is always doing things for women, but at the same time, he thinks women are selfish and take him for granted? It is OK to give and not receive, but ONLY if you are SURE that you don't want to receive anything back. People want and need to have a balanced, give-and-take relationship. This book taught me how to put myself first. As Sherry says \\"Act like a prize and he'll turn into a beleiver\\".

What this book opened my eyes to was the fact that I put a man's needs before my own once \\"in\\" a relationship. The spirit of this book is a fundamental lesson not just for women - but for ANYONE - value yourself first if you expect anyone else to value you. Yes, Sherry refers to the \\"game\\" that exists between men and women - but I think if you can look past it being an overtly manipulative kind of thing - you will see that she is talking about basic dynamics that exist between men and women and how to make the most of them and how to avoid potential pitfalls. And when you factor in how absolutely HILARIOUS this book is - (the entertainment value alone is a 10!) - you will see why this book is absolute gold. If you're still skeptical, take it with a grain of salt and look for the entertainment value - you'll be pleasantly surprised. And if you're looking for this to solve your relationship problems and find you the perfect man - you too will be pleasantly surprised - because what you'll discover is that you don't NEED a perfect man to be happy - you will be happier just being the perfect you - living your life and enjoying it to the fullest - and oddly enough - that will be like stinkbait to a catfish...the perfect man will become hooked on you!I have loaned this book out to several of my very intelligent, professional, and highly successful girlfriends already - and their reaction has been the same: fascination with what they learned about themselves.Love, love, love this book - and my aunt for making me read it!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This book gave no straight advice, was dumb, boring, and repetitive many times.

Overall though this book really did help me get an insight on why women do what they do and the different type of personalities. You may have figured it out by now I am a man and yes ladies Im on to you! wink! so your going to have to be even more bi***! then before. Relationship are fun and make sure all of you don't hate playing games, because if you can't play then sucks to be you. I totally recommend this book as it describes a few of my earlier follies in my 20's Im 30 something now so I have come a long way. I think my day will come when I publish my diary of all my relationships."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"If you met someone, and they invited you out with him and his friends and seems very interested in you: Do you think that if I accepted the invite the first three times, that I will have not played by the rules and ruined my chances? I have not initiated anyting, but I wonder if I played too easy to get by accepting these invites. I saw him and his friends Thursday night, and a week later on the next THursday night, then Sunday night. We couldn't stop talking on both those thursday nights and I wish I would have said \\"oh I have to go\\" on Thursday night instead of enjoying our conversation so much. Sunday he invited me to a superbowl party and I talked to everyone and not him as much that time. Which makes me think I shouldn't have accepted. He knew I was studying and that I came after half time because I got enough done.What can I do now, based on the rules?: I JUST started reading this book so I have no idea. This guy is recently unengaged, so I don't think this guy is pursuing me, but I do think he is attracted to me and interested in me--so it's a unique situation where I don't expect him/want him to start with dating. He is healing, and I am healing, and it's just a friendship for now. He does seem like the type to believe in the male being the pursuer.My main question is: if I maybe was a little too eager to accept, is it fixable? SHould I try to drop something into the conversation that says something along the lines of \\"right now I really like just hanging out with friends and meeting new people, which is why I go out with you and your friends and am doing the same with my other friends, but I'm not interested in dating right now.\\"....is that a good way for me to play hard to get and cover my tracks?

Some of the information is sound . like not nagging or being scary needy and that your more likely to get what you want if you're nice about it instead of bitchy and mean. But i think thats the same for both sexes not just men and is just good information in general. Its a treat others how you want to be treated type of thing.what I didn't like about the book is that the tone makes all men sound like jerks and basically says that women are always going to be the underdogs and have to manipulate their way in life because no one respects us enough for us be honest and actually speak our minds. She also uses bitch as a powerful term for a stronge women, which I didn't really enjoy and thought was kind of misleading. In my mind bitch is always going to be a derogatory term and we should start respecting ourselves a little more by not using it. It's kind of like using the term douche bag or fa**ot as a positive term to describe someone. I also didn't like how she wanted women to use sex to manipulate guys. Sex shouldn't be negotiated it should be something that a girl and guy wants and there should be enough respect on both people's part not to use it as a weapon. Women shouldn't be told that they have to ration sex or a guy won't respect them. They should be respected for being comfortable with their sexuality and enjoying sex when they want to have it and if your guy doesn't respect you for that then you need to find another guy.My boyfriend saw me reading this on the couch and he was pretty appalled he said no guy wants a bitch and that it was basically a woman's guide on how to use and manipulate men. It was just written using nice words so that people didn't see it for what it was. He also said that some things might be ok in the beginning but eventually ur guy is going to get fed up with you being lazy all the time and blowing him off so you can paint your toes and is going to look else ware for a quality girl that he can make a future with. He also said that guys are going to need a book called how to handle your bitch after girls read this and offered to return the book to the store for me. Lol. I think girls should look for a good guy and no really decent mature guy wants a bitch at least not for very long."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This book really taught me a lot about men and how to handle them.

So I had to read it (especially if a man recommended it lol). And I must say Sherry Argov knows her stuff!Chapter 6: Nag no more definitely cleared the haze for me when I would constantly get on my husband for being inconsiderate (always hanging with his friends, not spending time with me, coming in late, etc). After I read this book (he didnt know I was reading it because I changed the book cover), he tested me a few more times with his inconsiderateness only to see that he wasnt getting the typical reaction that I normally gave him. And Im guessing it really bothered him because 3 times in 1 week he said to me \\"U havent cussed me out in awhile.\\" And he couldnt give me a straight answer on if it was a bad thing or not. I just laughed. But he is being much more considerate now. Still a working progress though.Im glad I read it, it gave me my reminder of how I use to be before I got married.

I was initially skeptical because of the word \\"Bitch\\" in the title of the book because it is a word I normally find offensive but then I realized it was more of a figure of speech than anything else and it was really just a book about empowring women to not be doormats in relationships.

I totally get it and laughed and saw where I was a nice girl. I was like a windscreen wiper nice girl to bitch. I knew what it was wrong to chase him but I was too impulsive. This book never leaves my bag to keep myself in check. Was intimidated by the book's title and when I was being taken for granted too much by my boyfriend I decided its time to see what this book is all about.I own plenty of self-help and dating books and now I can totally understand what I did. I wish I read this book when I was 18 I would have never put myself through some things. I have stopped appointing my current boyfriend of 8 months whom is in the military as my agony uncle (did that when I was feeling down and had no job). I can wholly relate to the book and its principles and I can see where my girlfriends do in their relationships.I am totally FOCUSED ON MYSELF and don't really care whether I am with him or not. I am not making it convenient for him to see me. He doesn't like it, but I was like this in the beginning. I am weaning myself of calling him by keeping myself busy as I do get this urge. I still have other guys chasing me and could not care less but with the one I like I feel to chase him but NO MORE!!!I am 25 now and have realised the path to relationship heaven with a man is to make him work for you, to date you, to want you, as if you were the only woman to walk the earth. You do that by changing his expectations and goalposts continually after you have become a couple. To settle in to domestic routine is to allow him to move into a comfort zone you will later regret.

Dating has been such a headache for me and it was simply because I was going about it all wrong. Women are conditioned/naturally very caring and concerned beings--at their own expense! If men aren't treating us the way we feel we need to be treated, we need to drop the zero and get us a hero. Simple as that. Once women begin to focus on their values and maintaining high self-esteem, they can have a greater perspective on the dating and what shouldn't be sacrified. Only then will women win at the dating game."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Okay, with over 500 reviews and opinions on this book, is this really literary or clever marketing? I say this because it is evident, the author infused great marketing techniques into the emotions of desperate women seeking companionship. However, if any woman is to the point of reading a book to get relationship tips, she's already in trouble and this book is going to do nothing more than push her deeper into the the realms of low self esteem. True, the author (I can't even nor do I want to remember her name) did give some tips which were mere matters of common sense. Don't give your all, don't jump for a man, don't come on too strong, and so on and soon. Okay, great! Most women learn this as early as their high school years and if by the age of 30, they have not grasped the concept yet, then no book will change that inbreed character. At the same time, the advice given was piratical wisdom. For women who take this book seriously, it is my single opinion that they may be beyond the help they claim to seek, because I am sure, most of them have family and friends who have possibly told them the same things they are reading or going to read in this book, yet failed to take heed to their advice. So now, you run out and purchase a book by a total stranger, to give you tips on matters of the heart. I bet the fact that the cover displays it's sold a million copies, added to the belief that \\"Oh, this has to be the truth!\\"Tell you how I really feel about this book you say. Well, for starers, why does the woman with self esteem, common sense and knows her value, has to be referred to as a Bitch. If it's not bad enough for some men to call women with dignity out of their name, here is a sister, doing the same. So you can't have dignity without being a bitch, and if you're nice, you're dumb with no self value? Basically, that is what the author states throughout her piece.Tell you how I really feel about this book you say. Well, secondly, it was repetitious. The author stated the same thing over and over, just differently. Waste of paper. Next, if I ever learn of a woman serving some half cooked hot dogs or putting on a apron and a oven mitt to serve some pop corn, I may slap her silly. Don't under mind the intelligence of anyone, especially one you are investing an interest in, karma is a mother!Finally, although I love a human kind, the difference is cultures plays a significant role in finding a companion or mate. White women and men date. They do the dating thing. They hook up, have some drinks, dinner, maybe a night cap and things progress. Then they refrain from seeing one another and date others in that same fashion for about a week or more, before they see that one person who really captured their interest again. Most of the time. Black men and women however are more decisive with their love interest. If the two make a connection, it isn't likely they will take a break to the point of seeing other people before they make it clear to one another that they are looking to make things exclusive. This applies to the entire flock, good, bad and indifferent. So her advice wasn't geared to all women. What about Middle Eastern men and women, Asians and Hispanics? So what I am saying is this book does not represent the thoughts and feelings of all, just a certain poled group. No man wants to be with a bitch? He will sleep with her, \\"date\\" her and call her up for a \\"booty call\\" from time to time, but he will not make her his lady or wife. So ladies, if you have a sense of dignity, this book is simply for entertainment only. If you are what the author considers \\"a nice girl\\", this may not be the book that will help you build up your confidence in manner that will benefit you in the long run. And please, don't consider this book to be your bible...What did I like about the book? It has a nice eye catching cover and I respect the marketing hustle of selling a million copies.Girl Power Forever! Peace & Blessings"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I read this book after I broke up with my ex. I am glad that I found this book. I found my confidence again and I started to understand why my relationship failed in the past. I used to blame myself when my relationship didn't work, I thought I was not good enough, I said something wrong and I did something wrong. I was in hell! but after reading this book, finanlly I understand what was going on!!Let's admit it, when we meet nice people, sometimes we really \\"take it for granted\\". As a girl, I admit that I will when I meet a nice guy, it's the same for guys. I understand guys may hate this book, but be honest to yourself guys, you really do that!But the most important thing about this book is \\"not about getting a man, it's about how to treat yourself well\\"! The message in this book is to be an independent thinker, GET A LIFE for yourself, with or without a man, we can be completed and happy. I am 25 years old, before I thought I must need a relationship, but now I know I don't \\"need\\", I can have a choice. Even when I turn 30 or 40 or 50, as long as I love myself, I can be happier than those women who are married but are treating badly by their husband. I've asked all my female friends and relatives (about 30 people), they ALL tell me if they can choose again, they will not get married and prefer to be single.I was \\"too nice\\" to my ex, what happened was the same describe in this book, he treated me badly, he left me sitting alone in parties (while he was having fun and flirting with his female friends), he told me to shup up when one of his female friend was so rude to me, and he even use a sms to broke up with me (he didn't even trying to TALK to me). I can swear to God that I was trying very hard to be a good girlfriend, I was not asking him to give me any committment or do anything for me (I didn't mention marriage or children)I was quiet but trying my best to please him, but still, he thought that I was annoying and he just tried \\"his best\\" to get rid of me.So for me (and for a lot of my friends), this book taught us how to be independent and keep our goal in our life, we will become happier, we start to trust ourself and believe in ourself even without a man. And I know what should I do IF I will have another relationship (I won't chase it, I will just go with the flow and be happy).I know a lot of men will say that we are playing games and it is nonsense, but if they know what they did were so mean for us, they will know that we are just trying to \\"protect\\" and \\"take care\\" of ourself."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I am a fast reader by nature, but this book took months to get through.

Thanks!!!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"For the most part I liked this book. I love the sarcastic title, I think she's trying to redefine what a bitch is, however to me, a bitch will always be someone that hurts others on purpose. I really loved her message which is what I took with me. Don't be a doormat, have your own life, live your life because life doesn't start when you meet that great guy.However, I disliked the dumb fox chapter. I don't want to pretend to be a dumb chick for any guy. She gave one example where the girl lied to her husband about getting a maid, the girl told her husband she was getting her once a month, when she was actually getting her once a week. I can relate because I don't like to do housework and I don't like to cook.Its just not within me, in that case they should have just talked about it. In a relationship, I want to be able to speak my mind freely. I don't want to hide that I have groceries delivered or that I have a maid come in if I choose to do that.In another chapter she goes on to say that you shouldn't nag. I agree. Nagging is like being a dude's mom. Not interested. I ain't his mama. She does give an example where several women get manipulative to get a guy to move and do whatever she wants to get done. Like asking the single dad across the street to carpool their kids. That's just not cool. Come on.I also don't want to act like a dumb little girl who knows nothing just to make a guy feel good. No way. I want to be the girlfriend who makes the guy feel good without having to dumb myself down. So yeah I agree with some things that she said though I don't think its anything groundbreaking. Just some common sense stuff that women need to hear now and again.The rest I'm going to chuck just because it doesn't make sense. You have to do that with anything you come across in life. She's also right about having financial independence. This is something that I had to learn the hard way. It doesn't matter if your parents or guy support you, if they see you buying $200 dollar shoes with their money, they're going to get annoyed.Its just better to hold down a job even if you don't like it, buy whatever you like, and no one can complain what you did with it. And if you're ever told you are getting divorced or left by your man, then you can be comfortable knowing you can take care of yourself. And you know you can leave too if you become unhappy in your relationship.Anyone who's interested in this or any other relationship or self-help book, just use your common sense. Don't be manipulative just to get a guy to do something, I'm sure you wouldn't want him to manipulate you."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Just got my book a week and a half ago and I admit I was a bit skeptical because I don't believe in playing mindgames. This is the first book of its kind that I've ever bought and I don't think I'll need to get another. This book is great. The suggestions are practical and simple and I'm already seeing results! This book is a must read for any woman who's too nice and feels as if she's being taken for granted!

It shows you everything to do if you are one of those women who can't keep a man. A lot of the information I read in this book I was already practicing with the man I was with at the time, after I dealt with a loser and learned these rules the hard way. This is basically a book that tells women a lot of what they do wrong in a relationship. I would follow the rules in this book as they fit with your situation. I was using many but not all the advice in the book. You have to find what advice you should take depending on the man you are dealing with. The man I was with while I was reading this book is now my HUSBAND!! HAHAHA. Married June 2010. I think I got this book a year or two before that. Now it is time for me to upgrade to \\"Why Men Marry bitches!\\""},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"There is truth in the book...it echoes such books written for men trying desperately to win over women. These books are effective at picking up \\"hot chicks\\" at clubs, or picking up high rollers, business men, lawyers, etc., that many girls' mother told them to snag.However, if you want a real realationship, such as I have recently found, then throw out all this game-playing. I have a woman now who could easily be a \\"hot chick\\" dancing in a club; but now she is mine and loves only me, she's a homebody (which made it a bit difficult to find her, since I am too), but we found each other and we are honest with each other. Sometimes honesty hurts and sometimes it's unwelcome and at times it's a \\"turn off,\\" but chasing each other around does not lead to a fulfilling REALationship.I do not discourage reading books on people skills, such as People Skills, by Bolton, which has helped me enrich my friendships tremendously, but the goal should not be to possess someone, but to enrich the relationship. I am grateful for my woman, and I do what I can to please her (not to attract her or catch her, but to please her); writing poems, giving her simple gifts, doing things for her, etc. It's a give and take."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Oh how I wish I bought this book sooner! It could have saved me a lot of time and pain over the past several years. I'm not saying it will make every man fall in love with you - in fact I tried these techniques on a guy I was dating recently and he promptly stopped calling. Which was a good thing - because I was pretty miserable in that relationship! I stopped trying so hard and in doing so, realized the only reason we were still seeing each other was because *I* was doing all the work. Once I asked him to stepup in even the most minor way, he was out. And now I know not to spend any more time dating him! This is a great book for women like me who tend to fall too hard, too fast. I don't feel a \\"connection\\" with many men, but when I do it's instant and intense and I tend to jump in with both feet. This book has taught me to pace myself at the beginning of a relationship to figure out if the guy is worth my time and my emotions. It really helps to pinpoint the guys who are seriously interested and those who are just in it for the sport. Highly recommend this book for all single women who feel that they never really get what they want or need out of a relationship."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I read this book with high hopes, looking at the great reviews it had gotten, and having it recommended to Me by someone I know online. I was very disappointed to find that it's a few hundred pages of telling you to have your own life instead of caving in to another person's desires all the time. It also basically tells you to lie/make up excuses to get out of seeing someone, to make them want you more (similar to the strategies of the male version of this book, \\"The Game\\")Maybe it's just common sense to me, but if you can't stand up for yourself and hold your own when it's important, you probably need to do more than read a book to fix that. The book repeats how it's not about being mean or nasty (what most people think of as bitches) but about being strong and powerful, and knowing what you want. I guess that means that women who know what they want and are smart enough to follow their own hearts are bitches? Ok...Needless to say, I gained absolutely nothing by reading this book - I guess I've got these ideals ingrained in myself and didn't realize so many other people don't.I'd certainly recommend reading this book if you're kind of weak-willed and a pushover in relationships. If you get stepped on a lot because you're overly nice, yes you should read this and take note... but don't spend the $15 bucks, if you can find it in a library... or at least buy it used.

I love them, but most of them are junk and are written by people whose lives are a mess. I have a friend who cannot hold a steady, monogamous relationship for the life of his, but he is writing a relationship book. Since he's had so many shallow ones, he considers himself an expert. It's like having somebody who's broke write a book on how to get rich. Quite ridiculous!This book is different! I read it 3 times and bought copies for my girlfriends. It's the only one I refuse to part with. It is perfect to remind you to hold your own in a relationship. Way too often nice girls end up with the guys no other woman would ever put up with while the bitches end up the best guys out there. You don't have that much time to waste since you have the most choices while you are young and pretty. Pick your man wisely and hopefully you'll never have to apply any of the strategies the author recommends, but just to be on the safe side, keep the book with you.

I would drop all plans with friends to be with my boyfriend, because I was so \\"in love\\". Well, when all was said and done and I got dumped for being too available, too needy, basing my life around him, all my friends suddenly had other plans when I'd call them. I found myself without a man and with few friends left.To drop everything because he calls at the last minute and you're so needy and desperate you're afraid you'll never hear from him again if you tell him you have other plans is a not a good sign. It means you're so desperate to get your hooks in a man before you get old and your looks fade that you're going to screw over everyone you know.To cancel on anyone at the last minute because \\"he\\" called is rude, ill-mannered and shows a complete lack of respect for friends. There is nothing \\"bitter or envious\\" about being miffed at someone who keeps cancelling at the last minute because he called. But hey, if you want to be available as a booty call at the drop of a hat, feel free. But in spite of finally having a boyfriend, you seem to be bitter.

I was fascinated with this book for a few reasons --Argov is a writer's nightmare. Rarely does she use a compound, complex, or compound-complex sentence. A second grader could write this drivel. The analogies she uses are unimaginative, and she seems to think her target audience is not an educated group of women. Secondly, Argov is a walking contradiction. In one chapter she preaches that women need to be strong, but in the next chapter she writes things like, don't kill a bug in front of a man because he needs to be the \\"hero.\\" Always respond to a man's text, BUT wait at least X amount of minutes or even a day or two to reply. Always make him wait for you. Then Argov has asinine rules. Even three or four months into a relationship don't cook him dinner. In fact, the most you should do for him is put a bag of popcorn in the mircrowave and nuke it. Why allow him to know you know your way around a kitchen? Don't open a jar in front of a man (however, if a woman should not cook for a man, than I don't see why she would be opening food jars...just saying!). At a scary movie, hang all over him, and hide behind your hands during the gory scenes (even if you want to see the gore). Let him tell you when the \\"scary part\\" is over. Don't parallel park when he is in the car. If you have to parallel park, let him do it. A woman should always remind a man that he is manly by saying things like \\"You're so strong...\\". The clencher: Argov writes that a woman should NEVER play games with a man. A woman should be honest and forthright. Yet, it seems that every chapter was a lesson on how to toy with a man's mind and his heart.The one thing I did like that Argov writes is that a woman should live her life and not wait for a man. Make plans with the girls, and don't forgo the girls for a last minute date with a man. Which, by the way, Argov says one should never accept a last minute date. It allows the man to have too much control over her. Go places. Live life because your independence will, and I quote, \\"turn him on.\\" (Now... this contradicts so much of what she writes in the first 7 chapters. Confusing, right?I know others love this book, and I know that we all see relationships differently; however, I am not going to pretend that I am helpless, stupid, or even uncaring. It goes against every fiber in my being. The irony: According to Argov, that's probably why I am single."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"If you have to manipulate someone to get someone then you will have to manipulate him to keep him. If you have to gauge every call you make, every meal you cook and everything you do, you are with the wrong person. I tried some of this person's tips. I dated a man for seven months and never let him know I really liked him and that it bothered me when he played the come closer go away game. Her tactics were very effective. When I blew him off, he came running to me. I should have asked him what he was looking for in a relationship and told him where I was at in the first month. But I didn't because I didn't want to appear \\"needy.\\" She was correct in that the more unavailable I was the more he wanted me. Turns out he was dating someone else at the same time he was dating me. I ended the relationship as soon as I found out. If I'd have trusted my instincts and asked the questions her book advises women not to, I would have dropped him very early and not wasted so much time and effort. Every man I know who I have shared her advice with has laughed out loud. The women I know who are the most successful with men have also given me some advice.

They hate all those books we women have to read to be able to know how to have any kind of a peaceful relationship with them. Since The Millenium wasn't ushered in with any manuals, we need to read all we can and this book is included in my list. We all forget sometimes that the best things in life are the simplest. We've evolved so much that we're taught from birth that as intellectual beings, we're duty bound to learn to take the simple and make it really complicated (lawyers come to mind here). But the attraction game is simple, intuitive, and alive in all animals...even us. Even marriage shouldn't kill it. Come on, we all know this. We need to \\"strategize\\" through life in all arenas to continue to get what we want.....i.e., work, social groups, friends, politics. It is essential in our erotic/intimate relationships, too.....including AFTER marriage.Anyone with kids can tell you we have a capacity for this stuff early.......and for a reason. Only the most obsequious, yes-men/women think that all we need to do is \\"make nice\\" to get what we deserve. So don't make it so easy on everyone to know the score with you. Don't take away a man's chance to long for you a little....or get a little worried, or work up a little sweat over you, thinking you may not be as available as he thought you were. Let him have his little bit of adrenaline rush for you. It's what men like and it's what made them pursue you in the first place. What's so bad?

I was in a relationship and felt like he was slowly but surely getting bored with me cause I was the type that went over when he asked or most of the time accomodated his needs. I finished half this book the night I got it and might I add, he had called me twice and I was too into reading to pick up. For the rest of the week I followed the authors advice in a sense that I wouldnt be the one to ask to hang out or go over every time he asked. It completely threw him off guard and when I eventually did see him, he couldnt keep his hands off me!I agree with most of the reviewers however, that playing a 247 game isnt going to get you a real relationship. But if he is falling astray it might just be the thing to get him back on track. If you have to constantly play the game to keep him then it isnt worth it. But every once in a while its a good idea to throw him off track or play hard to get in order to reignite that spark when he didnt have you in the first place, and to remind him of what he could be missing."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"After my good friend read this book and talked about it nonstop, she passed it to me.

Just because a guy has sex with a woman does not mean he cares about her. Women get that all mixed up and lie to themselves about it. I have recommended this book to lots of friends and will continue to do so! Thanks for writing it. I am happily married to a guy I didn't have to chase because I became anyone's dream gal by just being honest with myself and seeing situations as they truly are.

It usually isn't your boyfriend who stamped that out, it's your own insecurity. Don't let that insecurity take over. Don't try to hide who you are and don't feel like you have to conform to anyone's image of the \\"nice girl.\\" It will get you nowhere fast, as most of us know from experience.I also would like to add that immediately after finishing this book, which I of course started and finished in the same afternoon/evening, I jumped up in glee with this newfound insight and went straight to the author's website so I could thank her for writing what I consider nothing less than a bible for how a woman should conduct herself in a relationship. I'll have you know that she sent a kind, succinct, gracious email reply the next day...it looks like she is probably just as lovely on the inside as she is in her photo on the back cover.

It confirmed some of my notions about men. But more important, I learned a lot of information I wish I had known all my life.

She insists on readers to use manipulation (something that is denied in the book, but that's exactly what it is) to utterly confuse a man and make him so uncomfortable that he can't think straight enough to treat a woman badly. The men used as examples in this book seem pretty petty and childish themselves. I couldn't help wondering: why put yourself through the misery of mind games when it would be easier to dump this loser? I do think that the advice of being happy as an individual is important, but I also know that while a dumb jerk would fall for the silliness in this book, good guys will just leave the woman who follows the author's advice because all men are not as clueless as the books says. They know when a woman is playing games and being manipulative.

In that sense, it had more useful information.Women in general want to know why relationships stall after three months, why men seem so interested in you in the beginning and how they back-peddle six months into it to prevent it from getting too serious. This is why I liked WHY MEN MARRY BITCHES better because the information seemed far more useful."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Since I read this book--in the last year I have had two different men talk about marriage with me. There hasnt been any game playing either. I have just learn from this book how to communicate with a man in a way a man understands and become aware of when I am rewarding for things I dont like and to immediately stop. And to let a man go at HIS pursue speed. The result is these men have been loving and appreciate me.Here is something to think about: for those women that have critisized this book--saying \\"they dont play games.\\" Hows that working for you? Are the guys falling at your feet yet? If you are sitting by the phone waiting for that guy to call or return your calls or answer your emails or texts OR If the man you are in actually with is not treating you like a dream girl...then realize this (the faster the better) the \\"I dont play games\\" games you are playing to try to get his attention......are NOT working.Sherry didn't make any of this up--she interviewed tons real men for this book who gave real answers. If you really want to understand men what men really motivates a man to fall for a woman and stay in love.We all say we want men to be loving and kind and to share their \\"feelings\\" with us. If you are serious and these are the things you want....READ this book."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I wanted to read this book out of curiosity because I saw the title of this book. I almost wanted to be proven as to why men love \\"bitches\\" as the writer so says. Read through the book and made a realization that all my past girlfriends must've already read this book. This book talks about how you're really not playing games with men but really you are and advocating that if you only show enough interest and not put up with anything from a guy, a guy will actually love you and want to marry you. Seriously? This must be why the divorce rate is so high today.All my past girlfriends did these things the book suggests. From a guy's perspective who actually wants a healthy relationship for once: it gets old. Real men look for real women. Both genders have to work hard in a relationship. Relationships are all about giving and taking switching between the individuals in a couple. Relationships are all about a couple working together. It's not about playing games, making one side very demeaning in a cunning and sneaky way, etc. I've personally never had the privilege of having one healthy relationship. It's either been women leading a guy on, controlling ex-girlfriends, and a particularly sociopathic ex-girlfriend. To women reading this review, please understand that there are truly good men out there that will value you if you value them back too. Despite the popular belief that men are jerks and women are angels, many men become jerks because they've been hurt by past relationships just like you. It is just a vicious cycle.If there's anything that's good from this book, it's about giving women who had bad relationships self-confidence. It gives them the ability to walk with your head up. However, everything else this books suggests will not lead to real or healthy marriage. Switching between one gender having all the control to the other solves nothing. A woman might feel better having more control over their own lives and over a man, but then that isn't a relationship or how a real one works."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Seriously, they should be handing this book out to girls right after they have the awkward little class in middle school about getting your period. I wish I'd had this book years ago, it would have saved me a bit of heartache and TONS of wasted time. Some of it's obvious, BUT the majority of it helps you understand how men define your behavior. Like, everyone knows, \\"Don't be a door mat!\\" but this book makes you realize, \\"Wow, I just thought I was being nice!\\" when whatever action you have done is translated to a man very differently from how one of your girlfriends would have perceived it. It's a quick read too, she's funny and honest!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Why Men Love Bitches isn't about being a bitch to your man or any other man. It's about how women can take back control of their lives by just changing the way they relate to men. It's about NOT canceling dinner plans with your girlfriends when a man asks you out at the last minute. It's about not being a doormat any longer--holding your own with him and keeping your self respect.Too many women have the feeling that if they just give a man everything he asks for, he will be happy and love them more. Exactly the opposite is true. According to several men who were interviewed for the book, men like women with a little mystery, a sense of who they are, and who are not always deferring to them.So, ladies--take back your power. Have the man on YOUR terms and, according to the book, he will be coming back for more instead of writing you off as someone he can control. He WILL get bored with that \\"nice girl doormat\\"--but if you take of yourself first--he will respect that and it will make him want you even more."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This book is a great read for all women who tend to loose themselves in a relationship. It is WAY better than The Rules...which is manipulative and unsustainable. The idea that in order to keep the relationship fresh and stimulating by keeping focused on your own life--works. My guy chased me like a mad man for a very long time until I decided to settle down with him. My behavior changed at that point and I was more focused on him. And of course he immediately relaxed and stopped lavishing his attention on me. I couldn't figure out the reason for his change. Now I get it. It doesn't take a lot of effort--just shifing my focus to my life and interest, which was what I was naturally doing when I was undecided about him. My guy responds to it and I think 95% of men will to."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I wish I had read this book 20, no 30, years ago -- but it was not written then. This book is proof that feminism has come a long long way. The book emphasizes self esteem while recognizing the very practical realities of &quot;the dance&quot; in a relationship with a man. Old fashioned in powerfully modern way. Pragmatic information which has application in all aspects of female self-identity and personal strength.

The whole dreamgirl idea was done much better (and seven or eight months earlier) by Lisa Daily in &quot;Stop Getting Dumped!&quot; which in my opinion is a much better read. The empowerment aspect of this book is good, and there are some humorous parts, but it just seemed to me like a less funny, far less interesting version of &quot;Stop Getting Dumped!&quot; which I totally loved. &quot;Why men love&quot;, I'm not so crazy about.

I don't know if B*tch Buster is a brother or what, but he's right on target to in what he says. Sadly a lot of hate be going on with the sisters as of late. And as for the song No Scrubs, man that was just vicious. First off, I've been working all my life since 10 (I'm now 28). I earned a BA, took time to work and now finishing up my MA. I visited the old neighborhood this summer. All the b*tches that were into that Tlc song were lableing me a scrub because I was living with my aunt and going to school and not wasting my precious money on their dumb a$$es. Now they hear of me and my success and are like \\"Hey, hey!\\" like we were all best of friends. Like I am stupid or something. I eyed them up and down and just laughed and shook my head. Yeah, I grew up in that neighborhood but I was visiting. Yet now, those same b*tches that were mocking me for going ahead with my life are still living at home and they're closing in on 30 years of age now. Now that is what a REAL scrub is to me--just a money hungry, no good, female scrub trying to be holering at me...Yeah, well I am one of those \\"brothers\\" that likes white women. They have class for the most part. They're not anywhere as b*tchy. And they don't have an act and think that is what gets them ahead. They're not as cheap and screwing around and selling it cheap and for free and then wondering why their black men are \\"dogs.\\" It's because when a woman acts all catty and goes around town offering her butt, there'll be lots of dogs then who'll come sniffing around.Anyway, I jsut had to give my cent's worth on this becuase it hit real close to home. Anyway White Chcik, don't heed her any attention. And to my real black women and men out there, go get yourselves an education! Stop having kids out of wedlock. Don't just say--but DO!

It could have saved my marriage and saved me a great deal of heartache and messed up relationships. It explains so much about the games some men play...and how to counteract them. For example, many men want to do the pursuing and resent being pursued, they want the challenge, they don't want to be mothered or smothered. That's all common sense when you think of it, but the way she presents her arguments made me feel empowered. The book is like an advanced course in how to take care of yourself in a relationship. She points out that men reflect what we think of ourselves. That is so true.

She describes a bitch as a woman who is confident, independent and self-reliant, traits that men find sexy, attractive and intriguing. Argov portrays \\"good girls\\" as available, overly nice, accommodating and needy - characteristics men find off-putting and boring. Had this book been written 20 years ago, it would have been cutting edge, but you've probably heard the core of Argov's advice before (much of it is reminiscent of asking why a man would want a cow if he could get milk for free), from your mother and grandmother. She's just wrapped it in new rhetoric with a cute flair. Although her basic premise - men like independent, confident women with an \\"edge\\" - rings true enough, it's barely enough to fill an entire book. Argov disguises this sleight of hand with clever writing, witty one-liners, scattered \\"attraction principles,\\" humorous stories, relatable examples, large type and a lot of repetition. If you don't find the whole idea a little pass&eacute;, you'll have a good time. getAbstract recommends that you read this book in snippets whenever you need a chuckle or a shot of self-confidence as you play the catch-and-keep-a-man game. Of course, real women don't play games - as Argov would be the first to tell you."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I totally don't think this book is about being a b***h.

It is the single most amazing book I have ever read in my entire life. And I have read just about every relationship book out there.What she says makes SO much sense! I sit back and think to myself that I have been such a \\"doormat\\" through the last year or so of our relationship. Before that, I had broken up with him twice, but he still kept crawling back to me and now I know why. Because I was who I wanted to be and if he was interested in that person, great. if not, great.

My first reaction was how could someone write this??? How could someone conceive that Men loved Bitches, this makes No Sense. However, I couldn't resist opening the book and flipping through some pages. To my amazement, it was filled with a vast amount of good advice and it made alot of sense. I couldn't help but buy the book, despite the funny looks I got from my co-workers at the front desk.I am glad I bought this book, and I believe the title had to alot to do with it getting my attention. Well, first of all let me explain to you that when the author used the word Bitch, she is not referring to a rude or abrasive woman. She is referring to a woman, who is sweet yet has confidence, goals, dignity, and has a backbone. The author describes the word BITCH as Babe in Total Control of Herself.This book is filled with alot of advice to women who want have a successful relationship. I love this book and I love the author's style of writing, she has the ability to offer important advice and put a funny spin on it that will make you want to continue reading. This is a book you will read and want to come back and reread. It's worth the money.And lastly let me state this book is not about playing games with man. This is about women knowing what their worth and not overcompensating. Most importantly it explains how a balance must be established and that a relationship must one in both people(give and take).On the other hand,a relationship where only one person does all the giving,just leads to the build up of resentment, which is always proves problamatic. It about women setting up their standards, and learning that they need to love and value themselves before someone else can do that for them.

I think most men will be hard pressed to disagree--it just hits it right on the mark. Until now, men kept secrets from women and didn't share this stuff with their mate. We, as guys, do have certain ways of getting the upper hand, but to our own detriment. There's nothing sexier then a woman who can keep a guy in check. And truth be told, most men fantacize about a woman who is strong. It's more of a compliment when a guy has a strong woman interested, rather then a desperate woman. It's just funny seeing this stuff in writing with such candor. Kudos to the author, Sherry Argov. This book is really outstanding. It's the real deal."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I want to first thank Sherry Argov for writing this honest and very practical book on how to make your man change his attitude and not take you for granted. I have read many books on relationships, and this one is the only one that gives practical suggestions in plain language that you can actually understand. Not psychobabble like other books that I have tried to read and put down because I fell asleep. This book I read in one day and have been reading over and over again. Here's the 411: I am a clingy needy partner who nags and nags and nags because my man used to treat me well but all of a sudden changed almost overnight. I had no idea that what I was doing was causing him to tune me out. Men don't react to words, they react to actions. I stopped my nagging, and become a more independent person. And on top of that, have been acting like I don't care about the relationship. It has caught him off guard and now he is going out of his way to be with me and paying attention to me. The important points that I've learned from this book are; put yourself first, act as though you don't care too much about the relationship, do your own thing without him and he'll start thinking that he's losing you. Then sit back and watch him come to you and treat you better. The other thing is, you will feel better about yourself.

It was tough at first to follow the advice, because I kept wanting to try to please him.

The book is full of perceptive remarks which will ring true and valid for many a woman...BUT...the author seems to try to create a coctail between two things that don't mix, a message like that of \\"The Rules\\" along with some \\"woman's lib\\" consciousness of \\"dancing to your very own tune\\". As a result, the book is loaded with outrageous contradictions:The first two chapters are uplifting and \\"empowering\\" telling women why they should play by their own rules...but then, by Chapters 3 and 4, the message deteriorates; in chapter 3, Argov talks about what she defines as \\"women's sexual powers\\" with words like \\" the candy store\\", and women \\"exercising that power\\" by giving \\"one jujube at a time\\" and following some \\"jujube installment plan\\"...(?!) Women are not seen as creatures with their very own desires, but just as \\"owners of that which men want\\" with the whole point being in instructing them in how to \\"trade it\\" better...how could that possibly be called \\"empowering\\"?..Isn't that the oldest trick in the book?Then, in chapter 4, there is a further deterioration, where the \\"empowered woman\\" of the first two chapters, proud owner of THE candy store in the third, is asked to act like a \\"dumb fox\\", and the entire chapter is about how she must PRETEND to be something she is not, and to play a DIFFERENT set of tricks in order to caress man's \\"poor fragile ego\\" and make him feel on top, while she tries to get her way with sneaky tactics.....that stuff \\"empowering\\"?!.....Then, the book moves on to the upbeat \\"dance to your tune\\" and \\"be your own woman\\" bit again...Then, throughout the book, men are constantly portrayed in an unflattering light that you can't help but wonder \\"why the trouble?\\" The unmistakable impression is either of jerks who think they are smart and whom Argov is teaching us how to \\"dupe\\"...alternately that of \\"wolves in disguise\\" and this is some \\"101 de-wolfing course\\" for the little red riding hoods of the world... and, while \\"instructing\\" women how-to tricks for the \\"taming\\" of men, repeating that the taming process does not stop, there seems to be no belief whatsoever in any inherent goodness that could possibly exist in men, but that such goodness could only come as a result of women's skill at \\"moulding\\" them, with a bit of manipulation here, calculation there, sneaky games here, sexual blackmail there...etc..etc..And while women are told to calculate and manipulate, they are simultaneously told to \\"define themselves from within\\" , and to \\"follow their inner calling\\" while at the self same time \\"making the right impression\\"..That is where the book falters...the two just don't go together, at least not in any sane, balanced individual, and any attempts to convince otherwise is a bluff! Maybe a witty and funny bluff like this book, but a BLUFF nontheless!For women who need a recipee to ensnare a man at all costs, as long as these women feel \\"cool\\" with a relationship founded on never-ending manipulation, as long as these women have no problem pretending to be one person then a complete other at different stages of \\"the game\\", as long as they don't mind putting their wits and energy into such a feat on a ongoing basis, and living from the outside in, constantly looking at themselves, checking and calculating that they are making the right impression....if these women don't mind all that, well, this book may well be their manifesto."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Here's an interesting nuts & bolts dating book that people are going to be talking about a lot. Overall, this is a very impressive piece of work and probably the best of its kind (getting a man to fall in love with more respect and passion). For the woman looking for a more tactical approach to dating, this is your cup of tea.\\"Why Men Love B!tches\\" does a great job of advising women on how to maintain more respect and dignity in their romantic relationships and gain the love of a man as a result. Her 100 Attraction Principles are extremely well thought out and offer the reader a great deal to chew on.Not only does she have great principles, her book is loaded with interesting features like sample scenarios (The Spontaneous Guy Who Is Treating You Like a Backup vs. The Spontaneous Guy Who Adores You), \\"She says/He says\\" tables, and \\"The Nice Girl vs. The B!tch\\" comparisons.My favorite principle of Sherry's is: Before sex a man isn't thinking clearly and a woman is thinking clearly. After sex, it reverses. The man is thinking clearly and the woman isn't.Another good one is: Anytime a woman competes with another woman, she demeans herself.And for good measure: Act like a prize and you'll turn him into a believer.There are 97 more of these and all of them have something insightful to say regarding earning respect, maintaining dignity, being independent, gaining self-confidence, using humor effectively, the allure of feistiness, getting satisfying sex, creating a challenge, stirring up his desire, ending female neediness, getting rid of nagging, the effectiveness of action instead of words, and much, much more.For \\"nice women\\" who have been treated as a doormat and don't know why, here's a book with virtually \\"all the answers.\\" It is also written in a very humorous tone with examples from popular movies and personal stories of the author and her friends.I also highly recommend \\"Why Men Love B!tches\\" for anyone who wants to recapture the passion and respect of the male partner who's gone romantically dormant.The Bottom Line: This book gives the reader the \\"tactical edge\\" on many key love situations and is a fun read that women around the country are going to enjoy talking about. (Maybe even New York City's Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte, and Amanda!)"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I wrote a review for this book over two years ago when I first met my ex boyfriend. I have always been the kind of person who tries way to hard to please other people. There is nothing wrong with being loving and kind, but if you don't learn to develop a backbone in life, you are going to have a rough road with everyone you encounter.When I first met my ex boyfriend, I followed the advice in the book, and things were great. Actually, better than great. He treated me like a princess, and even told me he had never felt so strong about someone so quickly. This lasted for several months until something happened: I fell in love with him, and lost myself in the process.It's completely natural to feel insecure when we realize that we love someone and they have the possibility to hurt us, but I let that fear rule me. I lost my confidence, and completely changed. I made it known that I wanted a future way to quickly. I even questioned him as to why he wasn't talking about it. Basically, I killed the romance for him. And to get it back on track, I started nagging, which changed everything so much that we now have broken up.So how do I know this book is true? Everytime I applied the principles to my relationship, things were great and everytime I lost my confidence, things changed. Most importantly, by ex boyfriend told me flat out that he wanted to be the one to initiate talks about the future and he wanted to be the one to do the pursuing. He also told me that talking about our relationship constantly took the fun out of it. He also said the less I nagged him about seeing me, the more he wanted to because it didn't feel like an obligation. He said he just wanted ease and lightheartedness, not so much seriousness and talk about where things are going constantly. Basically, time and time again, his honesty matched up to Sherry's thoughts exactly.My ex boyfriend told me that I was one of his best friends, and that he doesn't want to lose me out of his life ,but now that he's thinking about marriage, he just doesn't think it would work with us. Sadly, had I had more faith in myself that I would be okay with or without him, things probably would have gone very well. I really can't blame anyone but myself. He even told me that I am smart, beautiful, and awesome. He told me I just need to be more confident next time and let things unfold naturally, rather than try to force them along.I am deeply sad right now that my relationship ended, but I have also learned a lot as a result. This book is wonderful, and if you really learn from it, it will change your life for the better. Confidence and self-respect are the best things anyone can have. With them, all of your most important relationships will thrive.Next time, I will DEFINITELY follow this advice. It worked amazingly well before, and when I fell off the beaten path, things blew up in my face. As much as some people want to put this book down, saying that \\"real\\" men and \\"real\\" women don't need to do these things to have great relationships, I couldn't disagree more.My ex boyfriend was and is a wonderful person, but he is also a human being. Anytime you make it known that you feel inferior and you lay all your cards on the table immediately, it is human nature that someone will take advantage of that. Probably, if the tables were turned and he acted insecure and let it be known he had nothing to lose, I wouldn't have valued him as much either. He did value himself, and I placed a higher value on him as a result. I initially valued myself and he adored me, but he grew unsure of me once I questioned my own worth. And he should have. How can you believe in someone if they don't believe in who they are?This book is awesome and I have lent it to everyone I know, who all couldn't agree more with the advice. Even my male friends are in total agreement. If you follow the advice, you can't go wrong.I thank Sherry for being strong enough to write books like this that give us the reality check some many of us desperately need."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This is a really helpful book, but something is missing, and that something is being yourself completely. This book did help me! I would recommend reading it, and there are other books that I recommend as well. Just remember to be yourself, and don't play games - that is the part of this book that needed to be revised, otherwise, it has some great advice."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"at first i thought i don't even want to buy a book with this title. what if someone sees me reading it...but i quickly got over that after flipping through some of the pages and seeing some of the common mistakes i've made. as a black woman a lot of the advice she gives is some of the stuff i've heard from my mother (who's been married to my daddy for 30 yrs) but with so many sources (magazines, talks shows, friends, self help books, church, etc) telling you what to do to get a guy to act right it's just confusing. don't let the title fool you...this is a funny book that is dead on about how to get a guy to treat you the way you want to be treated through your own smart choices."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Men are hardwired for the hunt and for battle, and oh yeah have penises too. That means: if you give it to him he loses interest; showing weakness could mean death so he will never show his cards and neither should you; and the constant struggle to be in control is exhausting and he secretly longs for a woman who has the upper hand.So the only way to succeed with men (get what you want) - is to beat them at their own game, which basically means that for the rest of your life you have to PLAY HARD TO GETAnd not just to get a guy but to keep him too! Yes, girls, the rest of your life is one long relentless, 24-hour-a-day PLAYING HARD TO GET maneuver. OK, maybe I'm an NGID (NICE GIRL IN DENIAL) and I just dont want to hear it.But why is the message to women always some form of: \\"the better we can fake it and pretend to be something we are not, the better we'll do?\\" And in practice how do you simultaneously not put up with [anything] and also be \\"attractive\\"?...by smiling and stroking them, then pulling away mysteriously, that's what she keeps recommending. So I should treat my boyfriend like some kind of dog that will do my bidding if I communicate total superiority combined with simple obedience training.Don't get me wrong, I think Sherry Argov has given us essential and truthful info here, I reccommend it to all females. In the context of humans of both sexes as predators it makes sense but I take issue with the fact that it's not about strategy it's about DIGNITY. I just read the book and may come around to her way of thinking but at first reading I don't find her prescription at all \\"dignified\\", and I think her advice needs to be taken with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"THIS IS AN ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL BOOK! I just ordered it from Amazon after reading it in Barnes and Nobles for free. Its a must have for every woman's bookcase. It is hilarious but direct and informative at the same time. NO FLUFF HERE. It addresses concepts that all women should know - the bitch isnt mean - she just self protective and puts herself first, nagging doesnt help - no contact does - the man should not be number 1 in your life - you should find hobbies and love them- and being the \\"mother\\" vs being the lover. Its not just a book for the beginning stages it gives advice on what to do when you are being taken for granted mid way through. I am going through my own rough patch in a relationship where I started out the bitch and got every thing I wanted and then regressed to focusing on HIM. This book has knocked the sense back into me as will to you. And it will help you deal with men in a much more efficient way. Dont be the \\"nice girl\\" - its not a good thing! Good luck!!!!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"When I first scrambled upon this book back in September, i thought to myself \\"is this lady joking\\". I mean, what could a woman tell me about men? Well, let me tell you, she told me a lot. I must admit that I was always the type to go around catering to my man, buying him extra things, cooking for him, cleaning for him and getting nothing back in return. I didn't realize until after I read this book that what I was doing was all wrong.Instead of my kind actions turning these men on, it was now turning them off. They were now viewing me as a motherly figure and let's face it, who has sexy thoughts about their mom. So after reading this book, I began implementing a lot of her techniques. I didn't call my boyfriend constantly, and guess what; he called me all the time. I didn't cook for him and found myself getting taken out most of the time. I did not ask my man where he was or who he was with but I would get a call from him telling me exactly what he was doing. I didn't stop my whole life when he called; instead i told him that i would see him when my schedule permitted.This book really does work. I would highly recommend this book and am looking forward to her next book Why Men Marry Bitches."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Some of the reviewers seem to believe that this book is recommending that women fake orgasms, which is not what it's recommending at all.The page (pg.70) with the orgasm parody is just that--meant as a joke. The next page states \\"I don't recommend that women fake an orgasm. This little lesson is a satire on the pressures women feel to perform.\\"\\"The bitch is far less likely to put on a 'cartoon' show. She is much more honest. She asks for what she wants. If he doesn't do it right, she won't encourage him by giving him disingenuous feedback. Yet then he doesn't learn how to please her, and that won't work because the bitch rightly cares about her own pleasure.\\" The author contends that men get off on seeing a women truly enjoying herself and that \\"half of pleasing him is getting off yourself, not faking it.\\" (So true...)So no, the book is not flawed with a 'faking-it' recommendation. So go slow, be honest, tell him what you like. You'll get there."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This book says what many many other say, basically that a girl should play hard to get, to make the guy wait, etc etc. I think where all those books go wrong is to assume that there is pretty much only one type of girl, one type of guy, and one type of relationship. Argov means well, because all the recommendations in the book will work, and she's right to say girls shouldn't let their guard down too soon. After having read this, though, I can spot a \\"bitch\\" girl a mile away. I'd just prefer that a girl be straight-up rather than play some stupid transparent game, as if I don't notice what's going on. Another problem one will notice if one reads serious books on relationships is how the verbal messages don't coincide with the girls' nonverbal behaviour, which causes problems all the time in relationships. If people want to really learn about relationships & communication they should take a course on those topics, like I (a sensitive guy) did or study some serious books on them by authors such as Sharon Brehm, Mark Knapp, Ronald Adler, etc. Books like \\"Why Men Love Bitches\\" are roughly the equivalent of getting relationship advice from television, so you can expect similar results I think. Another problem I have with these sort of books is that they're written on the assumption that all \\"nice\\" girls are roughly the same, the guys are roughly the same and the same formula can be used on all guys, with the same result. (obviously the real world doesn't work this way)"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This book is so right on the money. As a woman in her mid-twenties who's had her fair share of relationships and dates, this little piece of literature is like a revelation to me. A friend of mine recommended this to me years ago when I was in a less than great relationship, but of course, I was skeptical like many of you. I used to think if you were nice to a guy and went out of your way for him, he'd say \\"Wow, she' a really great girl.\\" and fall in love. Oh, how wrong I was! I've had nothing but men take me for granted and break my heart despite the fact that I'm an attractive, sweet, smart girl who comes from a great family. I love the section on the mama/ho complex! I used to be the \\"mama\\" with my last ex-boyfriend and Sherry was right, he did take me for granted. The Faking an orgasm page had me laughing to the point of tears and I'm glad that she addresses the fears and insecurities that women have in saying NO because we are pretty much programmed to be people pleasers and that's how you end up getting drained. I'm in awe of the people giving this book negative( mostly men who are just mad that somebody put them on blast!) reviews and I find it hard to believe that they read the whole book cover to cover because if they did, they would know that the author doesn't use the word \\"bitch\\" in a literal sense, she means it in a tongue in cheek way. Women who are assertive and non-docile are usually called the infamous b word, as she states in one of the first pages of the book and the faking an orgasm section was meant to be a satire. A little common sense will tell you which parts are humorous and which parts are serious.I really cannot believe how naive some of you are. \\"I don't wanna play games!\\" I hear women say. So, you'd rather sit by the phone, run out to his house at all hours of the night when he calls, give up the panties in a hurry, slave over a hot stove for hours cooking him a meal, cancel plans to be with him, buy him expensive presents, I could go on and on. When us women find a guy who makes us swoon, we lose our usually sensible minds, and start going all out to be around him and we're so entangled in the high of our infatuation that we don't realize that we are giving too much too soon of ourselves and then when the guy dumps us, we feel pissed off because we invested so much and we cannot believe that he just walked out on us/cheated on us/took us for granted, etc. Us as women need to be looking out for ourselves because the most important relationship you have is with yourself. MAKE MEN WORK FOR YOU! Make HIM go out of his way for you, Make him earn sex, Make him have to figure you out, Make him invest in you. If he's working hard for your affections over time then you can reciprocate by slaving over that hot stove, throwing on that lacy thing from Victoria's Secret and giving him the best sex ever because then you know he will value it because he worked for it. There's nothing wrong with being a little mysterious and making a man earn your trust and affection. That's not playing games, that's called having standards and not being desperate!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I saw many good and bad reviews on this book, and otherself help books for women (like \\"The Rules\\"). And I agree with both sides. I have been burned myself - who hasnt. What this and many other self-help books teach women is to realize what they are doing. As women, we have a tendency to cling, to become needy, to serve, to nurture, to take care, to do everything for somebody else, to completely disolve in other person. This is especially evident when a woman has a baby and I believe is nature's way to provide nurturing environment for the newborn. This is a very natural reaction for a woman, she wants to disolve in another person because of how she feels toward that person, however she has a certain expectation when she does it. That the other person will love her back, will care for her and appreciate her. What she doesn't understand is that the men psychology is WAY different. They find themselves suffocating in this relationship and go aloof due to needing space. They also start trying to rationalize the woman's behavior, and often come up with understanding that she is a little crazy, or insecure. The woman feels him distancing, starts to feel abandoned, rejected, hurt, and tries to fix it by trying to get closer to him, scaring him off in the process even more. It's a cycle that needs to be broken! By a woman!This is where a book like this comes in handy. All you got to do is go get a life! Go do other things! Whatever they are! Stop putting him on a pedestal, no matter how much you love him. Give him some space and leave him alone no matter how bad you want to be with him. As soon as you get busy doing your own things, you will notice him missing you. And, no, don't be a bitch to him. When he misses you - you two can figure out when to spend time together. Just don't drop all your activities for him, cause then you will end up in the same place - completely all over him. Just remember that his needs are not your needs. He can't meet all your needs. You have to do that yourself. Stop putting pressure on him. Live a complete, fulfilled life whether he is there or not. And when you are fulfilled, you are happy. And he will want to be with you because you are happy!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"When I started reading this book, I thought that maybe it was not for me. Maybe I am already a bitch... I value myself and I would never put up with some of the situations the author describes as a no-no in her book. But as you progress towards the end of the book you start identifying with so many patterns that it is scary to think it might have been your fault the last time a relationship did not work! So, we value ourselves a lot in the beginning of a relationship, and then we get dangerously involved... is this our fault or the jerk's?What got me questioning this book is the fact that it is not worth getting involved with someone who won't love you for who you are. I am sorry, but pretending I am someone else for the rest of my life is not my idea of happiness! Instead, I prefer to push away those guys that love to hunt. My purpose in life is not to make some jerk's life challenging and fun.The mistake in this book is to sell the idea that you can transform a jerk into a prince by following simple rules of behaviour. People don't change, they grow, and that takes precious years that you may want to spend with someone else instead! Someone who has already grown up, perhaps? It's not that hard to find (and I recognize I am talking about men here)!The fact is, you can transform a jerk into a prince temporarily, and most likely in the beginning of the relationship while he is still trying to impress you... but he will return to his jerky way of being as soon as you marry him, so why bother?This book is all the way worth it, but has to be read with a critical eye. Instead of transforming that jerk into a prince, follow the author's advice to drive all the jerks away.

Do onto others as you would have them do unto you. I've dated several women who were like this and dropped them very quickly. This book is absolutely ludicrous."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Guys, this is a great book to read for no other reason than it will help you strengthen your game and read what other women are reading about us. Find out if you are unwittingly giving yourself away with unsaid cues and learn what women are looking for in men, especially what they are wanting men to be looking for in women. Versatility is the name of the game in playing the game, and reading up on your prey and what drives them psychologically will definitely give you an advantage. Learn of their desires, their needs, and how to placate and play to the sense of independence of the \\"strong woman.\\"Sharpen you skills by learning more on how your taget thinks and know how to better present yourself in the manner that such women are looking to find in a man."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"If you're considering any of these types of books, this author's two should definitely be on your list. They all basically say the same thing, in my mind -- to keep your own life and not sacrifice it for any relationship, stay busy, don't chase men, etc -- but Sherry Argov is just a fantastic writer. Unlike The Rules, which are not particularly entertaining, her two, Why Men Love Bitches, and Why Men Marry Bitches, are both just great, very readable, entertaining + packed full of fascinating details about men and how they operate. These two delve into more detail than The Rules seem to. And give specifics about how you can operate most efficiently while dating men, to make yourself and your dates happiest.I way highly recommend her two books. Buy them both, they're quick reads, and chock full of really great information from males and about dating them. Details about how you can operate to achieve a relationship that holds you in high regard, how you can hold your date in high regard, a win-win.And they're funny too. Really great."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This book straightened me out. It breaks it down so that women \\"get it.\\" Get it for every woman you know--they'll love you for it!!!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I placed my review in the 5 star rating so that my message might reach more people.Please before purchasing this book, ask yourself these 2 questions... 1. Is the best way to be assertive to be a bitch? 2. Is 'getting a man' the best reason for developing assertiveness?Think about it, please. As a female, you are a part of a community of women in a larger sense, it is hard for me to believe that true empowerment comes from changing yourself into a bitch.Also, most likely if you are looking at a book to 'improve' yourself and get on the dating scene, you probably have some kind of motivation and energy which can be channeled into something more positive and sustaining of your real self and some part of you probably is ready to get into the dating scene. How about instead of rushing it or trying to change yourself, you slow down, look at what you want in life and breathe (easier said than done, but possible). You may want to surround yourself with other people who are supportive of you and the things you are going for/value in life, so maybe try to switch up the people you hang around or the places you go to try to support yourself. If you are looking for tips on slowing down and taking life in, I'd recommend some Jon Kabat-Zinn, like 'Wherever you go, There you are' http://www.clcumary.com/?p=442&fb;_source=messageOverall, I hope that you are able to raise consciousness as to what you are putting into your life as you are reading whether you decide to go with this book or not."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This book is fantastic!

I suggest that all women read this book..because MEN have not changed their stripes and that is all I will say, our advantage in reading this book as I have learned in all of 1 day is to make sure that we can manipulate the situations that they try to put us in and that we are using our minds not our hearts all the time I am doing this b/c I want to and not because I want you to like me we need them to not always be in CONTROL as JANET JACKSON would say and that we do not allow a man to take us for a RIDE without the Fuel we need as Women!...especially the way gas prices are today. That was to be humorous, however make no mistake a MAN needs you to be a woman and when I say a WOMAN he does not a PUSHOVER!---He needs a woman that will stand up for herself and walk the walk with him and talk back to him!...Just read the book today and don't wait!....There is no reason you will have to read another book!---This book is the KEY TO A SUCCESSFUL,LONG,HAPPY and HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP WITH A MAN AND HE BE YOUR EQUAL AND THE RELATIONSHIP IS NOT ALWAYS ONE-SIDED."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This book is great for helping women see their own value.

Then I happened upon \\"Why men...\\" and read it all in one night. The next time I saw my boyfriend (later that week) there was a noticeable shift in attention (it was coming MY way) just because of my new attitude. The day after that date, he called so frequently I actually thought \\"Pest!\\" Less than a week after I read this gem of a book, he called to tell me about a bumper sticker he just saw that said \\"BITCH: Babe in Total Control of Herself\\". I thanked him for the report; hung up; did a happy dance.I wish Ms. Argov had sometimes been more specific in identifying ways out of the hole we've dug for ourselves. Overall, the book however is about an attitude shift and specifics aren't always necessary.I am recommending it to all my sister \\"doormats\\" out there who are bone tired of trying to find the answer to relationship magic.

All of my friends have jumped on the \\"bitch\\" bandwagon. I highly suggest this book for any single woman out there that is wondering why they can't maintain healthy relationships. You'll find that as you read the book, you are very anxious to try out some of the methods mentioned. They WORK!!This is not a man bashing book! This book is about making yourself feel good so you are confident enough to date without being needy. Great buy!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I'm reminded of the proverb: People tend to seek out the kind of advice they wanted to hear to begin with.So: This book says SO much more about the American woman of today than about what men want or will respond well to.Gives 100 principles (you can read them in the Amazon preview), so it's almost impossible that none of them would be good, although those few are then contradicted by the main thrust, i.e.:1) A man wants a woman who loves sex. (However the book advises to withold it, then offer it only sporadically and then fake orgasms.)2) A man wants to feel that he is protecting a woman, and by appreciating him for making you \\"feel safe\\" then you are stimulating his desire for a serious relationship. (She doesn't say it that clearly.) But 95% of her other recommendations repulse a man's protective instinct and, if he's a guy with options, tell him to move on to someone who does (God forbid!) actually seem to \\"need him\\" more.Constant self-contradictions... it's \\"not about playing games,\\" oh, good! Except the rest of the book is about how to play games, but apparently the author covers herself from that criticism because she explicitly denies it.One principle is that if a man \\"has to wait\\" to have sex he will find you more beautiful and if he has to wait he will eventually \\"become your girlfriend without knowing it.\\"In 2010 America I can't imagine this working on anyone except guys who think that women who like sex are all \\"sluts,\\" \\"luckily\\" for readers there seem to be a fair number of guys like that.Here's a thought, maybe you could give him reasons to stay around beyond the fact that you are \\"difficult\\"?Like...How about having fun together the way friends do? If you think you can have a successful marriage with someone without being able to enjoy just being friends sometimes then you are in for serious disappointment. In fact that \\"friendship test\\" is a much better criteria for if you want to get serious/physical with someone than is the \\"how far can I manipulate him with this\\" test.How about KINDNESS? Wanting to help him feel better about his life and himself. Encouraging him to be the man you want (which should be kind above all) by showing appreciation for when he is. (The author's take on encouragement is to fake home repair situations that he can \\"feel like a man\\" fixing, and if he can't do it to make him feel inferior by getting a \\"real man\\" to do it. WT*?)Somehow the author equates kindness (\\"nice girls\\") only with taking abuse. Based on anecdotal evidence from myself and other men I know, sincere warmth / kindness is the key difference to if a woman is perceived as more than one-night stand material.Of course most men are not good at this either, but ultimately kind is attractive to kind, and \\"BITCH\\" (no matter how you spin the acronym) attracts the male equivalent.This book describes plausible (though unenjoyable) ways to get a medium-term relationship with a very emotionally disturbed and commitment phobic \\"man\\" who is interested only in challenges and not women who genuinely like him (because he probably doesn't like himself and therefore can't respect any woman who does).Good luck basing a marriage on this, on finding a soul mate who will grow old with you, build a family together, take care of you in your most difficult moments, love you unconditionally and with all your imperfections visible, etc.Again, I'm so bummed this book is a best-seller, makes me so VERY glad that I'm already married to a kind, sweet woman who brings out the best in me instead of exploiting me for her own feelings of control and one-upsmanship... then again, with so many men today wanting to become players and \\"pick-up artists\\" I guess you all totally deserve each other."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This book is basically a catty manual for women with low self-esteem who don't know how to communicate their wants and needs when in a healthy relationship. It gives advice on how to sneakily manipulate a situation to your advantage, rather than telling you how to best fix it in a manner that both people in a relationship can understand and are okay with.An example from the book: your boyfriend is too lazy to fix something around the house. The author recommends that you get another man to do it, so that your boyfriend feels threatened enough to do it and jumps to the task. Rather than, say.. telling your boyfriend that you find it disrespectful that he won't help out and asking him again to do it for you, so that way he actually understands why his girlfriend is upset and knows to have more respect in the future.Yes, the women outlined in this book really are b*tches. They are playing mindgames in order to gain attention from their spouses. Instead of being honest about how they feel, they are being taught that the only way to handle a situation is to pretend you don't care, or to be mean about it, or to ignore it altogether until he crumbles at the knees in confusion, hurt and defeated. That's not okay and it's a recipe for disaster.Of course, the author makes it look like it's okay to abuse a man's emotions because so what? They're all jerks anyway, right? No. And that's the entire mindset projected in this book. It's practically spilling off the pages.Men are not mindreaders, and they're not perfect. They need to be told when something is wrong, instead of tricked into fixing it without ever knowing what was wrong or why. Women should not have to be vindictive and passive-aggressive to get their relationships to work/their boyfriends to care about them.Basically, everything in this book is unhealthy and teaches all the wrong lessons.. a \\"dreamgirl\\" is not a b*tch who plays with people's emotions. A \\"dreamgirl\\" is a woman who can be honest, peaceful, and open; yet knows how to stand up for herself in the right way - which is with truth and confidence. REAL confidence, not just a display or a fake attempt at \\"holding their own,\\" whatever that means. Unless you want to end up getting divorced, I'd highly recommend not following any of the \\"advice\\" this woman spews."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Why Men Love Bitches is amazing!

This language is rather offputting because there are a lot of truly unethical and nasty people in the world who really deserve to be called \\"bitches\\", and truly decent people who deserve the title \\"nice\\", but what the author calls \\"nice\\" is really someone who is just nice because she wants something, and what she calls \\"bitches\\" are just those who are not phoney. I think the author is just trying to be diplomatic (and/or make some money) by calling phoney people \\"nice\\", and their opposites must be \\"bitches\\", then. The language really should change so as not to offend those who do not deserve it.But then again, there are all kinds of people in this world, and I can only think of two people I have known in my entire life, who fit her \\"nice\\" description. One was a teenage friend of mine, who would say \\"how high?\\" when her boyfriend said \\"jump\\". But she was a teenager, and teenagers often will do anything to continue dating. I don't think she was being a phoney, just young and inexperienced. The second person was a coworker of mine, who seemed desperate for everyone to like her. She called mere acquaintances \\"darlings\\",laying it on real thick, and wore ultra-revealing clothes, yet, few people seemed to like her, and plenty of people mistrusted her, and she wondered why.

I was interested in a good relationship but no matter how much I did (I did my best all the time!), it never worked for a long time. I had learnt that if I was a good girl, someone would love me and appreciate my efforts and my good qualities. However, I found out that I was too busy finding out if my partner accepted me instead of thinking about becoming more self-confident.One day a friend of mine brought me this book and I couldn't stop reading it. The author has described all typical situations between a man and a nice girl. Now I understand what when wrong all the time and I feel so much stronger!If a woman is worried that she will be alone, that she NEEDS love otherwise she can't live, she will choose someone that can at least keep her a little company. She may feel he is not the right one, but she will stay with him all the same. In this case, even the author's tricks won't work! I used to talk too much and be too helpful. Now I try to think more about myself and help myself. There's enough to do!Ok, in one chapter, the author describes men in a way that wasn't really nice. But, all in all, I find that women can live better, if they read the book. Women are so proud about all the things they can make by themselves, two things or more at the same time etc. But in this way all they get is stress and someone who takes it for granted. I no longer do so many things for others at home. I accept all kind of help :-)My daugher is clever and self-confident, I've always admired her. However, this summer she fell in love and all of a sudden...she was a nice girl as the one I used to be. She waited for 'his' calls and letters, she was desperate if he didn't call, she would have done everything for him. I was worried. She wasn't the same anymore and she was beginning to give up her hobbies and remain in her room. Then I gave her the book by Sherry Argov. She has found her dignity again. Even if she doesn't use all the 'tricks', she has understood that it is important to live one's own life, to never forget about oneself. I'm so happy!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I enjoy this book but at the end I realize what this women was basically saying. The things we would have to do in this book would indicate who is really interested at us. We are basically creating a barrier to see who is really interested in dating and having relationships with us."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This is a fantastic book for those that are doormats and don't know it! I am a Libra with a Libra ascendant-I was born to be nice and please everyone.I also seemed to attract men with very strong personalities that are described in this book-they always have a \\"me first\\" attitude.It is not bad to be nice or want to please others, but it becomes a serious problem when you begin to loose yourself in the process! This book shows several ways we women sabatoge ourselves in relationships trying to make the other happy at our expense-and I am embarassed that I did all of the No-Nos in this book. That was a wake up call for me and I will forever be grateful for Argov to present this in a clear straightforward way! It taught me that, whatever happens in a relationship, I will always be ok because I would take care of myself-I would be in control of myself.Indeed, you show others how to treat you. Argov mentions that men don't \\"get it\\" when you simply explain what is wrong. They need proof from you-you showing that you won't tolerate something or that you are not happy about an aspect of your relationship. I believe that many women simply don't understand this because they are working from their emotional centers, not the logical one that men are. This is the reason why the women who is with the man she wants to marry, but is not changing his immature ways ultimately never gets what she wants because she chooses to stay with him. He is thinking \\"If things are so bad, why is she still with me?\\". He therefore sees no reason to change!Indeed, some of the advice Argov mentions is exageratted, but that is to get the readers attention and to snap them out of their man pleasing ways. Adjust the advice to your particular situation. Don't go practicing her advice in a gun ho fashion. I wish that the author would make that clearer for the readers. Use discernment folks.I also want to say that some of the \\"men\\" that would do these things are actually little boys.The men described in this book are the opposite of gentlemen and really, have no respect for women. Although I will get treated the way that I deserve using that advice in this book, I wonder if that is a person I would want to pursue a relationship with in the first place. I would like to believe that at some point, after you have been a \\"bitch\\" for a while, the man actually develops some genuine caring/loving feelings for you and THAT stops him from doing anything disrespectful or hurtful to you-because he is listening to his HEART.So women, you can really win with this book. You won't allow a jerk to treat you badly, but you will also come to a point that you KNOW that person isn't with you because of his heart. Know when to walk away as Argov suggests.I also wish that the author would have stressed to be yourself. Use the advice as ways to IMPROVE yourself, not become somebody you are not. For some women, I understand that you really have to fake it to make it, and that is ok, but over time you should grow into a woman who incorporates the advice in an effortless way with confidence."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"thank you for writing a book that MAKES SENSE and that i can apply to my life. now i understand. i've always been the type wanting to please, but that never gets you anywhere. since i've read this book, i see my mistake(s) and am now living like a \\"bitch\\" and watching as all the boys flock my way. i feel enlightened and free of all that dead weight and guilt sitting on my shoulders whenever i'd do something wrong. i've got a new state of mind and it's not changing. :D"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This book brings a new healthy meaning to the word 'bitch.'

She had read it and said that it was well written and had a comedic value to it so I downloaded the preview to my Kindle. After reading the preview, I purchased the entire book and sat down for an evening of what I thought would be a great read.The first 1/3 of the book is entertaining. It does have some good advice but was nothing that I hadn't already implemented or heard before. The enormous fault that I find with the book is toward the end, it starts to compare men to things like your dog and that you should treat them the same way. It turns condescending and I couldn't finish the last couple of chapters because of it. As the book says, there is a difference being a full blown irritating bitch and a bitch that a man loves. Unfortunately the author writes like the bitch a man loves in the beginning but turns toward the end."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I love this book, I had a low self-esteem and this helped me big time, I know now to always urself first before anything because you are in control of your life and only you can make it fun or not.

I just had to throw in that the part that keeps speaking to me and makes me smile almost daily is when she points out that the guy does NOT have a monopoly on the rent in the thoughts in your head (she's speaking to over obsessing and over analyzing everything like the girls always do)....he does NOT have Boardwalk and he most certainly does NOT have Park Place....he has one of those cheap little purple spaces in the corner. HA....I live by this now..LOVED THIS BOOK!!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This book is not really about being a \\"bitch\\"; it's about *not* being a doormat (see subtitle). Sherry's message is to value yourself, and to let your behavior flow naturally out of that. So many women, single and married alike, will bend over backwards for a man, put up with rude and inconsiderate behavior, and act like he is the center of her world. A woman who values herself--a \\"bitch\\"--doesn't live like that, which means her man will value her more. Sherry wants women to \\"get a life,\\" stop catering to men, and let themselves be pursued. And she writes with a great sense of humor! Much of the book is tongue-in-cheek, like the \\"recipes,\\" and she encourages readers to have a sense of humor as well. My favorite part is about a booty call, that a woman who leaves in the middle of the night to go see a man is only missing one thing: a sign on the top of her car that reads, \\"We Deliver\\"! This book is a fun read. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars, because 5 has to be life-changing for me. This isn't life-changing but it is definitely excellent. I also highly recommend \\"The Nice Girl Syndrome\\" by Beverly Engel. You'll want to read both books more than once."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This is the BEST book on relationships I've ever read. I wish it was written 30 years ago. I made most of the mistakes Sherry writes about. If this book was around I could have saved myself a lot of heartache. I flipped through one of my co-worker's copies and went right home and ordered both her books. I read it over a rainy weekend, and couldn't put the book down. Buy a copy for yourself, your best friend and your Daughter."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I am not at all surprised over the controversy and the somewhat laughable spectacle this book has generated among readers. D. Leon has made some good points, but I felt they were over generalized and some are just plain, flat out wrong (no attack meant here D. Leon if you're reading this. She asked for a \\"fine gentleman\\" to explain why men dump \\"sweet girls\\" for the proverbial b*tch. Well, I don't know what her definition of a \\"fine gentleman\\" is but I do get up for little old women (and men) to give up my seat on the train. But even though my moma might have raised me right, I am far from being a \\"nice guy,\\" who like the \\"nice girl,\\" as D. Leon alleges, get treated poorly and taken for granted.I personally have never seen any man dump a sweet girl for the \\"b*tch\\" type. What I have seen, sad to say, is a guy who's cheated on the good, \\"nice girl\\" with the \\" bad girl\\" type. But I never saw him leave the good type for the bad type. Why he did it? The sex. It was just sex. Not for a relationship. And as much as good women reading this would be angry, it says equally as much about the good girls who seek these \\"bad boy\\" types and take them back at the end.Why women do that is what I would like to know. Yes, these guys are rakes, and yes they are worthless and unworthy of a good woman. But these women want these guys. It's like these women need to \\"tame\\" them to have some approval of womanhood bestowed on them. It's a form of vanity, when you get down to it, for if this woman can tame that bad boy, and have him wanting her and no one else, what volumes that must speak about her as a woman, no? Or as these women just plain desperate and so fearful of being alone. What is it?Well, I don't know. Yeah, I am one of those nice guys who although loves sex and lots of it, would not cheat. I like romance. I like treating a woman nice. To lots of women hearing this, they picture some fat, bald guy, but I'm not and an ex-jock in his late 20's now. In my experience, when you keep the romance on later in the relationship women take it for granted, or worse start to think you're covering something up out of a guilty conscious. It's like you can't win. And although no push over, I'm just no bad boy type. It's a lame game and I would not want those women interested in those \\"men.\\"So where does this leave us with good women wanting bad men, good men feeling and often being the last guys finishing, and bad men and bad women just using everyone? It's to laugh at if it weren't so sad at times. But you know, sometimes, good people do find one another and actually, amazingly, when it seems like all the odds are against it, fall in love. It's rare and it happens and a beautiful thing.I'm not maudlin and sentimental. I'm realistic. I'm a good guy but a pain at times. I'm high strung, a type-A personality, who gets by frequently less than 6 hours a night and works until 2AM and up early. I'm a neat freak and perfectionist type. Women see this in someone like me and think they have to be perfect. I don't suffer from this need. For I recognize I am far from perfect and know, despite some women wanting to convey otherwise, they are not either. And I like that. All the weird idiosyncrasies, peculiarities, the private things they wouldn't want anyone else to see or know about them. But you women are just plain nuts. You complain about men pushing you out, but you never really let your own self out. And sometimes, you play this front so long that it genuinely seems you don't know who you are and how to be, or just plain be yourself in those private, quiet moments. It's practiced, often has an agenda, or so confined with self-consciousness that it's completely devoid of real, genuine intimacy.Women are all too often living more in a fantasy romance world, where everything has to be perfect though. In it they're perfect. The men are perfect. Their lives are perfect. No arguments. No disagreements. No problems. The sex is spectacular every time. The world stops in its track. It's nirvana on earth. Then they live in the real world. Suddenly, their not that perfect and feel men are judging them, comparing them to that ideal in their fantasy. Or he is not that ideal. An argument or disagreement is now cause for a sudden reevaluation of the relationship, for it means paradise has been lost. But then again, it couldn't have been paradise to start. And the women who exhibit this more than any woman is the b*tch type. Perhaps that is why so many men sleep with them but never really commit to them.But as for leaving a sweet loving woman for the b*tch? Never. Nor would I \\"jump through hoops\\" for a b*tch let alone sleep with one. And no real man would either."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"The reason most women find this book exciting, is because the psychology used in this book is what attracts women to men and keeps them interested.It does NOT work the other way around, not for the long term at least. Its a completely different set of emotional priciples that keep men hanging in there for the long haul.Playing aloof to the guy who finally sets your heart on fire, is a sure way to put that fire out. Not to mention all the wonderful emotional thrills you would lose out on, which is reason to be in a relationship in the first place.The only reason to get this book is if:1) You are a total doormat.2) You want a guy to be your doormat, in which case you need to find a total wimp. But ask yourself is this the kind of guy who pulls your heartstrings?3) You want to have an open realtionship (seeing other people outside of the realtionship).So be Bitch at your own risk---you may well lose your soul mate when you finally meet him."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I seriously hope this book is written and designed to be taken as comedy and not a self-help book. Any one who uses this as the foundation for her relationship is begging for ruin. I'm happily married and for some unknown reason a relative handed it to me with the words \\"i think you'd enjoy this\\" to this day i'm still unsure of how to take that. It urges women to manipulate men they are interested in, act snobbish, lazy and often just plain rude. I read some of the parts to my husband who agreed it's an extreme. Of course who don't want to act like an obsessive doormat, but being a controling seemingly uninterested b-tch isn't any better. It also casts men in a very negitive light. Of course there are always going to be jerks in the word, but there are alot of good guys out there too, if you take this book to heart you'd come away thinking all men want is sex, sex, food, more sex. According to this book, no man wants to get married, have children or anything above a one night stand.Men, if you see your lady reading this book, RUN.Women, if you are reading this book, take what it says lightly and with many many grains of salt."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Thank you Sherry! This is one of the best books I have read about relationships with men. In fact, I wish I had read this book 20 years ago. This should be the official guide for all women (all ages) adventuring into the dating world. The younger you read this book the greater your chances of succeeding in your relationships with men.I am the typical nice girl. I am driven by emotions and when I meet a guy I like I see him as \\"the one\\" until proven otherwise. Therefore I automatically feel that I must give my 100% to that person. The problem with this approach is that giving your 100% too early in the relationship will make him feel as if he had it too easy and will make him go away looking for a better challenge. This book describes in a very simple and funny way something that we instinctively knew but couldn't put our finger on: These fantastic and interesting creatures called men are, very succinctly, \\"hunters\\" looking for their match... therefore women need to be the smart \\"strategist\\" prey.I always wondered why relationships with the guys I liked never worked out while the guys I was not interested in were always chasing me. After reading this book it is clear that the reason was ME. It was amazing reading some of the examples about the typical mistakes women make that will kill the sparks on a relationship. More than one time it felt like I was reading my own diary...Depressing. It made me feel stupid and ignorant but at the same time it opened my eyes.One note of caution: I have read some reviews stating that not all men are like the ones portrayed in this book, like if this book were about \\"jerks\\". This book is not about how \\"bad\\" men are or how \\"good\\" and mistreated girls are. I am pretty sure we all agree that inherent evil has nothing to do with sex. This book is about helping you understand basic rules of human nature and principles of relationships between sexes based on the fact that men and women are different and \\"think\\" differently. This book will give you the tools that you need in order to understand how men think and perceive your actions from their vantage point so you can make yours and your partner's dating experience more interesting and enduring"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"My fiance and I hit a really rough patch. He was acting annoyed by my pressence, stopped wanting to be intimate and seemed tense and upset all the time.So I made the \\"nice girl\\" mistake by trying to be perfect for him -- cooking these huge, elaborate, expensive dinners, making sure the house was spotless, buying him little presents, etc. Nothing worked. I was convinced he had fallen out of love with me or was cheating.Out of desperation, I went to the bookstore and grabbed a stack of relationship books hoping for some insight. One of the ones I came across was, \\"Why Men Love Bitches\\".I read the chapter on nagging and realized that I complained A LOT to my fiance about EVERYTHING over and over again. I saw myself in that chapter and learned how I was pushing him away and nagging makes a woman come across as needy and unappealing. Also, the author explained that nagging is ineffective with both men and women because it makes the person being nagged feel like the nagger is trying to control themI bought the book and immediately followed the advice of that chapter. I took my nagging from a 10 to a .5 and gave my fiance a little space. I also stopped sweating the small stuff, like how normally I'd go off on him for leaving his boots in the bathroomThe next day, my fiance did most of the things I normally nagged him about without asking (ie: making the bed, washing dishes, feeding the dog). Then, he came home from work early for the first time in a month and cooked me dinner.We were intimate twice the following night (HE intiated it for once, not me!) and his whole attitude toward me is more like it used to be when we first started dating.So yeah, this book may have a flaw or two in some people's eyes, but to me it's what you make of it. I think the best thing to do is read it and motify the advice to fit your particular situation. Thats what I did and it has been working great for me."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"What I liked the most of this book is that it describes what really happens in the day to day basis, and it happens to any woman, no matter race, age, social status.

WMLB has always been able to bring me back to my \\"core\\" so-to-speak; with simple examples. I remember just trying one small example from the book just to see if it worked; It did for me Every time....This book has helped me to respond to men in a way that works. I have always responded the way I would want a man to respond to me.... And you know what? I have always felt something was wrong with that, but didn't know why?WMLB is my indespensable reference for constantly showing me where my focus should be when I get bogged down in a relationship.

As modern women we have taken control of our own careers, our finances, even our reproduction. So why is it that we seem to have lost the control over our romances and our relationships that our grandmothers and great grand mothers had?While the name, \\"Why Men Love Bitches,\\" may seem rather harsh, the book is a well written primer in understanding behavior and correcting the errors that most women make. This is not a \\"how to make a man fall in love with you in 30 days\\" guide or a rule book. But rather, highlights the fact that the very things that most modern men find so appealing in women, their independence, their decisiveness, their ambitions and goals, and their own experiences seem to be the first things that we toss out the window as soon as we start a relationship.

While the subject matter is indeed overused, Sherry Argov has an earnest, more honest approach to help empower women not to lose their own identities in relationships. She does not advise women to be \\"bitches\\" in the classic sense -- rather she advises women to stand up for themselves and to not be afraid of having their opinions and views, even when said things differ from that of their partners. I agree with some of the readers here about the author generalizing men, but sometimes generalization is the only way to get a point across. This was an entertaining book to read.

I always wondered why after coming to my home for a dinner prepared by me, most of the men i dated, (whether I slept with them or not) - would lose interest. I was too much like their \\"mom\\" or a motherly type. Asking them if they needed anything else and buying them their favorite drinks, and so forth. Not making that mistake again!!Also, I do treat an ex-boyfriend (I lost interest in) with kind of an aloof demeanor as the book states we should do (I was already doing it). And he keeps buying me gifts or inviting me to dinner/lunch/offering to make me food. I spent 6 months of my life with him trying to get him to notice me. Then when I ignore him - he just keeps trying to impress me.

I believe that every woman could benefit from reading it and gain some insights.There are many authors who have attempted to bring across some of points presented in this book, but have for the most part botched them up and in their presentations missed the mark.This book is very sound and the advice is healthy, both in relation to women and in relation to men.After all happy and mutually fulfilling and respectful relationships are not based on neediness, but on each party contributing and sharing the gifts they bring into the relationship. Both needy and abrasive behaviors point to some kind of insecurity and inadequacy the woman has within. Self-assured woman, a woman who has a fulfilling life even without a man, doesn't have anything to prove or do for the sake of approval. She also doesn't feel like a martyr. She shares herself out of her choice and for the sake of mutual enjoyment. She never has to do what she doesn't feel comfortable doing. That doesn't mean that she is selfish or that she takes advantage of a man in any way, but rather that sharing is respectful and reciprocal. There is no permanent happiness in any relationship without some kind of a balanced exchange of energy, with both parties wanting to share their gifts and contributions, rather than feel in any way forced to do so.Way to go Sherry! Thank you for writing the book!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I recommend reading this book just because in my experience of dating, it is a not fun dating after 30. I have found that men do play these games and they know that women in the 30-40 age group are looking for not just fun in a relationship, but also some stability and family life. It seems that if you are nice to them that you are &quot;needy&quot; and therefore look for the woman that is not so &quot;nice&quot;. I don't want to be this way completely, but I am after getting my heartbroken and being told the &quot;you are beautiful and such a nice person, you will have no problem finding someone.&quot; I have everything I thought a man would want in a woman (minus the family trust fund)and I enjoy being very giving, however the book makes a very good point of having men earn this wonderful character in women. You don't have to be this way for the rest of your life (you are really protecting your heart and feelings, also learning there is life without men involved), but it is a good way to know if the man you are involved with is really serious with you. If he is not, it doesn't sting so bad because of learning to not be dependant on his company. I do also agree with the reader who said that &quot;he got tired of chasing&quot;. This book does give good insight and helpful advice. I'm understanding about being a friend to a man and not his servant, groupie or mother.

It is important in any relationship to know how to stand your ground, how to maintain your boundaries and not be taken for granted. In my friends, I have seen many good relationships fall apart because one of the partners started taking the other for granted. Sometimes, to keep the spark alive, and keep the other person from falling asleep, you have to use a little Machiavellian strategy, which is where this book comes in.

Or, should I say, to get control into their dating or relationship life. Though many of those pointers seem to have potential to work sometimes, they will not work with every man. I think they work more with men who are immature and where they are headed in a relationship.Dating is not an exact science. I think that instead the author should focus more on teaching women how to take care of themselves and gain control of their emotions in order to be emotionally stable. Women can play all the games they want, but if they are not emotionally healthy, they will never be fully satisfied with their relationship. Playing games takes people out of their skins and into umcomfortable territory. The book \\"Facing Our Skeletons\\" gave some very useful outlook on how important it is for women to focus on themselves instead of playing \\"head games\\" with the men and be at their best while waiting for Mr. Right."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I was frustrated with a previous failed relationship when I bought this book and as I started to read it, I felt empowered again and thought I'd conquered my feelings of failure in love, etc. I was ready for the next one to come along and couldn't wait to try these techniques. As you know it, he did come along and I was more smitten than I expected to be. He was very much into me and there was amazing chemistry. I found myself wanting to let my guard down, however I thought if I followed some of these techniques, I could save myself from potential heartache and \\"nice girl\\" no no's (as it talks about in the book) etc... and it worked for the first month like a charm, he called me all of the time, began to open-up to me and always wanted to see me. However, not long after that, he eventually got tired of chasing me and disappeared. I was heart broken and knew deep inside I made a big mistake... there is a limit to everything. He wanted more of me as a person and I didn't want to trust it. I was crazy about him and realized had I only been myself; open and responsive, honest and not playing games.. he may not have left the way he did or at all. Be careful when reading this book... I followed it closely with common sense, however a little too closely and lost what may have been a potentially wonderful relationship. Read this for fun as it is a funny read and there are some places that are helpful, however don't take it literally. Just be yourself... men can sense fakeness and don't like begging after a woman... just know what you want and trust your own instincts, please!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I needed to hear this advice about a year and a half ago, when I was doing all the nice girl/doormat behavior. It would have made dating a lot more enjoyable. Now that I'm in a relationship (and have been for a year and a half), the advice is not quite as valuable as before.I love how the author holds you accountable for your dignity. You should never be trampled on; never be misused. With my last boyfriend, this book would have probably earned at least a modicum of respect. Of COURSE you shouldn't give up your hobbies to be with a man, or your friends or your family or your life, but it happens so NATURALLY for so many women. Men apparently bluff better, and their \\"take it or leave it attitude\\" frightens so many of us. This book is for those women. I am occasionally still that woman, which is why I bought it now.However, I disagree with some tactics she recommends, especially the entire \\"Dumb Like A Fox\\" chapter. If your man is such a caveman that he really needs this ego stroking and helpless-girl manipulation, then is it worth having him? If so, by all means, follow these guidelines. I tried changing my usual brief \\"thanks,\\" after reading this chapter to a swooning, \\"Oh, you are SUCH a clever man! How can you DO this?\\" And I felt like an idiot, because it was an insult to his dignity, and he realized it. I am glad she has such tips as always remembering you are a catch, always remembering to \\"treat yourself like a prize,\\" because I still need these reminders, but take some of her advice with a grain of salt, because no matter how she sugar coats it, it still often boils down to manipulation."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This book saved me from crossing the line AGAIN! I always start out good in relationships (6 months) and then I become clingy and wonder why the guys run. I now have an understanding of how they think, I have to continue to be hunted less I become boring and predictable. I highly recommend this book, I read it in 2 days and thankfully my boyfriend was away while I devoured it. It has been working like a charm!!!! THANK YOU!I am waiting on the next book...."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I was dating a woman who all of the sudden starting acting like she didn't care, that she just wasn't interested. I responded the way book said I would. The problem was that I actually cared about her, so when she seemed upset or uninterested I attempted to correct the situation. I guess this taught her a lesson - Act like a B*itch and get what you want. That didn't last long at all. A week went by and She finally got around to calling me to inquire as to why I hadn't called her. I told her politely and honestly that she seemed uninterested and I didn't enjoy spending time with her anymore, she just seemed to have no respect for me and was acting rather childish. Another week went by and she called to confess this book (which led me here), and to apologize. She was sorry and wanted things to \\"go back to the way they were\\". Too little, too late, too bad. She just proved herself to be selfish and manipulative (not to mention stupid for believing this crap). You can learn not to be selfish and manipulative, but you can't cure stupid. I told her it was deceitful behavior on the same level as lying. That if there were a problem with our relationship and she wasn't getting what she wanted, then she should have talked to me about it. We could have tried to work things out and if it was unworkable, we could try again or part ways civilly.Treating a man like crap as a means of conning him into getting what you want, is exactly what kind of foundation for a serious relationship?I told her that she succeeded in changing me, that was for sure. I went from someone who cared about her to someone that didn't give a damn.So in the spirit of making money by destroying relationships, I'll offer some advice.When the person you're in a relationship with enjoys your company and attempts to spend time with you - Act uninterested or b*tch your way into doing something you know for a fact he isn't going to enjoy. Since he cares about you and wants you to be happy he'll do it, but keep doing this until he realizes that you really aren't interested and really are a B*tch. That way you can buy my self-help book about dealing with loneliness and depression.That'll be $19.95."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This book is not a man-bashing book. In fact, because of what I learned in this book, I am now happily married to one of the kindest, most honest, loving, funny, intelligent men I've ever met.I dated my last boyfriend for 3 years. We were on again, off again. He was aloof while we were together, forcing me to put in most of the effort. After I read \\"Why Men Love Bitches\\" I realized he was taking advantage of me because I was \\"too nice.\\" Unfortunately this was a pattern I'd repeated 2 times before. I broke the pattern then and there.In addition to re-evaluating my current relationship, the book helped me determine what I should be looking for in a mate. It was then that I looked at an old friend of mine with new eyes. What a shocker to find out that the guy I'd been friends with for 10 years possessed all the things I was looking for. I'm now married to and deeply in love with my best friend.I have read this book twice, given it to four ladies I know, and all of us agree it has changed our perspective on relationships. The book is easy to read, funny and insightful. Some of the items are things we already know as women but are good reminders. Yet there are some genuine nuggets here that could change your life. Whether you're just dating or married for years, there is something for everyone. Even Men!What's different about this book is that it's not full of platitudes or meaningless psycho-babble. She actually gives you real examples of how to enact the things you've learned. They work too! It's not about playing games with men, it's about dealing with men on their own mental turf.The crux is this: when you're a \\"nice\\" girl, you are often not respected and get taken advantage of. The author isn't saying you have to be a bitch or mean. She is using the word \\"bitch\\" as a synonym with \\"possessing self-esteem\\". Basically you must have respect for yourself or no one will. Now this same theory holds true for \\"nice\\" men too. If you give everything you've got, leaving nothing for yourselves, you lose the respect of your mate. In other words, as a former boyfriend once said, \\"You can't respect someone who kisses your ass\\". And that's why we're \\"Former\\".Give it a chance. The best 10-dollar investment I've ever made. Good luck."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I read your book Why Men Love Bitches and it's the best book that I've ever read -- because it's practical! I've been such a nice girl, and not really understanding why my relationships weren't working out, when really I had everything I needed by just being myself. I've got men now turning their heads because I am a strong woman, but I also realize when a man IS NOT RIGHT for me too. I find that I'm more confident now, I speak up for myself and I don't let anyone put me down. I look out for Number One, and that's me. I can't wait for your new book to come out \\"why men marry bitches\\".I wish that we (both women AND men) had more books out there like yours because you are truly an example of what a woman ought to act like. There are too many women who act like girls and it's embarassing to me and the female gender! It's so sad and if there is one thing that we can change in America, it's to educate women about being themselves and foregoing all of those superficial cosmo magazines and dumb advice.It's time that we spread the word that women put themselves first.

My girlfriends and I all have the book and live by the suggestions that the book has to offer. My friends are a mix of singles and married women. All of us have found the book helpful and useful. I am in a relationship with a man and he has completely turned around now that I have stopped being the \\"doormat\\". As the book suggests, you have to be real and not play games but just realize that it is ok to be an independant women and to have your own life. Men really do respect that and they will give to you emotionally more than you could have ever dreamed. I never could have turned my current relationship around without this book.

Basically, guys will like you but, you will no longer be \\"you\\" but this complex creature who will have predetermined reactions for every situation. Half way through the book, the author has gotten her point across millions of time, she contradicts herself in every chapter, telling you not to be his servant, nevertheless you should never complain for his mess in the house, letting him do whatever he wants, etc. She repeats herself trying to write a book out of a single thought. I would not recommend this book to anybody, it is merely a waste of time in something that can be said in one page."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Chapter 2: Why men prefer bitches.Hey bitch, we don't. Stop suggesting women are either promiscuous or bitches just because you were promiscuous and no one gave a crap about you.Chapter 3: The Candy store- how to make the most of your feminine and sexual powers. Why don't you just say how to manipulate men with the use of your vagina. This kind of crap is just what women don't need to hear. Ever stop to think that just because this works in the short term that it is responsible for major problems long term?Chapter 4: Dumb like a fox- How to convince him he's in control while you run the show. So your great advice for building a relationship is to purposely be deceptive and an intentional exterior idiot. Great advice.Chapter 7: The other team's secret playbook- Fifteen things that turn men off. OH you have got to be kidding me. How about chapters 1-6 where you explain how to be a worthless vagina? That's 6 right there. (sub-chapter) - Ten ways to tell whether a man is in love. How the hell would he really know? You've just told women how to be anything BUT their real person. Even if he is in love he is in love with a facade. God you suck.It's this kind of book that sends me into a blind rage, I mean really. This is the crap that they feed women. This is the most unhelpful and relationship ruining crap I've ever read. Any book that tries to change a person in order to fulfill a relationship is fundamentally flawed. YOU CAN NOT CHANGE PEOPLE.

It also gives helpful insight into why a man doesn't appreciate a woman who gives him everything. However, to go as far as the author advises would push many men away. After a period of time, a relationship should be a 50-50 partnership, and the author doesn't recognize this. What woman wants to play these \\"hard-to-get\\" games for the rest of her life?

I haven't been in many relationships and I often wondered why mine ended diasterously when I thought I was being a good woman to my man and doing all the right things. This book was an eye opener for me. We've all heard of \\"the rules\\", but Sherry Argrove is right on point in her book when she says it's not playing games, it's about taking control of your life and not allowing a man to have a 100 percent hold on you.

I wish this book would have been written years ago when I first started dating. I have recommended it to every woman I know...married or single. Get this book! You won't be sorry.I am in a situation right now with someone where I want more from the relationship and I have pretty much done everything that Sherry says NOT to do. Luckily I ran across this book just in time and it woke me up. I realized I have been a big fat doormat in this situation and in past dating situations but now I have the self-confidence to get what I want or move on. After all, why would I want a man who doesn't want me just as much?One of my favorite chapters was the one where the woman plays the \\"dumb fox\\" - basically it's about letting the man THINK he has the power but you are controlling the puppet strings all along.After reading this book, I feel empowered. The book does not try to analyze men like other books, instead it gives practical advice on how to change your behavior simply by getting a life and putting less focus on the man. Men are \\"three-year-olds\\" trapped in adult bodies so when they don't get the attention they expect, they will go to any length to get it. Suddenly, you become desirable and mysterious and that drives them nuts! Also like a typical three-year-old, a man will try and get away with as much as he can...this book tells you how to stop that cycle before it starts.As the book says, \\"Give him a piece of the pie, not the whole thing.\\" Not only is this book highly educational and empowering, it is absolutely hilarious. Sherry writes with a fun sarcastic tone and her points come across loud and clear.THANK YOU SHERRY!!!!! KEEP WRITING!"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I agreed with many points of \\"Why Men Love Bitches,\\" so I generously gave it a 2-star rating.Helpful points:1) Remember your self-worth.2) Maintain your dignity.3) Never tolerate disrespect from a man.4) Never fake an orgasm.5) Be yourself.6) Do not overcompensate for feelings of inferiority by catering and giving too much to a man, especially in the first stages of non-exclusive dating.7) Do not follow the \\"sex on the third date\\" rule, as guys who follow this and pressure a woman for it usually want a hit and run.8) Allow time for personal hobbies, activities, work, etc. Never let the (non-emergency) needs of a man come before your own to the point that you are not physically taking care of yourself.9) Dump a guy who always makes you pay for dates or tries to get you to loan money.10) Allow the guy to make the first move in terms of contact, and don't make yourself too available, waiting for his call.11) Do not nag or smother him.12) Do not over-cater to him for things he is capable of doing himself (e.g. finding silverware).13) Do not \\"mommy\\" him by telling him obvious things to remember in regards to things he can do himself.14) Compliment your man and always appreciate the kind gestures he does for you.15) He doesn't need to know personal information about you, such as the exact number of people you slept with before him, so politely refuse to answer.16) Do not give too much until he proves himself as someone who will appreciate you and reciprocate.17) Do not be a doormat.18) Do not tell everything about yourself all at once.19) Use humor to lighten the mood (this book has some humorous lines here and there).However, there were many points of this book that I did not agree with because I felt they sent a negative, unhealthy message. When I first started reading the book, it seemed positive and uplifting: something that could never be flamed by a rational person who believes in equality of value between both sexes and avoiding abuse from the opposite sex. Now I realize why this book has received many negative reviews.Harmful points:1) Do not discuss your feelings and talk to a man like a fellow man, not like a woman.2) Although it is okay to show you are emotionally capable, stable, and self-reliant, do not show you are capable of physical tasks such as fixing up things around the house, or else it will emasculate him and lead to him being lazy.3) Act \\"dumb\\" and become aloof/distant when he does something you don't like, instead of having a frank conversation starting with \\"I feel hurt by this action you did because...\\"4) Assume every man has a three-year-old inside, and he will \\"test your boundaries\\" as to what you, a.k.a. \\"mommy,\\" will allow, and if you act disinterested and aloof when he misbehaves, he will run back to you.5) Assume all men will have the tendency to be emotionally manipulative/abusive/distant to you BECAUSE THEY CAN, and it is YOUR DUTY to keep it in check by following this book.6) When he does something for you, don't just compliment him, do it in a patronizing, insincere, exaggerated manner.7) When he does something nice and messes it up badly, hire someone to fix it and lie to him about it.8) Lie to him about the maid coming to the house more than once a month to avoid conflict and make him feel \\"manly,\\" so you don't have to broach the impossible topic of his not helping out with the chores around the house.9) Make him feel like the Grand Poo-Bah, but always \\"put him in his place\\" if he is disrespectful.10) Pretend to know how not to cook, because he will never take you out to dinner (voluntarily) otherwise.11) You must keep playing these games to keep him.12) Set up fake \\"problem\\" situations for him to fix (so he feels \\"manly\\"). For example, turn off the circuit breaker switch and act scared.13) Close your eyes during the scary part of a horror movie, even if that's not your personality.14) Passive-aggressively bring up things that bother you through \\"humor.\\"It is important to note that a lot of the tips from my \\"harmful\\" list contradict her \\"girl power\\" and \\"be yourself\\" statements. These points were damaging for me, as they advocated insincerity, game-playing, and deceit. As a victim of emotional and physical abuse from a few previous boyfriends, the last thing I need to read from an \\"expert\\" is that any man will try to play me, drain me dry, and give me caregiver burnout if he can get away with it. Why would I even want to date men, if that is the case? I would be deeply offended if someone wrote a book like this about women, and I am offended for the decent men out there the author conveniently does not mention. One quote from a man said that he checks out other, not-so-beautiful women just to make his girlfriend insecure. What kind of a decent person does this? Why would this author advocate \\"catching\\" a man like this?There are so many better relationship books out there. I'm all for maintaining mystery and spacing out contact so that familiarity does not breed contempt, but this is insane. I would be so miserable trying to cover up my true self with a sneaky, \\"bitchy\\" exterior.Do not buy this if you are seriously looking for dating advice."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Sherry hit it just right.

I can't wait to try out Sherry Argov's tips."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I read this book after numerous online recommendations and having a brief look at the reviews on Amazon (and a few other sites). The only reason it's a four is due to the extreme situations where people have followed it so meticulously that they wonder why things went wrong. Otherwise it's such an eye-opener for me. While reading it I cringed inwardly and outwardly at all the things I read almost mentally checked every box on the 'nice girl' list that gets treated as a doormat. For those who are considering the negatives, just know and be aware not to take the book as it is, but apply its underlying concepts to you; it's only a guideline, not the be-all-and-ends-all to relationship happiness. So don't blame the author if you yourself chose to take the book the wrong way.I find the negative reviews quite ironic and almost funny when they slag off at how 'incorrect' Sherry is in her extreme depictions of us. We are not 'stereotypical', we cry in outrage, but so many males read this and groan out loud or chuckle at \\"how true\\" the perceptions are. So many people read this and say Sherry is too \\"extreme\\" and how they tried some techniques and it drove the guy away. Honestly, don't treat this book as the bible which dictates your entire relationship. It doesn't even treat itself as such - in fact - it even says \\"don't take the advice of others\\" in one of the latter chapters.This book is so much more than knowing how to \\"play the game\\". As other reviews have said, it goes that step deeper, talks on the same channel as how men think - those people who say its common sense and stupid; or how they've tried it and the guy lost interest - evidently you played too hard to get and didn't 'apply the concept' to your own life. There is no set manual in life and relationships, it's true. You can't rely on other people's experiences and past to dictate your own relationship, then blame the author for being wrong. The book is written as an insight of many, and you should be able and open enough to treat it as such, not focus on the nitty gritty details like how she contradicts herself in some specific little detail. Get real. There is no one method to 'win', and for those who are looking for ways to get the rich guy, you're missing the entire point of the book.For those who say it's too \\"manipulative\\" - how one can't constantly \\"play games\\" throughout the entire relationship. Get off your high horse. This is life. You might want to step outside your bubble and have a look, its not just relationships and 'playing hard to get', it happens all day, every day, in all your social relationships. You think that by \\"being nice\\" you are not manipulative? Seriously. One can argue that the nice ones are just as manipulative - that they are nice because they want people to view them as nice kind-hearted people. Some negative reviewers commented how 'manipulative' it was to change behaviour to interest men. Hello marketing? What are women doing all the time? Not just women, men. We dress to impress. We want people to have a good impression of us so we dress accordinly. Which is, by the way, another form of manipulation - sorry. Magazines tell ladies how to 'get the guy' by dressing in this season's \\"HOT NEW LOOK\\", which only exemplifies to women how she can only be attractive to a man through her appearance. So she dresses up to hook the guy - same thing. Only we don't argue with the popular magazine, we accept it as the truth. From these 'experts' who are usually women.Women often head to the magazines and 'relationship advice' columns which are unfortunately - written by women. Guys I've asked only cringe when they think of the 'perfect girls your man will love!\\". It's really almost like we're brainwashed into thinking that men like what we want them to like. But who better to ask than males themselves. And I say this from the male reviewers who I looked out for to see if they identified with the situations and perceptions - most did - as wells as ones I had asked. We whinge, cry, complain to get what we want; in the beginning its fine but I've seen long term, it's done nothing. I guess its time for a change.How ironic that all these people who say it's so evil to trick the guy, when everyone does it subconsciously - it just is marketed as acceptable. When we go for a job interview, it's the ones that take into account the culture of the company that make the cut; not the ones that don't care - impressions count, whether we want to believe it or not. So get off your high horses because there's nothing wrong with wanting people to be attracted to us or like us for who we are - which Sherry does splendidly by the way - it's so motivational for women to and so hard for us to accept and like us for ourselves - media portrayal of what is 'sexy' or not. So thank you.Anyway. Bottom line: Incredibly motivational and helps you appreciate you for being yourself; and from the signs so far, that edge IS incredibly hot and attractive; just don't overdo it. As a note, I refrained from texting for a night: and bingo, two sms in the morning. I was so shocked I nearly grinned in giddiness. Just don't go too far ladies. And recognise the more 'extreme' examples as what they are, its true not all people are the same. Not all men or women are that stereotypical, well be smart enough to make it fit to your own rules, like she says - dictate the rules and don't let this book dictate how you act. I loved it :)"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I have a penis. And I can't stand working with bitches, let alone dating one.The ideas put forth in this book are so far from my own experiences and thoughts as a guy that reading I wondered if she was describing an alien species. I don't understand how people can write books about the other gender with a good consciousness. If women are so interested in reading a book about how men behave and think, I suggest asking their male friends or reading books on dating written by men. At the end of the day, while men are generally different from women, when it comes to relationships we all want the same thing:LoveRespectFriendshipExcitementCommitmentHonestyHumorOf course, it's hard to sell books when the \\"rules\\" fall down to your basic Kindergarten \\"Golden Rule\\". I dated a girl who listened to this type of nonsense. And the relationship fizzled out after I realized she was playing games with dates and answering the phone. I just stopped calling her. A few weeks later I ran into her and after our awkward conversation she called me up and asked why I had stopped calling her. I told her the truth.I mean, maybe guys do play games. But if we do...then we still win if our girlfriends are playing the same game with these rules. I pursue women who excite and interest me. I'm interested in personality, profession, education, and confidence. If I pursue somebody who appears not interested I leave them alone and go for somebody else.Overall I thought the book would be great for people who just got out of a nasty relationship. Build up your self esteem and take responsibility for your actions. However, you aren't ready for a real relationship until you feel comfortable making concessions and compromises for the sake of said relationship. I know that I would never be in the great relationship I am now were she or I to listen to the junk advice in this book."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"The title may seem kitschy, but don't be fooled -lots of intelligent advice in this book that extend far beyond just what men like (or don't)."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I loved this book because if gives real life situations on how men think when it comes down to dating.

THERE ARE SO MANY \\"TRUTHS\\" IN THE BOOK. WHEN I READ IT, IT ALL MADE SO MUCH SENSE TO ME, I GUESS SOMETIMES IT JUST HELPS TO SEE THINGS IN PRINT.MEN ARE SO COMPLICATED SOMETIMES, & THIS BOOK IS A GREAT DICTIONARY TO UNDERSTANDING THEM. SOME OF MY FRIENDS EVEN CALL THIS THEIR \\"BIBLE.\\"IF MEN COULD JUST BE HONEST & STRAIGHT FORWARD, WE WOULD NOT NEED THIS BOOK....BUT, THIS IS A BOOK THAT WILL BE AROUND FOR A LONG TIME TO COME."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I believe this book is a MUST read, especially if you have been hurt in the past by \\"jerks\\" and are in need of some wake up call, however, I do not fully abide by everything Sherry Argov suggests to woman to follow this sort of advice word by word. It has great advice on some levels but some of it, it's a little over the top. For example, the whole \\"maintain your space don't let him know relationships are your goal\\", I know that many man find woman more desirable if the pressure is off in wanting a relationship especially right from the start. however, I like to point out if woman fail to state from the beginning, what is it that you really ultimately want in a partner and fail to recognize what you expect from him, he would do just that!!!The last chapter, however, is the key component to any type of relationship because after all that is what life is about, is not about clinging to your partner all the time is about loving, respecting yourself as a person so that any man/woman can respect you as well. I know so many woman who diss their girls, cancel plans, exclude themselves out of reality just to be with their partner. Even if their partner allows them to have a life of their own woman make their new partners the center of their existence AND guess what? When he is gone, they are devastated!! They feel that because they did sooooooo much, dedicated time and effort they weren't gonna be left behind. Sherry Argov suggest how to hold your OWN relationship (if you don't already have one) how to be an independent woman so that man see you as an equal and how all those special things you want to do for them hold it off until they have EARN IT. How to not go out of your way the extra mile especially if he has not step up to the plate and shown you what he really is made of because believe me they are man out there if your let yourself be treated like a doormat he will walk all over you!Books like this are written for a reason, to put stupidity on check, even the nice guys too. They are so many brothers who consider themselves gentleman nice type of guys yet they still play games on their woman all the time. Don't get me wrong they are some brothers out there who keep it real in knowing what they want right upfront but that is exactly, Sherry's \\"exception to the rule\\", the one who aint playing the \\"usual\\" games that most of our man do. I don't mean to get religious but man of this \\"world\\" will be wicked, it is what it is.I ultimately, strongly believe Sherry Argov meant to wake up the ones who try toooo hard to please man all the time and at the end they get dump and FAST. This is sort of a wake up call for the dependent types. And for the rest of us who know best not to let a man walk all over us, it is reassuring us we are doing the right thing. For guys of course it is going to be maddening for this sort of advice to be publish especially if they\`re out there playing games, expecting things to run their way, you know typical \\"macho\\" society.\\"Why man love Bitches\\" gives woman how to have a voice of their own. A lot of woman go along to get along thinking that's the right thing to do. Especially in today's society where most of our woman have grown up without a father figure or if we see our mother's tolerating unacceptable behavior from our father's, just to have a man in their lives. Is simply not right and it has to stop!My only advice read the book, don't try too hard, if you find yourself NOT the exception to the rule, RUN! And if you do, embrace him."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Some people, men and women alike, were put off by the tongue in cheek title which Sherry Argov uses in describing the women whom men love as \\"Bitches.\\" Don't let that stop you from picking up and reading this book as well as her follow up,Why Men Marry Bitches: A Woman's Guide to Winning Her Man's Heart.

I am 27 years old and I have never been able to sustain a relationship for any considerable amount of time in my whole life. I had always assumed that the problem had nothing to do with me, but it had everything to do with the guys I were dating. I don't even know what made me order this book, but I did and was completely amazed. I realized for the first time that the problem did indeed have to do with me. I WAS the too nice girl. I was the one that always I felt I had to over accommondate. I was always the one feeling like I was being taken for granted and in the end giving too much of myself with nothing in return. This book opened my eyes to things that I had never known about myself. It pointed out my flaws and once I stopped feeling hurt, I took the author's advice and feel more empowered then ever. I am currently see a new guy and I am putting ever rule into play. This time I promised myself that I would get what I want out of this relationship or there will be no relationship at all.

It is about becoming a strong, independent woman and taking care of YOU! Novel concept, huh? Most of our parents taught us to be accomodating to our mate, to be the perfect hostess, cook, maid, etc. But we have to realize this was long before women had careers and identities of our own. Too many of us have worn ourselves thin trying to meet an expectation of the \\"perfect woman\\" without realizing that men don't necessarily want it that easy!

I heartily reccommend Albert J. Bernstein's _Emotional Vampires,dealing with people who drain you dry_ as one of the best, if not the best study of different personality types and precisely how they make your life miserable. Read Bernstein, and compare your partner(s) with the behavioral checklist. Are you drawn to narcissists, passive-aggressives, histrionics, or paranoids ? Learn to identify these types before they contaminate your life and learn how to defend yourself against them. Men DON'T love bitches. Not successful, intelligent, emotionally healthy men. Men don't like being manipulated, bullied, or symbolically castrated. If you think you can rescue your relationships with a facile, one dimensional model of personal interaction, you will be setting yourself up for and endless round of lifeless, loveless control games that will eventually leave you exhausted, disgusted and broke. \\"Holding Your Own\\" means knowing exactly what you are dealing with, and having precise responses.

I realize the title and writing is sensationalized in order to sell lots of books and make the author a nice pile of royalty checks, is this really an advancement in relationships between the sexes?I wanted to give it one star, but I realize, if you want to play a game along the lines recommmended in this book, you can manipulate another human being and keep them in a relationship. But my question is--if you have to resort to such tactics, and if the other person is willing to continuously submit to such tactics, what kind of long-term relationship are you hoping to achieve? Like I posted about another ill-fated book of advice on modern marriage, if I were a divorce lawyer, I'd be sending out complimentary copies of this book all across my locale with my name and number affixed to the front cover, and just wait five years.There is a world of difference between being an assertive, confident, self-realized woman (or man) emotionally and mentally capable of making an enriching relationship fit into a modern life, and resorting to guerilla tactics in order to accomplish what many would consider an altruistic goal.As I posted regarding another women's book in a similar vein, the test in these books is to reverse the pronouns, and read this book as if it were an advice book for men, postulating the same code of conduct, except for men. If the book doesn't sound as tantalizing or promising when read this way, but instead sounds knuckle-headed and manipulative, the question isn't why you aren't being more assertive, more confident, more willing to have an interdependent relationship and still respect yourself and your chosen partner--the question is, why after all these years of feminism and social \\"advances,\\" are you still hiding behind internal feelings of inadequacy, inferiority, and only thinly-veiled hostility towards men on an individual basis?Be the person that can be loved and respected and valued, THEN (and this is very essential) find a man who can complement and value these traits in yourself. And yes, I've read the reviewers here who talk about the men they've had to live with and put up with. Question is, did you HAVE to put up with them? Is your bad experience going to continue to result in generalizing half of the population that just happens to be a different gender than you?"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Ladies- this is a knee slapping, eyebrow raising, tickle you to pieces must-read.

I's amazing how emotionally laced some of these reviews are. What is really striking is how all the guys are saying the book sucks and then there's a divide among the women. It's clear this book is far from offering any universal insight in sexual politics, which if you're honest is what this book is really concerned wtih. And even more than that, this book is really a how-to book at how to get a guy to fall for you. Again, all the guys are saying no-way, and the women are going at it and really divided.A case in point is MissAnn (who I suspect might really be LittleOracle) and Jennifer R. I found Jennifer R's take refreshingly honest from a woman. In fact, the way the word b*tch is being used in this book, Jennifer R, obviously very strongly opinionated, free-spirited, and take-charge, exemplifies in just about every respect the attributes that Sherry Argove is promoting. Jennifer R really slam dunked MissAnn (or LittleOracle) really good. At any rate, all this book seems to do is make controversy and divide people. I think that says quite a lot about it in itself."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I want to quote a female reviewer (\\"LittleOricle\\"):\\"I have a friend who lives for her boyfriend and really could use this book but she's so far gone that I've given up hope. I can't tell you how many times she's cancelled on me at the last second because he decided he wanted to go out at that time. Wrong. You hate when your friends do that to you and you're disgusted with them for their attitudes -- so why on earth would you do it? Besides, he's more likely to call back when you don't offer everything on a platter at once -- including your heart; You lose mystery with him when you do that and he loses interest.\\"This quote best personifies the bitter, angry, jealous, envious \\"gurl friend\\" of a woman, who is secretly desiring to see her friend's relationship end. Why? Like all envious, bitter little women, they have no man of there own.I have found that if there is real chemsitry and interest between two people, the surest way to have a man not call you back is not show interest. In contradiction to LittleCuticle's belief, a man is more likely to call you back when you show him interest. I doubt she would know that though and is still probably dateless and loveless.I used to have \\"friends\\" like her. I know her type and woman like her. And to answer her question why on earth I'd cancel on a person like her and go out with my boyfriend--my lover--is because I actually have a boyfriend and would rather spend the time with him going out, having fun, and making love--than spending it with a looser so-called \\"friend\\" like her.I used to believe this crap when I was younger. I was even so into the heartless b*tches international website until I realized I was getting older and really becoming just like those bitter lonely loosers myself.I think the real sell-outs to women today are women. It's other women to be fearful and distrusting of today--not men. So many bitter, angry women, who when they don't find love want to insanely destroy it with others and then sit around their circle of bitter friends and say \\"see I told you, men are sh*t.\\"Well, now you know why both men and women cancel on you and don't want to hang out with you LittleCuticle or whatever you call yourself: it's you and your philosophy that's sh*t.

My mother had initially let me borrow it after she read it, and she's been happily married over 20 yrs...and she was not thrilled with the overall message of the book. She said, &quot;If you have to play these games with anyone of the opposite gender, you shouldn't be with them.&quot; It's true. With the exception of gently reminding people what you've done for them when they pick what you've done apart, most of these techniques just seemed too abusive to me for everyday use.Life isn't a corny teen flick where this stuff works -- if it was, I'd be living in a house worth $800,000, have a hot next door neighbor exactly my age, and my biggest problem would be the next time my nails were going to be done.

What Argov is apparently not understanding of modern women is just how far women have indeed coming. We have our careers and are our own persons already. Hence the message she is giving, namely to be independent, is as about thought-provoking as declaring the earth isn't flat but round. We're all up to date Ms. Argov, and by the way: This is the 21st Century--alot has changed since the time when you were young.So archaic message aside, what else does this book have to offer then you ask? Well, as a pyschologist, Ms. Argov is believing that 1.) psychological mind games should be employed, and 2.) as a psychologist, she has some \\"scientific\\" approach to playing mind games.I suppose for some women that feel they have to resort to this childish approach, the book would have appeal for them. For the rest of us women above the years of puberty however, this book is as insightful and pertinent to life as an adolescent's copy of Mad Magazine is for a female corporate executive.And there is the matter of the title itself. Specifically, it is the term \\"b*tch.\\" When I hear that word, as certainly does the rest of the world, what comes to mind is not a strong, independent woman, but rather a spoiled, stupid, clueless woman who is arrogant without cause. That is certainly not the image I aspire to become--nor I hopefully believe the one that most other women wish to become.What then, if any, redeemable message of value is there in this book? It's what your mother essentially told: have self-respect for yourself, find something that you genuinely like, pursue it and develope it--or try to make something of worth out of your life.Oh, and just say no to drugs."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Most of the sappy books I've read about how to whine about your inner child were making me wonder if the people who write the book are crazier then the people who read them. Then I came across this book. Sherrie is sort of like an anti-hero. She doesn't hold herself up as perfect--and her humor that wins you over by the middle of the first chapter.And then...you can't put the book down. The title is misleading. This book is sarcastic but it's well written. And will hold your interest from beginning to end. I've read it three times, and I could read it three more and not get bored. Yes, it's THAT good."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Im going to start by saying that I did not finish this book. Now before anyone starts to get all hype and accusatory let me finish. My husband's cousin who is still in her 20's read this book and she gave it to me (which I thought was odd because I am married to her cousin but anywho)I never got around to finishing the book because when the hubs saw it he took it from me. 2 days later he was talking to me about the book he finished it in 2 days and would not shut up about it lol. So I decided to do the lamest thing ever and have all three of us sit down and talk about some points. From my husbands point (he is to embarassed to leave a review) he said what attracted him to me was the fact that I was not \\"needy\\" he said the fact that I didn't give in to him so easy made him intrigued and really want to show me that he was the one and it worked cause we are married. PS I didnot know I was resisting him I just wasn't interested at first lol:) He also went on to say that the author made some good points about avoiding the cooking in black nighties business meaning don't give it away so easily if the guy looses interest oh well he didn't deserve your body (his words not mine). Remember every situation is relative so ladies if you are interested in a guy try to \\"customize\\" your case feel the guy out. If he seems sensitive then don't hurt his feelings or string him along it is unecessary because men have feelings to (his words not mine). If it does become serious and he's in it for the long haul it is no reason to act like some power hungry CEO open up to the man and show him why he wanted you in the first place afterall he stuck in their with you.I think the point of this book is that women shouldn't feel like they cant speak up my cousin-in-law has felt that way we have talked about it before I even knew there was such a book.If your needy then girlfriend who am I to tell you that it wont win a man over some men may need that type of women and you shouldn't change it just because a couple guys are turned on by rebellion. If your a Drop Dead Diva then be you and don't back down and stay head strong. The person you are supposed be with will love you for you. I think people are taking this book to serious if you don't like the book so be it re-sell or give it away. The hubs has lost the book so I do plan on finishing it but I have to find it first. But I hope this helps."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"So what are you getting? A man who has to be handled and manipulated, just so you can be treated decently. The author of the Bitches book derides women who give too much, but then spends the entire book telling women what they have to do, how they have to talk, how they have to think, and who they have to become in order to hook their so-called man. In the end, the woman is jumping through as many hoops as before, plus she has to wear the pants because otherwise he'll get bored and won't have any respect for her.I prefer men who are attracted to real women, not pseudo-men. If I have to think like a man, talk like a man, act like a man, and be the man, what do I need him for? I have a vibrator for that. And while we're on the subject, what does he need ME for? Shouldn't he just admit that he'd be happier with a man?I won't wear the pants for any man. If he can't appreciate a feminine woman so that I have to protect myself from his immaturity and ineptitude, he'll find I'll wear the pants one time--in order to throw his sorry butt out the door so he can go back to playing with the other little boys."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I've read this book twice. I have also read many of the 1 and 2 star reviews. I see how it could offend men and confuse women. I love this book BUT you must read with your own discretion. Be smart about it. Don't take everything literally. It will have a powerful effect on you if you have been wrong or feel fed up or depressed. You will feel empowered after reading this book. So empowered that you might end up hurting your man. Most men behave different to women....men LEAVE! I read this book over 2 years ago when I was with my previous bf. He was wondering why I was behaving so \\"aloof\\". Everything was working just like the book says (he call more, etc, etc.), but he began to be very concerned and I wasn't acting like the person he feel in love with. Did I mention : THIS WAS A GOOD GUY. When he discovered the book I was reading, he flipped out and began stomping on it and said this is what tears relations hips apart.PROS:1) It's very empowering to young girls (or women) who just don't get it. Yes it says things like don't sleep with a guy on the first date which is something everyone knows but I don't blame the author for reinforcing this fact because some women are still doing it and they keep falling for the same stupid lines. If you don't believe me, watch \\"Maury\\"!2) Women who constantly call men. Leave them to call you in the beginning. Yes they should chase you a bit in the beginning and still kind of chase you during, but later you should be chasing them back. Men deserve love too.3) I disagree with popping pop corn for dinner. I love to cook and the man I love will taste my cooking. Just not within the first few months.4) Yes a woman has to put up a bit of a chase I agree with Sherry BUT please show him that you love him back. I think she says that in the book.5) I think she means to behave \\"aloof\\" you don't want to reveal EVERYTHING about yourself so soon and I agree. You might have a whole ife time together, save some stuff for later.6) I think some of her points might be a bit demeaning to men. Maybe she comes across a bit....well if I were a men I would feel castrated reading this book and maybe this is the reason for all the strong opinions I'm reading from men on this site.7) For men reading this book, you have to remember, she interviewed MEN! SO you can't get that angry. I believe that not all men are cave men BUT all men I know like a bit of a chase (which is where I agree with Sherry), BUT where I disagree:CONS:1) I will show my feelings from time to time. Men love endearment, but they don't love consistent weaklings.2) I will cook a real meal for my loving man (in months to come)3) I will not behave like I'm not interested UNLESS he did something deadly wrong.4) As far as doing his laundry, dishes, cleaning that will be shared when I live with him.CONCLUSION:When analyze relationships, this is what really goes on, but is not discussed. I think Sherry is taking a lot of heat on this book because she's describing hings that strong women do that men are not supposed to know. Just like men have secrets up their sleeve about how to talk a women into the bedroom on the first date and never see her again. When women hear about that it makes them angry. Well when men read this book (which is NOT intended for them to read) they will ge angry. You see guys both men and women have to play some game to keep things things interesting and to protect themselves and to maintain their integrity. It's been going on for centuries. Almost everything she said is what mothers tell their daughters but their daughters don't listen because she thinks \\"HE LOVES ME\\", but that's not always the case.FINAL ANALYSIS:Ladies please read this book but with precaution. If you have a good man, don't give him the cold shoulder. It's ok to use a few pointers where you think you need them but don't get carried away with too much empowerment. It might turn him right off. Learn from some of this reviews from men on this site because you might b sorry. I think the most important thing you can learn from this book is to learn to love yourself and people will love you no matter who it is."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"The author is not suggesting that you be a \\"bitch\\". What she is saying is that you should not drop everything every time a man comes into your life..as so many women do. Don't stop working out because your boyfriend wants to meet during your regular gym class time. Don't cancel a date with your friends because he wants to go out. Men like women who have an opinion and their own lives.

Well, yes, if you believe this book's premise. Such rancor is childish nonsense. A bitch deserves, gets, and ends up with a dog...if that. Hell hath no fury...Better to just stick to getting money and call it \\"love myself\\", thank you, and \\"fxxx yourself\\", loser, this book's making me loads of money telling hurt women how to get back at men. Try it, and you'll see what you \\"get back\\" alright. Another way may be to be a better person and learn how to attract and select better types of people and remain wary of badmouthing ( \\"All men are...\\") n envious friends around you keeping you down by the fire hydrant...with \\"ad-vice\\" and books like this. Otherwise, good riddance and begone with you because you'd just prove that it then wasn't such a mistake to breakup with you after all..."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"Although I only gave this book two stars (I'll share with you why in the next paragraph), I have to give credit where it is do: the book is very well-written, the author has a sharp, humorous wit, and she is clearly intelligent. Also, I like how she sincerely seems to want to empower women, which, as a man, I am 100 percent in favor of.However, this book is CLEARLY manipulative, teaching women how to manipulate men and gain an \\"edge\\" in their relationships. That is the reason that I gave this book two stars. Some of the content just seems somewhat mean-spirited. It seems to me that the author views dating as a battleground, as if women are going to war when they seek to get involved with men (and I know some women, as well as men, would say that dating IS war), and must have this strategy, or battle plan, to emerge victorious. Sure, there are many men who are dogs in this world, but there are also many men who just want a really sweet, loving woman whom is his equal. Even though the strategies are not meant to be used long term, it is just the manipulative undertone of the content that kind of bothers me.As far as the techniques, they definitely do work. However, for men who have dating experience, the techniques are not nearly as effective, because many guys can pick up on the whole \\"hard to get game,\\" and that can be a huge turn off. Men play hard to get as as well, but we call it \\"playing it cool.\\" Again, these techniques can work, because they are based on the laws of human nature, with principles such as \\"we all want what we can't have, and want more of what we have to work for.\\" But the negative side of it is that it is fairly easy to see through these techniques. Ladies, men, and I mean REAL men, love a woman who is self-confident, assertive, and knows what she wants out of life. But I feel that I speak for many men when I say that very few of us want to be in a relationship with a woman who is manipulative and who plays games to get an edge in any relationship..."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"A rather misandristic selection of \\"solutions\\" and surveys, masquerading as a self-help guide for women."},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"This book is great teaches you how much worth you are compared to anybody else and makes you reavaliate your relationships with friends and boyfriends...value yourself and everyone else will follow your actions and react accordingly"},{"Title":"Why Men Love Bitches: From Doormat to Dreamgirl - A Woman's Guide to Holding Her Own in a Relationship","review":"I'd recommend this book to any woman in a relationship, or who is in the pursuit of a relationship.

To read this book is to regconize what we learn and see around us in most of the relationships that we expericne in growing up, to our adult lives. 99.9% of men are not perfect, for every dream guy there is ten gansters,womenizers, Howard sterns, Colin Ferrals, George Clooneys, and Bill Clintons out there.Women get what they bring to the table. I have seen men who are dogs instantly, and I mean as instant as coffee, straighten up when in a relationship with a women who takes no doo-doo.I have seen men who know that if they cheat on a certain women, not even look the other way because they know they have much more to lose than sleeping in the dog house. They know that their is a good chance that their girl will walk and walk for good. These men are in love with Bicthes, not the \\"bad evil, roll her eyes and snap her finger bicthes\\", but the \\"I wont take any crap that you wont take and you know where I draw the line bicthes\\".Here to prove my point, let me take all of you back to highschool. Try to remember a roudy group of kids in your class. Then think of your most meanest and most strict highschool teacher. Wasn't it amazing how the same rude students would treat the wimpy teachers and how some students would treat the teachers \\"who they knew they could not mess with?\\" It wasn't out of fear, it was just that they knew where that teacher draws the line. Everyone tries to size up the people in their lives, we do it to our freinds, our bosses at work, ( we know who to goof off on) and our lovers.We know which professors to skip class on, we know which friends to ask for a way out of the way favors and which parent always gives in. Women tend to settle for less more so than men, and are willing to compromise more so than men. When you do hear or know of someone who is with a dream guy, ask the guy about his past. Nine out of ten times he was whipped into shape by a good bicth who taught him a lesson or two!! If more and more women didn't tolerate a lot of things, more and more men would have no choice than to behave.Women still tolerate men cheating, letting themselves go ( and this I mean basic hygene and grooming) and romantically dead relationships. Men don't tolerate whore or sexually agressive women ( not atleast with respect or dignity) women are attacked and quickly labeled. Men are not whores they are womanizers, pimps, mack daddies, ladies man,and a cad. All slick yet enduring ways to label man whores. Men are able to have shows like the man show that display have naked honies walking around. No matter what sex and city did ( and we barely got away with that) we can never be given the sexual freedom of a man. Yet we can control what we take and deal with and know our self worth and value and yes be bicthy!!!Look, all that I am saying is we know who to mess with. A man's best friend is a dog and for a good reason, they are one in the same and both need to be trained.

If they are with one, then they either gave up on love, lack courage to stand up for themselves, or do not know that real love exists out there for them. Men and women are from the same species and essentially have the same standards for each other. They both do not like being treated poorly by the other. They both do not respect promiscuity in the opposite sex (men call women whores and women call men dogs). And they both want mutual love and respect.

If you wanted the whitewashed version of history we were taught in high school, where Christopher Columbus had pure motives in the new world and didn't rape or enslave the native population, where the Native Americans were savages who were domesticated by the pilgrims who so graciously shared a Thanksgiving feast with them, where Woodrow Wilson's racism and hatred of women isn't mentioned...why did you bother taking a college history course, or bother going to college for that matter, at all? Pull your heads out of the sand! If you truly believe this book is socialist propaganda, I recommend you start doing your own research of America's past without using any high school or college textbook as a source of information - you'll find that this particular textbook has one of the truest pictures of American history available."},{"Title":"The American People: Creating a Nation and a Society (American People (Addison-Wesley))","review":"Let me start off by saying that I am liberal. But I have absolutely no patience for intellectual dishonesty, especially not from those teaching history to others. They have a duty to give a fair account of history, as what they teach becomes truth in the minds of those taught history. The perspective of the authors is anything but fair. The authors of this book should be ashamed. Before reading this book for a history course, I read the reviews here. I was hoping that the reviewers claiming this to be liberal propaganda were simply misguided conservatives who take offense at anything conflicting with their world view. Turns out they were right. I realize that many wrongs have been committed by the white majority of society in American history, but this is not all of what history is about.The authors of this book are staunch supporters of conflict theory. They spend an unfairly large portion of each chapter on the plight of the underprivileged, and especially on minorities and women. The authors seem to view all of society's problems as the fault of the social/governmental/economic system. The concept of personal responsibility apparently is a lost cause. The authors seem to not only subscribe to the social belief of equal opportunity, but also equality of outcome.Almost every chapter has a large amount of text devoted to the plight of minorities and women. Minorities are always blameless in this book, and the big bad white men can never seem to do anything with moral integrity.The first chapter of this book, \\"The Union Reconstructed\\", is intended to tell the history of the Reconstruction Era, or post Civil-War era. It ends up talking more about the plight of blacks than it does on actual Reconstruction. Every single photograph/painting in this chapter, save for one, has to do with the plight of blacks, usually in the form of being exploited by whites. Ridiculous.While most other chapters are not this bad, it still sets a tone that will last throughout the book. Near the end of the book, the authors even have the audacity to claim that opposition to affirmative action is rooted in racism (page 1087). If that's not an unfair account of history, then I don't know what is. The authors let their bias cloud the truth, and it is a travesty.I would also like to note that this last chapter (which tells of the history from 1992-2002) spends not even a full three pages talking about the economy, and then goes on for almost five pages talking about the plight of minorities. Actually, let me break down, page by page, what this chapter discusses, just so you can see how people can get the impression that this isn't a history book, but liberal propaganda. 1074-1077 talks about immigration into the US. 1077-1079 talks about the Census of 2000, where it spends much time talking about... you guessed it, women and minorities. 1079-1081 talk about the economy. 1081-1082 talks about the plight of the lower classes. 1082, 1083, and 1086 talks about \\"Aging and Illness\\", which deals with the increase in the elderly population, the health concerns and social pressures that come with that, and the AIDS epidemic. (pages 1084 and 1085 are one of the \\"Recovering The Past\\" features which serve to break up the pace of the text a little bit) 1086 to 1092 talks about, what else, minorities and women! A paltry two pages is then spent on the revival of the Democrat party with Bill Clinton. 1093-1095 deal with some general political history. 1095-98 deal with the rise of George W. Bush. 1098-1102 deal with foreign policy. And then a paltry two pages are spent on September 11th, the War of Terrorism, the Afghanistan War, and the impending conflict in Iraq. And, that's the end of the chapter. It's almost as if little happened in the 1990s except blacks getting persecuted! Sounds like a fair telling of history, doesn't it?Other examples of flagrant unfair history telling is in Chapter 17. The Native Americans are portrayed as this collection of nice little idyllic, Utopian societies that was suddenly torn to pieces by the evil white men. The whites slaughtered the Native Americans while the Native Americans were not guilty of any atrocities. Sorry, this isn't how it happened. There were atrocities on BOTH sides, and yet not once does this text mention any atrocities committed by any Native American tribes. I will concede, however, that the white settlers were probably more at fault than the Native Americans, but the Native American tribes were by no means blameless like this book would like you to think.\\"But their bravery and skill could not permanentally withstand the power of the well-supplied, well-armed, and determined U.S. Army.\\" (page 592) Their \\"bravery and skill\\"? Give me a break. Another quote: \\"The [buffalo slaughter], which had claimed 13 million animals by 1883, was disgraceful in retrospect. The Indians considered white men demented. \\" - page 592. A historian should always strive to have a neutral point of view, not call things \\"disgraceful\\".This book is just completely unbalanced history telling. It conveniently neglects any facts which do not corroborate the authors' racist views. Not enough time is spent on what happened outside of the suffering of minorities and women. The history text that is here skips over all sorts of events, trends, people, and dates so it can fit in more diatribes about the persisting ills of society."},{"Title":"The American People: Creating a Nation and a Society (American People (Addison-Wesley))","review":"Some of the reviews posted here are just bizarre - did they read the book? Yes, the book writes minority groups and women into the story - where they belong (gay Americans are not mentioned at all in the pre-Civil War volume; in the full edition they are not mentioned until the 1970s gay rights movement!). The book discusses farmers, urban artisans, and everybody else in early America. It also does NOT ignore the traditional subjects of history - politics, leaders, diplomacy, economic development.

It outlines general trends without emphasizing the historical facts on which the trends are based. While it's certainly important to recognize progressions in history, it's extremely difficult to learn about them based only on the text's vague, 50-page summaries, all of which fail to mention any form of historical evidence.As a student, I found this book's approach to teaching history disastrous and mildly insulting. First of all, it fails to convey even the most cursory knowledge of history by shunning, at all costs, cruel Old Regime teaching methods that might require DATE memorization or familiarity with historical FACTS. With nothing to &quot;Lock On&quot; to, it's very hard to retain anything. Even worse, however, are the implications of the book's approach. I like History because I enjoy being able to look at a set of evidence and trying to figure out, based on otherwise stale information, what *actually* happened, what life was like. Somehow, I got the sense that by describing outright &quot;what life was like,&quot; the book implies that to force students to learn INFORMATION is useless, that students are unable to think for themselves and interpret historical information with any accuracy.I think I should comment, also, on one reviewer's dismissal of this book as &quot;Nouveau History.&quot; I come close to BEING one of the &quot;Tenured Radicals&quot; this reviewer had so much disdain for, and I still hated this book. I would hate it if I were communist. There's so much wrong with it that to criticize it for its left-wing perspective is plain silly.I would recommend &quot;The American Promise,&quot; by James L.

I mean, the FF were driven by the walking tragedy of Ben Grimm as the Thing and the great villains, why the Avengers started out as the Marvel version of the Justice League of America with the best of the best and then deteriorated into those superheroes who did not have their own comics. But the X-Men were victims of persecution and prejudice because they were mutants. The metaphor for teenage angst and the joys of puberty was just too obvious not to work. Plus they had a bald headed guy in charge.\\"The Essential Uncanny X-Men\\" presents the first twenty-four issues of the comic book, which starts with the creative team of writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby but ends with Roy Thomas and Werner Roth. Issue #1 provides one of the better foundations for a Marvel comic. We begin with Professor Charles Xavier's School for Gifted Children in Westchester County, where Jean Grey breaks the boy's only barrier as Marvel Girl (the all time worst name for a superhero Stan Lee ever came up with). The original roster of the group, for those who cannot remember back any farther than the rebirth under Chris Claremont and Dave Cockrum, consisted of not only Professor X's power to read minds and project thoughts and Marvel Girl's telekinesis, but the agility and strength of the brilliant Hank McCoy, the Beast; the fully functional wings of rich boy Warren Worthington III, Angel; the walking snow cone Bobby Drake, the Iceman (who originally looked like a snowman); and the power means that shot out of the eyes of the group's field leader Scott Summer, Cyclops. All gained their mutant powers when they became adolescents (although we would not learn their backstories for several years), and were rescued from fearful humans by Professor X and given a power of sanctuary. Having trained them in the use of their powers, Xavier has their working as a team. Thus we have alienation and the need to belong all wrapped up with a mixed bag of superpowers.The other key part of the foundation is that Lee and Kirby came up with THE ultimate villain for the Uncanny X-Men in the first issue. The FF had the Mole Man, which smacked of all the monster comics Lee and Kirby did during the Fifties, but the X-Men had Magneto, the Master of Mutant Magnetism. Now, granted if his power works the way they say it does this is an invincible super villain (he can easily kill everybody in sight by either taking making a metal object a weapon or manipulate the iron in your blood if he wants to be overly creative), but the important thing here is that in the face of human prejudice over mutants (\\"homo superior\\"), Magneto agrees he is part of a superior race and is out to confirm humanity's worse fears. In Issue #4 Magneto leads the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants in a sort of mutant Civil War. Ultimately, the strongest similarity between the X-Men and Spider-Man are not that they are teenagers, but that they are heroes who are treated by the world at large mostly as villains.The main complaint against these first two-dozen episodes is that despite this great foundation the comics are mostly standard superhero stories. The bit where Charles Xavier and Scott Summers both love Jean Grey but will not tell her their feelings is awkward at best, so the interpersonal relationships are nothing special at this point. Beyond Magneto really good villains are hard to come by; the Juggernaut is above average, but many of the others are laughable (e.g., the Locust), and even the Mimic is just an X-Men version of the Super Skrull. Even the mutant paranoia element is relatively low given where it would be in the future.They are up to Volume 4 of \\"The Essential X-Men,\\" but are still stuck on just this first collection of the original comics. This is too bad because in the next collection we would see Roy Thomas hitting his stride as the book's writer and then we get to the books drawn by Jim Steranko and then Neal Adams. Those were the early glory days of the X-Men and those volumes need to be published by Marvel as well. 'Nuff said. Final Note: Check out the great cover Kirby drew for \\"X-Men\\" #17: \\"...And None Shall Survive!\\" Nothing actually in the issue is that good, until the final pattern (which was nicely homaged by John Bryne at the end of \\"X-Men\\" #111), but I think it is one of Kirby's top 10 covers ever (not that I have really gone back and counted mind you)."},{"Title":"Essential Classic X-Men - Volume 1","review":"Oh, to reread these rough-and-tumble stories from Marvel's early days brings a smile to my face. Sure, you wince at the hamhanded sexist portrayal of Jean Grey or the Scarlet Witch; sure, you groan at the excessively long-winded dialogue being batted about in the midst of a battle or crisis... BUT, elements are juggled in a page-turning manner. Every story features the characters doing everyday things and running into the problems being mutants brings to these situations. Every story features lots of free-wheeling adventure, not just slugfests. And, of course, there's the meetings between characters from different comics that still makes me feel all golly-gee-whiz. My favorite in this case is the meeting with the Avengers. VERY WELL-WRITTEN and fun. Even the lame-o second-rate villians are fun, to me at least! Finally, I don't think any fan can gaze at Kirby's panel revealing Magneto's return from space without saying, &quot;WOW!&quot; Adventure with an occasional message and lots of quirky bits of (at times misplaced) humor. (instead of heavy-handed mutants-are-hated-every-story-melodrama) Cool! Works well in the b&amp;w newsprint format, too!"},{"Title":"Essential Classic X-Men - Volume 1","review":"Those who doubt the magnitude of the debt current comics fans owe to Stan Lee and Jack Kirby need only pick up a copy of &quot;Essential X-Men vol. 1&quot; to become true believers. Most latter-day X-fans associate all that is good and pure with this title to Chris Claremont and John Byrne. As this collection of the first 24 issues of the title shows, however, Claremont and Byrne were truly standing on the shoulders of giants.How many of these fans know, for example, that Lee and Kirby created many of the X-Men's archenemies? Magneto and the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. The Juggernaut. The Sentinels (yes, that's right---the Sentinels!). Much of the X-Men mythos emerged from the fertile collaboration of Lee and Kirby.Unfortunately, the X-Men were a bit of an also-ran in the Lee/Kirby stable. The stories are fearly pedestrian, the art not as grandiose as we expect from Kirby, and the title ultimately languished until Claremont and Byrne brought it back from the ashes like, well, a Phoenix.Still, this is a worthy glimpse into the birth of a legendary superteam, and I heartily recommend this collection to X-philes everywhere."},{"Title":"Essential Classic X-Men - Volume 1","review":"If you can get past the lack of color (it's not hard), and the fact the pages feel like coloring book paper, this collection is a must have for any X-Men or comic fan. I used to think the 70's Claremont issues or the 90's Jim Lee issues were the best X-Men stories, but after reading this I realize this is what the X-Men are all about.Unlike Claremont's stories, there are no ridiculous aliens, no outer space adventures, hardly any fantasy elements - it's pure, street level, mutant action. Best of all, the strongest part of the X-Men mythos - the mutant/human issue - is portrayed in a way that doesn't get boring or tiresome, like most current X-Titles. In these early issues, the X-Men fight fascist mutants and humans trying to exterminate mutants...the things the X-Men should do! The Brood and the Shi'ar are fun, but this is why the X-Men were formed. Why do you think the current revamping of Uncanny X-Men and &quot;New&quot; X-Men features the Sentinels and mutant-human bigotry as the opening storyline? Why do you think the new &quot;Ultimate&quot; X-Men comic (set in another timeline) features the Sentinels and Magneto in the first story-arc?This is the meat, the foundation, the bread &amp; butter of the X-Men. Although it may have been a side project by Lee and Kirby, these stories are ten times better than any X-Book produced after 1994. Cyclops is moody, depressed, and damn near suicidal. The Beast isn't blue and furry, although he's still &quot;bestial&quot; with the mind of an intellectual. Angel is the gallavanting playboy before he was transformed by Apocalypse, while Jean is just a telekinetic. And if you thought Iceman had a low range over his powers now, just wait until you see his big transformation - from snowman to iceman!Granted, the comic shows its age. There is &quot;simplistic&quot; artwork with some dynamic shots thrown in, and everything feels like the 1960's. However, despite all of that, the comic still feels timeless and is a cherished part of my comics collection. I hope they get around to reproducing more of these classic tales very soon."},{"Title":"Essential Classic X-Men - Volume 1","review":"Marvel gets lots of flak for the format of their Essential editions: I can agree with the mid-stream format change - just like the Masterworks, you have to start over if you want a uniform set. I can also agree with the flimsy paper, to a degree, as it tears easily during the binding process. The ink bleed results in ghost images on facing pages. And the lack of color leaves out some of the visual appeal. Yet, with all of this, I still LOVE this line, as it is hands-down the cheapest way to educate yourself on the Silver Age of Marvel Comics. I will gladly pay the low price for these 500-page books!Anyway, on to the meat of this volume: Uncanny X-Men #1 - 24, by Lee, Kirby, Thomas, Gavin, et al. I guess most folks today prefer post-Giant-Size-X-Men, but whatever your preference, check out this book, as this is where it all began! These stories are from the early '60s, so of course the dialogue is cheesy; of course the characterizations are stereotyped; but by gum, you just can't get innovative stories like this anymore. Here we have the original X-Men, as kids no less, setting the stage for the uneasy coexistence of humanity and mutants. It's super-hero action combined with teen angst, and some little oddities that, to my knowledge, were not carried into later issues (Professor X loves teen-age Jean Grey? Eeeugh!). Featured villains include, in their first appearances, Magneto, the Blob, the Vanisher, Unus, the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants, Juggernaut, the Sentinels, Lucifer, Mimic, and the Stranger, plus a few others I won't mention. Plus, you get a great Kirbyesque cover by Bruce Timm (this guy should do all of the covers for Kirby's reprints).The Marvel Essentials line is one of the best bargains in comics. Why not fill your shelves with them?"},{"Title":"Essential Classic X-Men - Volume 1","review":"When I first started really reading comic books in the early 1980s, there was a definite distinction when it came to the X-Men. In particular, the heroes featured at the time were the \\"New X-Men\\" with such members as Wolverine, Storm, Nightcrawler and Colossus. These were different from the \\"Old X-Men\\" of Iceman, Angel, Beast and Marvel Girl; only Cyclops really bridged the gap between the two. A quarter century later, with the rosters changing so much, \\"Old\\" and \\"New\\" don't have the same meaning, but back then, it did. The Essential Uncanny (or Classic) X-Men chronicles the original group.For those unfamiliar with the team's origins, it started off as a group of five kids in their late teens attending a private school with the single instructor, Charles Xavier. Professor X, as he was commonly called, was a mutant, gifted with strong psychic powers, especially telepathy. Recognizing that there would be other mutants out there, he founded the school to keep these other superpowered individuals on the straight and narrow and protect the world from less benevolent mutants.These students were Jean Grey (Marvel Girl), a telekinetic; Warren Worthington (Angel) who had wings; Hank McCoy (Beast) who had incredible agility; Bobby Drake (Iceman) with grand ice-generating powers; and Scott \\"Slim\\" Summers (Cyclops) who could shoot destructive beams out of his eyes. Led by Professor X, they would fight various supervillains. More importantly, they would try to fight anti-mutant bigotry.In the twenty-four issues in this first volume, the X-Men would battle a slew of villains such as the Vanisher, Unus the Untouchable, the Sentinels and Count Nefaria, but by far their greatest enemy was Magneto who was incredibly powerful but also had a contempt for humanity; he wanted to pave the way for the mutants, also known as homo superior. Either solo or with his evil brotherhood, he would be the greatest challenge to the X-Men.In these early issues, the characters are still not fully defined, with only Cyclops and Professor X having really distinct personalities. For the others, we only get glimmers of who they are. But overall, the stories are pretty decent, if a little Scooby-Doo-esque: if it wasn't for those blasted kids, who knows what villainy could occur. Among the early Marvel comics, this is one of the better ones, even if it is not quite five-star quality yet. If you're an X-Men fan - even a \\"New\\" X-Men fan - this is a must read."},{"Title":"Essential Classic X-Men - Volume 1","review":"I'm one of those few people that prefer the original X-Men over the new.

It's better than the essential x-men in my opinion. The whole point of the essential line is to start from the beginning isn't it? The characterization is excellent for such old comics. The love triangle between Cyclops, Angel, and Marvel Girl is quite interesting and realistic. And the scenes showing Iceman and Beast's growing friendship are nice. I've always disliked Professor X and this book didn't change a thing. I hate how he acts like he's above everybody else. What gives him the right to read other peoples minds and erase them? All in all he's a pretty 2-dimensional character. And if he cares about people knowing he's the X-men's teacher so much why doesn't he just wear a costume?As for the villains they're pretty good as a whole. They range from the ultimate bad(Magneto)to the ultimate corny(The Vanisher). I was extremely impressed with Magneto. He wasn't the amazing character he is today but fantastic for the 60s. He takes over a missile base in his first appearance. Yes, \\"takes\\" as in he actually does it! That's the great thing about Magneto, he actually goes through with his plans. He also adds themes like bigotry and racism. Very lightly of course, but better then the stories of fake one-sided communist countries that were popular with marvel back then.The Vanisher is just pathetic. I mean he vanishes! The Blob. Don't even get me started on him. I mean, even his name! So whose idea was it to have him in 3 issues! The Brotherhood is pure genius! It was a great idea to have reluctant members. The Stranger is by far the most creative one-shot character ever! There are plenty of other villains too.The art. This is probably the most controversial thing about the essential line. Yeah it's in black and white. I say get over it! Jack Kirby does most of the art. Friggin' Jack Kirby!The book has its funny moments also. The scenes at Greenwich village are hilarious.

From Magneto to the Sentinels, from the reintroduction of Ka-Zar to the Juggernaut, these were great stories with nice arc and well developed suspense. They show the maturity the creators had developed by the time they came to develop the X-Men. The sad part of this volume, though, are the final issues with wordy stories by Roy Thomas at his least creative (the Locust, Count Neferia and his forgotten villian brigade) and poor art by Werner Roth.

The peak of this frustration was during the run of issues 12 and 13, when the X-Men were battling the Juggernaut for the first time. Issue 12 came out in July and 13 did not come out until September, an excruciatingly long wait.The continuity in being able to move from one issue to the next and follow the story sequentially is one of the most attractive features of this book. No longer is it necessary to use memory or back issues as a reference to follow the flow of the story, a recap of the previous issue is still fresh in your mind. Reading this book was a flash back to my past where I was enthralled by the adventures of the original X-Men and could barely contain my impatience while waiting for the next installment. The action and dialog is superb and a credit to the Marvel team headed by Stan Lee.The only downside to this book is due to the lack of color, which is no doubt a simplifying and cost-saving move.

The films incorporate (and take many liberties with) the 25+ years of the X-Men which has made reading the comics a vastly different (but enjoyable) experience. Here follows a summary of what to expect in volume 1 of THE UNCANNY X-MEN. (Possible spoilers.)Our superheroes and their lives and powers are varied:~Robert (Bobby) Drake, Iceman. The youngest member of the group with a sense of humor that compliments that of Hank McCoy's.~Hank McCoy, Beast. The most intellectual, humorous, and athletic.~Warren Worthington III, Angel. Wealthy, charismatic, and in love with Jean Grey. He is the one with wings.~Scott Summers, Cyclops. The most tragic (because of the intense power of his eyes) and the most respected (the deputy leader of the X-Men) and in love with Jean.~Jean Grey, Marvel Girl. Telekinetic (also telepathic, but that is not revealed in this volume), the only female member, and forced to choose between Scott and Warren.~Charles Xavier, Professor X. A wheelchair-bound mutant whose telepathic powers make him one of the most formidable and most powerful of all mutants. He not only founded the X-Men and leads them, but created the school Professor Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters (where mutants go to learn to control and refine their powers and abilities).Volume 1 contains issues 1-24. The X-Men fight several of their memorable villians:~Magneto (The X-Men's archenemy, enough said.)~Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Mastermind, Toad, and siblings Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver) who work for Magneto.~Juggernaut~the Sentinels~Lucifer~Mimic (who will later become an X-Man)Other lesser villians include the Stranger, the Vanisher, the Blob, Unus, the Locust and the Submariner.The X-MEN comics are excellent and thrilling reads, however, the series isn't without its faults (written in the 1960s, the sexism is quite obvious, even if it isn't offensive). However, after reading this, you'll be wanting more---much more.The Essential series is published only in black and white. There is another series, Marvel Masterworks, which reprints the series in color.Marvel has yet to publish a follow-up to volume 1 of the Essentials, which is sorely needed as one is left with many unresolved issues that begged to be answered (How do Jean-Scott-Warrren resolve the love triangle? What is Magneto planning next? Will the Locust be back? What happened to Unus and the Blob?)Whether one is a newcomer to comics or a longtime reader, the X-MEN should not be missed out by anyone!"},{"Title":"Essential Classic X-Men - Volume 1","review":"I got this book for christmas a few years ago, and I have read it like 20 times. I at first hated the X-men because it was too complicated and there were too many charachters to keep up with. In this there are only 6 X-men and there are real true villans.If you hate the X-men the way they are, but like the idea, this is for you!!!"},{"Title":"Essential Classic X-Men - Volume 1","review":"The book includes the very first x-men comics ever published. I was a HUGE x-men geek back in the 80's, about the time that Longshot joined the team. I had most of the issues from about 150 - 250, and I always wanted to go back to the start and read the story from the very beginning. If you did/do too, this is where to start. The other series, \\"the essential x-men\\" which also has a #1 starts with the mid-70's \\"reboot\\" that introduced Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Colossus and Storm. The whole thing is in black-and-white, though, which feels a little strange when you're reading it."},{"Title":"Essential Classic X-Men - Volume 1","review":"Though the X-Men originally start as heroes in the public eye, you can quickly see that change as Stan Lee decided they'd be better as anti-heroes, which is what eventually made them so popular in modern culture. It's a little jarring, but makes sense as these early issues progress. The artwork is good, and overall the characterization is not bad. It takes a few issues for the Beast to become as loquacious as we're used to. After awhile, you'd like to slap Cyclops and Marvel Girl until they admit their feelings for each other. It's good early Marvel entertainment at its best!"},{"Title":"Essential Classic X-Men - Volume 1","review":"A whole bunch of X-Men nostalgia.

The story picks up well after the first 3 issues which were, like all initial Marvel issues , rather simplistic. After the halfway point, the comics are absolutely amazing, with one great issue following another, from the Stranger's appearance on earth to Lucifer's threatening Antarctica. The X-Men are great and very human and likeable, specially Iceman. The stories themselves do not have the complexity and darkness of later issues and are much more good-humoured and complete in themselves.This collection loses nothing by being in black-and-white - and is a must for any X-Men(or actually any comics) fan."},{"Title":"Essential Classic X-Men - Volume 1","review":"First of all, I must say that the Essentials series is fantastic. I hear people saying that they hate the idea of no color and hate the pulpy paper. Well, if your a true comic lover, then that doesnt matter. Its all about the story, and its easy to forget that the comics are not in color because the stories are so amazing. Also, where else can you get 20 plus stoires of your favorite super hero in just one book. Ok, now back to The Essnetial Uncanny X-Men. I found this book spectacular, and I highly advise that any X-men fan buy it. I found almsot all of the stories extremely exciting and I found it very interesting how the X-Men evolved throught out the book. Its also fascinating to see the beginnings of many of your favorite X-Men villians, such as Magneto, Toad, The Blob, Vannisher, and others.

This serves the purpose but was disapointed that they were not in color."},{"Title":"Essential Classic X-Men - Volume 1","review":"If you are a fan of the X-men at all, or if you like comics, consider this book. The 25 issues covered here add up to pennies per comic, and the storyline is great. In fact, it started out a little slowly for me, but by the time John Byrne began his run in the middle of this volume, I couldn't wait to read each issue.There are two catches however, one pleasant and one liveable. The pleasant catch is that as Phoenix keeps growing in power, you find yourself reading one of the classic stories in Marvel history and...it is continued in Essential X-men, Volume 2. Since that book is also a bargain, and the art and writing are sensational, it is a pleasant problem to deal with. Gee, I have to read another 25 classic issues of X-men, hmmm!The other catch is, if you aren't already aware, for this bargain price, the book is printed on low grade paper in black and white. Of course, collecting all these stories in color is either impossible or costs hundreds of dollars (Masterworks) or literally a fortune if you are acccumulating the original comics. I didn't even notice the lack of color after I got absorbed into the stories.One more detail: the other &quot;Essential&quot; titles, such as Spiderman and the Fantastic Four, are reprints from the 60's. The X-men run starts in the late 70's and is into the 80's by Volume 2. The evolved art and writing style is a nice bonus.Summary: Incredible value, legendary and masterful work."},{"Title":"Essential Classic X-Men - Volume 1","review":"I honestly don't get the appeal of these books. Why bother making (or reading) black & white reprints of classic four-color comics...? I mean, yeah, the stories are still great and the original comics are hard to find, but a huge part of what made these comics great was the eye-popping artwork, including the bright primary colors: reading them in dull B&W; is just plain wrong. Sure, the printing costs are lower, so you can get more pages for your money, but it's more pages of boring, not more pages of fun. It's really a travesty.On the other hand, it recently occurred to me that these could be used as coloring books... Maybe you could buy a box of crayons to go along with all the artwork that the publishers ruined in this format.

I'm very sad it is over. I am not an avid reader, but Camilla has made me one. If I can read a 900 page book, I can read anything. But I don't know if anything will be as good. I am a big fan of the Austen movies. I finally read Pride and Prejudice. I was a little disappointed that it was slow moving. I found Camilla the opposite. I just ordered Evelina and Cecilia. I can't wait."},{"Title":"Camilla (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Think about all the worst stereotypes of the melodramatic villain, including the satirical ones. They're all rolled into one here, but rest assured, as you knew from page one, all virtue is rewarded and vice punished (except of course when the vice is perpetrated by one of a family of utter paragons, then it is written off as mere boyish spiritedness and all is, ultimately, forgiven). And if you think that sentence is a bit contorted, you'd better stay well away from Fanny Burney.Like other reviewers, I was led to this from Northanger Abbey. I chose it from the several other C18th novels listed in that because I knew something of Fanny's estimable father's musicological writings and I was intrigued by her career as Keeper of the Queen's wardrobe or whatever it was.What I got from it was how far above her precursors Jane Austen is in terms of clarity of style and depth of characterisation. Reading this book with a C21st sensibility, the sententious moralising by the most 'admirable', i.e sickeningly flawless, characters is almost unreadable.Here's one taste, there's a lot more like this... [Dr Marchmont is a learned cleric, adviser to the hero. He had cautioned the hero against pursuing the heroine too hastily because he, Dr Marchmont had been disappointed in the character of a lady whom he had initially taken to be a non pareil]\\"Dr Marchmont, as he saw the pure innocence, open frankness and spotless honour of her heart, found her virtues, her errours(sic), her facility, or her desperation, but a picture of youth; and regretting the false light given by the spirit of comparison, in the hypothesis which he had formed from individual experience, acknowledged its injustice, its narrowness, and its arrogance.\\"If you imagine you would relish 996 pages of that sort of stuff, throw yourself unhesitatingly into the delights of this work.I will say that the plotting is about on a par with Sir Walter Scott although the utter certainty of vice and virtue receiving their just due and of the hero and heroine ending in wedlock leaves you only wondering what twists and tribulations they, and you, will have to go through to get to page 996."},{"Title":"Camilla (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Why do I think it should have been called Eugenia? She is the character whom you will respect and adore the most at the end of this book. But before I elaborate on that further, let me say that this is the second book of Fanny Burney's that I have read and she is the author who has, by far, the best gift for pulling her readers into the very emotions of her characters. The characters in Camilla felt like very real people to me by the end of this book. This is not just due to the fact that it is almost a thousand pages long - I felt this way within the first few chapters. Ms. Burney was a great inspiration to many later authors, most notably, Jane Austen. In fact, scholars believe that Camilla was the direct influence for Austen's masterpiece, Sense and Sensibility. The flavor of Austen's books were clearly cooked up while she was reading Ms. Burney, and you'll find that the inspiration and enjoyment Ms. Austen received while reading Camilla, as well as other Burney books, is no mystery.The story follows two sisters, Eugenia and Camilla, and their cousin, Indiana, in the months preceding their marriages. Not only are the lives of these three women explored, but we see several equally strong male characters and the supporting cast is as delightful, frustrating, and dramatic as good supporting characters should be. Although Camilla is darling and sympathetic, you may, as I did, find that much of what she goes through could have been easily avoided. Much of what occurs involves Camilla's suitor, Edgar, who decides, based on the advice of a friend, to look for her faults and be sure she loves him before declaring his love and asking her to marry him. On the other hand, Camilla, who is deeply in love with Edgar is given advice by her father to avoid him and hide her feelings for him as much as possible (to avoid complications in their already established friendship). This of course, places everything in a muddle as both are working against each other. On top of this, Camilla seems to have a knack for finding herself in situations, which Edgar always just happens to witness, that appear less than flattering to her character. The reader finds themselves frustrated with the continual thousand page cycle that ensues, but fear not, by the end you find that Ms. Burney planned and shares these frustrations. As you can imagine, the book deals greatly with the expectations placed on young women, trust, prejudice, and giving individuals, especially those we love, the benefit of the doubt.Ms. Burney writes about her characters in such a vivid manner that you feel as if you can actually see what's going on. Facial expressions, emotions, settings, etc. are painted with subtle yet strong master strokes. Besides giving us Camilla's story in full, Ms. Burney gives us multiple strong sub plots. Eugenia's story is perhaps the most dramatic and in my opinion, more powerful and moving that the main story. I will not spoil the book by giving you the details other than to say that she overcomes insurmountable odds, and does so with a grace that will endear her to you.Besides giving us wonderful human interest stories, Ms. Burney once again weaves intrigue, wisdom, tragedy, comedy, and a host of surprising plot twists in this book that will hold the reader glued to every page. It's length was never felt. In fact, the closer I came to the finish line, the slower I read because I didn't want the book to end. Despite it's being a thousand pages long, I finished the book rapidly and never felt a numb, boring moment. Camilla will capture you from her opening pages and hold you betwixt the beginning and end in utter turmoil, suspense, awe, and, most importantly, rapture."},{"Title":"Camilla (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Along with Belinda and The History of Sir Charles Grandison, essential reading for all Jane Austen enthusiasts. In Camilla you will find Austen's inspiration for many different characters and situations. The 17 year old heroine of the novel is Burney's most enchanting. Her adventures are rich and surprising.The color of the 18th century infuses this book. Bring handkerchiefs, for there is pathos aplenty, but in a pure, non-cloying form. Eugenia, the stunted and unlovely but spiritually and intellectually exquisite sister of Camilla provides the soul of the book. This book contains suspense, glamour, romance, great wisdom and greater folly. Anyone who adores 18th C lit. will be sorry to turn the last page, though a thousand preceded it. In many ways this is Burney's happiest and most hopeful book. It was written as she was celebrating her liberation from spinsterhood into the estate of a married woman at age 40. We would be very lucky if anyone ever thought to turn this one into a film."},{"Title":"Camilla (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Though there may have been a few slight annoyances about this book (Dr. Marchmont, Edgar's suspicious nature), for the most part, it was highly readable and very well-written. The Eugenia subplot was fascinating and the characters were well-rounded and interesting (especially Sir Sedley Clarendel, who I thought showed a lot of potential, and who was much more than the fop he appeared to be). I should warn you (especially everybody new to Burney)that it starts fairly slowly, but the plot really picks up a couple hundred pages in. There were several times that I got so into reading it (especially the last 200 pages) that I ignored homework or other things that I was expected to do. Altogether, I highly recommend Camilla to anyone who wants to read something engaging, entertaining and different."},{"Title":"Camilla (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"As a devoted Austen fan and having read Northanger Abbey where Fanny Burney's Camilla is mentioned I thought I'll give the book a try. Although it proved quite enjoyable for a time, but after 500 pages and at least \\"500\\" recurring events where the main (?) characters, Camilla & Edgar, almost seem to make it just to end up further and further apart I got really bored. The novel would be much better if it were 400 pages shorter.Burney might have inspired Jane Austen, but Austen exceeded and outsmarted her in every way. Where Austen's plots are tight without any unnecessary subplots and going-ons, just for the sake of writing another 200 pages, Burney keeps repeating events, her characters find themselves over and over in similar circumstances without adding anything new to plot or to characterization, making the whole novel very tiresome after a while. I admit that Jane Austen also used clich&eacute; characters but her genius breathed life into them - they are well-drawn and have depth - while Burney's characters - even or especially the main characters, with the exception of the wonderful Eugenia - stay flat and common place, as if cut out from a newspaper.In my opinion, Camilla, the heroine is simply one of the most frustratingly perfect female clich&eacute; characters that appeared in print. Besides some very common place deeds she doesn't seem very special at all. What is apparent right form the start that her family, friends and admirers assume her perfect without any other ground that her being pretty and good-humoured. And it seems the author was quite satisfied with this kind of characterization for she didn't feel the need to emphasize Camilla's good qualities with any external actions really but what is clich&eacute; and boring. As a result, Camilla remains a rather one-sided, flat character without any real progress than being understood rather than misunderstood by Edgar at the end of the painfully long 1000 pages. The most incredible and discrediting thing to me was when at a social assembly the boorish suitor of Camilla - not at all a gentleman - starts abusing Eugenia's appearance and Camilla instead of putting him to place or at least leaving him on the spot if she is such a coward to say anything - like I am sure Elizabeth Bennet, Elinor Dashwood or Emma Woodhouse would have done - just remains there sitting stupidly and mutely. So much for sisterly love!I tend to agree with my fellow reviewers that Eugenia is a far more interesting and profound character, her personal tragedy and the courage she bears it with make her endearing. Hers was the -unfortunately only - subplot that I followed with the most excitement and sympathy.Still, the novel was an interesting experience for me to know what was considered popular reading in that period and as such, quite useful with my studies."},{"Title":"Camilla (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Although this book may seem intimidating due to its length, it kept me entertained the whole time. I am a huge Jane Austen fan, and I had also read Burney's Evelina. After reading Camilla, I have found an author that I enjoy as much as Jane Austen: Fanny Burney. Burney's works seem neglected by Hollywood; while reading this novel, I kept imagining what a great role some of the characters would provide for a movie. (However, I couldn't think of one scene which I wouldn't be disappointed to have left out in a screenplay of normal length.) Camilla's uncle (Sir Hugh Tyrold), her brother Lionel, and various suitors actually had me laughing out loud. This book is 1000 pages entirely composed of \\"the good parts\\" of Jane Austen's novels. I felt like I was there in the world of Camilla. I cringed everytime Camilla did something that Edgar, her love interest, interpreted in the wrong way. It was almost painful, and I could sympathize. It is a great novel which should be a part of the library of any fan of Austen or 18th century literature."},{"Title":"Camilla (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Don't get me wrong, /Camilla/ (1796) is a fantastic novel, and an excellent piece of late eighteenth-century literature; however, after reading all of Burney's other novels, her journals, and her plays, I have to say this novel is my least favorite of all her work. While Burney again demonstrates her talent for satire (especially in her comprehensive representation of all \\"degrees\\" or \\"ranks\\" of society), her arch critiques, and stunning insights into human interiority and social interactions, /Camilla/, to me, lacks the \\"edgy-ness\\" (for lack of a better word) of her other work. There are really no moments comparable, for instance, to /Cecilia/'s (1782) masquerade sequence or Harrell's suicide at Vauxhall, nor to /The Wanderer/'s (1814) acute sensitivity to terror and the vexed questions of liberty so closely associated with the revolutionary period. And the \\"hero\\" of /Camilla/, Edgar, is certainly no Mortimer Delvile, Lord Orville, or, my personal favorite--Albert Harleigh. In fact, one of the biggest issues I have with /Camilla/ is the fact that the hero takes the advice of a professed misogynist--a close friend of his who, spurned by a woman in his youth, encourages Edgar to judge Camilla based on her actions, without deigning to point out that she deserves to speak for herself in regard to them, too. Acting more like a judge and a tool of regulation than a sensible, spirited, and intriguing lover, Edgar is a hero I just cannot get on board with. Camilla, however, is interesting enough, if not a little unlucky when she appears in public before Edgar--but that's exactly Burney's point: when society (and a patriarchal society at that) chooses to judge women based on \\"outward semblance\\" alone, how can she appear other than as a weak and inherently flawed second-citizen in need of male regulation? While Edgar learns, somewhat, in time to not trust to appearances and to hear Camilla speak for herself, it comes a little too late for me--I spend the entire novel resenting him, and the end doesn't really make up for it.Still, I love this novel more than a lot of other works of the same period, mainly because I find Burney to be perhaps one of the most enchanting and innovative writers ever. For those, however, who are looking for another Burney novel after thoroughly enjoying her delightful and more light-hearted debut work, /Evelina/ (1778), I would sincerely recommend picking up either /Cecilia/ or /The Wanderer/ before /Camilla/--if you're going to read 900 pages, you should read her best! /Cecilia/, my favorite novel of all time (although /The Wanderer/ is a close, close second), is widely regarded as one of the best novels ever written, not just in the eighteenth century! And for those Jane Austen lovers out there, you may recognize some familiar characterizations and plots--and Burney's famous repetition of the follies of \\"PRIDE & PREJUDICE\\" that pervade the end of the novel only drive home the ways in which Austen admired and interacted textually with Burney.I'd also recommend, if you enjoy this or other Burney novels, Maria Edgeworth's /Belinda/ (1801), Elizabeth Inchbald's /A Simple Story/ (1791), and Charlotte Smith's /Emmeline/ (1788)."},{"Title":"Camilla (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Fanny Burney does not write \\"light\\" novels. They are complex, heavily populated and interwoven with numerous events that solidify the characters personalities.If you can keep up with all the twist and turns, Camilla is quite a satisfying novel. The heroine is a sensitive and naive girl, who after several tests of character and tragic disappointments meets a just and lovely end. Along the way, you become acquainted with her family and friends. They instantly endear themselves as deeply as Camilla does, and you find yourself cheering for their success or deserved demise.I especially love Burney's obvious enjoyment of the use of language. She lingers over the words and is in no hurry to bring brevity or economy in her narration. Its linguistic decadence is a wonderful contrast to todays \\"txtg\\" & abbreviated \\"msging\\", IMO.I am sure we could find several passages that could have been effectively edited, but then it would not personify 18 century, classic, British literature.Well worth the investment of time, as Burney always is!"},{"Title":"Camilla (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"This is a long novel, but well worth the effort. If you like Jane Austen then you should find this a rewarding book to read."},{"Title":"Camilla (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"Like the other readers who reviewed this book, I am a huge Austen fan. I've read &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; so many times I can quote whole paragraphs by heart. So when I discovered Fanny Burney, a contemporary of Austen's, I couldn't wait to get into her books. &quot;Camilla&quot; is the second book by Burney I've read, and it's reinforced my initial impression that Burney is not up to Austen's caliber as a novelist. She tells an interesting story, but her characters seem too much like stock pieces acting on a stage, and the overly dramatic dialogue doesn't help matters much. Austen's genius was in not only telling a mesmerizing tale, but in bringing her characters so completely to life that they seem totally real. Austen's novels are of their own time and for all time; Burney's books are stuck rigidly in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.A singular problem with &quot;Camilla&quot; is Camilla herself; she comes across more as a sweet but empty-headed ingenue, tripping from one mess to another and managing to make mountains out of molehills. Her younger sister Eugenia, crippled and disfigured with smallpox but well-read and profound, is a far more interesting figure, and if she had been the center of the book, it would have been a far more interesting book. By 600 pages we get kind of tired of Camilla's incessant mess-ups, and just wish she'd hurry up and marry Edgar and have done with it. As another reviewer stated, I would like to see &quot;Camilla&quot; brought to the screen; with the fat trimmed from the novel, a good script, and in the hands of a good director, it might be a better movie than a book. Taken on its own, &quot;Camilla&quot; is not a bad book at all; but there is no way it can stand up to Austen."},{"Title":"Camilla (Oxford World's Classics)","review":"The story follows two sisters, Eugenia and Camilla, and their cousin, Indiana, in the months preceding their marriages. I have been meaning to read this book for a long time, I wanted to read some of the books that influced my favorite writers such as Jane Austen. Fanny Burney's name is always mentioned so I picked up Camilla at a used bookstore and decided to give it a try. It is a very long book and at times can be so frustrating because you just want the characters to get on with it and be over. The misunderstandings, are endless and Burney has an excellent ability to allow her readers to feel all of the emotions of her characters. There were points of the books where I was laughing out loud and other points where I was crying my eyes out. I have to say that I haven't read a book like this in a long time that had the ability to totally affect my emotions and make me think about it long after it was finished. I can truly understand why so many authors have been influenced by Fanny Burney her writing is witty, funny, light and dark and I look forward to adding her other two books in my large to be read pile."},{"Title":"Seventy thousand miles of war: Being one man's Odyssey on many fronts,","review":"In his foreward, Chaplin admits that he saw enough blood and horror as a soldier in World War I. His war reporting will thus concentrate on non-combat, human interest observations. (Isn't this a bit like being a surgeon with a fear of handling sharp objects?) This book deals largely with events of 1942, which Chaplin recognizes as the turning point of the war. It touches on earlier observations in France and Africa, but its largest sections are on India and Russia (with brief but interesting stops in Bagdad and Teheran). In India, the author is critical of British colonialism-as-usual lassitude in the face of an underestimated threat from Japan. He also gives us a negative portrait of Gandhi. In Russia, he is struck by the total mobilization of the civilian population for war. This, he concludes, is why the Soviets will not only be on this conflict's winning side, but why they will also be a formidable force in shaping the world's future. Well written enough, this account leaves the reader discontent that Chaplin chose to dwell on such mundane subjects as he reported from these momentous places and times."},{"Title":"Building an Aviary","review":"This is a must read for anyone interested in building an aviary.

Given the somewhat inappropriate codename of \`Operation Mincemeat, the body of a young man was dressed in the uniform of a major in the Royal Marines and furnished with a complete set of false papers. The minute detail which went into those papers included two used cinema ticket stubs plus a photograph and letters from a fictional girlfriend. Handcuffed to his wrist was a briefcase inside which were copies of a supposed invasion plan. His body was then set adrift so that it would be washed up on the coast of Spain in the certain knowledge that all those papers would be handed over to the German authorities in that country.Perhaps one might be forgiven for thinking that obtaining a suitable dead body during WW2 would have been relatively easy but not so. The human body could not be kept in storage for too long before assuming a certain state of unnatural decomposition which would have alerted German doctors that all was not as it seemed. It was also imperative that the body was washed ashore in the right place. After all, it could hardly be parachuted into Berlin!!!Eventually, a man of the right size, condition and age to suit the false persona of Major Martin Royal Marines was found dead in the streets of London and his body used to completely deceive the Germans. The full account of this amazing tale is retold by the person who was placed in charge of the deception. When first published, this book became a best seller.It was intended for the identity of the deceased to have remained a secret forever. It was not until 1996 (or thereabouts) that the true identity of the person was revealed by an amateur historian who discovered him to have been a down-and-out who survived by begging on the streets of London. Unfortunately, he also suffered from some form of mental illness and was found dead shortly after having been turned down for military service. The cause of death was recorded as having died from ingesting rat poison. In Spain, however, that same man got a very different death certificate before being buried in a local graveyard.Av truly remarkable, almost fanciful, tale from WW2.NM"},{"Title":"Jihad: World War in 2036","review":"MacDonald Reid's Jihad: World War in 2036, in an excellent narrative. Unfortunately, while the idea is there, the book suffers from lack of a compelling story. Putting aside, the lack of differences as to how the military would actully function in 2036, the book, instead of being a story, simply descibes all of the events. You can never relate to any of the characters, good or bad, and they all seem cartoonish (with every other line ending in an exclaimation mark). The book's saving grace is that the author obviously shows that he knows the subject area, and put considerably thought as to how things might be different 40 years from now (though, I think he should have gone allot farther).

Nicolas Guillen has constructed his book length poem of prose fragments, smaller self-contained poems, and other textual forms. The result is a dazzling collage which deconstructs the political, racial, and linguistic anxieties of 20th century Cuba.This bilingual edition has Guillen's Spanish original on each odd-numbered page, with translator Vera Kutzinski's English version on each even-numbered page. Kutzinski has also written an outstanding introduction which contains insights into Guillen's life and art.Guillen is a master of wordplay, &quot;special effects,&quot; and cultural critique. Whether he is capturing the effect of a blinking restaurant sign, creating imaginary newspaper advertisements, or peppering his verses with sarcastic footnotes, he shows that he is a wizard of the word. And he has serious things to say about racism, Cuban-U.S. relations, consumerism, and other controversial topics. &quot;The Daily Daily&quot; is an important work which should be read by scholars of Latin American literature, by fans of experimental writing, and by those interested in Cuban history and culture."},{"Title":"Healing from Depression: Twelve Weeks to a Better Mood","review":"A well-written account of coping with very deep depression combined with anxiety and agitation. The author spends a fair amount of time talking about how religion and spirituality played a major role in helping him, so if this is a major turnoff for you for some reason keep that in mind (interestingly he describes himself as having grown up in a middle-class Jewish family but the spiritual awakening he undergoes seems to be within the context of Christianity, although I don't remember if he ever gives more specific descriptions of it along theological lines). He spends the first half of the book talking about his suffering, roughly, and the second half about his recovery program. His prescription for recovery, in rough order of importance, seems to be exercise, spirituality, social support, medication, therapy and diet. (Don't take this as an absolute description it's off the top of my head.)Also talks some about his struggles to find a long-term inpatient program, and his inability to do so under current insurance schemas (he winds up doing a day program, and recommends it for others.) Is not shy about talking about his own shortcomings, such as his divorce and the fact that he used to write self-help books, but was unable to follow his own advice when struggling with depressive symptoms.Spends the obligatory amount of time paying lip service to biochemical and genetic theories of mental/emotional distress. Also discusses suicide, both in the context of his own impulse(s) towards that act as well as people close to him who acted upon it (the book is dedicated to one of them).A useful complement to the genre of personal accounts of psychiatric suffering."},{"Title":"Healing from Depression: Twelve Weeks to a Better Mood","review":"Douglas Bloch has written a clear, thorough and wonderful book.

I found it in the lost-and-found bin at work; thumbed through some passages during lunch breaks; waited 30 days until no one claimed it, and took it.Only when I read it through did I realize this is one of the most important books I own.I am not well-traveled, but enjoy Crichton's fictional work, from &quot;Andromeda Strain&quot; to &quot;Jurassic Park.&quot; He is obviously intelligent, imaginative, and writes well. His adventures abroad are fascinating. But what changed my life and the lives of several people I know are the recountings of inner experiences: the things no rational person acknowledges day-to-day.In this book, Michael Crichton- a medical student- admits to finding Ram Dass's New Age viewpoint puzzling and strange at first. In subsequent chapters, he quits his promising medical career to pursue writing. From there his exploits become stuff of fantasy; shooting a film with Sean Connery, traveling to countries he had previously never heard of, becoming rationally convinced that auras are real and can be seen.This is a book I read that transformed me from a skeptic to an open-minded pragmatist. That may seem like schlock at first, but think about it. Do you have the opportunity and means to travel to Thailand, or Hunza? Have you consulted intuitive psychics from around the world, or sliced open a cadaver?Buy this book. It may inspire you to explore inner realities like me, or reassure your agnostic point of view. In any case, you will read wondrous descriptions of Crichton's personal journeys. You will be compelled."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"In the Preface of this highly informative and entertaining collection of musings, experiences and travels of the body, mind and spirit, Crichton explains the reasons that prompted him to write this book:\\"If you are a writer, the assimilation of important experiences almost obliges you to write about them. Writing is how you make the experience your own, how you explore what it means to you, how you come to possess it, and ultimately release it.\\"Crichton explores our need for direct experience. His premise is that modern man has lost his innate sense of himself and existence, relying on opinions, concepts and information structures, second hand knowledge, in order to make sense of the world, which, in the end, is a false perception. He proposes that the modern city-dweller, for example, cannot even see the stars at night due to the false light around him, causing a serious alienation from himself and reality. We've become so reliant on the media, hyper -realty, that simulation has become the real, thus we have generally lost our bearings, we have lost track of ourselves in relation to the greater scheme of things. Travel for Crichton, then, helped him to have \\"direct experience\\", thus achieving a greater sense of himself and his place on the planet. This book is about these direct experiences.In Travels there are twenty- eight essays covering the author's early life in medical school and his bout with psychiatry, moving on to his first years in Hollywood as an aspiring writer and filmmaker, to his experiences in exotic lands and his musings on his experiences with the esoteric and the unexplained. These last essays are extremely interesting because Crichton attempts to rationally explain those phenomenon that dwell in the irrational - entities, other dimensional realms and the underrated \\"sixth\\" sense, that we've come to know as intuition. His proposition is that, fundamentally, just because certain phenomena cannot be explained \\"rationally\\", doesn't mean it doesn't exist. And to dismiss such phenomenon because it cannot hold up under the rigors of scientific analysis, is a mistake.Crichton's Travels is a writer's exploration of himself and the world. It is an entertaining chronicle, at times hilarious and sad, and ultimately a strong argument for the need for all of us to have \\"direct experience\\", reinforcing his view that we also need greater insight into the mystical as well as the scientific, in order to truly understand ourselves and existence.As usual, similar to all his books, Crichton has given us something informative, as well as tremendously entertaining."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Not many people can take an outrageous idea and run with it, so convincingly that there are people walking around in the world right now that actually believe dinosaurs have been brought back from extinction to act in big-budget movies! But Crichton is THAT good. In this non-fiction \\"Travels\\" you actually get the chance to ride around on Michael Crichton's 6-foot-above-the-ground shoulders (and STILL not see over his gigantic head!), peer out the windows of his eyes, and along the journey(s) discover the author to be a very authentic, introspective, one-part cowardly and six parts courageous, confused, flawed, highly intelligent, sometimes silly, sometimes blundering and yet always a tragically deep HUMAN every bit as fascinating as his best characters, kind of a Quantum Theory mentality in tour de force action. His early days as a doctor supporting himself as a fiction writer (fainting at the sight of his own blood) are just as engrossing as his soul-seeking travels about the globe, whether he's being swept unstoppably through a cloud of sharks, dealing with the frustrating anger of his father's untimely death, nearly fainting at a 300-pound gorilla's charge, or riding on the top of a train with Sean Connery, it's very difficult to put this book down. I strongly like most of Crichton's novels, but I strongly loved this non-fiction memoir."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I read through all the one-star reviews, and they all say the same thing: they didn't like the book because Crichton is a whiny, self-absorbed cry baby.They seem to believe that Crichton somehow unknowingly portrayed himself this way. But the point is that he is fully aware of it. He talks about his weaknesses, his inexorable insecurities, and the experiences that helped him to change those things. The one-star reviewers wanted a cowboy or Indiana Jones type, but Crichton uses the book to expose himself to his readers by sharing thoughts and attitudes he formerly held, some of which those one-star reviewers have doubtlessly had themselves. Many are not thoughts and attitudes anyone is proud to have had in retrospect, and it shows a great measure of courage to stake his reputation with the publication of this book.And whats this whining about \\"he thinks of African tribal women as animals\\"? It was very clear he describing the personal impact of a cultural gulf of greater magnitude than he'd ever experienced. He finished that chapter by describing the behavior of African tribes people as indicating they must have felt the same way about him, and that the notion on both sides was, in the end, absurd.The pompousness of traveling somewhere just because other people could not? Crichton was making himself vulnerable to see what the hell he was made of. Its a shame the one-star reviewers can't get that much out of the book... I'm not sure they would get anything out of traveling themselves. They all seem to think they've reached self-realization in a vacuum."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Thirty-seven stories of one writers accounts. Be it somewhere without or somewhere within, this book is the best auto-biographical adventure I have ever read. Crichton narrates his stories with comical candor and psychological accuity. He blends the exotic and phenomenal into a perfect creation until it transcends the wonderous and becomes human. Not a single story is without it's own life lesson for the author. His ability to relate each episode to the reader and make the reader understand the lesson's he learned is unmistakable. His interactions with women, (there are a quite a few) animals and spirits are humorously expelled as he entwines the audience with his wit and candor. Crichton's massive accomplishments are towered only by his impressive feats of earth and soul. All in all this book will be one your favorites, for every reason I can think of."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Travels consists of a series of short stories, autobiographical in nature, relating various of Michael Crichton's experiences. Many of the stories have an element of spirituality, as the Author seems to constantly be looking for greater meaning, or greater understanding of himself and life in general. From tarot, auras, and past lives, to spoon bending, and chakras, Crichton has experienced it. It was interesting to see how a Harvard educated MD approached these different fringe phenomena, and was able to relate them as well as his own sense of curiosity in each of the different stories.The book has sparked some curiosity in me, and has made me consider that there may very well be phenomena that we don't fully understand. While I still am not a believer in psychic powers, or fortune tellers, I will go so far as to say that there are many mysteries in life that I have not yet experienced.Overall I found the stories interesting, but short. Considering they are short stories, this is not a bad thing, but there were definitely times when I was craving more information, more detail, more writing. This isn't really a complaint so much as me whining. It was a very interesting collection of stories, and I think some of you will enjoy reading about them. I generally enjoy anything that gives me more information about the author so that I can get a feel for where their writing is coming from."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This was a truly fascinating text -- Crichton has led a lifeas rich and diverse as anyone could hope for -- travellingto Nepal, attending psychic parties in California -- he'sdone it all. Seeing what he's done and where he's gone reallygave me a new &quot;confidence&quot; in reading his ficiton novels -- thisman is basically an authority on anything and everything.The most interesting part of this bookwasn't his travelogues (although they were quite interesting in their own right),but rather his discussions of person-to-person relationships.The discussions of his relationships with women were particularlyenlightening -- he's really had some unpleasant experiences withmembers of the opposite sex, and after reading them, you'llunderstand the real-life roots of some of the female charactersin his fiction works (read Disclosure again after reading Travels...)After reading his personal philosophy on what men and womenare both REALLY after in a relationship, I had to putthe book down and think for a while -- he, more so thanany self-help book I've ever seen, hits the nail right onthe head in just a ten-page vignette.Another striking thing about this book is that (unlike someof his later works -- Lost World, for example...) Crichtion seems to be writing for himself,without any thought toward any movies that might be made fromthis book, and he reveals some VERY personal things in thisbook, much more personal that what might be revealed insome 20/20 interview (it is one of his earlier works,and he may not have beem so audience-conscious when he wrote it).Overall, this is a fascinating book -- it's really compellingto see Crichton turn his analytic mind away from current eventsand focus it on himself instead."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This was only the second Michael Crichton book I've read, afterDisclosure (which I read without knowing anything about Crichton, andbecause somebody left it on an airplane). Since reading Disclosure Ihad taken much more note of him, seemingly seeing his name on everythird movie or TV show I watched - and gradually associating that namewith a high level of interest and quality. Even Crichton's &quot;popculture&quot; creations had more depth to them than I first thought. Ipicked up Travels at a used book store (I wasn't looking for it, butit sounded interesting from the blurb) and found the book fascinating,consistently entertaining, and enriching. It raises my spirits todiscover that someone so influential in creating the entertainmentcontent by which I, my children, and the culture I live in arenourished is really extraordinarily talented, curious, intrepid,soul-searching, and -- likeable. Crichton's outlook and his life arean inspiration. He has lived richly and courageously, with aworld-class hunger for the outer and inner frontiers of experience.Make no mistake, Travels catalogs Crichton's travels in the innerworld as much as in the outer world. (Be prepared for first-handaccounts of spoon-bending and aura fluffing!) As long as you're goingto be exposed to a lot of Michael Crichton regardless, you might aswell get to know the guy"},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I enjoy Crichton's fiction and this exampleof his non-fiction is not a disappointment.I have always found his books and movies to be basedon fascinating ideas. Jurassic Park- Dinosaur DNA from mosquitos trapped in amber?? What a concept! Now reading about his personal experiences and travels I get a glimpse at the man behindhis books.This book is wonderful: it's honest, rude, interesting, self-depreciating. And the range of topics is vast: spoon bending, seeing auras, swimming with sharks, to climbing Kilimanjaro.At times I caught myself laughing out loud. When he talksto his cactus you almost can't believe that he shares this with you.I am a big Paul Theroux fan, but I find Michael's insights on travelling a bit more interesting. Crichton has a gift for storytelling and itcertainly shows here. I would love to go to lunch with himto hear the tales he can tell.Don't miss this book, it's not as flashy as his others, butI think that is what makes it the most interesting."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This book is engrossing because Crichton seems to make a 180 degree turn in the way he sees the world throughout the course of the narrative. His personal evolution involves many interesting, sometimes bizarre adventures that made me look at the practice of medicine and new age philosophies in a very different light."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This book is amazing. Not only does it have the great Crichton voyeuristic side of being taken into different worlds, but it also has a reveletory nature that really makes you stop and think about life. I am a super cynical person, but this book made me extremely contemplative about human nature.Yes, a lot of it is like a time trip into the 70s (auras, bending spoons, esp) but since Crichton is SO well educated and smart, it makes it much more interesting to read about than from some new agey-type that you can just write off as being a weirdo. When hiking in the desert I've thought many times of him talking to a cactus and had a good giggle.Also I really liked how each chapter is a self-contained story.When oh when will he write Travels 2???"},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Published in 1988, this autobiographical hodge-podge of medical training, travel and dabbling in the occult is at times fascinating but ultimately ends with a 22 page pretend speech to a group of skeptics about why Crichton believes in various occult practices like channeling and talking to cactus plants (I'm not making this up).The title, \\"Travels\\", and even the jacket blurb leave you thinking this might be about travel - you know like taking a trip to Australia. And though there are interesting short accounts of travel to Asia and Africa, these accounts get fewer and shorter as you are unwittingly led into Crichton's real purpose in writing this book - noting his personal beliefs and experiences in the occult and trying to convince the reader that there is something to them.The first 1/3 or so of the book includes Crichton's experiences in Medical School in New England. I found this fascinating mostly because Crichton seemed to always feel so superior to not just the other students struggling to learn the art of medicine, but also his teachers, the other doctors and pretty much anyone else he came in contact with. What a colossal ego the author had! Many accomplished people have these over-sized egos, and you can even argue that you need an over-size ego to accomplish great things, but it is hard to accept the views of someone with seemingly so little perception regarding others. And while there are strangely anti-social and uncompassionate doctors out there, they are few and far between in my 20 year experience as a physician.In case you think that Crichton only treats doctors with disdain, wait until you read about other people with whom Crichton had contact. After medical school, Crichton makes a ton of money and becomes famous via his fiction and movies and then seemingly spends much of the rest of his life wondering why he feels so empty. I really felt sorry for this guy by the end of the book. I also wondered what kind of venereal diseases he caught in this life of frequent marriages, promiscuous sex and libertine travels. I admit I was rather disgusted when Crichton and his buddies visit a child brothel in Thailand.But most of the book, and clearly the theme of the book, is Crichton's dabbling in the occult. Crichton tells us of out-of-body experiences where he floats up in the room and looks down at his body, hearing a cactus talk to him, pulling three entities (a bug, a devil, and a little man with a hat who sat behind one shoulder) out of him, paying various fortune-tellers to tell his fortune, noticing auras, playing with energy fields and re-living his life as a gladiator. (I'm not making this up.) I have to admit, I was intrigued with why a shadow entity needs a hat - but that's neither here nor there. When Crichton tries to convince the reader that there really are energy fields that surround bodies and you have passed your hands over tens of thousands of patients as I have and never felt a thing - well, it's hard to respect anything else this guy says. So, call me a skeptic. (Wait, I know, I wasn't holding a crystal. That must be it.)Crichton is a decent writer and quite imaginative in his novels and I frankly don't know and don't care if some of this \\"autobiography\\" is made up or not. But the obsession with self wore thin after a while and when an author spends much more time discussing how other people thought his feet looked funny after his blisters healed than on the experience of being atop Kilamanjaro - well, just know what you are getting in to before you read.Due to the occult subject matter, generally whiny tone, and the author's disdain for most others and certainly any mundane person or belief, I can only give this book 2 stars. But it was interesting, in a voyeuristic way."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"While I agree that the adventures that Michael Crichton has written about in this book are sometimes pretty interesting, I found by the end of the book that I was disgusted with him and really ended up not liking him at all. It is impossible to write about personal travels without your true personality coming through in your writing- and his came across as arrogant and self righteous. He seemed to think that people should treat him a certain way because of who he was (or what he had-which obviously was plenty of money and free time). I pictured him as some sort of grown-up, spoiled rich kid who has not an ounce of humble in him. He's obviously a successful writer- but for travel adventure reading--stick with Paul Cahill, Bill Bryson and David Quammen--all guys who go to wild places, have cool experiences, get along with the locals and are funny. Those three seem like really good guys that you could actually have a great time travelling with."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"When I was young I was an avid reader of Michael Crichton, I constantly admired his way as a writer to draw the reader in so conclusively and to keep them there.Travels is a WHOLE different story. This is a semi-autobiographical tale of the years after medical school and beyond. Now, this is not the usual autobiography, about how he fell in love or how he loves his job, this is a story of self discovery and search for himself. Much of the first half of the book covers travels around the world and different instances in his life that he wants to share. The second half discovers the paranormal, psychics, astral travel, and seeing auras. These are true tales of how he searches out the meanings and explanations for unexplainable things.This is by far my favorite book of all times. I cannot recommend this more. It has the same form of drawing the reader into the story, but also takes a more objective perspective on life, citing stories without holding back even when it makes him looks bad. You will find yourself within this book."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I wouldn't exactly say that I'm a fan of Michael Crichton's, though I have read several of his books. For the most part I find his fiction to be shallow and formulaic, even if it is a formula that succeeds in building dramatic tension and holding it for the duration. (I must confess that I have actually missed my train stop several times while reading a Crichton thriller, which is ample testimony to his ability to 'grip'.) I never thought of reading him for any deep insight into the human psyche or the world around us, though. That is why I was so pleasantly surprised by Travels, the autobiographical tale of his journey through life. Crichton has an open, inquiring, and supple mind, coupled with the honesty to portray himself in not always the most favorable light. The emotional and intellectual growth he undergoes in the course of the book far surpasses that of any of his fictional characters, and his accounts of forays into such scientifically suspect realms as psychic readings, auras, spoon bending, and so on display a certain courage for someone with his educational background. The last chapter, his (imagined) address to the American Skeptics' Society (or whatever they call themselves), was in itself worth the price of the book. I just wish he could break free of his success as a formula fiction writer and incorporate some of his life experiences and insights into his novels. Then I think he would really come into his own as a writer!"},{"Title":"Travels","review":"\\"Travels\\" is a collection of essays forming an autobiography of this amazing man's adult life. Michael Crichton is a modern renaissance man--a disillusioned doctor, a fantastically successful writer, a world traveler, an amateur practitioner of paranormal phenomena. Everyone knows his books, but you don't have to be a fan (I'm not particularly) to enjoy \\"Travels.\\"But what kind of guy is he really? Obviously extremely intelligent, tall and good-looking (just glance at the cover), at ease in all kinds of situations. Self-absorbed, over-confident, a bit arrogant? I thought so by the end of the book. I originally read this for the chapter on Kilimanjaro--he made it to the top, despite being foolishly unprepared and having ill-fitting boots. Only a supremely confident person would try something like this. Diving in Bonaire, he attempts several increasingly dangerous dives, ignoring warnings, pushing the edge of the envelope to near disaster.I was also uneasy about how he described the one personal relationship he mentions--after what seemed to be many years of faithfully participating in his adventures, Loren and he simply discovered their hopes for the future lay in different directions. Or so he says. Maybe he was just being discreet, maybe just cold--I really wondered what was going on in her mind, though.Overall, this is quite an interesting book--not too heavy, very well-written. You don't have to like Crichton's books--or him personally--to enjoy this collection."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I first read Travels as a teenager at the suggestion of a boy I was trying to impress. I ended up loving the book and hating the boy, who never read the whole thing to begin with! & years later, I picked it up in a used bookstore.I am of the school of thought that there are too many good books I haven't yet read, so why re-read something I already have? This is only the second book I have re-read in my whole life and I plan on doing it over and over again.For all of those readers who feel that Crichton comes across as arrogant and self-absorbed, well, you got it about half right. Crichton points out over and over his mistakes, his shortcomings, his arrogance. He sees admits to his flaws, puts them out there for everyone to see, and tries to learn from them. I feel it would be much more arrogant for him to gloss over his flaws and have us all think him perfect.This is an intimate book and, even though it reads much like a journal, I have gotten so much out of it by example. I do not aspire to BE Michael Crichton, but he is one insightful guy and has had an interesting life. AS he says about tarot cards at one point- the value of the cards is not in their ability to show you aspects of yourself, but in serving as something for you to project on. This book is not a guide or a success story or an adventure; treat it like a lovely conversation with an interesting dinner guest: informative, impressive, sometimes funny, and, above all, HUMAN."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"It's always fun to randomly pick something off of the shelf and discover, after about 20 pages, that it is quite good. I've never been a fan of Crichton's other books - pseudo-science thrillers that most seem to be - so it was just luck that for some reason I picked this off the shelf in a used bookstore. Again, I usually don't find much pleasure in reading paranoia-inducing pseudo-science thrillers and the authors of such novels usually seem to me to be after money and nothing more.However, Crichton appears to have quite an interesting story. The book starts out with some of his experiences as a pre-med and medical student that helped form some of his opinions about science. The tales culminate in his decision to leave the medical profession due to so many conflicts with the methodology of treating humans, well, basically products. Interwoven into the 'early days' is some information on early travels in addition to some background on his rather spotty relationships and family problems.After moving to California to try to make a new career writing and working on movies Crichton begins to dabble in, shall we say, somewhat 'new age' spiritualism including psychics. It is only after a several years of such dabbling, in addition to some other large events that occur during his travels, that Crichton gradually comes to accept that there is much much more to the universe than all that we are taught in science textbooks.This is the major theme that gradually is revealed over the course of the book: what we experience is relative to our state of mind and that state can range from all-encompassing to completely self-centered. I believe the final pages, where Crichton presents some quite apt commentary on our new religion of science, have so much impact simply due to Crichton's unflinching presentation of his personal growth. For that really is what makes the book such a great read: Crichton never backs away from showing the reader his frailties and foibles.Great fun and much more relevant today than when it was first published."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Some of the people already writing the reviews here have described Mr. Crichton's autobiographical account as self absorbed and whiny and I have to say that I didn't find any whining in his book. If anything he has been remarkably honest about his strengths and weaknesses and also his mistakes. Take for instance, when he decided to hike Mount Kilimanjaro and he wore the wrong shoes and almost had to turn back because the blisters on his feet were so bad. Or, when he went to Thailand and he was made fun of because he was tall and he made fun of himself stooping self consciously around the Buddha and making the cultural mistakes of pointing the soles of his feet at someone and waving with his left hand. I find him very open minded, not only about himself but about the world, which could also be why he has gotten as far as he has today. As for him being a lost, confused soul, who isn't? For those of you who want easy answers go read the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series. Michael Crichton is simply sharing his experience with you."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Probably my favorite Crichton book. It's a compilation of true, autobiographical stories from Crichton's life, from his days in med school to vacations to foreign lands to experimenting with psychic phenomenon.This book gives you a good understanding of Crichton's thinking processes. The problems with medicine (albeit in the 1960's). The openness with which he visits and tries to understand foreign cultures (and his mis-adventures in doing so). Some of his closed-minded tendencies, which we can all understand.What is particularly interesting to me is how he, as a man of medicine and a scientist, opened his mind on psychic phenomenon. I don't claim to understand any of this aura-reading, meditation, seances, etc., but it's really fascinating that Crichton spent some time experimenting with these phenomenon.Great reading!"},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I picked up Travels when I was on the Greek island of Mikonos. I had just heard some terrible news that a childhood freind was killed in a plane he was flying after taking up a new career to deliver air mail. I had never heard of this author before as I had narrowed myself to other favourite authors.Now Michael Crichton has joined that list.The book is extremely insightfull and I appreciated the way he was not frightened to tell the truth no matter haw personal it had to get.I have had an interest in different forms of energy for some time he has made me realise that this is only the begining, I have not yet found my &quot; cactus &quot; yet, I have not heard the voice but I am being patient.I have since purchased Airfram and now suffer from lack of sleep whenever a Michael Crichton novel is bed side, ( I must limit myself to 1 book every 6 weeks or so )I thoroughly enjoyed this book and it helped me through a very tough time being overseas hearing this grim news."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I am a great fan of Michael Crichton. I enjoyed the parts in this book about his travels around the world and about quitting medicine. But, the parts about \\"inner travel\\" I did not care for so much. A lot of it is true however, such as our mind causing some of our medical problems, etc."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I thought the Travel parts of this book were extremely entertaining to read. I was enjoying it up until Crichton got into the stuff about entities attached to his body and his obsession with cosmic stuff. Also the severe lack of Dinosaurs has been noted."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"For me it is Chrichton's best book although I was disturbed by its last few chapters. It is an acconut of Chrichton's experiences as a med student, as a writer, as a director and even as a fanatic (telepathy, out of the body experiences, auras etc). The tales are funny yet irreverent."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"In this series of autobiographical essays, Crichton comes off as self-absorbed, selfish, emotionally immature and alarmingly credulous about paranormal phenomena. If you enjoy Crichton, give this book a wide berth; it will reveal your hero's feet of clay"},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I doubt this would have been published if Crichton weren't Crichton. Just a hodge-podge of stuff - medical school, a few good travel essays, a lot of paranormal stuff - energy balancing, auras, channeling, etc. etc. I see a lot of readers loved it, but I thought it was a waste of time."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Departing from his techno-thriller genre (or so it has been labeled) Crichton offers an autobiography that is just amazing. I loved this book, one of Crichton's best, a must read."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I loved this book. Absolutely stunning story telling of his life. The best book ever written besides the Bible."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This autobio is great. He tells of his extraordinary life and adventures. My favorite book."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"If I had read this book by Chrichton first, I never would have read any of his other works. The book itself is not too bad, the writing is jerky at times, however, my main problem with it is his overall attitude and personality. Chrichton reveals himself to be a very arrogant and snotty person through this book. He doesn't travel to these exotic locations because he has any interest in them, he only goes there because it's not easily accessible to other people. If the \\"average\\" person can't go there, he does just because he can. Another way he shows that he thinks he is better than everyone is at one point in the book he describes meeting some African women and while he is sitting there talking to them he mentions that he had a hard time seeing them as people. To him they were no different than animals. Then he just moved on to his next adventure. He cared nothing for the places or people; he came, he saw, on to the next place. He also shows his arrogance by ignoring the recommendations of people experienced in activities he does or places he's visiting. Someone would say to him \\"You can't do that and this is why.\\" and he would just either ignore them or argue with them believing he could do anything only to find out he was wrong and it was always a shock to him.After a while, I just got tired of his vague, negative descriptions of the places he's been (he seemd to have all these high hopes for each place and was never satisfied when reality hit) and the way something truly terrifying happened to him everytime he went some where new. This book is far from his best and has actually turned me off reading him ever again."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"It is one of my favorite book. The whole deal of searching for anwsers in this book is present. The author does not gives us an insigt of his book the only thing that he does is express the things that happened in his travels and search the meaning of it. It is a great book speacially for a person who is searching for meaning in this messed up life."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I'm not going to rehash what has already been said. I just want to say that I thought he was a little hard on Richard Feynman (Nobel prize-winning physicist). When he says that Feynman had not interest in philosophy or art I felt he was off base. If you read about Feynman you will get his view on life even if it is not presented as a philsophy per se. As for the lack of interest in art, the man drummed to ballet. Not my cup of tea, but it is art."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I found &quot;Travels&quot; to be an excellent page turner. Michael Crichton has accomplished quite a few feats in his life, and shares a few with us in this book. I did not care much for the &quot;supernatural&quot; sections he has written about, but that is just my opinion. All in all, if you are a Crichton fan, or a fan of traveling throughout the world, I highly recommend reading this book."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"After reading this book by Michael Crichton I felt like he was a close friend telling me about his life. In this book you will smile, cry and wonder. This book will make anybody open up. Michael Crichton show that even tough life is not a box of candy, there always something good for you at the end. In this book you will see some names that you seen in other works of Michael Crichton. Almost all the people talked about in this book relates to one you might have seen before (ER, Sphere, ect...) You will also see where Michael Crichton gets the ideas for some of his novel (Congo, Great Train Robbery, to name a few). After reading this novel you will feel like you done all the thing right along side of Michael Crichton. Then after you see the world through Mr. Crichton you will think twice about most things you do."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This book leaves me wishing I was Michael Crichton. Even before he made his true fortune with Jurassic Park, he was a great man. I loved the mystical chapters here and there, and also the trips around the world. A sequal in the future?"},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I was in London at the time that I read this book. I've always enjoyed Michael's books, especially this one. I really got a sense of where he got a lot of his story ideas. From the scuba adventures (Sphere) to the medical schooling (ER, Five Patients, many others), you can really see why he knows so much about the topics. When I was in London, I actually when to the London Psychics organization and had a reading myself. I can't say that it changed my life, but it was damn fun!! Enjoy the book!"},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This was a great book for anyone who wants to read a book about extroadinary travels to places throughout the world. The book also tells about Chrichton's lovelife, experiences in Harvard Medical School and his amazing experiences with pyschics, channeling, and auras. Did you know that Chricton averaged a &quot;C&quot; in Harvard when he was studying to be a writer? If you want to find out more about all of Crichtons exciting experiences, you should definetly read Travels"},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Michael Crichton gives us slices of his life in which he gained insights and grew. We learn of his time as a doctor, his various encounters with paranormal phenomenon and his journeys through all parts of the world, such as Africa and Hong Kong. As he descibes these events, one gets the sense of being there and learning the same things. A truly enlightening book that explores all aspects of life and encourages an open mind and a willingness to explore not only our outside world, but our inner one as well. A great read that is hard to put down. Full of humor, sadness, and life experiences"},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I've been a fan of Crichton's fiction since I first read Jurassic Park years ago. I love how he mixes reality with the potential science of the future. The events in his novels may not be possible, but when Crichton tells the story you believe that they are plausible. Perhaps it is Crichton's attention to detail that makes the stories both so interesting as well as believable. It is this same attention to detail that makes Travels such an interesting book.Travels is a series of essays broken up into two sections. The first section deals with Crichton's time in medical school. These stories are very interesting as we get to see some of the inner working of hospitals, and some of the stuff that we wouldn't see on TV (and might not believe if we did). This was a fascinating section. The second section of the book was most of the book and it dealt with Crichton's travels. I'm not a huge fan of travel writing (normally), but I was blown away by the depth (or length) of Crichton's travels. He truly is a world traveler and we are told of his experiences climbing mountains, exploring remote corners of the world. Not only has Michael Crichton had several lifetimes of experience, but he tells the stories very well. Most are very short, but very interesting.I don't think that Travels will be a book that I have any interest in re-reading, but it was a good book to read once and I'm glad I did. Crichton has a lot of stories to tell and he tells them well."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I was a little skeptical about this book before I read it, but it turned out to be very entertaining, thought provoking, and satisfying. Every Crichton fan should probably read it just to get the inside scoop on the man himself, perhaps to see what has driven him to write so many fascinating books, and also to see what fuels some of his philosophy that comes through in his writing. &quot;Travels&quot; certainly isn't all about philosophy, as much of it consists of some very entertaining anecdotes, though there's a philosophical vein that runs through it. It's not preachy, though Crichton seems to be trying to stimulate thinking in the reader. I found myself wishing at times that there wasn't a metaphysical bent to this book, though in the end I suppose it's for the better. Overall, a very engaging read. Avery Z. Conner, author of &quot;Fevers of the Mind&quot;."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Some of the people already writing the reviews here have described Mr. Crichton's autobiographical account as self absorbed and whiny and I have to say that I didn't find any whining in his book.

For those of you who want easy answers go read the &quot;Left Behind&quot; series. Michael Crichton is simply sharing his experience with you."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I would not expect a travel dialogue to be any different from an author like Michael Crichton.I think it should be expected that his experiences will be interpreted differently, his voice unique to the traveling readers. It may be that his experiences do not relate to the typical reader of traveler guides, but this is not a usual interpretation of the same.He has a voice and mind that causes reflection. That is obvious with his work. I found this piece as a reflection of his experiences, and as unique as you or I, should we choose to reflect on them. All in all, they are gripping accounts, and ones that keep the pages turning. I do not know about you, but, that is why I buy a book."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"At first glance, this book could appear to be a lavish tale of an intelligent and wealthy person who has travelled more than most and wants to share it with an already existant audience. At some points, this is true. However, this book is more often than not, an incredible exploration into the depths inside and outside of yourself. Crichton has the ability to take you along his journey without talking down to you and by sharing his stories with you as if you were sitting next to him having coffee. He is very honest about his experiences and does not try to &quot;sell&quot; them to you. In fact, in the end, he even suggests you can do what he did and come to your own conclusions. It is a humbling compliment that this well educated and practical author can share his experiences without building a wall between himself and his audience. The book lags when it begins to feel like the reader is traversing through a list of where he has been and what he did there. But when he opens up and shares his spiritual journey, the book really progresses and is a fantastic read. Skeptics will enjoy his no nonsense accounts of visiting psychics and other assorted characters from the non-scientific realm. It makes his many esoteric statements easier to swallow. Highly recommended if you enjoy travelling inside and outside of your reality."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I find Michael Crichton's books extremely fascinating because they are some of the very few massmarket books written for intelligent people. This book is a different twist from his usual works, it in many ways reminds me of Eric Segal-- must be the Harvard Med connection. It opened my eyes to a &quot;new age&quot; way of looking at things--he has written the first book I have ever read on the subject without a &quot;fruitcakey&quot; approach to it."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Crighton's stories cover his medical training, world travels, and various supernatural experiences. His autobiography is diverse, intriguing, and personal. Gain insight into a great mind and a fascinating life. One of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I enjoyed almost all of the episodes, both foreign and inner trips. Travels, this could be called adventures. It is much more interesting than usual guide book articles. With this book, readers too travel carrying his unique and honest sense. &quot;Cactus teachings&quot; was somehow exhilarating and remarkable one - splendid."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"An entertaining and somewhat motivational book. Crichton's experiences make you want to get up and climb Mt. Kilimanjaro or try bending a spoon. As usual, Crichton does not dumb down anything. He explains esoteric scientific ideas in a clear and concise manner. Some of his adventures seem to come out of some action/adventure film. Here is a man who has really lived life..."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This book seems much more than a compilation of adventure stories and personal reveries made at significant crossroads of Crichton's life. Travels depicts a personal journey, which takes the author from medical school to exotic and forbidden places, then finally on an inward exploration to test his psychic boundaries. Somewhat tedious in closing, Crichton adds a dense postscript, as academic proof for his self-absorbed wanderlust. We're not expected to swallow it all, hook, line and sinker, but it's definitely an eye-opener to the larger world around us."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"If I could give this book a 10 I would. He has a powerful hunger for life. It also changed my perspective of him. He is also almost a mirror to Hemmingways writting. He writes about things that he has experianced in some way. If you think about it you can almost see where he comes up with the ideas for his books through out his life."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This book is as good or better than any fiction Mr. Crichton has written. I only wish he would do a sequel or two to bring us up to date from where this book ends. One of the things I liked best was his honesty - he did not attempt to paint himself as a white knight or the good guy. He tells his story and lets the chips fall where they may. read it!"},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Crichton's \\"TRAVELS\\" is one of my lifetime favorites.I have read it at least 5 times, and it is alwayssomeplace in my consciousness.

Thesestories are outrageous yet believable. Some of myfavorites are: getting through the trials of MedSchool, climbing Mount Kilimanjaro, scuba divingin the midst of wrecks of sunken ships, andtraveling with a woman friend who maybe wishes youwere dead.I take this book as being about real life, and ashaving important things to say."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This is my second purchase of Travels by Michael Crichton. I bought it in hard cover back when it was first published but loaned it out and never got it back.This really lets you get into Crichton's head and discover the many things in his life that gave him the sense of adventure as well as the off the wall doctors and scientists which come across in his works of fiction. Adventure, how about climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro, hiking the Himalayas or diving on wrecks off the coast of Belize where he loses track of time at 180 feet and runs out of air before reaching the surface. He was a very lucky man, more than once actually, many of which are detailed in the book.He also describes his travails at Harvard as he worked towards his medical degree, which he funded by writing movie scripts such as Andromeda Strain, and his internship at hospitals in Boston, where he decided being a doctor was not a journey he wanted to take.I really miss his writings."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"very interesting book from an author I have admired and read several of his books."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"For those of us who will never experience such exotic adventures, it's great fun to live them through the eyes of a superior author. Additionally, the early autobiographical chapters offer insight into the life of Michael Critchon. Did you know that he is 5 ft 9 in tall?"},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Good autobiography by an interesting writer and person. The beginning when he's in med school is interesting by not great and the end when he goes on about paranormal stuff isn't top notch but still interesting. Overall, i recommend the book and it's worth a read by anyone who likes Crichton's stuff."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This book is truly brilliant. It is inspirational and life changing! I'm more than impressed by Crichton's ability to relate his life experiences to me in a way that scream at me to live my life more fully. Thank you for an amazing book. I'm forever grateful to this incredible author."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Knowing Crichton only thru movies like &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, I was not attracted to Cricton's work. Someone gave me &quot;Travels&quot;. I was pleasantly surprised. Crichton has led an incredible and examined life. The writing is a joy to read, and the text bristles with what Crichton calls &quot;Direct Experience&quot;. After reading this book, I grew to respect this author. His quest for knowledge, both external and internal is truely inspiring."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This book, put simply is one of the best I have ever read. Crichton definitely has had some interesting experiences and I enjoyed his perceptions. Some trips I found myself saying better him than me. The only complaint I had was that he didn't describe the enviornments in much detail. I guess I'm spoiled by authors such as Robert Jordan who can immerse you."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This book is fascinating. I couldn't expect anything more from Crichton, his vivid and detailed description of his travels is very absorbing. Anyone interested in travels, whether in yourself or on the map should read."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Travels was a great book about Michael Crichton's life. Through his life, Crichton did a lot of interesting things, like scuba dive with sharks, make three movies, and even cut open a human head! The story had some boring parts in it, but life isn't always exciting. Nonetheless, Crichton didn't live a normal life, as you can tell. This becomes very clear towards the end. Many people would like this book. If you want to find out about different parts of the world, Crichton explains a lot about the countries he went to. If it's excitement you want, the story did get very tense at some parts. Also you'd like this book if you're interested in paronormal things. But you'll have to read it to find out why."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Michael Crichton has written an honest, disturbing, and insightful portrait of himself. This is one of the best Crichton books I've read. It is entertaining, silly, funny, dramatic and odd. Even a non-fan of Crichton should like this book."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Michael Crichton carries you through his struggles in life and makes you feel as if you were there experiencing them with him. A book you can't miss out on."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I have read this book three times and find that each time something different applies to where I am right now. Michael Crichton is astonishingly open, honest and self-deprecating in relating his travels all over the world and within himself. By reading this book I have become more open to trying new adventures. Crichton comes across as though he is sitting right with you telling you these stories. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Crichton's pseudo-biography is one of the most powerful novels i've ever had the pleasure of reading.I picked it up at a 'cross-roads' in my life, and I believe it's helped me make the right decisions time and again. Without being preachy or condescending, it not only tells Crichton's tale, but also assesses his choices in life(some good, some bad). HIGHLY RECOMENDED!!"},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This is an excellent book about a man that has lived an exciting and experiencial life. Some times I had to remind myself that I was reading a true story and not just another fictional story by Michael Crichton. The middle section of his book is the most interesting and entertaining. The first section about his years as a medical student is interesting at times but too long and detailed. His last chapter &quot;speech&quot; I believe really didn't need to be included. He should have let the readers judge his experiences for themselves rather than preach to them. What I really enjoyed was his travels whether to far off lands or to the exploration of his mind. His writing is such that you really get to know him and you feel almost that you are in Michael's home listening him tell you about his life. The best part of this story though was his willingness to expose himself showing that he was like everyone else in making bad judgements, mistakes, and sometimes even acting like a jerk. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is willing to open their mind to all the possibilities out there."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I really think I have read every word this man has written.

I really enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This book is an exhilirating account of travels, inside and out. A very influential book in lifestyle, excitement and open mindness. This book has forced me to strive for more in my young life in hopes of achieving such journeys and fulfillment as Mr. Crichton has."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This book chronicles Michael Crichton's travels in the most remote regions of the world and of the mind. He swims with sharks, climbs a mountain, and spends time with psychics. In his book, he is constantly exploring his limitations, searching for evidence of the spiritual world and greater understanding of the physical world. Travels motivates us to always look beyond our visible boundaries; to explore things we don't understand; to seek out things that are unfamiliar, strange, and challenging in order to get a better idea of ourselves. Crichton believes that we should explore every little corner of the world before we come to a conclusion about the world as a whole. I think it's a great book."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Travelling is one significant thing that make Michael become successful. Since I had read this book, I no longer wonder in his achievement. Michael frankly wrote a lot of his useful opinions in the book. I consider them as readers' lucky.It is another worth reading!"},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I found &quot;Travels&quot; to be a very compelling story of Micheal Crichton's life. It was interesting to read about his struggles, and his lifetime-goals trying to be accomplished. I think &quot;Travels&quot; brings out the true fact of an average american discovering the world, and what the person is bound to find out. I think this book is one of Crichton's best! READ IT TODAY!"},{"Title":"Travels","review":"The book arrived ahead of the promised date, in fairly good condition.This book blew me away, wish I read it when the author was still alive. I would have made an effort to talk to him about some of his experiences from the book. A MUST read for anyone with an open mind."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This is the only book of Michael Crichton that I was missing and so I bought it to complete my library. I knew not to expect a book of fiction because it is not one. What I did not expect was how much I was to enjoy it!Besides small side-remarks, there is nothing about his childhood or his upbringing. These stories are the memoirs of an aspiring writer trapped into an Ivy League arc that was to land him an MD. But he got away. Well, maybe too far away...The first stories describe his ever growing disillusionment with both medicine and its practitioners. Later on Crichton goes into his personal journeys in life, both around the world and professionally. From inside Hollywood trivia to scuba diving tips; from exotic culture shocks to the benefits of meditation; and from escaping mortal danger in Jamaica to having his ...aura fluffed, no corner of Michael Crichton's mind remains obscured.Crichton's insights may not always be easy to share but one has to appreciate his candor. Because of his untimely death, this book is a major part of his legacy.RECOMMENDED!"},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I am a pretty big Michael Crichton fan. I loved this book! Extremely interesting and informative. Get this book now."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Didn't think I would like a non-fiction book. This novel was just as gripping (maybe more) as his fictional works, for me. A life lived as an adventurer into areas of the earth usually unexplored, was just indescribable. Yet he described these places, people and his insights, both personal and and his perceptions of those people around him, in such vivid detail that I felt as though I was there. How can one live such a life, bravely and uniquely following personal curiousities and challenges? Most of us (including me) have lived a \\"safe\\" life. I believe most truly talented artists in all fields have followed \\"the road less taken.\\" For me, this is \\"food for deep thought\\" which enables examination of one's life. Maybe it will have a profound affect on you, too. The only other book which has affected my life so deeply is \\"The Drifters\\" by James A. Michener."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Having read some of Mr. Crichton's books and noting he had just died several months ago at age sixty-six, I was interested to learn more about him through this autobiography.He certainly became a \\"participant\\" in a variety of different diciplines.Med school, channeling, novelist, director, psychics, man of science,traveller. All his journeys seemed to be some type of \\"hunger\\" that doesn't really reach satisfaction.This book was somewhat of a journey itself.An interesting, complex, multi-dimensional individual that I enjoyed \\"spending some time with.\\""},{"Title":"Travels","review":"First non-fiction book I've read by Crichton. Of course this guy can write, almost everything he has put out has been entertaining so it's interesting to see how he does writing about his own life. This book consists of Crichton's anecdotes over his life, what he likes to do in his free time basically. Lately I've felt depressed and was looking for something to cheer me up. If you are searching for something in life this is will be interesting because so is he.Some of the stories are straight up travel adventures intertwined with his personal life. I especially enjoyed reading about his hike up Mount Kilimanjaro. It's quite a detailed account of his ascent and made me want to try it on my next holiday. Also notable were visits with mountain gorillas in Rwanda, scuba diving on wrecks and with sharks, fighting with his girlfriend while on holiday in Jamaica. The woman inadvertently invites a convicted murderer and would-be mugger into their daytrip. He also explores the spiritual world and visits psychics, which is not my cup of tea, but quite interesting at times to explore through his eyes.The capstone of this book is actually the postscript where the author argues with a group of leading scientists that they should not discount the paranormal and spiritual. If nothing else it provides an excellent basis for how one should go about in a serious debate. Personally I have never believed in mysticism, spiritualism, any of these non-scientific views of the world. I was interested to see the outcome after having read the book because Crichton really enjoys exploring these ideas. You could say he's a believer.He writes, \\"science offers a picture of the world, but its picture is not to be confused with the underlying reality itself\\". For example a map of the world provides a detailed image of the geography, but it in fact it's not really a true reproduction of the underlying land. Science is able to express some of nature's unknowns in mathematical theory but it can only show a fraction of what is truly occurring. Crichton's argument is that there is much more to the world than science can explain and that we should be open-minded about where we might fight it. For some reason I found myself agreeing with him."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This is very different than the other Michael Crichton books but this was an excellent read. Very interesting / enlightening / thought provoking. I recommend it."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This book is difficult to find in a regular bookstore, I looked for it for many years. The narrative makes it very interesting and exciting and brings you to the actual places. It is ideal for people who like to travel."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This book is an excellent combination of &quot;regular guy&quot; adventures, humor, and the curiosities of a Harvard-trained skeptic. I have read many of the stories twice and come out with something new each time, especially when Crichton learns something about himself-I find myself enlightened. Also, I lately have been curious about certain psychic phenomenon but am somewhat of a skeptic. Crichton shows its okay to explore these areas, whether you choose to embrace their existence or not depends on your experience."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I loved this book. It was great to read about the private side of this amazing author. His spiritual insights give us a wonderful background to appreciate his works of fiction. All Crichton fans will enjoy this book!"},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I picked up the book at an outlet store, since I recognized the author from movies based on his novels. I read the short stories in random order.The book's a journal in the truest form.It captures the essence of the author's experience.But, don't just take my word for it.It was M. Crichton's favorite book to write.For a personal life perspective (a.k.a. travels/autobiography),This is as good as it gets!!!!I'll cut myself short, before this sounds like a shameless promotion. . . .Please (save a tree) and check it out from the local library. ((See I'm not in sales.))"},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I've always loved Michael Crichton's style of writing; he's so eloquent and engaging when he writes his fictional accounts. Well, he's equally as eloquent and engaging as he reports about his own travels, both physical and metaphysical.In the first part of the book, he writes about his days as a medical student and trips to exotic locales. His description of scuba diving is incredible; it had me on the edge of my seat and I felt as if I were diving alongside him! The second part of the book takes us on a spiritual/metaphysical journey. Whether or not you approach it with an open mind, it's very well written and worth your time.Overall, I would highly recommend this book to everyone, whether you travel alot or not. This book quickly became one of my favorites, and I often find myself rereading various parts of it depending on my mood and circumstances."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I would not expect a travel dialogue to be any different from an author like Michael Crichton.I think it should be expected that his experiences will be interpreted differently, his voice unique to the traveling readers. It may be that his experiences do not relate to the typical reader of traveler guides, but this is not a usual interpretation of the same.He has a voice and mind that causes reflection. That is obvious with his work. I found this piece as a reflection of his experiences, and as unique as you or I, should we choose to reflect on them. All in all, they are gripping accounts, and ones that keep the pages turning. I do not know about you, but, that is why I buy a book."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I am a fairly new reader of Crichton books. I had always thought of him as &quot;science fiction&quot;, but anyone reading his books will know he puts so much non-fiction into his fiction....a person just cannot stop reading his book, once started. Upon reading this book, &quot;Travels&quot; it really allows you to know the inner &quot;Michael Crichton&quot;. He holds nothing back. Tells things that most people only &quot;think&quot;. As always with his books, it is a book you will not put down until it is read completely. I laughed and at times cried. At times I felt as though I were reading his private diary. What a great book for anyone and everyone."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This is one book that has really left an impression on me. I find it a rather philosophical book. Especially the later chapters on psychic adventures. I will also tell you that I was so convinced about seeing auras that I tried to see my own halo. But I failed, as you might well have guessed. But then, I have decided to seriously try meditation. I am sure it will be a good experience for me to attend a camp like Michael did. Vipassana is one place I am seriously considering. Everyone MUST read this."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"The best book I never ment to read! It was misshelved in the travel section...I have always enjoyed the author so I bought it. What a great book. I will look at all my &quot;travels&quot; in a different light."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Whenever I'm going on a long trip on a train or plane I make sure I have this book with me. For some reason I never get tired of it, especially the first and second parts of the book (about medical school and travelling). However, the last part, mostly about the paranormal, has not worn as well, and I don't know why; the vaguely postmodernist anti-scientific speech that finishes the book looks especially bad compared to when I read it for the first time, as a gullible teenager.Still, while this is not great literature, or even a great travel diary, something about it makes it very absorbing and relieves the boredom of long trips. I've probably read it half a dozen times in the last decade and I never get tired of it."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Travels is a fascinating, truthful, revealing compilation of adventerous essays. It's humorous, silly, terrifying at times, and enlightening. Crichton takes his readers with him in all of his journeys - to places where most people have never been. It reveals what makes Crichton Crichton. The best part of this book is that he doesn't expect you to believe everything. If you think that the paranormal is hokey stuff, then fine, you can believe it is hokey stuff. You can be skeptical about it. I am. But he encourages his readers to experience things for themselves."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"The technothriller master shares a biography as exciting as any of his fiction. A masterful journey of self-discovery through the eyes of one of the most gifted authors of our time. A must read"},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This is simply a wonderful book to read. It is personal, insightful, and in my view will please most readers. This is an autobiography that gives a snapshot view of certain events of MC's life: medical school, exotic holiday locations, making movies, near death experiences. It's not so much a detailed chronology of his life, but more like highlights of important events and turning points in his life. For fans it is a delight to see a personal side of MC. For others it is an easy, intelligent, and inspirational read into the life of a famous (and my personal favourite) author."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I have read a lot of Michael Crichton and thought it intelligent and interesting. After just finishing \\"Travels\\" this afternoon, I have to admit that I hated it. I know that this book was about his inner and outer travels in life in which he reaches self discovery, but in reality it is one of the most self obsessed books I have ever read. He whines and complains and tries to find excuses for his bad behavior and his inability to have a meaningful relationship. Instead of looking at the international travel (as little as he actually talks about it) as a great opportunity to learn about other cultures for who they are, he is continually belittling and condescending. His only real self discovery is when he turns to self help and psychics so he can talk about how wonderful he is and how misunderstood he is. For all his money and experiences he could have had the same attitude anywhere, one of ego centered self indulgences. Nice try but highly frustrating and diary-ish. He should have kept this one to himself."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Crichton is a pretty good fiction author, but this autobiography left me quite unimpressed. It starts out OK - his days in medical school - and there are some good sections when he is travelling the world, but the stuff at the end about auras and the possibility (or liklihood if you believe Crichton) that para-psychology is real made me lose a lot of respect for the guy. OK, I can buy into the fact that there are levels of subconsciousness, but I can't buy into the spoon bending, psychic readings, or the seeing of auras, etc. James Randi is a famous skeptic who has offered $1 million for anyone who can show that any aspect of telepathy, etc., is real, and he has had no one walk away with the money.How much money do you think Crichton paid for his \\"conferences\\" in the desert? Or his readings with psychics? Please. This was a very wealthy guy who got hoodwinked by a lot of different people over the years. The problem with the book is that he claims to be of a very scientific mind, yet he never discovers the man behind the curtain. He wants all of his observations to be true, so of course, they are true.I really think he spent too much time in L.A.Also, he claims that most illnesses are brought on by the individual and that much of western medicine is a crock. However, he died of cancer at a fairly young age. Where were his crystals when he needed them?"},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I will admit immediately that my biggest complaint about the book is that it was not what I expected. I have come to like Michael Crichton's writings with their intelligent plots, vivid characters and unexpected devlopments. \\"Travels\\" had some unexpected developments that I did not like.The book started off as a documentary of his life of, logically traveling. He explained how he was attracted to exploration and why it was important to him by giving several chapters of background. He retold his adventures into jungles, deserts and cities with the precision and detail you would expect with a philosophical perspective that gave the book greater depth.However, just as the book started developing well, he transitions into solely mystical travel and tells the story of his transition from something of an agnostic to a mysticist, complete with talking with the dead, visualizing auras and bending spoons. It became very dull and overly introspective and I had great difficulty reading through the last few chapters.It was well written and interesting for most of the book, but don't expect you be amazed as you would with any other Crichton book."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I like the idea of searching for meaning in one's life. I am impressed by the number of remote, obscure locales that Crichton visited. I am intrigued - if not entirely convinced - by Crichton's experiments with the paranormal. So I found \\"Travels\\" interesting, if not what I expected. Crichton has a nice way of putting a mostly humorous, ironic spin on his tales while considering their roles in his life. But I think he tried to accomplish too much with \\"Travels\\" - in the end it feels as though it is stretched rather thin in places and really accomplished nothing."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This book was rather disappointing. Crichton comes across as pompous. As I read it I felt insulted that he needed to overexplain every insight to his readers. He went on some interesting trips, but I couldn't help thinking someone else would have described the experiences much better."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"The book that I received is in great shape. I wonder if it was ever even read previously. I love the story so far, Michael Crighton was an amazing person and author.ThanksWendy"},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This book tells MC's early years. From his medical studies, when he wrote novels using pseudonyms to support himself to some of his adventures, some you wouldn't imagine.If you like his books, you should read this one to get to know him a little bit more even though it is a pretty old book, he should write a newer Bio."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I am a fan of Michael Crichton's fiction books. They are compelling, suspenseful, and generally based on good science. Travels is the first non-fiction book of his that I have read. It has some good sections about the many intriguing people and places he has come across in his many travels. However I feel it breaks down when he discusses his \\"inner travels\\". How a Harvard trained physician can be taken in by seers, aura viewers, and spoon benders is beyond me. I will continue to read his fiction, but probably enjoy it a little less after reading this book."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I read this book in college after I had read a few of his books, mostly because every other day a new movie was being adapted from them, so I thought I might give them a try. Crichton is an entertaining storyteller, much like John Grisham, but after a while the plots begin to feel formulaic and contrived, which is why I stopped reading them altogether. Fifty years from now people will say, Michael Who?I initially read this book because as the time I was considering a career in medicine, and I noticed that Crichton wrote about some of his medical school experiences.What I got was a series of 'travels' by a guy who had too much time and money on his hands, and although intellectually gifted, obviously emotionally immature. No wonder the guy has been married so many times. I especially was put off by the line where he talks about one of his marriages and said that it was falling apart because one of them wanted children and the other did not. He never says who it was that didn't want children, but it isn't difficult to figure out that he is the one who didn't want any kids getting in his way (but he didn't have the guts to admit that it was him). Who knows, they may have prevented him from going on one of his overindulgent self-discovery voyages to some exotic place.I'm all for visting interesting places and learning about other cultures, but Crichton does it with such a smug and hedonistic tone that I find his attitude insufferable. Then, when you wonder if his self-righteousness could get any worse, he gives his readers (whom he must consider to be uneducated rabble who aren't so fortunate as to travel all over the world) a laundry list of tips on how to get through life. Gee, thanks, dad."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I was amazed that in this day and age, a well known author can describe an African woman as an &quot;animal&quot; and SouthEast Asian child as a &quot;mongrel&quot;. Mind boggling !...The author includes a story to a southeastern brothel where children are the prostitutes. As a reader you are shocked at him and his friends, actually checking out the kids in room after room. Somehow Crichton decides it is not for him and opts out.I am thinking, Did you really have to go into the brothel where children are prostituted to find that one out?Sick....Washington Post calls this crap &quot;entertaining&quot;! They must have been thinking about the dinosaur book."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This book has it all. It challenges your thinking and perceptions, it makes you want to be moe open and curious about the world, it makes you want to seek out adventuraous expeirences. It has the potential to be a life-changing book."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I have read a few of Michael Crichton's books over the years, beginning with the Andromeda Strain, and have always found them entertaining. But I never thought of him as a deep thinker. Travels makes it clear that I was wrong.This book is an extremely intelligent and self-aware exploration of how Crichton personally interacts with his world, and what is actually going on in that world. Much of the book is about the reality (or not) of spiritual phenomena like psychics, auras, out of body experiences, etc. Particularly for those of us who are basically connected to reality but convinced that \\"more is going on\\", this is a really insightful book -- more open to unusual phenomena than typical books on meditation and similar activities, yet much more grounded than books like The Celestine Prophecy.Crichton's descriptions of his travels and experiences at medical school are also interesting and well-written (and probably the best way to promote popular sales of the book), but this book is much more than just a travelogue -- and there are better books for those primarily interested in travel writing. The important part is about spirituality and psychology, and for that this is one of the best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I thought it was very generous of Mr. Crichton to share his inner and outer travels with his readers. He is a very intelligent, interesting person who has accomplished a lot in life. However, reading this book, will give you an insight of his life as a regular person who has his ups and downs and other struggles in life and personal relationships. He is also very honest in expressing his thoughts and feelings in this book.I don't believe in paranormal, palmreading and stuff, but I appreciate his thoughts and personal experiences related to those.This is one of the books I could read over and over again, over periods of time. I definitely recommend this book."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I love all of the Michael Crichton books and this is no exception. I'm a fan that can't wait for the release of his next book. I go back to the early books, such as this one, and re-read them for added pleasure."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"My first reading by Michael Crighton, but first of many for sure. I could not put this book down. I read it on vacation in Hawaii, and it was the most fascinating journey, very funny, so self-deprecating, full of adventures, startling adventures, scary adventures, and bizarre adventures. Michael has lived such a full life and I envy how he has traveled to so many places, and yet how nearly he has escaped death so many times. I highly recommend it. It is a great read, especially on vacation."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This book fascinated me. I've read most of Crichton's fiction, and I've been particularly interested in the way his characterizations of men and women have changed over time. Now I understand the background for those changes in his work, after reading this chronicle of decades of this author's personal development.\\"New Age\\" experiences do nothing for me, but I nevertheless found it interesting to read about Crichton's perception of such experiences - and, especially, about his need to have them. The medical school chapters and the straight travel chapters engaged me best, though, because I could relate to them in a way I couldn't hope to relate to his accounts of channeling, exorcism, and so on.Worth reading for Crichton fans, although I'm not sure how much interest this book might hold for someone unfamiliar with his fiction."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This book is as much about being a seeker of experiences, as it is about being a traveler. It is in my opinion, an indispensable \`how to' guide. It teaches the reader to use outward places and experiences to enhance inward journeys. If you dream of new vistas, this book is unique in its approach to taking you there. I have given this book as gifts to several other special people along my path.Travels is like a trinket you pick up on a stray beach in Bali, or a memory too dear to risk forgetting. Yes, it can be a bit indulgent. For example, some may not want to read about having fast-induced conversations with succulents or reading auras. But developing 'openness' to the unknown is critical to living or traveling, isn't it?Overall, I think it's an education in understanding what travel is at it core, its essence."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"A great book for reading for pure pleasure! He starts off with his experiences with medical school and things progress from there; from BonAire scuba diving to the supernatural. I highly recommend this..."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I enjoyed the first half of the book. I was having a hard time putting it down. But, as he went on, the stories became less interesting to me. Perhaps because I am not really into metaphysics.If this book were merely about his physical travels, it would be a great read for me. The intellectual travels that Crichton goes through are often interesting.....but if you are into that sort of stuff I suggest you look elsewhere for your kicks.All in all, a decent read."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Surprisingly great autobiography from the master of fiction.On the surface, this is an interesting background biography of popular author Michael Crichton. It covers his academic background at Harvard Medical School, follows his decision to drop out of modern medicine (interesting given that he produces TV series ER) and then follows him around the world.Get past the biography and find a tale about exploring the world. I read the book several years ago just as my eyes were starting to open to the world. His adventures were a roadmap for expanding the mind through travel.It's a very interesting travel log. Are his experiences more clouded by a medical background, a writer's imagination or a desire to live as the locals? In the end it's a remarkable tale of discovery, not so oversimplified as to ignore the pains of the road. Think a medically trained Paul Theroux.I highly recommend this book on both levels - to understand the author, and to encourage a broader worldview."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"There's a lot to read in \\"Travels.\\" It's the story of Crichton's time in medical school, his travels to exotic places around the world, and a lot of insight into who Michael Crichton is. Harvard Medical School was fascinating reading, and Crichton's opinions of medicine and medical training gave me a very different perspective on the subject than I was used to. I don't think he would have been happy as a doctor, but in any case, he learned that his real calling was as a writer, and a very good one.The travel stories were fascinating and very descriptive, with the author going to some places that I have never heard of. I especially enjoyed the stories that involved scuba diving, since I'm an avid diver. Each story reveals a bit more about Crichton and who he is. I was not aware that Crichton was into so-called \\"paranormal\\" phenomena, but he has spent a good bit of his life investigating these activities. Frankly, some of the paranormal results that he writes about would have been less credible from other writers, but Crichton manages to make these things more credible with his scientific approach and willingness to challenge traditional scientific views. The last chapter, \\"Postscript,\\" is a classic challenge to scientists to be more open-minded about things that can not always be reproduced on demand in a laboratory.Summary: great writing by a great writer, and a nice look at who Michael Crichton is."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This is the kind of book that gets you involved into a person's actual life and adventures. As all the books of M.C. the story telling is terrific, full of action and fun.Rarely is when you can read a documented story of an skeptic becoming a full believer in the trends of past life experiences, auras, etc.In my opinion this could have been a great book if the secound part of it was not as supernatural packed, but hey.. It's his life!!! . I got a little bored at the end.By having all these experiences (and the money to pay for them! ) it's easy to understand that getting in touch with our inner nature and the nature that sorrounds us is the turning point for having that type of creativity and imagination.I wouldn't read this book again but I had a good time reading it."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Cleverly named book... It doesn't just cover Crichton's geographical journeys, it covers his internal journeys as well... The book starts off with Crichton in university and describes not only his experience as a medical student, but also how he blossumed into the successful author that he is! It was fate (and a bit of heritage...).But apart from his travels all over the world, it is fascinating to start reading about his experimentation with the pychic world and all. True, there is a bit of a &quot;I tried and tried and nothing seemed to happen, then suddenly it did&quot; air about his experiences, a vague cynical suspicion (on my behalf) that is sounded terribly like a 'growing up in California' experience, and one had to wonder, would Crichton have done what he did if he hadn't been so successful so young in life... But, the fact is he did, and as long as you are an open minded individual this book will be a very interesting read!If on the other hand, you are looking for a straightforward autobiographical account of rags to riches and writers angst of an amazingly successful and thoroughly readable author, you will be disappointed. This book REALLY gives an insight into the Michael Crichton one wouldn't suspect from his fantastic and diverse novels and its actually, quite interesting..."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Usually I adopt a rather snobbish tone when discussing books by Michael Crichton. &quot;He is a great author,&quot; I say with disdain, &quot;When he isn't writing Hollywood scripts and passing them off as novels.&quot; I tell you this so you can somehow transcend your own Crichtophobia. Because this, ladies and gentlemen, is something different. This isn't Crichton's genre fiction. This non-fiction account of his travels, both geographic and metaphysical, will change the way you view the world. Absolutely a gem of a novel, full of a truly candid tone and eye-opening revelations. It makes you wonder what he's doing writing The Lost World. My well-thumbed copy has certainly gone above and beyond the call of duty, having been loaned out to great acclaim from everyone from my stage manager to my socialite sister to my staunchly skeptical neighbor. Incidentally, an earlier Crichton novel called Case of Need (originally published under a pseudonym, which is how I read it...didn't know it was actually Crichton until I read Travels)is worth the time, too."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Right off the bat, you know that this will be a &quot;different&quot; kind of autobiography than the kind we are used to. After all, not many authors would choose to begin an essay on their own life with the words &quot;It is not easy to cut through a human head with a hacksaw&quot;, but Crichton does.The first part of the book is a short but interesting section detailing Michael's adventures during his 4 year tenure at Harvard Medical School. It is an interesting story told from the &quot;other side&quot; of the medical profession. I reccommend one of MC's other non-fiction books Five Patients, to anyone who likes this section.The bulk of the book, of course, is the latter section focusing on Crichton's travels. Told are many fascinating (and true) stories of experiences in such out-of-the-way places as Hunza, New Guinea, Mount Kilimanjaro, not to mention Hong Kong and various underwater expeditions. Also included in the &quot;Travels&quot; section are some of Michael's many inner journeys. He talks of psychic phenomenon, future-reading, spoon bending, and the like. I found his insight on psychics extremely interesting.I reccommend this book to anyone who wants a &quot;different&quot; kind of autobiography, and who wants to know about people's &quot;innter journeys&quot;, not just outer ones."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I like Crichton. An unusually interesting way of thinking, but always using facts to support his conclusions. Highly intelligent with some quirky interests. His politics are unclear, which is probably what he intended. Go to his website and listen to some of his speeches, especially on medical and environmental issues.This is primarily biographical (did you know he was 6'9\\"?), only slightly a travelogue (don't go to Pakistan or New Guinea). In the most honest way he describes his personal mistakes and philosophical evolution, with modest references to his successes as an author, screenwriter and director. His views on corruption in science are startling. I planned to skip the phenomenon part, but his typically analytical approach drew me in and I now agree there's a lot we don't know.I enjoyed sailing through these breezy pages."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This is book was incredible! Crichton's days as a medical student are humorous and thought-provoking, his globe-trotting is exotic and awe-inspiring, and his psychic adventures left me with a whole new vocabulary of chakras, auras, etc.The amazing med school stories are great, which is no surprise since he's written Five Patients and is the creator of ER. The travelling stories were interesting because they seemed believable. Tourbook, camera, sore feet ... I can relate to this guy a lot better than a Hemingway-type figure.I don't know if I'm going to go out and talk to cacti or fluff my aura anytime soon, but I thought Crichton's journies of the world and the soul were amazing. This is probably among the least-known of his books, but definitely a must read."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This book changed my life. The &quot;science is not absolute&quot; argument has been around for a long time, but Crichton adds force this with Travels. The reader begins to see that there are other spheres of knowledge that we simply are not familiar with. The most profound running line in this book is the necessity to detach ourselves from our material belongings. Well worth the read, it will make make you hunger to travel to these distant lands Crichton writes about."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"The book is a series of episodes from Crichton's life. The various short episodes include, experiences as an medical student, visiting psychics in England, travelling in remote villages in Asia, climbing Mount Kilminajaro, working with Sean Connery on THE GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY, and new age explorations. But the episodes all tie together to make a point. The most surprising thing in the book is that Crichton makes a very strong case for &quot;psychic phenomena&quot;. From his work and education, I'd always assumed he would be a hard-science materialist, but he is not. He makes an interesting case for his viewpoint, and I'm sure he's sincere (he has little to gain from making such claims). But I can't say he convinced me. Even so, I've reread the book once, and will probably do so again. Very interesting and well-written."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"As a therapist I enjoyed this book from the perspcective of searching for one's meaning in life and that journey. As an adventurer I enjoyed this book for the stories and excitement. One can enjoy the stories for their excitement or use this book to futher their own &quot;search for meaning&quot;"},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Michael Crichton has a consistently amazing capacity for reading society's pulse when it comes to other people's obsessing and woes about the impact of new technologies. &quot;Jurrasic Park,&quot; along with most of his other writings, is a wonderful example of his professional capacity to do so. However, &quot;Travels&quot; is something else. While I found Mr. Crichton more than competent to record and extrapolate his own personal motivations, he came across as calculating and less than fully engaged with people who appear in this irregular journal of his activities. In fact, they appear more or less as only window dressing among the facets of his activities, instead of integral elements of his life. I first read &quot;Travels&quot; several years ago, and after reading it again I compared notes with other,more skilled readers; each of us came away with the same impressions.Overall, Mr. Crichton comes off as quite a narcissist. Perhaps this isn't the real Michael Crichton, but a reader wouldn't really know from &quot;Travels&quot; that he can be more than just a disconnected observer of the human condition."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Sorry to disagree with everyone so far, but I regretted how much of a glimpse into his personality Crichton gave me with this book. He comes across as insufferable and arrogant; a person with whom I certainly would not enjoy travelling. He has visited some interesting places, but his ego was paramount to most of them. There are other books about personal experiences with travel that have much less &quot;I&quot; in them (including &quot;Into Thin Air,&quot; which certainly is personal, but is not egocentric), and are more enjoyable because of it. The beauty of a good selection of travel essays is that one can imagine oneself participating in the experience. Not &quot;Travels.&quot; Crichton is omnipresent.That being said, I enjoyed reading about climbing Kilimanjaro for the realistic descriptions of the experience. Still, I would have preferred to climb it without Crichton, who should stick with gripping, well-researched fiction."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"My favorite nightstand travel companion. Great little stories about Crichton's life's travels around the world with family and friends. Really, really enjoyable. Too short."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Reading this once again after several years, and it's just as wonderful and fascinating as the first time! Michael had a style of writing that always flowed so beautifully, drew you in, and made it (and still makes it), difficult to put one of his books down, even though you might have to get up at a certain time, and need to go to sleep- now!Somehow, even the most simplistic stuff is interesting! But this has to be one of the very best semi-autobiographcal books I've ever read! Aside from the amazing travels, (which come a little later in the book), Michael's experiences in medical school are recounted in the first section of the book, and are far more fascinating- as well as sometimes humorous and touching- than one might imagine!It's certainy sad that Michael died so youg- with his talent and imagination, he probably had so much more to give us in the way of books and movies, etc."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Personal thoughts on a number of really cool travel experiences. Gives a clue as to where he got some of his ideas/inspirations.Made me hate him less for being a Harvard Grad....but had to laugh about him wearing 'new' boots on Kilimanjaro...Cambridge didn't prepare him for much, and this book explains his thoughts around that as well."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Travels is one of the most fantastic books I have ever encountered. I have two copies just because I can't get enough of this book."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Growing up, I was an avid reader of all MC's books, I loved each and every one. I read them through my teenage years, following each and every release of the new novels he would turn out and marvel at his imagination and granular research into each story he was writing about.It wasn't until I reached my late twenties that I realized I was interested in the type of person who was capable of authoring such books.Reading this offers some insight into Michael's life, the background of some of his books, and the trials and tribulations of someone struggling as an artist. I really enjoyed it, and if you are a Crichton fan, you absolutely will too."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Great insights into what makes Michael Crichton tick. Enjoyed the stories about his experiences in medical school and why he chose to be a writer instead of a doctor. That was the primary reason for purchasing the book. His travels were even more captivating. He traveled to some very unusual places yielding some very unusual experiences. He was a very good writer with some deep insights from his time spent in medical school."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Michael Crichton has written a marvelous book about his life. I couldn't put it down and wanted more. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Michael Crichton does a great job of expressing in writing the thought process behind trying to understand oneself, and paranormal events observed by some people."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Simply put, if I were stuck on a deserted island with only one book to read, this would be it. The stories told in this book give insight to a world that few have explored. It makes you realize that there is more to life than just simply what meets the eye. Beware though, this book is not for the closed-minded. You must be open to new ideas that sometimes may seem far-fetched. Open your mind, read this book, and you will start on a journey that will lead to new discoveries."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"If you've read any of Michael Crichton's SF books like Jurassic Park or the Andromeda Strain, you ought to give this book a go. If you don't like SF, you'll probably STILL love this book. An account of many of the true stories of the author's interesting life, the book is divided into chapters which mostly stand on their own - so if you aren't a big reader, this book is perfect because you can read one chapter and then put it down for a time before going back to it. I gave this book to my Dad (in his early 50s) as a birthday present. The beginning section of the book tells stories of Crichton's time in med school, and the remainder describes the many amazing things that he encountered while travelling throughout the world. From cadaver-sawing to spoon-bending, this book is a spellbinding ride from start to finish."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"As a book-lover, you probably have a favorite that you read a couple of times a year. It sits there in your bookcase, and as you pass by you glance at it and smile, thinking of how much it's meant to you. And one day as you notice it, you say to yourself, \\"It's time I read this again!\\"And so you do, visiting this old dear friend. You see aspects of its personality you hadn't fully noticed in previous readings, concepts that had escaped you before.\\"Travels,\\" by Michael Crichton, is my old dear friend.Crichton was the author of \\"Jurassic Park,\\" \\"The Andromeda Strain\\" and so many other books; and was the creator of the TV show \\"ER.\\"But did you know when he was a medical student at Harvard, he wrote a mystery he called, \\"A Case of Need\\"...using the pseudonymn \\"Jeffery Hunter\\" so no one at the university would know he was the author (students were supposed to study, not write books)? And he'd have been sucessfully anonymous, only....ooops! His book won the Mystery Writers of America \\"Edgar\\" as best mystery novel of the year.The first part of \\"Travels\\" is \\"Medical Days,\\" a fascinating look into the lives of medical students and their patients. It's not written in dry medical terms but in arresting vignettes of different patients, fellow students and teachers.This takes us from 1965 through 1969 and to page 81 (paperback edition). Then he wrote about his travels (1971 through 1986).He climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, and when we read it we're taken right along with him. Wore me out. In Rwanda, he went looking for gorillas and found them. A zoologist with him said that she couldn't study gorillas because they \\"were men.\\" At the end of his stay there, he understood what she meant by that remark.In northern Kenya Crichton went eye to eye with an elephant in the middle of the night; in Bonaire he almost died when scuba diving with his sister; he found Shangri-La, which is no \\"Shangri-La;\\" in Jamaica his girlfriend invited a murderer into the back of their car and he came THIS close to being killed; in Pahang he was literally covered with bees in the jungle; he went swimming with sharks in Tahiti...so many countries, so many adventures, and through them all he was totally open about his feelings, about who he was (he learned this along the way.)Crichton was self-deprecating, which is odd, because this 6'-9\\" man was handsome, brilliant and talented.A little more than half-way through the book, things take an interesting/weird/off-the-wall (depending upon your point of view) turn. These chapters are about his \\"inner travels.\\"Can you picture Michael Crichton believing in spoon bending, seeing and fluffing auras, talking to cacti? He did, and the chapter \\"Cactus Teachings\\" so affected me that years ago I bought a huge cactus and have it yet.The chapter \\"An Entity\\" is one I'll read more than once when I get to it.At the end of the book, Crichton listed his conclusions about psychic phenomena. There are three. First, consciousness has legitimate dimensions not yet guessed at. Secondly, at least some psychic phenomena are real. Third, there are energies associated with the human body that are not yet understood.(At his web site, he was asked once if he still believed what he wrote about in \\"Travels,\\" and he answered that he did, but that he went on to other things.)He did NOT believe in levitation, flying saucers, the Bermuda Triangle, extraterrestrials, palmistry, numerology, astrology, psychic surgery, biorhythms, coincidence or pyramid power.Well, neither do I, but still...that chapter on \\"an entity\\"....And now it's time to get comfortable in my beat-up recliner. sweetened tea at hand, and begin to read for perhaps the fortieth time, \\"Travels.\\"Oh, Michael, we miss you so."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Michael Crichton's deeply autobiographical work, Travels is as an exploration into a person's quest for understanding the world around him and within him. The reader is entertained with snippets of stories that begin in Mr. Crichton's days in medical school and end with a treatise on understanding reality that was to be delivered to a debunking society. Between these bookmarks, Crichton has visited many exotic locals (including northern Pakistan) in addition to quasi summer camps for spiritual growth, charkas, and other New Age topics.Crichton succeeds in writing about these inner travels as clinically as possible. He is not trying to \\"sell\\" you on his experience but rather just trying to get the reader to listen to him. He allows you to make up your mind and even towards the end of the book, he outright states, \\"Don't take my word for it. Go out and see for yourself.\\"Travels is my favorite Crichton work because it covers most of his life as he transforms from a purely scientific individual to one who learns to accept that maybe science doesn't have all of the answers. We see how he challenges himself to look at things in a different way or have a new experience which he claims ultimately makes him a more well-rounded person.While Crichton is supporting the non-scientific world (i.e. psychics, metaphysicists etc.), he is quick to point out that that realm doesn't have all the answers either but that world cannot be discounted. You may not agree with some of the ideas presented in the book but Crichton doesn't necessarily want you to change your thinking. Rather he wants to get you thinking about ideas in a different way and that is the book's greatest value."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I started this book on Saturday night and finished it by Sunday morning. It's well written and interesting to a certain extent. The intent of the book doesn't appear to be in any way related to external/physical travel, but rather Michael's own intellectual (and certainly emotional) travels. Not bad content if you like that sort of aimless (self-serving?) prattle. I'm still not sure what the point of the book is. He's put the Asian, European, Caribbean, etc. travels into the book as a kind of garnish...the main course is his own emotional and intellectual wanderings.I much prefer Jurassic Crichton."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Among his many excellent books, Travels is one of best and most gripping. As the autobiography of one of the most celebrated writers of our time, this book does not disappoint. The fascinating life of Michael Crichton is painted by this master story teller as a gripping tale of adventure, mental angst, and spiritual development. Everything from attending medical school to almost drowning while scuba diving is covered in this thoroughly engrossing book. Crichton describes his life's journeys in a very, almost brutally, honest way. This book, apart from being a great read, lets you get inside Crichton's mind and discover where all of his amazing tales originated."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I've never been interested in reading anything by Michael Crichton, but a friend suggested this, and I have to say I was truly surprised at how good this memoir-style narrative is. What I'm looking for in a good book is something written by an intelligent author with good clean writing skills, something offering interesting and wise reflections and observations on life and human nature - nothing corny. This narrative offers all of this, and Chrichton's combined interests in science and the world's mystical or mysterious offerings as he searches for some clue to the meaning or relevance of life were especially interesting to me. I wish there were more personal narratives such as this by equally adventurous, intelligent people."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"No arm chair traveler here. Crichton shares adventures climbing Kilimanjaro, exploring New Guinea, hiking through the Himalayas, and participating in metaphysical retreats. He also shares his inner-most thoughts, insights about meaning of life, and impact of geography and culture on his world view and inner child. He willingly reveals his frailties but not to demonstrate humility but as object lessons on how to observe oneself and hence to better understand and benefit from how our mind works. Crichton is willing to bare his soul to help himself and the reader have a better understanding about what is possible."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This is not just a travel book. It is a collection of experiences as well that will appeal to travelers of the spiritual realms as well the physical world. Michael has led a truly remarkable life and it is well worth the read!"},{"Title":"Travels","review":"At the time that I picked up my copy of Travels I had read just about all of Crichton's novels with the exception of The Terminal Man and Eaters of the Dead (I'll read them someday). So, I had formed quite a liking for Dr. MC and his writings and thought Travels would be a perfect way to get to see more about the real life of my favorite author.Travels takes you as the reader back in time during his med school years at Harvard and the troubles he experienced throughout the way. Many of his stories dramatically shock you, or make you laugh...they're all so readable. After his med school years, we are taken to the years of his being a writer, and his amazing journeys he took around the globe.The best thing about this book is just reading the raw text of MC. Many people may not know how witty, clever, and sarcastic he really is. I see some comparisons to the No Reservations star Anthony Bourdain...as they are both very tall, lanky, and witty people. Anthony is far more bitter and sarcastic than MC however.His detailed descriptions of his travels really pull you in...like one of his adventure novels. Some of the highlights are the diving adventure with his sister where they nearly run out of air and die, or the climb up Mount Kilimanjaro.I couldn't put this book down - it was that enjoyable. It was amazing to see how such a great writer had such amazing adventures. I know now that he has first handedly been to most of the settings of each of his novels.I was so pleased with Travels and will probably read it again someday soon. Getting to look inside the life and times of one of the best novelists of our time really is a special opportunity that no one should pass up. It shows how detailed and how much time he puts into his work.Read this book and you won't be let down."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I just love this book. I had this book on paperback. Of course someone lent it and never returned. I was so happy to find it as an ebook."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I have been an avid fan of Crichton for years and a fellow travel enthusiast so I figured this book would be perfect, right? He starts by describing his medical days. Ok, interesting enough with some good and humorous stories. On to some of his early travels. Sweet, now we're into what i was really interested in! Then all of a sudden we take an odd departure into a very spiritual journey Crichton took for many years (and many pages!)... huh?This spiritual journey he describes I was not exactly expecting. I've got nothing against it, but didn't necessarily want to spend chapter after chapter reading about him talking to cacti and going through exorcisms. In the end he ties it together with his scientific background justifying what we do not necessarily understand. Ok, I get it... not really a soapbox, but be ready for some interesting experiences Crichton conveys as he basically go in search of himself. Not what i was personally looking for in this book."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Impressive spiritual journeys and around the world. Heart-pounding, fast-paced! You just can't put it down! A brilliant biography! Can't be missed!"},{"Title":"Travels","review":"MC has had such a fascinating life. Really enjoyed reading and learning more. Understanding his personal history makes his novels more interesting."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"\\"If you're a writer, the assimilation of important experiences almost obliges you to write about them. Writing is how you make the experience your own, how you explore what it means to you, how you come to possess it and ultimately release it.\\"So states Michael Crichton in the preface to this brilliant and captivating book. Known the world over as a hugely intelligent and entertaining writer of imaginative fiction, he brings all his talents to bear as he sets out to describe his own extraordinary travel adventures. Whilst seeking to explore what these experiences mean to him, he invites us to share his thoughts and feelings and some very personal insights too.Early chapters describe medical school and the beginnings of his career as a writer and film director, and anyone with even the most perfunctory knowledge of his work will recognise much of the background to it here. Despite achieving considerable success however, he finds his values beginning to change and in an effort to fend off depression he hits the road. At this point the book really takes off as he launches into a series of chapters covering trips made all over the world over a period of 15 years.Michael Crichton does not always emerge as an attractive or sympathetic character. However, through his willingness to expose his limitations and vulnerabilities, he is revealed as a fallible and human person who seeks to grow and learn whatever he can from life.Highlights for me included a wonderful description of ascending Kilimanjaro, and the internal dialogue which sustained him during it, and two conference retreats in the mojave desert, where he experiences some weird and wonderful revelations whilst in a state of heightened awareness.As someone who also felt a compulsive desire to travel, only to realise much later this was actually the reflection of an inner journey, I could really relate to this book. I would say it is one of the finest I have read, without a doubt his best. Whilst his fiction can be an intellectual treat, this book is a much more emotional and involving experience. I found it highly enjoyable and influential, hugely resonant and powerful, thought provoking and helpful, and have returned to it many times. Not everyone will enjoy it, but to those of thoughtful and inquiring mind in search of some of life's answers, I cannot recommend it highly enough. We can but hope that one day he will write, if not perhaps a sequel, then more in similar vein sharing the sort of insights which make this book so enlightening and rewarding."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"A must read for anyone who wants to be inspired! I have more of a drive to read, write, enjoy life, take risks and explore. I have been recommending this to everyone I know since i finished Chapter 1!!"},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This book doesn't seem to have a lot of connection - except travel. It is more of a travel book than a novel. But I enjoyed hearing about far-away places that I will never see."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Michael Crichton was an incredible author, and, in my opinion, this was his best work.This book presents you with a lot of ideas and experiences that you, otherwise, may never cross paths with.I've read this book 3 times, and bought at least 3 copies to lend out. Don't skip over this one!"},{"Title":"Travels","review":"\\"Travels\\" by Michael Crichton.Michael Crichton didn't want to be a doctor, but he attended the entire course and worked in different department. At the end, he refused to receive his right to practice his art, despite he received his diploma.This decision was based on his childhood, that was not easy. Actually, he never wanted to be a doctor, this was his parents' decision.So after having written four very good novels including \\"Andromeda Strain\\", which became a tremendous success; after making a movie (\\"West World\\") which was a great success -the movie didn't cost much- and being a doctor, he settled in a apartment building in Hollywood. The right place to live experiences. He was THE DOCTOR in this building and he was bothered by the other tenants. After succeeding in litterature, in movies, and being a doctor, he suddenly felt sad, depressed.Simply because he didn't have any goals to achieve. Then he saw a psychiatrist and after several weeks, he realized... (I don't tell you).He spent his childhood to travel in America, Europe, South America and this was what he knew the best. He never intended, then to write other books. First, he had to clean up his mind and arrange all his things otherwise. He had too many ideas to write other books. So he was married, but was seducing several women.\\"Travels\\" his a strange book, made from his souvenirs, corrected later. His style is natural since he didn't intend to publish it. It's the story of a gifted man who lacked of assurance and a goal in his life. It's funny, scary, surprising and he wrote about events that we would forget. Anything inspired him.What saved him is that he decided to travel. You will travel through time and space, since his book tells us adventures happening years ago, in a different world, where Africa was not tamed. (He was not Tarzan, just a writer).You will learn how doctors are prepared for their work since the first day when they dissect a corpse. This training for years change their mind, they have to see things otherwise which is the best thing that happened to Michael Crichton.His book allow readers to know better about themselves. To take risks, to admit that reality differs from peoples and others; that culture can be strange and probably the result of varying conditions of living, with strange taboos in each society and to me, it meant that a Global Village can be something good or bad, strange, that forces our mind to open to these realities. It seems easy, but it is not.We have to travel around the world to become a traveler, then we travel in our mind to face the ugly and the scary and tame the unconscious part which is protecting us clumsily.I fought to have \\"travels\\" for Christmas and I have no regrets. And by the way, visit his site, there is a series of essays by Michael Crichton, texts. Michael Crichton raises questions and it's up to the readers to find the answers."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Great insight into Mr. Crichton's personal life, his decisions, and his views on living life to the fullest."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I love international travel and thought that I was buying a travel memoir that would inspire new ideas for my travels. Instead, I found this book to be frustrating, annoying, irritating, and almost unbearable to finish. I have lost all respect for Michael Crichton. During the 10% of this book that actually covered international travel expeditions, I found him to be a whiney, cry-baby. He had no backbone, complained about EVERYTHING, and found no joy in the simple things in life. He certainly didn't find the \\"growth\\" that he claimed. Beyond that, the other 90% of the book covered his strange fascination with auras, spoonbending, etc. It was just weird. Not a travel memoir by ANY means. If you seek to read this book because you've got the travel bug and are looking for inspiration...look elsewhere. This book should NOT be in the travel memoir section of the bookstore. I want my money back!!!"},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I am truly surprised so many people loved this book. I bought it as soon as I saw it because I was a huge Michael Crichton fan. Big mistake. He shows himself as selfish, whiny, immature, and self-absorbed. I will have a hard time reading another one of his books with such a horrible image of him."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"It took me 1 month to finish reading this book. It was a disappointment compared to his other novels. It's a waste of money and time."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"There are adventures throughout the world. If you can write well, you can share those adventures with others.Michael Crichton can write well (with the clear exception of State of Fear), and he shares his adventures, his \\"travels.\\" These travels are his travels through medical school, in search of adventure in out-of-the-way places, and his search for \\"the power of the mind\\" [my words, not his].Two sections bother me a lot. One is his search for that \\"power of the mind\\"... for example, bending spoons with the power of thought. Although he keeps claiming that his science background keeps him on the straight and narrow, after bending his own spoon he says \\"great! No need to search for any explanation.\\" The travel analogy would be, what? You suddenly appear in China, and the path to get there is not important.Strike one.As Crichton hangs around with \\"friends\\" interested in pursuing sex with children in Thailand, he states he is not interested, but \\"boys will be boys\\" [again, my words].Strike two.And I'm sorry... State of Fear?Strike three.Michael Crichton, you are out!"},{"Title":"Travels","review":"A good friend of mine insisted I'd read this book, because she knows I love exploring the spiritual aspects of life.In the end I was very disappointed. Not in the writing or the exploration aspects of the book, but Michael Crichton's whole attitude. He would spend a chapter sharing his learnings and his eye opening experiences, only to revert back to his arrogant, narrow-minded attitude once again for the next chapter. How can anyone claim they've learned anything in life when nothing they learn from it seems to sink in?Sadly, this book left me with a very bad taste in my mouth. I have no desire to read any more of his books."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"The book starts off strong with interesting accounts of his medical school experiences, but after a while, the story becomes more of a sales pitch for meditation and other new age mumbo jumbo. By the end, Crichton looks like a total kook rather than the \\"Harvard trained physcian\\" that he uses to advertise himself. If you really want to read about \\"Travels,\\" pick up a copy of Tony Horwitz, Bill Bryson, or writers who actually know how tell a story."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"We were very disappointed as the book arrived very wet. It was December during the time that we had a month of heavy rain. It was packaged in a paper envelope and it was soaked when we opened the packaging so when it finally dried after several days, it was in terrible shape. The pages were wrinkly, some of the ink ran and it had a smell to it! And it was a Christmas gift so it was very disappointing!A suggestion would be that in the winter when weather conditions are wet that the book be put into a plastic bag before wrapped in the paper packaging."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"this book just didn't cut it to me. It started out good, but then just kind of lost me. I'm not a big fan of meta-physical stuff, and the last 1/3 of this book is full of it.

This book may leave to hanging."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Have you ever wondered how Michael Crichton came up with such diverse stories as &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, &quot;Sphere&quot;, &quot;The Andromeda Strain&quot; and &quot;Congo&quot;? Maybe because he draws on real life experiences...as his curiosity urges him to find out first hand. I mean, what better way to do research for his novels?I have read many of Micheal Crichton's books in the past and found this one to be just as enjoyable as any of his fictional stories. I highly recommend this book as it gives you an insight into how he chose the subjects for many of his stories. I guess that's why you always feel a certain amount of realism when reading his work.Follow his journeys which range from the spiritual to the dangerous, his experiences as a doctor and feeling embarrassed to use his own name when he sold his first few short stories."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I found the first part of this book very interesting. His autobiographical accounts resonated to my own experiences. However, he seems lost as to life's purposes, and the second half of the book seems more about his searches of the occult, and for meanings of life, than of storytelling. I found this portion quite disappointing. He finalizes the book with a &quot;sales talk&quot; about reconciling science and the occult. I think he is still lost about life's purposes."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This is The third time I've read this book. It's still a rather good for the book with this thick for me. This is the book telling us about the experience of Michael Crichton. This guy have done a lot of thing in his life and reflect to the way he think and write the books. I found many parts of this book is interesting, even touching and inspiring. The exceptional part is about his search &amp; participate in spiritual stuff. This book fill with various activities he has done and to be honest, it's not boring at all. In conclusion, if you want to find a book that tell the various stories of life with a wonderful thought (in some parts), this is the book for you. The only problem for me is that the end chapter of this book dealing purely just with his thought about the Science &amp; Spiritual with proven to be too much."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I am an avid Crichton reader, and this is by far the best book he has written. It looked deeply into all aspects of his intellectual pursuits, as well as the many facets of life around us.This book is a great inspiration for me. From the people he meets, to the choices he's made, he explains everything in a detailed and logical manner. This book is gives a rare insight into one of the best intellects of our time."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Authors are always trying to craft the ultimate opening sentence. In \\"Travels,\\" Michael Crichton outdoes himself: \\"It is not easy to cut through a human head with a hacksaw.\\" Crichton is off and running, and the first nine chapters, all dealing with his medical studies, simply fly by. It's absolutely engrossing material. The book takes a sharp turn into accounts of Crichton's world travels, and by the time he segues into the paranormal, the pace slows considerably.Crichton discusses his experiences with psychic phenomena such as seeing auras, talking (and listening) to plants, palmistry, being possessed, and on and on. He is a skeptic with a medical and scientific background, so his perspective is an interesting one. He makes a good case for there being areas of consciousness that we have barely begun to explore.I have read all of Michael Crichton's fiction, but this was the first nonfiction of his that I have read. One thing is clear: the guy can flat-out write. When I can read page after page and not even think about the mechanics of the text, I know the author is a good one. \\"Travels\\" is a fascinating book, particularly if you have an interest in exotic locales and the world of the paranormal."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Wow! I wish I had Michael Chrichton's money. Or his brain. But not both. Travels is proof to me that too much money and too much brain make you emotionally unstable. But it also makes a great book. I love his thrillers, mostly for escapism, but where I can read a paperback and get away from it all, Michael Chrichton needs to climb Mount Kilimanjaro or go to Tahiti. And somehow it's fascinating to see how this mind works. Or doesn't. A great read, strangely alluring, but rather like a moped. Great to ride but don't let your buddies catch you."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"This is a consistently intriguing collection of autobiographical sketches. Mr. Crichton has done some serious travelling in his time, around our planet, and also inward, metaphorical travels. His journeys are either to rarely visited geographical locales (such as various obscure Himalayan kingdoms, pre-massacre Rwanda, Hong Kong...) or to even more rarely visited, X-Files-ish states of mind, where spoons are bent with sheer concentration, the human aura is visible, and the future can be seen.I wasn't sure what I thought about some of the more mystical explorations he undertakes here, but the older I get, the more open-minded I am to things like that. He really comes across as being honest, and quite psychologically perceptive. If you liked his novel &quot;Sphere&quot;, this will give you a sense of the kind of thought processes that gave rise to the interesting ending of that story. Also, I should say, if you liked &quot;Congo&quot;, be on the lookout for various scenes here that clearly influenced the writing of that book. I won't give them away here...In general, I have to say that many of the more spiritual components of this book are some of the most accessible, interesting, and provocative passages on the nature of consciousness I've ever had the pleasure of reading. He makes you really think about the mind, and how we use it, or fail to use it. He uses plain, unacademic language to describe experiences that are too often shrouded in mumbo-jumbo words like &quot;epistemelogical&quot; or &quot;phenomenological&quot;. Anyone can read this book, and anyone who thinks about it can profit from it. Two thumbs up."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"Michael Crichton has been through a lot, and in this book he shows that he doesn't need to make stuff up to be interesting.The early sections of _Travels_ cover his days at Harvard and in medical school and offer an interesting perspective on experiences there. Later he describes travels to various exotic locations. Some of the accounts are illuminating; others are no deeper than a travel guide. The last sections are devoted to Crichton's supposed experimentation with the paranormal, i.e., bending spoons and seeing auras and the like.Crichton strains credibility with his descriptions of these hokey ESP things, but in general his writing is engaging. Even the hokey sections have a spookiness to them that I must admit I enjoyed quite a lot. Better travel writing can be found elsewhere, but it is interesting to hear the familiar Crichton narrative voice focusing his lens inward in these pages."},{"Title":"Travels","review":"I bought this book \\"used\\". It was delivered promptly and in quite good condition. I loved the book! If you would like to \\"know\\" Michael Crichton better, this is a must read. I have a Kindle, but suspected that I would want the hard copy of this one - I was right."},{"Title":"A Celtic Model of Ministry: The Reawakening of Community Spirituality","review":"Many people in the mainline churches today worry about the declining numbers, declining effectiveness, and declining spirit in the congregations. There is no mistaking that there are many crises in the modern world, but which ones should be addressed by the church? What are people looking for, and how can the church deliver? Is this even the right way to look at matters?In 'A Celtic Model of Ministry', Jerry Doherty, an Episcopal priest from Montana, suggests that there are a few identifiable critical crises that the church can and should address. Like almost no other period in history, all beliefs and traditions are being questioned -- the very survival of Christianity (and other religions such as Judaism) is at stake. Doherty suggests that the true solution is a spiritual reawakening, the development of new relationships with God. Doherty sees in the history of the Celtic peoples and their relationships and patterns of community some intriguing answers. In much the same way that the ancient Celtic Christians revitalised and restored Christianity to the collapsing Roman Empire, so to can Celtic Christian patterns reinvigourate the church today.The critical crises include a crisis of individualism, a crisis of faith, and a crisis of lifestyle. The crisis of individualism is a logical extension of the same individualistic idealism that helped make America great -- however, it has lost the complementary aspect of community, which Doherty proposes as crucial to the solution of the crisis. Doherty devotes several chapters to illustrating the idea of community and spirituality in Celtic worlds, as well as makes suggestions for the creation of new, similar communities in modern churches.The second primary crisis is that of faith. Doherty traces the oriental-influenced aspects of Christianity, and writes of how modern Enlightenment ideas have removed some of the mystery (mystical) and the practical spirituality from the faith, making it in many respects a completely rational, academic pursuit that ultimately cannot be sustained in such a framework with a great degree of emotional and spiritual satisfaction.The final crisis, that of lifestyle, shows the difficulties of living a 'Christian life' outside of the walls of the church. Part of this is the fault of the clergy, and part of the laity, and part society at large. Ministry needs to be a shared by all parties, and not relegated to or left to a particular subset of people. Doherty uses the examples of many of the Celtic missionary saints to demonstrate the Christian life of service and outreach beyond the walls of church and monastery.Doherty draws on ancient authors and modern scholars, poetry and prose from historical and literary sources, hymn texts, and personal stories to demonstrate his processes and illustrate his points. The text is well-organised and coherent, with many practical suggestions.One thing that could be emphasised more (and this is a general criticism of many books that put forward models or strategies for ministry) is approaching congregations and local communities where they are -- taking into account the history and personalities of those persons already in community. How the Celtic model would deal with conflicts that will inevitably arise would be an interesting question to address more fully.Doherty provides a nice-sized bibliography (particularly given the small size of the book) and an index, always an advantage in a book designed to be studied. This is a good resource for pastors, lay leaders, and anyone interesting in building authentic communities."},{"Title":"A Celtic Model of Ministry: The Reawakening of Community Spirituality","review":"First, why this book merits the stars it does get:(1) The Bibliography is excellent, and is highly recommended as a great source for further reading ideas.(2) The author has the good sense to have recognized a good idea and to have tried to work with it in his own church and to point others to it. For this alone, Doherty is to be commended.Now, why it only gets two stars:This book is a surface-level introduction to the topic at best. It excels in stating the obvious, and then in regurgitating others' ideas. When the author does attempt a truly original observation, he fails to develop it.Contra the previous reviewer, I don't see the practical suggestions. Telling us the obvious truth that we need to develop programs of relevance to the surrounding community is NOT a practical suggestion -- it is an annoyance in this case because it is scarcely followed with even an example from his OWN ministry, much less an actual plan. I don't doubt that he knows what he's talking about (and I'd bet his dissertation really might be good), but it's just not here.The basic ideas are found in earlier (and better) works, especially by George Hunter and Ian Bradley, whose books are light years ahead of this one in quality. OK, there's another reason for the presence of some stars: the book could lead one to these superior works, and Doherty (to his credit) is very open about his dependence on these and other authors.Finally, the author grossly oversimplifies the phenomenon of membership losses from the mainline churches, and seems to be saying contradictory things at numerous points. He is surely correct about the deleterious effects of &quot;individualism&quot; on the formation of true community, but then seems not to notice that merely coming up with programs to meet the &quot;felt needs&quot; of individualistic people (read &quot;consumers&quot;) creates an ersatz community -- as soon as the church next door does it bigger and better, a whole bunch of people leave, and everyone is just as individualistic/narcissistic as before.His analysis as it touches on the role of belief (conservative/liberal/etc.) in church membership losses is extremely shallow as well, as is the content of the gospel he apparently advocates. It's amazing that he can put the liberal, modernistic, &quot;never say anything negative about another religion&quot; Christianity on a par with the vigorous orthodoxy of a Patrick or a Brendan! While Patrick and the early Irish monks WERE remarkably patient and non-judgmental, they made no compromises with a religious order that they saw as under the dominion of dark powers. While I agree that conservatives too often create intellectual scandals where there should be none and often offer to the world unbelievable beliefs, Doherty seems not to see that the liberal mainline too often gives the secular folk nothing special in which to believe -- the old liberal &quot;Fatherhood of God and brotherhood of man&quot; has as much baggage after the 20th century as does an inerrant Bible and an interventionist God.To his credit, he does recognize that experience of God is what people are really (rightly) after, but then never seems to see how easily narcissism/individualism co-opts this search and makes his symbolic/non-literal interpretation of the Bible run the serious risk of being ruined by the idolatrous self-absorption of those who practice it.I could go on, but I won't. My advice to anyone interested in this great topic: avoid this one and read Hunter and Bradley. Oh, sorry -- one final quibble: the book needs a thorough re-editing, as I found numerous typos. Now -- go read Hunter or Bradley."},{"Title":"A Celtic Model of Ministry: The Reawakening of Community Spirituality","review":"The previous reviewer was right in that Doherty includes a LOT of summarization of other writers on this subject. However, that makes me want to encourage this book even more, as you can read it and get a general overview of other author's takes on this issue without having to read the other authors. I find he does a better job of saying what Hunter wanted to say than Hunter did himself.I am also forced to agree with the previous reviewer that some of his original thoughts do not have satisfactory explanations or examples. But I get the impression that Doherty, and his parish, are working these issues out for themselves and, thus, can't give specifics. It's a way forward, not a complete map.There are some frustrating omissions, though. His vision for the Church, by his own admission, seems more geared toward the tolerant \\"middle\\" and \\"left\\" of society. Is it inevitable that we are to be separated by these issues? Also, I find his list of the most pressing issues in society (the environment, racism, sexism, etc.) to pale in comparison to others (broken families, for instance).Overall, however, I find this book excellent. Even if I didn't entirely subscribe to his every premise (and I'm not sure I have yet), I can see how seemingly \\"liberal\\" churches (like the ELCA) may not be doomed to oblivion after all. There is hope.Bottom line: this book may just prove to radically alter my conception of the Church without touching my dearest held beliefs. For that, Doherty deserves at least four stars."},{"Title":"A Celtic Model of Ministry: The Reawakening of Community Spirituality","review":"Rev Doherty takes an insightful and thoughtful look at the role that organized (particularity \`mainstream') religion plays in modern life. Central to this process he examines how the concept of Individualism has influenced that relationship and what it means with regard to the fall in religious participation over the past 2-3 decades. He then compares the paradigms of how religions communities related to one another and the rest of society through the centuries since the birth of Christ. From these comparisons he draws conclusions that relate back to the historical isolation of the Celtic people in Ireland, Scotland and Wales. In this analysis he finds the basis for a new paradigm on which to build congregations true to our Judeo-Christian roots but far more pertinent and meaningful to our modern times. This book is particularly pertinent to congregations who are exploring the establishment of Total Ministry."},{"Title":"A Celtic Model of Ministry: The Reawakening of Community Spirituality","review":"This presentation of Celtic Christianity is mean to ofer a neew way of being Church, but instead the thesis presents an overlay of Celtic spirituality as though it were change. Administrative, polity and governance issues are left without any adequate address. These are the structural and theological issues of import to the church. We need to address them if we're to arrive anywhere beyond the 19th century re-run we are currently on in America. I do think this book has something to offer, however. It gives readers a good introduction to the ideas that church leaders need to articulate. It's worth buying to read and pass along."},{"Title":"Death Instinct (Signet)","review":"Once again the King Of The Macabre has done it again.

You won't be sorry."},{"Title":"Death Instinct (Signet)","review":"Phillip Emmons, a pseudonym for horror author Bentley Little, is the author of the serial killer novel \\"Death Instinct\\". Published early in Little's career, this one is different from the horror novels that have made Little a household name in the realm of horror fiction. While not a fan of the serial killer novel genre, I found \\"Death Instinct\\" to be very entertaining, but not difficult to determine/guess the identity of the serial killer.The story involves a series of gruesome murders in Phoenix that has police baffled. They can't seem to find any clues and only begin to realize the truth when being tipped off by someone romantically involved with a member of the force. A young boy is actually the one who first suspects the killer. It's difficult to give many details about the book without giving away key elements of the plot and/or clues to the killer.Needless to say, the identity of the killer shouldn't come as a surprise. It might be a bit farfetched, but the explanation behind the killer's motives is logical. If you enjoy serial killer novels and can locate this one (it's been out-of-print for many years), grab it and enjoy it."},{"Title":"Death Instinct (Signet)","review":"Bentley Little may be one of the best horror writers around today, but this was not an overnight process. Death Instinct, a book he published early in his career under the pseudonym Phillip Emmons, shows both the lesser quality of his earlier writing (though it is still good) and his potential for good things to come.The faults in this book come particularly from the plot, which is a routine serial killer potboiler. We have a beautiful woman with a tormented past, in this case, Cathy Riley, who lives a sheltered life with her emotionally abusive father. There is the handsome detective, Lieutenant Allan Grant, who must take the lead in an investigation when a series of hideous murders occur. By page 20, you know romance is in the future for these two souls. And, of course, there are the killings, which are both shocking and mysterious and will lead the two future lovebirds together.In many ways, this novel is indistinguishable from dozens of others in the same genre. My guess is that Little was driven more by commercial considerations than actual artistic vision with this tale. His later books offer much more originality. On the other hand, Little's gifts are apparent with his serial killer; I won't reveal the identity of this villain, but with a lesser writer, the killer would come off as weak or silly. With Little, the killer is one of the creepier ones you're likely to read about.This may be one of Little's minor works, but his adeptness makes this book still good, even if greatness eludes it. If you like serial killer stories or are a fan of Little's other works, Death Instinct is well worth reading."},{"Title":"Death Instinct (Signet)","review":"This novel, one of the author's early works, was originally released under the author's pen name, Phillip Emmons. There is little in it that reminds one of some of the author's later works. Instead of a highly imaginative, horror novel, this is a pretty straightforward novel about a serial killer. Still, there is just a little bit of a twist in the tale.The plot is somewhat formulaic and much more commercial than some of the author's later efforts, and lacks some of the creativity a fan of the author has come to associate with this author's work. Still, this is not a book that fans of the author's horror fiction should pass up, as there are some surprises in store for the reader.In Phoenix, Arizona, Cathy Riley is a young, pretty woman who lived a somewhat reclusive life with her disabled father, a nasty man with whom she stays out of duty. Cathy lives across the street from a house where a woman and her mentally handicapped son, Randy, have moved in. There is something not quite right about this mother and son duo.Meanwhile, a series of grisly murders have been taking place in Cathy's neighborhood, murders that are being investigated by Detective Allen Grant. When Cathy's path crosses that of the detective, an attraction begins to blossom into something greater. Meanwhile, the body count rises, and soon Cathy herself is in danger.The best thing about this book is the serial killer himself. While the discerning reader figures out early on who the serial killer is, the twist in the tale has to do with how and why he kills. It is here that the reader sees a glimmer of the author Bentley Little will become."},{"Title":"Death Instinct (Signet)","review":"The overall premise of this book is intriguing. A vicious serial killer (the only killings that rival these are the ones in Messiah) is stalking a small area in the city of Phoenix, and between killings we are introduced to Cathy (the novel's central character), her (so mean that its unrealistic) father, Allan (the local know-it-all cop who's hunches are always correct), Jimmy (the nice neighbor kid who's alchoholic father doesn't care about him), and the weird lady and her mentally retarded son who just moved into the haunted house across the street. As the story develops and the characters are intertwined (I bet you don't have to read any more than the list of characters in this review to realize who gets romantically linked. Half of the book is an effective who-done-it, but when we finally find out who is behind the killings, the brakes are slammed on and the reader is forced to ask his or herself &quot;Could _____ actually do that?&quot; The answer is probably not, but the story is still quite chilling and the prerequisite &quot;visit to the expert on the subject&quot; scene is very good. Its hard to write an effective review without placing spoilers all over, but I would recommend this book to anyone who loves the serial killer horror genre. It's an interesting twist on the convention."},{"Title":"Death Instinct (Signet)","review":"Spoilers alert---don't read further if you don't want to know what this book is about.Death Instinct's description on the back of the book is what caught me. It's my first Bentley Little novel. The murders in this book are extremely strange, defiantly from the mind of a brilliant psychotic. Cathy lives with her bitter father. Her brother David traumatized her when she was younger. However, the whole David issue had me a bit confused. He enjoyed being naked and showing himself to her, he let his friends watch her use the restroom and he killed a rabbit naked. But it never mentions if he raped her or something else horrible. The book kind of leads the reader to wonder about David but there's never any answers. Also the terror that happened in the house across the street isn't really explained other than on the back cover. Unless I just don't remember this part. Jimmy is the kid who lives down the street, he's alone. His father is out all the time and just doesn't have time for Jimmy so Cathy plays guardian for the boy. When the new neighbors move in Jimmy and Cathy are hopeful that they have a child Jimmy can play with. They do have a child but he's not the playing type.The West's moved into the old house where the previous owners died in. The mother is nothing close to friendly and the boy is retarded. But when you look at him, he has an evil look about him. Something isn't right. Soon the killings start. They are horrible and twisted with no order to them at all. The book is very good at not letting the reader know who the killer is too early. As the victims pile up the reader is hooked, unable to put the book down. When Randy, the retarded boy is finally named as the killer, I was wondering if this could be possible. Then when Cathy gets into his house, searching for Jimmy who Randy has taken and discovers the naked man tied to the bed, I was thinking where is this taking me. Then to discover he's retarded too, wow! That's just sick.Cathy is a very likable character as in Allen, the cop. And Jimmy, he's just great. I didn't understand the twist with his father though and the reading of the ritual and witchcraft book. It felt like that was just thrown in there to throw the reader off. Also the chase to find Randy at the end felt overdone. I think the book should have ended in the house when they found Cathy and Robert. The extra killings felt like too much and over the top for the little retarded boy.Over all, this was a good book, I don't feel I wasted my time with this book but I do feel a little in shock. Read the book, you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"Death Instinct (Signet)","review":"They say, the older books of an author is normally the better ones. This is definitely the case for Mr Little. Comparing this to The Vanishing which I read later, it was a case of Mr Little being thankful that I read this book first. For if it was the other way round, I might have opted to skip all of his other books.Death Instinct introduces a \\"savant\\" to us and it is thrilling in every sense. Little ends every chapter at a point which you cannot stop and you end up finishing the book pretty quickly.The only low point is that the killer was not kept on wraps long enough, otherwise it would definitely have been a 5 star book. Otherwise, the way Little ravels around characters every chapter and then link them up together is truly one of the areas I am most impressed of."},{"Title":"Death Instinct (Signet)","review":"First off, this is the first book of his I've read. I'm use to reading books like this about detectives finding a serial killer yada yada yada. But my mom got this for my grandpa for his birthday and I just finished my book and picked up his cause it sounded good. My mom and grandpa usually read a lot of his stuff. They told me some of his books are good, some are bad. This book had it's good points and bad points.Let's start with the good points.*It had a good story line and the killings were unlike anything i've read in any other books. It had a great ending although, it didn't start picking up till the last 100 or so pages. All the action didn't really start happening till then end. Although with the short chapters it was easy to get through.The bad points I didn't like in the book were a couple.*For one I felt like the author is kind of perverted since from the first page he's always talking about guys having erections and playing with themselves. I really don't find that kind of perversion necessary in books especially when it's unrelated to anything and it's just thrown in there. It got to be quiet annoying.*Then from the beginning of the book it's telling about this girls background and of course it jumps a head 20 years later. I don't see why it even had to bring up the background problems of her and her brother since the brother wasn't even in the book except for her dreams or flashbacks of memories with him.*I found this book kinda obvious with who the killer was. I mean it talks about this house being vacant for years because of a murder that happened when the star girl was little. It makes you think maybe the house is haunted. Then people move in and there isn't any point in that so you know they would have to be with the killings cause why else would they be in the story line?Maybe it's because I'm not use to his writing styles but I just found some of the things in the book to be unnecessary details since nothing came about them.

A history of Ford in the 1960's.This can almost be described as an 180 page,high quality catalogue of 1960's Fords.This book is a must have book.Beautiful colour and black & white photos throughout make this book a classic.Covers the models of Ford Galaxie,Fairlane,Sunliner,Falcon,Thunderbird,Mustang,Econoline,Cobra,Shelby Mustangs,Torino,LTD,F-100,Custom,Talladega, concept cars and a chapter on Ford racing.This is the best book I've seen on 1960's Ford's.This book will impress most people.Its a gem! Great value too."},{"Title":"Ford of the Sixties","review":"The Ford slogan during its heyday as a COOOOOL car was \\"drive a Ford! It's a BETTER Idea!\\" and \\"Ford gives you better ideas.\\" It did with some serious classics like the Falcon, the Galaxie 500 and the very cool Fairlane. Cool cars like that gave Ford a good name.Parris treats readers to the behind the curtain look at the Ford Motor Company during the glory days of the flying Falcon, the shooting Comets (a Mercury) and other cool classics. I love the stories about the Fords of the era. The 1960s brought the coolest cars Ford ever put on the road. Henry Ford II had plenty of better ideas and the 1960-65 Falcons, Fairlanes, Galaxies and Thunderbirds were proof postitive of this.Classic Ford lovers will delight in the pictures of the beautiful Fords of the 1960s. Falcon lovers will especially love this book, chock full of better ideas. People who have classic cars as a special interest will certainly want this book. I love it!"},{"Title":"Ford of the Sixties","review":"This was a gift for my adult son. He is very partial to Fords and in fact owns a classic. He was pleased with it."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"I read this book about 15yrs ago it had a great impact on my life. Nicky Cruz has a great testimony . I recently purchsed this book for my nephew . Run Baby Run has been a great ministry tool for me within the youth population whether you live in a booming metroplis or a small town everyone i have purchesed this book for has found something they can relate too."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"This book was the kind of book that you cannot put down. It immediately catches your attention and the content keeps it. This book does an amazing job of showing how a person can go from living in a pit of \\"hell\\" to the point where their only view is that of heaven. The most amazing part of the book is how alive the Holy Spirit was in Nicki's life. Great book to read when you need to be inspired in God."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"Truly, I'm not into books AT ALL. My cousin borrowed me this book and it took me about 3 months before I even opened it(busy life). I thought maybe I'd read 3 chapters and give it back since I already had it for longer than expected. But, the book is truly captivating from beginning to end! Once I started, I couldn't put the book down. The fact that it is a REAL testimony and not a fictional story gives it more props!It's easier to pass judgment on street teens, gang-bangers, drug addicts when you're in the outside looking-in. But, the details in the book about what it's like living \\"The Street World\\" broadened my insight, giving me a WHOLE new perspective of troubled lives LONGING for a FRESH start, HOPING for a U-TURN in their lives, but seemingly TRAPPED in the error of their ways!When all else fails, and you find yourself TRAPPED behind the concrete walls of a messed-up life with NO DOORS to open and NO WINDOWS to break, your only way out is LOOKING UP to Jesus! This book will MOVE you...I recommend this book to EVERYONE, from \\"Street Kids\\" to Church Leaders, believers and non-believers alike. This book will impact your life and broaden the mind!"},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"Personal testimony is one of the greatest treasures to share.

That is what Jesus does,he takes what was intended for bad and makes it good-If we let him! and Nicki Cruz Let him! Amen,Amen,Amen! MUST READ!"},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"I read this book several times while still in school. I was lucky enough to see Nicky Cruz speak on a couple of occasions, and found his story fascinating. I found it exciting where it needed to be and uplifting as well. It is an amazing story and sheds light in a dark area. His story is from decades ago, but now more than ever, it is useful. Today's gang-obsessed youth could really use a book like this in their lives. Even without the religious themes within the book, the messages of hope and positive change are important."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"I was glued to this book from the very beginning.

Nicky Cruz's gang was really very violent, fighting with policemen often and many people there were drug addicts. But a preacher introduced Nicky to Jesus Christ one day and then everything changed..."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"First read some 25 years ago, this is an account of touching reality - a harsh environment of tortuously limited survival odds. That Cruz escapes is testament to the persistance of his religious preceptor. As compelling a message, however, is the strength Cruz found within to turn from his familiar and disturbingly comfortable existance. Therein lies the true purpose - it is less a bible thumping exercise than an exemplar of spiritual power. I have read the book on countless occasions and, though not deeply religious, have often drawn on it's dynamism. As with other critques, I believe that as a tale of hope, though it may not convert, it might at least reform."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"Although I haven't read this book by Nicky Cruz, I thought I'd just add my own \\"2 cents\\". This is just a bit of trivia about the author. This is the same Nicky Cruz who is mentioned in the book, The Cross and The Switchblade. He was portrayed in the 1970's movie, of the same name, by a young Eric Estrada (TV's CHIPS)."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"I first read this book when I moved to New York 7 years ago. It really opened my eyes to a lot."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"Sent book fast, enjoyed, but 30 pages missing (made up for it by sending book later one day service free)"},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"I have a VERY hard time believing that many parts of this \\"memoir\\" are true. I am sure he had a rough time and was from a rough neighborhood but the book is littered with Christian speak and rings really inauthentic and manipulative to say the least. Nicky Cruz would have us believe that a minister came in to the ghetto and brought the heads of every gang to their knees in prayer on the street after preaching for just a few minutes, then somehow gets EVERY gang memeber in Brooklyn to attend a tent revival. Where are the people from The Smoking Gun, It smells like some major embellishing to me. Not to mention the writing style is dated and pretty sophomoric. There are alot of typos and grammatical errors and it pretty much feels like it's been written by someone who writes for The Watch Tower magazine.Hey I'm all for a good redemption story but this one just feels like propaganda, if you want to read a good gang redemption story, read a book called Monster."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"I read this book about six years ago, when I was 13, where I had a paperback copy, which was blue... Now after all this time If ever I am asked, which was the greatest book that I have ever read. &quot;Run, Baby Run&quot; is by far, one of the best. I would recommend this book to all teenagers, so they are made aware of the difficult life of drugs and violence and yearn to avoid it at all cost."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"It's an excellent read, a book that you find hard to put down once you start to read, a book that makes you feel that you are with Nicky all the way. I have purchased this book a couple of times and when I tell friends they then ask me to lend them my copy and I then do not get it back, I have now got a 3rd copy on order from my local book shop, and this one I will keep if I can get hold of it."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"I have read the novel Run Baby Run 3 or more times and it has really moved me and I recommend this book to all my friends and my boyfriend. It is amazing how God can change someones life so dramatically. I would love to go to one of Nicky Cruz's ministries sometime in the future and actually meet the man who has made a dramastic change in my life."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"Run, Baby Run is a powerful book. I bought this as a gift to a mother who had difficulty holding hope and faith for her troubled son who was on drugs and living a life as such. Knowing Nicky's testimony from this scene I saw God's love and power to deliver anyone. It's such a faith strengthener and builder. We see our great God in action helping our young people regardless of their circumstnces. I highly recommend Run, Baby Run."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"The first part of this book is sometimes scary and ugly to read, but so real you may not be able to put it down. Think you had a rough childhood?This book may lead you, like me, to count your blessings! The second half deals with Nicky's life after his dramatic conversion. It is the reason I did not give five stars. Mr. Cruz has mentioned elsewhere that he was not happy with the collaboration and \\"help\\" he got in \\"writing\\" this book. Sometimes, by no means not all of the time, after the time where Mr. Cruz is converted, some parts read like a Hollywood version of Christianity. Some words just don't seem to match the people who supposedly spoke them. Some of the conversions seem at least a little too fast, pat and formulaic. Overall though, I beleve the truth shines through. I really felt a great spiritual blessing in reading this book as if I were witnessing some of the true followers of the apostles in Acts. So moving. If you haven't seen The Cross and The Switchblade, where Eric Estrada plays the role of Mr. Cruz, by all means do so. Thousands have come to Messiah after watching it. It too seems to bring the presence of the Holy Spirit down upon one."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"When I was a middle school teacher in the 80s and 90s (I left teaching for another occupation), I used to read this text to my students the last 10 minutes of class (with my school principal's permission). My students were riveted to Nicky's story and begged each day for more time with the reading. Nicky's message is a powerful and positive one. I believe this story is still very relevant today. Some of the religion, although vital to the story, may need to be toned down for public school classrooms. I would edit the reading during the read-alouds but even doing this, the story remained compelling and transformative. I highly recommend the book and am pleased to see that its appearance has been updated and that Nicky Cruz's message continues to inspire young people today."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"A beautiful reminder that God is still capable of doing the impossible.There are no bounderies to his love and no limits to his power."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"i read this in highschool. Required reading, they say. Oh, it is a requiring read, I'll say. It's based on a true story written by the man it happened to. It's a perfect testimony and an even better moral story to everyone who wonders what gangs are like. He explains everything in detail so that you won't make the same mistakes as he did. It's graphic, but hey, isn't real life that way anyway?"},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"I first read this book when I was in 6th grade, borrowed from my older sister. I learned how bad people and the world, in general, could be. But the main thing I took away from this book is what grace God provides to all people no matter how bad they can be and how God can miraculously change people no matter how bad they are and how much hate they have in their lives. This is my favorite book of all time and I would wish that everyone could read it!"},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"I started reading this book when I was probably 6th grade in 1976. I was shocked to quickly find out how cruel people could be in this world his and how vicious gang-life could be, which I had not known about until I read this book. I went to church with other people when I was a child, because my parents didn't go yet, so, I have to credit this book with really being a witness to me. This book showed me at a young age how miraculously that God can change someones life! I have suggested this book to many people, it is a true inspiration!"},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"This book is so powerful. The story of David Wilkerson and Nicky Cruz is God breathed and inspiring. A must read!!!"},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"Bought this book for an inmate in state prison. He said he loved it. The story of Nicky Cruz reminded him of himself and now he has hope that God will still use him. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"Run Baby Run is a remarkable read and inspiring testimony. Nicky Cruz tells his story about how God worked through him and many of New York's gang members. Nicky's account is highly reccomended for all ages. You can sense God's glory throughout the entire work."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"i first read this book back when i was in highschool after having been to an event where he was speaking. i had it signed, but lost the copy somehow. anyway, it really touched me. this man has been an amazing tool for God to bring people back to him who might not otherwise hear about Jesus or listen to those telling them about him. you really need an understanding of the inner workings of these groups or persistance and the patience of job to get them to trust you and what you're saying. amazing man of God with an amazing story."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"I remember reading about Nicky Cruz in David Wilkerson's infamous book, The Cross and The Switchblade. I was in awe by his conversion and wanted to read about his life firsthand. I enjoyed reading his perspective on meeting Pastor Wilkerson for the first time and what he thought about him. I also was inspired by how God radically changed his life. It just goes to show you that with God all things are possible and how we should never give up hope on others."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"Should be required reading for every Christian. Tells the story of a gang member whose life is turned around."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"This true story of Nicky Cruz is the same one that I read 38 years ago this summer.

I would recommend it to anyone young, as I just bought this copy for my 18 year old son."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"I have loved this book since it was read to me by my 8th grade English teacher. I even reread it back then. I recently ordered it to give to my children to read.The misspellings and punctuation errors make it very hard for a first time reader to grasp the full meaning of many parts of the story.I see now that there is a later addition to the book. Hopefully these errors have been corrected.A very powerfull book that needs serious editing."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"I was a young teenager when I first read this book. It has never left my mind. Now, I'm 45 years old and have children and very young grandchildren. I do not know that it will have the same affect on them that it had on me, but, since I home school my two youngest children (6 and 8) I will have them read it in a few years. I feel so much for Nicky Cruz. I always have. I felt sorrow, and pain, and hope. His story has helped me to realize that no matter how bad things seem for me, they could be so much worse. And, it has helped me to love my children more clearly and demonstratively so that they will always know they have a place to be ... they have someone who loves them."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"Was given this book by my 7th grade English teacher in 1978 - I had read it so much during the school year he gave it to me before I went to the eighth grade. The book is wonderful - shows clear picture of the power of Jesus Christ, and how He can change any situation, and anyone! One of the best books I've ever read in my life - can't wait to share it with my kids, as the message is timeless! Still want to meet Nicky Cruz in person!!"},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"This book is a great read!With simple language that helps you get closer to the characters, and the inpiring goals that make you reflect in your own life!Truely one of the few books that could change your life for ever :)"},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"There is something more powerful that what mortal man can comprehend in the story of Nicky Cruz: the Holy Spirit.

I have just recently finshed reading it (I only wished I had read it earlier)and wanted to know more so next best thing was to read David Wilkerson's book's (the little skinny preacher) that did wonders for Nicky. It is just incredible how the Holy Spirit works wonders through someone else.

Great for late teen boys."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"great true story. had it read to me when i was younger. interesting story. true life stories are my favorites."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"This is an excellent book. It was worth every cent. I would certainly highly recommend it. May God bless all who read it."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"There was a lot of opportunity by the authors of this book- Nicky Cruz and his partner- to reach out and touch some of the thousands of troubled gang members in this country. Indeed, the chance was there for Cruz to show these lost kids what God's love is truly all about and how they can find salvation through acceptance. But instead, Cruz- apparently under the influence of Pentecostal Brainwashing- goes in a tirade of nonsense such as speaking in tongues (purely theater) and a host of holier than thou condemnation tactics- and in the process loses many kids that would have otherwise been found. I don't fault Cruz for his ministries, he is trying in his own way- but if he would leave the snake handling alone, he would reach a lot more lost souls."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"This is the kind of book we need to give to our teenagers today. They can relate in the realest way possible. The pressures of peers, drugs, sex, the macho attitude, and lonliness. It tells of a boy and many others who just want someone to love them. It tells of how God uses other people to help these teenagers see that they are truly NOT alone. God loves them, no matter what crimes they've committed, or what kind of darkness is in their heads and hearts. Nicky Cruz shares his life with us in the most open way. He helps you see how his life was transformed from one of gang life to a wonderful life with a wife, children, and a mission to help other who were just like him. I highly recommend it. Even if you don't believe in God or His awesome power, you will still be able to relate to Nicky. I guarantee you'll be rooting for him and will feel joy in his life-changing moments. He is truly a man touched by God."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"This book starts with somebody yelling, \\"Stop that crazy kid!\\" I think right then and there was when my fears were ceased. I've really wanted to read \\"Run Baby Run\\" for quite sometime. Yet you run into somebody else's life story, and it isn't as interesting as you thought it might be. So, I did take a chance, and I'm glad I did. If you are looking for the power of Christ, you've come to the right place. If you are looking for the possible description of a street fight, you've come to the right place. If you want a little bit of romance added to the picture, (YEP) you've come to the right place! And the story is all true, that's the amazing thing. Mario Puzo didn't pen this out and send it out to his publisher. Nicky Cruz LIVED it, and he's here to tell his story. Some might be wondering if it's the same old \\"blood, sweat and tears\\" story. Hmm... maybe the words blood, sweat, tears, puke, convulsions, profanity, narcotics, spiritual warfare and MORE might fit the bill. Don't let that scare you away though.If you've ever heard Nicky Cruz speak, he isn't always the easiest to understand, yet his language of love through Christ is universal. He's ticked off at Satan, people! I believe he has every right to be. He tells an amazing story of coming from Puerto Rico to the States (New York) and almost immediately getting involved in gang activity. He talks of the Mau Maus, and how he became the president eventually. He speaks of his best buddy, Israel. He talks about friends killed in gang warfare. He goes into detail about the rumbles. But that's just the beginning. He also talks of a man named David Wilkerson. He talks of Pastor Wilkerson with much awe and reverence. And from there he talks of a great relationship with Jesus Christ. He goes into detail about Bible college, he tells of his struggles. He tells of his ministry. Now some of you reading my review might be asking, \\"Uh, Wolfe... did you just TELL us the whole story?\\" I don't think so. You'll have to get the book for that. The time invested in well worth it.There is power in the testimony of Nicky Cruz, yet there is more power in the one who saved him, Jesus Christ. Embrace the message of this book! If you are one who is still running, run to a Heavenly Father who is waiting. Then you'll run an awesome race! So don't let the title intimidate you. Pick it up, and don't run from what Nicky Cruz has to say."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"I read this book when I was a teenager (I'm almost fify now). Since I haven't reread it, I can't remember many of the details of the book. However, I do remember this book greatly impacted me in three ways. One, it showed why young people join a gang. Two, it showed how brutal gang life is. Three, it showed how Jesus can transform anyone, even a hardened gang member, if he or she will only ask Him to come into their heart. I believe everyone will benefit from reading Nicky's story."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"I read \\"Run Baby Run\\" when I was in my mid-teens, and the book had an incredible impact on me. Nicky's story of redemption from a life of sin and crime in the inner city of New York, and the story of the man who God used to bring Nicky to Christ, shows how the power of God is able to change any heart. It also gives the reader a glimpse into the life a young person lives in the inner city, surrounded by gangs, drugs, prostitution and poverty. The book is well written and impossible to put down! I came away with a new awe for the awesomeness of God and with a desire to reach out to those who are hurting, hopeless and in need of a Savior. I still read this book periodically to remind myself that there is a world that needs to hear the gospel and that nothing is impossible with God!"},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"Nicky Cruz is a personal friend of mine, and I can assure you, he's the real deal -- open, honest, caring, a great husband, father, and grandfather. Ever since his dramatic conversion related in this book, he's been a changed man with a deep social conscious and a heart for inner cities and their residents. This book is a must read -- it never goes out of date. In fact, it is perhaps even more pertinent in today's culture than ever before."},{"Title":"Run Baby Run","review":"This is an inspiring and heart-breaking story.I am 50 yrs. now, and I read this novel when i was in my early 20s.I bought this book from a Christian Union Mission book store inRoseau, Dominica.

I would encourage all parents to purchase this book, with The Cross & the Switchblade by DavidWilkerson for their teenagers. There is also another hit \\"Coming Clean\\" that I am about to read for the first time. I have just ordered these books so I can read them again. NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE WITH CHRIST.

On the first page I was hooked, and I couldn't put it down. This book combines heart-pounding suspense with the revelation of God's love for ALL of his children.

It took about 30 years for Bach biography to catch up and digest the implications of the new discoveries. Bach biographies published before 1960 are frequently inaccurate in many details, and this include Spitta's famous 3 volume study. Of the recent books on Bach, Professor Boyd's book is one of the very best and the place for anyone with an interest in Bach to start their exploration of his life and work."},{"Title":"Bach (Master Musicians Series)","review":"This book provides an analyical and important summary of the greatest of all 18th century composers. Boyd succeeds in providing the life of Bach in context with the musical conditions of 18th century Germany, but adds his own perspective as seen from the end of the 20th century. I found this book most enjoyable, along the likes of other biographies of Bach, including Spitta and Schweitzer.

Bach, however it is nowhere as well written or informative as Christoph Wolff's biography. I found myself falling to sleep reading Boyd, but the Wolff kept me interested all the way. Wolff also presents the death of Bach's parents as a much more central experience, which I found Boyd tended to place less significance on. This is not a poor book, it is just that the Wolff bio is so much better."},{"Title":"Bach (Master Musicians Series)","review":"Malcolm Boyd's Bach is nearly a classic at this point. It's a fair read, but frankly it leaves me a little flat. It's okay, but truth be told, Karl Geiringer's Bach is far, far better."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I was really looking forward to the continuation of Ayla's story, but this was more like a broken record repeat of it. This is the most repetitive book I've ever encountered. It made me wonder if the author was to be paid by the word! Really, it was sad - and annoying - how much of the book was wasted on retelling the previous 4 books. Then there were the constant repetitions of Ayla's \\"formal greetings\\" and the overly detailed and rather crudely written sex scenes that had me thinking it might be more fun to go sandpaper my brain. The story didn't progress much for all the hours it took to listen to it. I don't recommend it unless you just want to hear a voice going on and on and on about nothing much at all."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I'm going to make this short and sweet. What a disappointment. I also waited with much anticipation for this book and was so upset I almost but a match to it. The ending left me wanting to throw it out the window. I loved all the previous books but like other reviewers I found myself skipping page after page searching for some \\"action\\". I'm hoping the next one will be better. Usually I buy the hard copy. I may wait and get it from the library."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I agree with the first 3 reviews that I read. Not a great work but it kept me going as it had been years since the last book and I was curious. Aceys comments left me laughing. Especially about Wolf taking a dump in the cave and about Ayla showing some emotion other than frowning or smiling. Have you noticed that some authors fixate on a word ad naseum? With Auel it was smile. Virtually a smile per page. Sometimes 3 smiles per page. Maybe it was a Cro-magnon thing. James Clavell had a novel where everyone blanched. Constantly. Another author had his characters mumble. Constantly and inappropriately. I was tired of the smiling, her accent, her remarkable beauty, her inventive mind etc. With over 800 pages and repetitions of the wolf story, the horse story, the cave lion story I was relieved to finish. What I did like what the spiritual aspect of the book. They gave me some reflective moments and a feeling of connection to people 35,000 years now past. That's why it's a 3 star not two."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I loved all four of the first books in this series and couldn't wait for this one. However, it is very much a repeat of everything that happened in the preceding four books in the series about the cro-Magnon woman--Ayla continually dazzles Jondalar's family with her ability to start fires with flint, domesticate wild animals, hunt better than the men in the tribe, etc. in the hopes that her amazing abilities will help them accept her as one of them. With nothing new to add to the series, this one was not worth the time it took to finish reading."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have read every book in the series, and despite the fact I was not thrilled with the 4th book, I was excited to see the 5th one had come out. Unfortunately, as far as the series go, I feel the first one was wonderful, the second ok, the third excellent, and the fourth and fifth nothing to write home about. Auel needs to get herself a good editor to tighten up her work. There is a good novel in here somewhere, she just needs some help to find it. She also needs to remember that what made the first book so special is that Ayla was human. She's become such a superwoman I sometimes just find myself shaking my head.I'll read the 6th one when it comes out, it is as if I can't help myself. But here's to hoping Auel recovers the magic she seems to have lost."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"If \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" was as mediocre as this book, its likely that the series would have ended right there. \\"Clan\\" was an excellent book -- and the others in the series were also very good -- but this book is very lacking in drama and repetitious to the point of boredom. The detailed research, which was skillfully woven into the story in earlier books and gave life and dimension to the characters and events, appeared in this book as lengthy descriptions which interrupted the story. As an Auel fan, I've eagerly read all of the previous books in this series, and was hoping that the negative reviews on \\"Shelters\\" were exaggerated. Sad to say, they're not. The only positive thing about this book is that Auel fans will have a chance to re-enter Ayla's world again after a long wait. I'm hoping that the next book will be better..."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"What a disappointment! Be prepared to skip not just pages but whole chapters! In fact, do yourself a favor and skip the whole thing!! This entire book can be read in minutes, I brought it on a plane trip and was so cheesed off that I wasted the valuable space in my carry on. I mean, nothing ever happens in this entire book--its boring--all character development has been arrested--why does the reader have to be subjected to every inane, sophmoric thought that goes through these characters minds? Why was this book even printed? Did Jean Auel get tired of her characters? Geez-o-man, I hope these reviews save at least one person from being bored beyond belief. Whatever happens, Don't buy this book!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I don't know what happened, but his book was a sore disappointment. I waited excitedly for this book to come out. When I was done all I could say was that I would not recommend it to others. The story was weak. She described everything to death and forgot to tell a good story."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I personally don't see what's so different about this book from The Mammoth Hunters or The Plains of Passage. When all is said and done, there will only be three important books in this series: The Clan of the Cave Bear (the best, by far, where we are witness to Ayla's unbelievable upbringing), The Valley of Horses (where we see how Ayla copes with being expelled from the only family she's ever known, and learns how to become self sufficient in an ancient world cruel to loners - not to mention her first meeting of another person of the Others), and the final book where, hopefully, Auel will tie Ayla back to Brun's Clan somehow.The only very dramatic moments in this so-far five book series came from interactions with the Clan in the first book, and I hope and pray Auel brings it full circle by the end in the sixth book. Everything else is essentially filler. If you love Ayla - and if you've read all five of these books you must - then it's fun to follow her through her adventures across Europe. But make no mistake: nothing very dramatic happens in this entire series after the first book, including book five. Nothing that's going to keep you reading hours after bedtime because you can't bear to put it down. I have high hopes for book six. If it takes her 12 years to write it I'll be most upset."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Having been a faithful reader of the first 4 books, Shelters of Stone was eagerly anticipated for 11+ years. What a let-down! It is if someone else wrote this book. The repetition of descriptions of places or encounters that the characters have is annoying, to say the least. Jean Auel never wrote like this in the first 4 books. Ayla can rethink a thought or conversation for two or three pages. It is if the \\"author\\" is trying way too hard to educate the reader or make the situations in the book more true through repetition. Or the publisher, like a teacher, said this had to be so many pages long and the writer went back and repeated and rehashed each scene in the book. One of the most irritating books I've read in a long time. If you liked the first 4 books of the Earth Children series I would NOT recommend this book. It is a great disappointment."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This fifth book in a seris of six was slow to start and got so bogged down in details about life during the Stone Age that I was forced to skip over pages just to keep interested. If Jean Auel wanted us to know how much she researched this book, she should publish a book based solely on her research. It was intriguing to hear her description of the Cave of Lascaux; however, I felt myself grow bored, especially with Ayla's seeming perfection. Even the description of the Matrimonial Ceremony was too long. Her first three books were far better and were more action packed. In addition, she kept repeating over and over again how Ayla tamed the animals, ect. I am hoping that the sixth book will be like the first three and that the author is finished with her need to describe in minute detail the flora, fauna, geography, and cultural characteristics of Jondalar's Zelandoni world. The ending left a little too much hanging as well. After waiting nearly 12 years, I am disappointed with the result."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Sorry Jean, but like many other Ayla fans, I have absolutely longed for this book, and now I wish I had waited for the paperback.When \\"Plains of Passage\\" ended, Ayla & Jondalar have journeyed through an array of fascinating adventures, and have at last arrived at Jondalar's home cave, pregnant, ready to be mated. \\"Shelters...\\" tells the story of their next 8 months, a tale that would have taken a couple of chapters in any of the preceding books, in an agonizing 749 pages...I skimmed and skimmed looking for a spark of Ms. Auel's altogether absent inventiveness and storytelling skill. No pathos, no finely drawn protagonist, no interesting new adversary. If she had wanted to add another few pages, perhaps Ms. Auel could have quoted her Song of the Mother ONE MORE TIME? I'm disappointed that JA would cheat her fans....I gladly paid for the book, but the story I expected was missing."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Most other reviewers have mentioned the repetitive nature of the novel, so I won't cover that. Suffice to say that I have given up looking for plot or characterization (or even references to the Cave Lion) in the \\"Earth's Children\\" series, and am now only skimming it for the unwitting humor. Jondalar's ex-girlfriend is jealous because she doesn't have a hunk or a baby like Ayla. :( So she dresses Ayla up in a boy's winter underwear. Hee hee! But Ayla decides to wear it anyway, to shame the jealous ex, and another woman thinks, \\"I wouldn't want Ayla mad at me!\\" Word, sister, neither would I. Ayla is (shiver) so scary when she's angry! And then there were the names. One male character is called Bologan. I wondered if his wife was Pastrama. The height of insult is to tell a woman she's fat; just like in a modern society, everyone gasps when they hear that. It's a hoot from beginning to end, which is when Jonayla (I suppose a baby boy would have been named Ayladar) makes an appearance. What will Marona do for an encore, Jean - tip a bucket of red dye over Ayla's beautiful new dress? And will Wolf have a cute baby just like Ayla and Whinney did? Oh well, I guess I can wait for the next \\"Harlequin Prehistorical\\". Especially if it's this amusing."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I cannot believe, after 12 years of \\"research\\", this is the best Ms. Auel can come up with. The tediousness of the cave life (yes, yes, you wake up and pass your water, but do I need to read about it several times throughout the book?), the ad nauseum introductions, the one-dimensional characters...I was beyond frustrated! I think ice age cave life was well covered in her previous books and was looking forward to seeing the story advance and bring closure to many of the visions and dreams Ayla has had throughout the previous books. Even now, Ms. Auel has let 5 years elapse since this was released and I can't help but wonder if we will ever see the dramatic conclusion alluded to in previous books. She doesn't need more research, she needs to finish!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Finally, I finished the book. This book is too long, with too little content. You feel you are reading the same paragraphs over and over until you have it memorized verbatim. There isn't an engaging story. Basically it's about Ayla getting introduced to Jondalar's people and travelling to the Summer Camp (similar to the story in The Mammoth Hunters) and having her baby. I was waiting for something interesting to happen in the book, but it never materialized."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Was disappointed in the book. Too much repetition. Wasn't it Hemingway who advised not to use a paragraph when a sentence would do? And, to use short sentences. Had Ms Auel followed his advice the book would have been half as long and, maybe, a much better read. I found her last four books better than this one. Hopefully the next(last?) one will be better."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I noticed a lot of reviewers complained about the repetition, and that was defended as \\"filling us in on the first four novels of the series\\". That doesn't hold water, since there was SO MUCH repetition within this book. The justification just doesn't make sense since so much was repeated in this book. That is hard to accept since we see so much of the same things said over and over again within this same, 5th novel. And on it goes, but often with the exact same words instead of different ways of saying the same thing.Hence, it was a tiresome read, but at least I finished it. I know my husband couldn't even manage to do that.Ayla and Jondalar continue to have *amazing* sex, which we get to read about. They have their baby, and Ayla continues to insist that the man is responsible for \\"starting\\" the baby. Too bad- it would have been nice to maintain the Goddess as the important Creator. :-)Wolf was a nice critter to have around, and I did worry when he was injured and was relieved when he recovered. I'd like to have seen more of the people domesticate their animals, including horses or at least consider it. The Awe with which the derned things were constantly greeted by newcomers got pretty tiresome.Ah well. I knew what it was when I bought it so I guess I shouldn't try to hold it to too high of a standard. :-)"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have every book in the Earth's Children series & looked forward to reading book 5. Unfortunately, I'm not even half way thru the book and feel like putting it aside. It's repetitious in ways that are beyond boring such as the greetings done with Ayla. We get the idea after the first greeting. It seems as though the author wasn't quite sure what to put in this book but felt it was necessary to put a book 5 out there because her readers were eager for it. Next time, wait until there is something to write. The readers will wait eagerly! But this makes me wonder if the next book is also going to be boring."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Why didn't Ayla react to the revelation that Jondalar's Elan(clan?) is the tail of an ermine and that he has always liked the white tails with the little black tips? It just happens to be the very same thing that she used to decorate the white tunic she made for him. Remember when she was floored that she was going to be adopted into the Lion Hearth of the Lion Camp? Also that Jondalar has also been choosen by the Cave Lion, and has scars like her too?Speaking of the Cave Lion, Ayla appears to have forgotten him in this book, she hardly ever \\"prays\\" to it anymore.And why does Jondalar now get very upset around a dead body?He wasen't so neverous around Rydag or the two Sungaea children or Jetamio or Attaroa.Mabey Jean was so busy re-re-re-writing the Mother's Song that she didn't notice there few laps of the plot."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"After reading the first 700 pages, I gave up any hopes of encountering a plot. Simply nothing of consequence happens in this book. Ayla encountered a few people who grumbled about her association with the clan, but these were easily dismissed by the rest of the people of her cave. If anything, Ayla was too easily accepted, leaving her no challenges to overcome. Even the detailing of stone-age life, which was a favourite aspect of the previous books, was lacking here. So, for most of the book, we just get passages from a terrible poem interspersed with Jondalar's proclamations of love."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I eagerly read the first four books of the Earth's Children series after my mother was done with them and even lent out Clan of the Cave Bear to my grandfather who is interested in prehistoric people. When he asked about further books in the series, we had to explain that they were about Ayla and not about prehistoric people.After 12 years, I was thrilled to hear that the fifth book was out, hoping that there would be an interesting plot when Ayla met the flathead-hating Zelandonii and some ghosts from Jondalar's past.Well, for the most part Jondalar's immediate family accepts the whole \\"flatheads-are-human-too\\" only minutes after hearing of Thonolan's death (which was quickly glossed over by some crying and then was all right as soon as Ayla demonstrated her \\"firestone\\") and most Zelandonii are at least open to the idea of flatheads = humans. There are a few dissenters, but the \\"meetings\\" that the people would have over flatheads seemed a little bureaucratic for a hunter-gatherer society.Marona's trick on Ayla seemed awfully contrived and I wonder if Auel asked a ten-year-old for advice on that setup. Like other reviewers, I also didn't like the concept of \\"trailer-trash\\" in a prehistoric setting. Brukeval and Zelandoni were fairly well-developed as characters and I sincerely hope that there will be more conflict with the former in the next novel (ie. Wolf kills Brukeval defending Ayla and the tribe calls for her banishment and Jondalar has to choose, etc...) but I doubt that will happen. As for Zelandoni and her obesity, most non-industrialized societies respect a woman with meat on her bones and so I was rather confused as to why \\"fat\\" was a pejorative term in this novel. Also, why is Ayla the only person across a continent and half who can fish with her bare hands when there's a dozen old timers around here who can smack walleye out of the river?And of course, Ayla has her baby with the cutsey name of Jonayla. Iza, Uba, Nezzie, Durc-ina ANYTHING other than a combination of their two names! Jonayla has a very small part in the novel other than being nursed a few times. Granted, she's a baby, but there was so much leading up to her birth. Don't get me started on Whinney's filly Gray (Cloud? Smoke? Mist?)Please, Mrs. Auel, give Ayla a fault or have her make a life-threatening mistake or at least tension-building (argue w/ Marthona over parenting or dinner, just don't feel like having sex with Jondalar, become allergic to wolves, something!) There was so much potential in this novel that you did not take advantage of!Actually, there are two things that bother me more than anything and they aren't in this novel, it's what they portend for the sixth. Willamar (wasn't he Willomar in 2-4?) promises to take Ayla to the Great Waters to see dolphins--meaning she'll be able to \\"talk\\" to them and go swimming with them and proclaimed a goddess by the locals. The other is that there is some evidence now that some prehistoric people from France managed to find their way to N. America by hunting seals along the ice cap. I am terrified that Auel has heard about this and now Ayla will be the first person and goddess of the Americas as well.Ayla's already taken Eurasia by storm ... now there's a possibility that she may come here as well ..."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The \\"Earth's Children\\" (tm) series has been a guilty pleasure with me since its inception, so I was glad to see that Jean M. Auel was going to continue it after so long a hiatus. Unfortunately the latest volume is a disappointment -- hardly worth waiting 12 years for. The one good thing I can say about it is that Ms. Auel had done her research, but as far as story goes, there isn't one. The first 500 pages read like a travelogue, with extended descriptions of the geography and other aspects of the setting. The only action is umpteen scenes of Ayla demonstrating her firestones, or Jondalar demonstrating his spear thrower, or one or the other of them relating the adventures from previous books. I was thankful for a little of this as I had not read the former volumes for a couple of years, but it went on far too long. Most of the new characters were charming and bland; the antagonists were mean and bland and incredibly under-used. There is little sense of conflict and none whatever of a cohesive plot. Things get a little more interesting in the last third of the novel -- at least I didn't find myself blipping over large portions of it in a vain search for something interesting, as I did for the first two thirds -- but events still seemed random and pointless. _Shelters of Stone_ may be accurate in its depiction of a year in the life of Cro Magnon woman, but it doesn't offer anything that makes an absorbing story. It rather seemed like a chunk of material that had to be gotten out of the way before the next installment. Why that chunk had to go on and on for over 700 pages is unclear to me. If you haven't read this one yet, don't waste your time; there's nothing necessary here to the next book. If you feel you must read it, get it out of the library."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"After waiting so long for the next book, this was rather disappointing. The slide into tedium actually started in Valley of the Horses but at least that had two story lines going for a while and an interesting romance. The Mammoth Hunters was more interesting with Ayla finding her first group of Others (although the many and extreme \\"misunderstandings\\" between Ayla and Jondalar were rather unrealistic). But reading Plains of Passage at times felt like reading a \\"how to live in the Ice Age\\" textbook, the only thing I could hope was that the next book would have less research and a better plot. Unfortunately, Ms. Auel is so enamored with her own research (which she obviously spent lots and lots of time on) she wants to put every bit of it on paper. I'm not quite through with the book yet since it has become more laborious than enjoyable, however, I must ask, is this book trying to impress its readers or the many archaeologists and PhDs that Ms. Auel has become so friendly with during her years and years of research?Even without the overbearing manifestation of all that research, the story is extremely slow. How many times do we need to see Ayla introduce Wolf?? Or hear about how extremely beautiful Ayla is. Get to the point already.Another thing, the storyline does not hang together in regard to the Others considering flatheads as animals. How could these obviously intelligent Others particularly the Zelandonii really think of the Clan as animals and yet have at least two of \\"mixed spirits\\" in their midst and not think much of it. How would you react to, say, a half human half chimpanzee in your neighborhood?? There are a number of examples of contradiction in regard to this outlook in the story.Most importantly, where are the Neanderthals??? That was the hook. That was what was so extremely interesting about Clan of the Cave Bears (which is still one of my all-time favorite stories). These Zelandonii are very advanced for 35,000 years ago, living not all that much different than the way the American Indians, Native Hawaiians or Australian Aborigines lived just 250 years ago. The Neanderthals, now that was different and very interesting."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"It is with a heavy heart that I declare my disappointment with this book. There was so much promise, and instead it is mostly boring, befuddled and bare of plot.It is apparent that Jean M. Auel's interest in the research behind the book overcame any desire to tell a decent story. The majority of the book merely exists to take us on a tour around the Dordogne region, and to look at the major artefacts found. Jondalar and Ayla are simply there as \\"guides\\". This is why we don't even get to the important aspects of the story - the matrimonial and birth - until the last quarter, and even then it seems rushed. I think it's fair to say that most readers really only care about \\"what happens next\\", and there's precious little of that to be had.And it's been mentioned in other reviews - the book is horrendously edited, with too much repetition and unnecessary characters. It also frustrates with the number of suggested plot lines that simply fade away with no follow up. There's a great small novel lurking amongst these 750 + pages, but unfortunately it is smothered in banality.It's a vast opportunity wasted. So many things could have happened. I waited 12 years, and I'm just so sad that this is the result. I only hope the 6th book is better."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I was very disappointed in this last installment. 2/3 of the book seemed to span a total of 2 months and then in the last 2 chapters we rushed through 6 months of time. The character development was very poor and the humanity of the characters was missing. I would have rather spent my time re-reading Clan of the Cave Bear. It would have been a better story."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"First the good news: Auel has always had her strengths as a writer, and these include an *excellent* ear for dialogue, better-than-average characterization skills, deep research, and an ability to take customs and technology that seem exotic and outlandish to modern-day eyes and make them seem familiar. (This probably is related to her aforementioned good skills with characterization--nothing can make the unfamiliar seem familiar faster than seeing ordinary and believable people interacting with it.)Second, the bad news: Auel's drawbacks as a writer are present here as well. Drawbacks include pacing, bad story structure, and clumsiness at integrating her voluminous research with her narrative. She tends to work her research in by doing \\"info dumps,\\" long paragraphs or pages where she explains every little bit about the natural location and technology level of her people, and these are often long, boring and tedious. She also is not good at understanding what needs to be told, what can be shown, and what should be omitted. What feels like the entire first half of the book is taken up with introducing and re-introducing Ayla to everyone in Jondalar's cave, and often these introductions are spelled out in mind-numbing detail. We needed to see this scene perhaps *once;* future instances could have been rapidly skipped over with \\"Ayla and Jondalar made the necessary introductions.\\" Something similar obtained with showing everyone's reactions to Whinney, Racer and Wolf. Again, one scene of surprise was enough; the rest should have been quickly glossed over.Ayla's \\"Mary Sue\\"-ness is also becoming more and more evident as the book series continues. Over and over (see previous point about repetition) we're told how beautiful Ayla is, how she is the only person who has the knowledge to solve various problems, how she's the most innovative of the group, etc. About the only thing she *can't* do is sing, and I quote from the original \\"Mary Sue Litmus Test\\": \\"Being unable to sing is not a flaw.\\" After a while, it gets boring and annoying both.But I think the central problem (and this goes back to the repetition thing) is that we've been basically seeing the same scenes for four books now. Ayla comes to a modern human encampment. Wow, gasp, she rides horses and can heal! But oh wait--she has Clan background! By this time, Auel needs to move on and find some new ground to cover with her character, and Ayla's final acceptance of her (Mary Sueish) calling to the ranks of Those Who Serve is a baby-step in the right direction, although more could have been done with this instead of the endless introduction scenes.One of the reasons Clan of the Cave Bear was so good was that it dealt with Ayla in a fundamentally different culture than that of anatomically modern humans, so that we had her as a set of eyes through which to view the culture of Neanderthals. While not all of the research Auel drew on to craft her Clan has stood the test of time, and while some of the stuff she invented was rather unrealistic, at least it was interesting. Her modern human cultures are all so similar to each other that it's difficult to tell them apart; they all share a reverence for the Great Earth Mother, do not know the concept of paternity, and have a relaxed attitude toward sex. So in a way, it feels like I've been reading the same book for the last four of her books. I didn't actually buy this book, and I think I will wait and pick up Earths Children 6 from the library. I'd recommend anyone else reading this series to do the same."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"If you want to explain to someone what a Mary Sue is, hand them this book. Ayla is a genius. She invents needles, the travois, and various healing techniques. She tames cave lions, wolves, and horses. She is a doctor, an animal trainer, and a priestess. The tribe's high priestess thinks that she should become the most powerful spiritual leader of the tribe. Men everywhere think she's beautiful. Everyone likes her. The only person who doesn't like her is jealous because she is so beautiful, and that character later makes friends with Ayla after Ayla demonstrates how wonderful she is. Every single character in the book coos and sighs on how gorgeous, intelligent, and kind she is. At the start of the series Ayla was an interesting and somewhat well-developed character, but as the books keep coming she has become progressively more annoying. At this point it's getting ridiculous. I have read hundreds of books in my lifetime, and in all my years of reading I don't think I have ever seen a more annoying main character. At this point she has become so nauseating that I had trouble actually reading the story.This book deals with Jondalar's return to his tribal homeland, and the way that he and Ayla settle in to what will become their home. It deals chiefly with the tribe's reaction to Ayla and the way that Ayla reacts in turn. Several skeletons in Jondalar's closet come to the surface, which I won't spoil for those who haven't read the book.The reason I didn't give this book one star is that Ms. Auel, to her credit, knows her stuff. She did an amazing amount of research for this book and it's certainly informative if nothing else. She also has very interesting ideas on the culture, mores, and religious beliefs of Cro-Magnon people. Unfortunately she integrates this information without grace, and large chunks of the book are devoted either to random summaries of local flora and fauna or recaps of previous books. Sadly, the weakness of her characterization and her clunky dialogue overshadow her research and ideas. While this book didn't have the sheer number of hardcore sex scenes that the previous two did, the ones that are present still seem like they could be taken straight from the pages of a Danielle Steel novel. All in all it reads like the bastard child of a history textbook and a harlequin romance.This doesn't mean that I hate Ms. Auel. Ms. Auel's Clan of the Cave Bear is a truly innovative and mesmerizing work. It was a joy to read, and I give her the highest marks for her work. The second book, the Valley of Horses, is also good, and Ayla is not half so annoying without a posse to fawn all over her. The third book, The Mammoth Hunters, signals the start of a rapid decline in the series....on the plus side, her euphemisms for various sex organs are hilarious."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"OK, I TOO had been waiting 12 years, so I'm also a bit let down, but calling it \\"boring drivel\\" might be a bit harsh. Yes it is repetitive, and the poem is slightly obnoxious, but this is still worth reading if you've read the rest of the series. Valley of Horses is still my favorite, and Clan Of the Cave Bear will be what Ms. Auel is remembered for... but if you just gotta know what happened to Ayla and Jondalar, you won't be that sorry. If there's one thing I would have added, it would have been more conflict... this book doesn't bring tears to your eyes nearly like the others have...but if you've got enough stress in your life already, you won't mind. It probably is a good idea to wait for the paperback though. My husband and I have discussions about what really happened to the Neanderthals, him being an anthropologist and all, and he agrees with Ms Auel that the Cro-Magnons did interbreed with the Neanderthals, so that makes it feel real to me. I liked the book well enough, can't wait for the last one."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"As a Jean Auel fan, I was very disappointed by this latest book in her Earth's Children series, and I am frankly at a loss at how the same person who wrote the absorbing _Clan of the Cave Bear_ and _Valley of the Horses_ could also write this, and require twelve years to do so! Despite the lengthy hiatus between stories in this series, the writing in _Shelters_ actually seemed to be rushed, affecting important elements of the story.The Good:As in Auel's other novels, _The Shelters of Stone_ is clearly well-researched, and she makes a strong effort to describe the scenery as well as the animals and artifacts native to the time period. Despite the flaws, it was fun to return to Ayla's world after 12 years. I was generally entertained by the book despite its 700+ page length.The Bad:Repetition: The worst among this book's flaws is the repetition, both of story elements from previous books (e.g. explanations of Whinney's origins) and from within the current book (e.g. each new character noting Ayla's accent). I understand that there has to be a certain amount of repetition in order to help new readers to the series, but I have read a number of novel series that did not use this degree of repetition.Narration: The 3rd person narrator switched frequently between characters, often in consecutive sentences, interrupting the flow and preventing character development. Although I am not against switching narrators throughout a novel, the constant change of point of view was poorly executed, and it often hindered the story-telling by giving away too much information about how other people were reacting (and often led to more repetition). Frankly, it came across as amateurish, which is surprising to me for somebody whose novels I have previously enjoyed.Pacing: The pacing was terrible, with the last third or quarter of the book zooming through about half of a year, barely touching on important events that occurred whereas the first two thirds of the book covered a very short period of time in excruciating detail. I would expect a greater focus on the couple's first couple of weeks after returning to the Zelandonii territories, but 400+ pages is ridiculous!Plot development: The plot meandered throughout the book, starting down many little (and often interesting) roads only to abandon them later in pursuit of the amorphous and somewhat under-whelming major plot concerning Ayla's desire to mate Jondalar. There were too many potential plot points but remarkably little plot development. In addition, some aspects of the plot seemed contradictory or flawed, as if the implications for twisting the story that way had not been considered. Finally, there didn't seem to be any real ending; the novel seemed to sputter out. Rather than leave me with suspense for the next novel, it left me annoyed.Character development: Auel's characters tend to be somewhat two-dimensional, with good characters showing few flaws and \\"bad\\" characters drawn as spiteful, difficult people. However, in her past novels she tempered this somewhat through character development in which some \\"bad\\", trouble-making bad people grow into better people (e.g. Freebec from _Mammoth Hunters_). In _Shelters_, almost every character was so two-dimensional as to appear like cardboard. The Bad stayed Bad, and the Good were sickeningly Good at times. The rare instances of transformation and growth (of minor characters only) were mentioned as an aside and left to languish as less interesting characters reclaimed center stage.Overall, although there were many problems with this book, some of the same Auel charm is still there. In my opinion, this book could have been much better with one good critical editor/reader to help identify and rectify the novel's many flaws at an earlier stage. Sure, this book will be an instant best seller, but the poor quality of the writing here may deter readers from purchasing the next, especially if it doesn't hit bookstores before 2014."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have read some duds in my day (basically everything Terry Goodkind has ever written) books that made me practically give up all hope that there is a single author/editor/publisher on earth dedicated to anything but mediocrity - but this..this...catalog of repetitive, slogging, meandering, sixth grade writing level piece of mammoth dung is one of the absolutely WORST books I have ever not finished.I couldn't finish it, honestly - I just couldn't - not after five hundred some odd pages of wanting to go directly to FRANCE and spray paint graffiti all over the cave walls that were Ms. Auel's inspiration for this mess.Ayla - who will always be played by the great (NOT) actress Darryl Hannah in my mind is not actually just a Caucasian ancestor but Albert freaking Einstein, Super woman and a mythical god-dess of all that is holy and beautiful. I have never loathed a character so much. She is beautiful, has enormous breasts, is the greatest lay ever but is also the single most brilliant person of the era. Everyone is awed by her. She never makes a single mistake. She invents everything, tames animals, makes tea, heals, performs surgery, educates everyone, hunts like a man, is a perfect warrior and can make a hell of a meal out of SPAM. All while pregnant. Everyone else in the book is pathetically stupid and her boyfriend is a complete himbo - he might as well be in an ad for Calvin Klein underwear. All he does is grin knowingly.There are endless descriptions of the geology and plant-life of the era (like reading an Earth Science book) and this supposed genius research that Ms. Auel accomplished is stuff anyone with half a brain could figure out with no research at all. Plus she basically tells everyone at the beginning of the book that some of it is accurate but MOST is made up - so there! Like it's my book and I'll make pre-history anything I want it to be.Yeah ok. The Earth's Children geniuses have so much more going for them than people did in as recently as the 19th century. So what happened? Everyone was all new-agey and women were equal to men in complete positions of power and then what - 25,000 years later women didn't even have the freaking vote. Ok, sure, makes sense to me.Anyway the rate at which these folks were creating art and items would have had them in computers and Lear jets in record time. So what the hell happened? Everyone got really stupid?The characters are shallow, there is no plot, the book is filled with repetitive introductions, snippets from the other books and feats of amazing wonder that make Ayla out to be the freaking messiah and all of it is written like a guidebook for writers on HOW NOT TO WRITE.You could lose your sanity stumbling over paragraphs with sentences like:That sounded familiar to Ayla. She wasn't sure why. She decided to make some tea. She dug around in her travel pack for some mint. She liked to bring tea to Jondalar in the morning.As well as conversations like the following that go on for entire CHAPTERS:\\"I know what you are thinking.\\" she teased Jondalar.\\"What I am thinking is that with this new spear-thrower that I invented, only after you inspired me, we will be able to hunt much more efficiently and therefore be in less danger from charging bison.\\" Jondalar grinned.\\"That is right. Charging bison can be very frightening. Remember what the Mog-ur said?\\" Ayla reminded Jondalar.\\"Yes I remember, but tell me again.\\"\\"The Mog-ur said that we should invent a weapon to not be trampled by bison because of his great fear of bison. He was a smart holy man, though I am not sure I know what that word smart or holy actually means,\\" Ayla decided to make some tea while they continued to talk.\\"Then we shall have to invent words for holy and smart Ayla, words like kamakakapoopoo and blerdge.\\"\\"I don't like those words Jondalar,\\" though she winked at him knowingly, \\"Let's just use smart and holy instead, you himbo.\\"If anyone actually does read this kind of drivel and enjoy it please email me so I can say that I have at least been emailed by the most boring person alive.The fact that this woman has sold millions of books is a sad commentary on how uneducated most people are. I had never read any of the middle books after Clan of the Cave Bear (which I thought was at least mildly entertaining) and I picked this one up because I wanted a good thick beach read.Apparently the woman (Ms. Auel) is utterly senile (thus the repetitions) and can't even remember why she wrote this in the first place. Of course her agent and publisher I am sure gently reminded her - FOR THE FREAKING MONEY.Read this book ONLY if you want to have fantasies of throttling an old senile woman (the author) or if you have no wish to contribute anything useful to the universe on any level."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Okay, I bought it, I read it, and sometimes I loved it. Unfortunately, while it starts out powerful, it then gets into this absolutely huge DRAG of a \\"nothing really happens\\" for SEVERAL HUNDRED pages.I remember reading \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" for the first time; I couldn't put it down, and didn't sleep for two days while I buried myself in Ayla's world and life experiences. \\"Valley of Horses\\" was much the same, and completely frustrating as the author flipped back and forth between characters in true cliffhanger fashion. (I loved it.) \\"Mammoth Hunters\\" was filled with wonderful people who lived, breathed, and had complex relationships with each other (and the idea that Ayla might choose to stay with the Mamuti was completely believable, based on the fact her son was only a mention since the end of Book One). \\"Plains of Passage\\" was kind of a letdown as it concentrated on being a pre-historic travelogue, but still interesting. \\"Shelters of Stone,\\" however, is a disappointment.Ayla is officially perfect. Jondalar is perfect. Everyone is perfect except for a few token bad guys who are never really a threat. There are some stressful moments, but the following things aren't a problem: a) food; b) clothes; c) relationships; d) animal companions; e) careers; f) authority figures; g) sex; and h) (my personal favorite) housecleaning. I should have a life this good! :)Yup, everything is now perfect, and I must confess its kind of boring. I love Ayla and Jondalar because of going through the stresses in their lives with them. Most of what happens in this book could have been summed up in a couple of lines on a Christmas card:&lt;P..."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I've been waiting for the release of this book for almost 10 years. I started the series in high school, and books 1-3 quickly became some of my favorite books. The 4th book started to get repetitive and dragged a lot, and I was hoping that wouldn't be the case with this one. Unfortunately, that is the case. I was hoping for something along the lines of The Mammoth Hunters, but what I got was a stream of forgettable characters that were never very well-developed. Too many characters were introduced, for no good reason. I kept mixing up the two women whose names started with \\"P\\", and the two men whose names started with \\"B\\". And too many different caves to keep track of.It's the same old story...Ayla is perfect. People don't trust or like her at first, she must prove herself by showing them her inventions and skills, then they love her and practically make a goddess out of her. Puhlease!!! I used to like Ayla, I really did, but I've lost interest in her because she is no longer realistic at all. I mean, does she have any faults? The only one I can think of is her inability to sing (which I find completely ridiculous, since she is able to mimic every animal known to man - why can't she mimic a good singing voice too?). Ayla is just TOO perfect. She is no longer human but a mockery, sort of like a child's superhero. She needs to wind up on the losing side sometimes, needs to reveal SOME human foible! The chick is starting to really annoy me. I've actually started rooting for her antagonists. The story would be richer and more intersting if just for once, Ayla didn't become allied with the most powerful people in the tribe, the most skilled, the ones with the highest status. Why can't Wolf really kill someone? (then she'd have to suffer through guilt and be truly ostracized) Why can't she get truly ANGRY once in a while? Like a real person?I was hoping this novel would answer a lot of lingering questions put forth in the first 4 books. I was sadly disappointed. There didn't seem to be much of a plot, other than Ayla meeting new people, the endless recitations of relationships and titles, Ayla showing everyone her inventions, etc. Of course Ayla is going to be challenged, and of course she is going to overcome it fabulously. One thing I was surprised at, was the lack of Jondalar's character in much of the story. His relationship with Ayla seemed to lose its steam.I admit that I used to like Auel's descriptions of Pleistocene Europe, but endless descriptions of this valley, that stream and this rock outcrop got very tedious. I skipped over many paragraphs, and at time many pages, just to get to some action. I think Auel did a disservice to her longtime fans by bogging them down with too much description of the landscape, and too much repetition of Ayla's exploits, of which we are already familiar! (I mean, come on! Hardly anyone is going to pick up this book, 5th in a series, without having read the other books!).I think this series has definitely run out of steam. I must admit that I'm only halfway done with the book, but it's all I can do to finish it, and this is coming from a person who has read and reread the first 3 books at least 4 times each!! It is a CHORE to finish this book. I keep hoping something interesting will happen, some questions about Ayla will be answered, but I am let down. The points in the story that are supposed to be important leave me feeling really ho-hum. Of course I'll finish it, just because I'm such a long-time fan of the series, but I almost wish that Ayla and Jondalar would've settled down with the Sharamudoi and the series ended there. I can't imagine how the last book will be any better than this one. This book put me to sleep. It's sad. It truly seems that Ms. Auel's heart was not in this book."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This has to be one of the worst books I've ever read - and I love the first four books of the series. There is barely a plot - little to no character development and no conflict to drive the story. What's worse is that she repeats herself constantly through the whole book its like reading the epic of gilgamesh. Ayla has sex then washes herself like Iza taught her. Five pages later she does it again and we are again told how Iza taught her to wash herself and that is repeated at least three other times. She spends the rest of the book - rehashing stories from the previous four - again - multiple times. And now that I am re-reading clan of the cave bear - I have found at least two passages that are repeated practically verbatim. When reading this book I felt like her editor was standing over her shoulder saying - hey Jean! It's been 10 years - you've got to finish this story - and so - unwillingly ploped this down onto paper and submitted it. The plains of passage spent much of the time talking about how they were going to mate when they reached Jondalars home and how she was going to be so happy to have a baby and that's pretty much all that happened in this book. The barest inkling of plots that showed up (the conflict between Clan and Others that Ayla will obviously have to mediate)was avoided entirely presumably put off for the next book and that's too bad because this book could have used a story."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have read all the novels in this series and though I thought the previous one was tedious, it was still acceptable. I must part company with this one, though. It commits the unpardonable sin for literature: It bores. Despite several provocative sub-plots and themes (racial prejudice, child-bearing questions, gender equality, religion) not one is developed fully. The book seems written in starts and fits; a promising idea is introduced and expounded, when suddenly we leave the narrative for yet another walk through the countryside with animals or observers as Ayla imparts her womanly wisdom of the ages.The meandering New Age chanting is repetitive at best and infuriating at worst. Considering what we now know about the development of religious ceremony (including chorus)in ancient Greece, it is highly improbable that this level of thought (which sounds suspiciously modern) was reached. For one thing, abstraction in language is a rather recent development. Although primitive man invoked ceremony when burying the dead, it is doubtful that a deep level of theological sophistication was reached.The relationship between the two main characters does not grow nor really change. He is still in awe of Ayla and her powers and she is still panting for his manly, uh, accessories. Mom, dad and all the relatives added little to the story. In fact, the half-breeds, which held the most promise, simply faded away. I suppose the chief complaint is that I was expecting something bold or new or different on the order of Clan of the Cave Bears. Despite intense research and quirky, original ideas on how primitive folks lived, the story reminds me of that saying: Nothing ventured, nothing gained."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Probably the worst book (romance novel) I've ever read. I waited 753 pages for a story to develop but never found one. Ms. Auel wrote that Ayla married Jondolar and met his family. Ayla has \\"mountainous breasts\\" and Jondalor has an \\"over-sized member\\" (Aul's words) but they \\"fit together well\\". Having written that, Ms. Auel tries to re-write these words in as many ways as she can to fill space. Every other page is filled with the same litany of Ayla's many titles as she meets, or re-meets, each character in the book. I never again want to hear about the daughter of the mammoth hearth, chosen by the spirit of the cave lion, protected by the spirit of the cave bear, formerly of the Mamutoi, accepted by the Zelondonii, etc. etc. ad nauseum. Her editors obviously didn't bother to do their jobs or we wouldn't have to hear the physical attributes of every character in the book repeated as though they hadn't been described in detail two chapters earlier. This could have been a decent read like the prior books in the series if the filler was cut down by 90% and if it had led into an actual story of the Clan meeting up with the Zelondonii or any of the other subplots that show potential but are never developed. In the name of Mut, Great Mother of All, also known as Doni, the Great Earth Mother, I suggest you read something else."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This is the 5th book (2002) in the Earth's Children series. After an extensive gap (12 years) between the 4th and 5th installments in the series, Auel offers up a very long, somewhat repetitive book with no real plot. The main characters finally arrive at their destination after the endless but interesting trip related in The Plains of Passage, we meet a boatload of new characters (to whom the same explanatory stories about all of Ayla's \\"oddities\\" must be told over and over, almost word for word, which is where a lot of the repetition comes in), and we get a lot of information about everyday life in this new place and about the structure of this new society. But nothing . . . ever . . . really . . . happens.This book seems to be an extensive stage-setting device, with Ayla's intellect and other powers coming to be recognized over time by Those Who Count in this new society (and, of course, resented by Those Who Don't), positioning her to do Big Things (and, of course, have Big Problems) in the next installment -- if it ever comes. It's almost been 5 years since this one was published, and the next book still isn't out. Without it, all of this stage setting is pretty much for nothing, in my view. If I were making the decision now to read the 750 sometimes repetitive pages of this doorstop, knowing what I know now, I'd wait to make the investment until Auel gets around to publishing the 6th book. Until then, the enjoyment you think you might derive from spending time with Ayla and Co. again won't really balance the fact that the book is repetitive and contains nothing you really need to know for its own sake."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Yawnzzzz. It took me a month to read this book... waiting for something to happen. It never did. Perhaps one should read it when stoned. Perhaps Ayla and company ate too many magic mushrooms and became too lethargic to actually do anything exciting.Like Zillions of other Auel fans, I waited 12 long years with breathless anticipation for this book, having thoroughly enjoyed the previous four. Thank goodness I did not pay the R260 for the hardcover. I eventually borrowed it from the library. Twelve years to write a book? I'm afraid it shows.I fully agree with Reader from Canada (April 2003) and his critique. All the no-nos of writing a good novel. Says it in a nutshell. And like another reader mentioned, it was asif someone else had written the book. I just think Jean Auel got so wrapped up in her own life, and kinda lost interest in Ayla and her clan. It seems it was just re-hashed verbiage dashed off to fill out a book. It really was such a disappointment.What bored me was the continual references, ad nauseum, to the happenings in the other books. Told over and over to whoever asked. Surely Auel must have known that the zillions of fans have read her other books, and any newcomers would then also read the other books to catch up. We didn't have to be told things all over again and again. It was like a tired soap opera. I'm not surprised that even Wolf got bored and ran away a few times.....Boring to have to read all the \\"introductions\\" of each person. That must have filled up the book by about at least. And Ayla's general lack of interest in healing plants etc. I won't even speak about the graphic sex scenes, which seemed to me asif the author thought, \\"oh ok, it's expected, we'll drop a descriptive sex scene in here...\\" To me it didn't add to the book, it jarred in fact. If I want to read about sex, I'll buy a suitable book.And sure, Auel's research is phenomenal. She proved it in her last 4 books, but the research was introduced in such a manner that it all flowed, and was therefore readable and interesting. In this book, every time you were told \\"something new\\", it was like being hit in the face with a wet fish. The research was obvious. Another no-no of good writing. Your research should not \\"show\\", but \\"flow\\" and be part of the story.There was no plot, there was no drama. And there was so much potential!! I kept on waiting for and expecting a confrontation with the \\"flatheads\\". Lots of potential for drama there, if it were more fully explored.Or with the resident breeds. A lot could have happened. How about Ayla going off in a huff, being driven off by unkind words or actions. Jondolar could have gone after her. There could have been drama between the people and the animals. I expected it, but nothing. Such wonderful acceptance! So boring! One almost wishes for another earthquake.....I am just sorry that this book did not come up to expectations. I still think Auel is a brilliant writer, when she puts her mind to it. There is another book in the pipeline? Oh dear, after this one I'm not sure if I want to read it now. What are the chances that it will be better than this one? I will, however, re-read the first 4 books of the \\"Earth's Children\\" series. Brilliant, especially Clan of the Cave Bear. The first 4 in the series are way better than anything else I've read in the same genre. To the readers who actually LIKED this book, well, I suppose, \\"different strokes for different folks.\\" And to Jean Auel I say, \\"You can do it again girl, just cut out all the psychobabble and get back to basics!\\""},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Do not waste your money on this piece of garbage.How many times are we going to see this formula? Ayla meets strangers, who don't trust her. Then they like her. Then they find out about the Clan and don't trust her. Then they love her again. This book is nothing new. The entire thing is a rehash of the previous three (yes it was used in Clan of the Cavebear, so I should say previous four); Auel doesn't even bother trying to come up with new ideas.The most interesting part, the birth of Ayla's child, is taken care of so fast you almost miss it, and her attitude to the child is one of \\"Oh isn't this nice?\\" No where NEAR the fierce love she had for Durc. It was totally unrealistic that a woman who had wanted another child for so long would be so unemotional about finally getting that child.And of course the tribe has their version of Broud, who immediately doesn't like or trust Ayla. It's the same character with a different outfit, and we've seen him lots of times before. And the tribe is all a twitter about the animals. YES WE KNOW ALREADY!!The biggest disapppoint was the total lack of plot development. Except for having her child and tieing the knot with Dalamar, nothing new or exciting happens. (and those things are debatable as exciting anyway).I wish Auel had taken another few years to at least find a plot for this one, because there is none. Nada.

Problem is--anyone who has read Auel's previous books already knew that--that was the plan at the end of the last book! I kept waiting for SOMETHING to happen, but nothing ever did. There were no surprises, very little conflict, no further character development of Ayla and Jondalar, and no character development at all of anybody else. Tons of named, but useless, characters cluttered the novel. It also seemed there were the starts of some interesting plots, all which deadended.Yes, obviously well researched since we had long explanations of minute details of stuff was made, etc. But I think at this point Ms. Auel has made it abundantly clear that she'd rather do research than write good fiction."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"In \\"The Shelters of Stone,\\" Auel continues a disappointing trend that initially surfaced in her second book, \\"The Valley of Horses.\\" Rather than playing to the strengths that we saw in \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear,\\" i.e. an original idea couched in some impressive research, she is now resting her entire series on her weakest points: black-and-white characterization, wooden dialogue (everyone - EVERYONE - uses long, multi-clause, perfect sentences with impressive, SAT-worthy vocabulary), and pages upon pages of exposition about the tundra. I have the impression that Auel's boxed herself into a corner by her previous books, which established the precedent that Ayla is absolutely brilliant, beautiful, and perfect in every way, to say nothing of Vivid Blue Eyes. That being said, I still read the entire blasted thing, although I started skimming and skipping over large chunks about halfway through. It's worth a library checkout if you're an opportunistic glutton for a series that should have ended several books ago.If you are in the mood for some long AND excellent historical fiction, I would recommend reading Gary Jennings' \\"Aztec\\" or \\"Raptor.\\" The characters are massively flawed, the setting is brutal, the pace is incredible, and the research is impeccable."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I've read the other 4 books in the series countless times, and was very excited to finally find out more of what was happening in Ayla/Jondalar's lives. I thought the book was interesting, and didn't see as much repitition as I'd expected from other reviews. This book didn't have as many really \\"high points\\" as some of the others, but was still very enjoyable. It also ended on a much more \\"to be continued\\" note. While I knew the others would be continued, they seemed to be more stories in themselves that could stand alone. This one, despite its length, still left so much hanging at the end. And covered such a short time period compared to the first few books - so much time was spent meeting everyone and learning about all of them that there wasn't much time left for anything to happen. But I loved the book (as I did all the others) and hope book 6 is much quicker in coming!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Purchased at Amazon. As with all the books in this series, I enjoyed reading Mrs Auel's fiction based on extensive research. Her research on archeological digs and connected subjects interjects a realism into these books which I do not see in other kinds of fiction. With that said, this series is a prodigious effort - six books each around 700-800 pages. Naturally some are more interesting to a given person than other volumes. To me specifically, some parts of this book were a bit less interesting than others. That in no way detracts from the scope and grandeur of the project. Are the heros too perfect? Of course, because the author is ascribing thousands of years of progress and invention to a few individuals over a fictional 10-15 year period. To me, the importance is the progress and invention of Cro-Magnons compared to the Neanderthals, thus forming a basis for our life today. Well done Jean Auel!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"From starting to end, I couldn't put it down. Very good composition, did very well with her research. Excellent book. I would highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have loved the Earth Children series and have the 4 previous books in hard cover. For many reasons, I haven't been able to read much over the past several years. My son gave me a Kindle for Christmas, so I downloaded the Kindle version of Shelters of Stone. How disappointing it is to [try] to read this version; there are so many errors that it is distracting. Further, the errors are repeated over and over throughout the text... like anders for antlers. They seem to be scanner OCR errors because you can 'see' how the word was confused. Too bad someone didn't proof read this. If I had known how badly the Kindle text was, I would have paid more for the hard cover and NOT read it on my wonderful Kindle."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This is the culmination of the degeneration of a great idea and a great character (Ayla). I read the entire Earth's Children series last year, one after the other, and I didn't even make it halfway through this last one. It was utterly useless plot and boring self introductions. She should have just ended the series with them making it back to Jondalar's home... what a pity.I also didn't care for the last half of the series (starting with the last part of Valley of the Horses after Ayla met Jondalar) because it became disgustingly obvious that Auel was living out her sex fantasies through Ayla with Jondalar as her ideal man. This happens way too much, and makes me ashamed of women authors who otherwise have great epic historical fiction plots and ideas.Yes, sex a part of people's lives in all times and places, but when it starts to absorb the plot and characters it just isn't fun to read anymore."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Auel has nothing to worry about. If Plains of Passage wasn't bad enough to make me stop buying her books, pretty much nothing will. I'm not going to deny that Shelters of Stone is a badly written book, because it is. A lot of the Ayla Fan Fiction is comparable or better. It is still fun to read the canon, though, and I'll be buying the next book whenever it comes out."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Very disappointed with the content and wrap-up. With the time it took to write and research, it seems that Jeal Auel was quick to add content that took away from not only this book, but the entire collection. Maybe to add pages or get more readers - I was really put off by the, lets say, pornographic genre scenes scattered within the pages of what could have been a great follow-up to the Plains of Passage."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I bought this book because I enjoyed all the others, to varying degrees (though I don't really remember the fourth one at all). And I have to admit this one has a not put downable quality to it in that you want to know what happens! But nothing much does and there are so many repetitive passages that it made me wonder whether the book was edited at all. I think the Zelandoni attitude towards \\"Pleasures\\" is refreshing but I don't think the sex scenes between Jondalar and Ayla add anything to the story."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This book was eye-candy. After waiting for this book for so long, it was easy to ravenously devour it's sweet frothiness which lacked real substance - I wanted book 6 immediately afterward as I was still hungry for a meaty story. However, I think that after so long it was almost necessary to re-introduce old readers to the pertinent information again, as a set up for the (hopefully) deeper issues the 6th book (again, hopefully!) will broach - such as: Durc's place in the clan, and the foreshadowed meeting of him and the Others, some sort of \\"out-and-out conflict\\" between the Clan and the Others, in which Ayla will probably play a part in stopping, Ayala's indoctrination into becoming Zelandonni and the mystical world and learning that will be involved, perhaps Jondalar's struggle with losing her to that mystical world (the boy is a bit obsessed with her, don't you think?). Also, the Others learning to domesticate horses and other animals, which drastically alters the way humans began to form communities and civilization - more could be planned for, which left more time for \\"civilized\\" pursuits. Just some thoughts, but I'll be hoping that Ms. Auel has saved her best for last - book 5 was merely an appetizer."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I took the liberty of reading the other reviews and agree with most of them. Yes, the book is overly long and repetitious. I'm not sure if Ms. Auel was trying to re-aquaint us or herself with characters who've been missing for far too long. Yet, this series remains on of my favorites. The people, places, and customs remain descriptive and rich in her writing style. As always, there is an element of intrigue boiling just beneath the surface. If indeed Book 6 will be the final installment,then The Shelters of Stone has left many questions that will need to be answered."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I enjoyed the trip into the past I would have liked more interaction with the Clan.I would like to be advised of any books Jean writes."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I love this book - it's a favorite I have read many times. Listening to it is a wonderful experience. My only complaint is that Ayla was given an accent that she did not have in the previous four books that I found a bit annoying. I realize she does indeed have an accent in the books, but making her sound Eastern European to achieve what was her \\"clan accent\\" did not work for me. Otherwise I loved it and will listen to it again and again."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The best of the series yet! Cannot understand all the people carping about it: hey! Get a life! This isn't supposed t be War and Peace or the Great American Novel...it is just a GOOD story! if you want SERIOUS FICTION and stories about DYSFUNCTIONAL FAMILIES and the like, read something else. I loved it; although I do agree tgat the repition of titlee dot a bit overdone. I can hardly wait for the last book in the series."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Shelters of Stone is an enlightened tract that is a bit short on narrative. But note that the range of emotions is far better than the stuff put forth by professional archaelogists, who emotively mainly carp and backbite. Most archaeology is 1/10 fact and 9/10 inference. Auel's artistic inferences are much more honest and revelatory than the spitting and hissing by the conventional managers of ancient intellectual property. Auel is not a graceful stylist, but she is efficient, orderly, and sometimes appropriately bold. Her characterizations are decently diverse, except for Jondalar. Onomastics are not Auel's strong point. Her thematics about tolerance are obviously guesswork, but why not in a work of fiction? They beat the contrary. And carping at Ayla's ability to invent everything from horse-whispering to soap to birth control stems from the same sort of self-important Thwackerisms as those that claim Shakespeare was too undereducated to write his own stuff. One last point for the sniffies: her use of contemporary idiom is a nice medievalish anachronistic touch. Who said our early ancestors grunted all the time?"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I didn't know if I would live to read the next enstallment of Jean Auels mighty series. I have read all of the Earth Series Books, except the last, four times through, and love it. I love the way Jean starts the book with the next obvious breath from the last exhaliation of the previous book. Always with the curious and fearful people wondering just who Alya and Jondalar are. I love the way she jumps right in with the action of the story of the main characters greeting then finding something to do. Had it been my journey, I think that I would have wanted to sleep for a week.The characters blended very well, and I see that she has left herself open for a sixth in the series. I just hope we do not have to wait fifteen years. I was totally blown away as Jean Auel explained the number of trips to and from Europe. My feelings of gratitude have grown in such leaps and bounds, because I know, now, how much work goes into these kinds of series. Jean Auel, if you get to read this, please know my great thanks for the book you just finished, and for them all, as I have been so antsy to read it. Like a child waiting for a holiday, for when I read your books, I see myself in the situations you write of. Truly and totally enjoy, do I, your ability to tell such wonderful stories. I thank you for doing it to entertain us readers that know the good stuff and don't waste time on those that are not. I also love the series by Kathleen Gear and her husband, Michael. Sue Harrison is not to be left out, nor in a different setting, I love Tony Hillerman for his modern day mysteries of the Four Corners area of the US.I apologize for and am sorry that I was so anxious that I became greedy with your time. I just felt 'the book wasn't here fast enough.' But when I finally saw that your new book was out, my heart was singing a new song. I ordered my book from my book club, and within 5 days, I had finished another great book of the life and love of Alya of the Mind of Jean Auel. Thank you, thank you, thank you for being this kind of human, to share the results of your very talented mind and thought processes with us. You truly do make your fans wait with such anticipation of excitment, like waiting for a great and precious present.I am glad Wolf was not killed. Nearly thought he might be when I got to that part, but breathed easier at the next chapter.I find myself from a range of feelings all throughout this book - tears of joy, guard-like watchfulness of the ones who would be envious of Alya and Johdalar, barely controlling the sexual arousal that come with the couplings of Alya and Johdalar. I have no husband and, whew, they really love each other. Glad you wrote them this way. It seems like we are peeking through a key hole to spy on them when these parts are read. Whew! Anyway, takes me back to when I had a love to share pleasures with.Thanks again. Hope to live long enough to read your next one, when Alya joins the Zelondia for she is truly a great and good character, she deserves to honor the mother earth.Well, I have gone on, haven't I.Sincerely and with great gratitude, I sign,Penny Haulman"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I looked at all of the reviews and find that quite a few people were dissappointed in this book. While not as gripping as the previous 4 books in the series, it is in the style that Ms Auel writes. There were several sections that grabbed me emotionally. I liked the book very much. I came accross the Earth's Children series of books about 4 months ago. The whole series thrills me very much. Ms. Auel joins a very limited panthyon of authors whose books I would buy on sight. They include Robert Henlein, Isaac Asimov, Gordon R. Dickson, J. K. Rawlings, Bruce Moen, and Robert Monroe. So, I'm a traditional science fiction fan among other things."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I ordered this book to help complete my Earth's Children Series...I had absolutely no issues with this purchase.

I can't wait till Jean M Auel writes the next book in the series. I love her books.Lila Guptill"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I was a great fan of the Authors previous books. I found all of them imaginative and the detail very interesting. I have to admit that The Plains of Passage became a little tedious at times, but the story line made it worth the while.In this installment however, the detail was tediously boring. I found myself skipping pages to try and get back to the story. But the story was merely a recounting of the previously explained history of Ayla and her skills. The characters are even so similar to previous books characters that the encounters are repetetive. The story that this book tells is almost non- existent. The characters are one dimensional. It could have been told better in two hundred pages.In other words, it was a big disappointment, a well written yawn."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I waited over a year to get the audio cassette version of this book. I read the first four books when they came out orignally and loved them so much that I wanted my husband to hear them on audio cassette, as we have a long commute to work. He enjoyed them and understood when I was excited about the fifth in the series. Finally the long awaited day came when I had the audio book in my tape player and we settled in to listen to what very soon became a disappointing letdown. Not only do I agree with the rest of the reviews but I must add that the audio version has added another faux pau. Someone decided that the reader should give Ayla's voice an accent. Yes, they are always going on and on about her foreign accent but in the other audio books she had regular speech and sounded no different from the rest of the Cromagnons. You could use your imagination to figure out how Clan people sounded. Now she sounds like Natasha (Boris and Natasha) and it is annoying and laughable. Sometimes the reader seems to forget the accent and speaks normally. Later the accent returns. Please!!! I am so sad that I cannot love this book. I keep hoping Lorimar or Brakovar will kidnap her or do something to bring a little suspense...what happened to Merona, Jondalar's old lover who played the \\"evil\\" trick on her? She might turn up later in the book but somehow I doubt it. I am grateful that halfway through the book we have only been subjected to one sex scene. This book is so boring, everyone is so nice and modern-thinking! We are plodding through, out of loyalty on my part. I pray the next book in the series redeems itself."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"after re reading how fire is made ,what seemed like a 1000 times I decided this was the most boring book ive read in a long time."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Like so many other fans of the Earth's Children series, I was disappointed in this installment. In my opinion, the book was about 500 pages too long. Too many words!! Get to the point Jean Auell. Where was the character development? Where was the story of the people? The dialog was totally unbelievable. In short it was an effort to finish the book, I only did so because I am an optimist, I kept hoping it would get better. Will I read the next book? If it takes another 10 yrs. to get out I probably won't."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I just finished the book. I was happy that I didn't go back and read the previous books. To me there were parts of the books where it did drag a little, but in all honestly I've never found any of these books that didn't drag a little to me. I did get a little bored about reading how Ayala aquired the horses. Overall in my opinion this books was the best yet. I just really hope we don't have to wait another 12 years for book #6, and I for one will probably be sad to see the series end."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I waited twelve years for this book, and I would have been less disappointed if it had not been written at all. It is entirely too lengthy and uses too many words to say too little. The description of how the \\"spear thrower\\" works is one example. What took half an hour to read could have been summed up in one page. The use of contemporary English does not fit the characters at all. I think I'll pass on the next book in the series where Ayla visits the Pacific. What a disappointment."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have read the first 4 books in this series. I thought the Valley of the Horses was the best one. I bought the unabridges version of the Sherters of stone in cassette form. Jean Auel, in my opinion, wrote a very long book of descriptions of Ayla's talents with healing, medicine and food. Al of which were explained in the other books.THERE WAS VERY LITTLE ACTION EVENTS IN THE WHOLE BOOK. It dragged on and on. The next time I buy a tape version I will get the abridged version. Maybe that will cut out all the stufff Jean told us in the first 5 books. Based on the other books, especially the first three books, I was extremely disappointed in this last book. I can honestly say I would not reccomend this book for others to waste their time on reading it.Fred Davis"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The whole book reminded me of Valley of the Horses. It is building up to an encounter/clash with the Clan, just like VoH was for most of the book a buildup to Ayla and Jondalar's introduction to each other. However, unlike VoH, SoS leaves us hanging... in spite of a book that left me with sore muscles from holding it up!Now to be totally fair, the tediousness comes from getting to know yet another people - the Zelandoni. Their society is not terribly different from the Mamutoi, Sharamadoi, and all the other peoples we get to know in previous books. But they are different, and the timing of the introduction of them should have been done in VoH, or even an earlier book of Jondalar's childhood. Auel chose this way and it obviously was a difficult choice.So I guess I rate it this high because as a stabd alone book, it is not that bad. It is just kind of clunky if you are reading the series concurrently.This book is like eating your Brussell Sprouts so you can have dessert. The next one could be the best of the series based on all the buildup."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Reading these reviews has been a comfort to me, since I waited almost 12 years for this book, and found it so disapointing. I'm glad I'm not the only one!That having been said, I have to jump to Ms. Auel's defence. First of all, no book could have lived up to the fanfare and expectations of those of us who have read and adored the first four books. (Especially those of us who spent all those years dreaming up our own versions of what happens next!) Just because she didn't include all of the action I hoped to see, doesn't mean Ms. Auel has lost interest or failed to write the book she wanted.Secondly, I spent all day re-reading SOS and realized that several parts were excellent. (And anyone who thinks this book was ghost-written clearly didn't pay enough attention to those parts!) Chapters 2 through 10 are great. So are some of the scenes at the Summer Meeting. There are at least 300 pages of terrific reading. The only problem is, the book is 741 pages.There are only two serious problems with the book:1. The endless descriptions of the landscape and repetitions previous material.2. The really great characters and storylines Ms. Auel introduced--then didn't take anywhere.I could easily skip the pages of boring description, but what I can't forgive is the way she set up Brukaval as a stalker, Marona as a dangerous villainess and Laramar's whole abused, disfunctional family that Ayla was supossed to save--and then left us all the lurch. I could write reams of fan fiction about all that stuff, but I'd have preferred Ms. Auel do it for me. That's why I was in the bookstore on April 30 as soon as I got off work.I will probably do the same when book 6 comes out, partly out of hope that it will be back to the level of the first 4, and partly out of repect for the author who has written some of my favorite books of all time..."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This was a disappointing book. I loved all the others and couldn't wait for this one. This book was more like \\"a day in the life of Ayla, et al\\", with no real story or plot and not much adverture. In an effort to be accepted by Jondalar's family, she has subdued her strong personality and is not as determined and outspoken as before. A lot of the book was a rehash of the other books and most readers would have read them and already know the background. Also so much was repeated over and over in great detail. It almost feels like it was ghost written by someone else with a different style of writing. There are many grammatical mistakes, too. The first 500 pages covered about a month or two and that last 100 pages covered about 10 months all at once. We never really got to know how Ayla spent the winter. This was a book I read thoroughly, but was glad when I finished it, almost like the task was finally done. That feeling came from the lack of a plot, the rehash of the other books and the repeating of so many activities. Auel should have made it into two books with the first half coming out earlier and thus have two shorter books rather than one so long."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Auel continues to fascinate with her research and speculations about the life of pre-historic man, however, she missed her opportunity with this book. Amazingly, Ayla is only 19 at the END of this book?! She should have aged Ayla, which would have had its own interesting possibilities, and made this book about her children. Fans of this series waited a long time and there is little progression in the story to show for it."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I rushed into the store to pay the 20 dollars for this book thinking that it would live up to the excitement of the others. i began thinking that maybe i was less exciting 10 years ago and didn't know any better.

The descriptions are way too descript-they ramble on and on and its all remnisicient of books gone by. Im truly sorry to have to write this review about a beloved Author, but she definately needed to give us more content and less of the repetitous drone provided here. Even the Jondular/Ayla sex scenes-puhleese! Read one-read 'em all! I found myself skipping a great deal of this book just to try to move on to bigger and better things and found I had almost literally skipped the entire book.

The book was just very boring. The characters were boring, there was really no plot except for maybe Ayla being pregnant, which of course lasts the entire book. There was no tension; nothing to keep you on the edge of your seat. In ten to twenty years whent the last book in the series comes out, I think I'll wait for it in paperback."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I'm yet another fan that has waited 12 long years for this book to come out. When I learned that the fifth book in the series was to be released, I was overjoyed. I raced to the bookstore to buy it the day it came out.After reading what other people thought about this book, I have to agree with the majority of them. This book most certainly should have been 300 pages, not 700. The repetitive dialogue as well as the long winded introductions were a major problem. I have to admit that I too skipped many a page.After I finished reading the book, I wonderered how Ms. Auel is going to finish this storyline in just one more book, for she covered so little ground in this one. Also, I noted that Ayla rarely concentrated on her healing abilities. In all the previous books, one of Ayla's main objectives, was to note the plants and vegetation in the area and to keep her supplies well stocked. This was something as natural as breathing to Ayla, so how do you explain the sudden change of character?Here's to hoping the next book is better!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Okay I am finally done reading Shelters of Stone and I am wondering if this book can get me through another 9 years waiting for the next book? I have to say I really needed my Ayla fix so I was not too disapointed, but the repetition in this book, including large parts from her previous books, was getting to be too much. And what happened with Marona, does she get her revenge against Ayla? I think lots of other routes were possible but simply not explored in this book. I read Plains of Passage when I was 15 and it has been a long wait. I have to wonder, do I have to wait 10 more years for more Zelandoni soap opera writing, where Ayla becomes Zelandonia and just lives in the Ninth Cave. What about the dream she had about Durc and her new son, then she has a girl!? Is she going to have another son and he will battle with Durc, or is this just symbloic of the times? This book was not packed with much like the first four were, will she make up for it in the sixth? It should be like 2,000 pages long.

I kept waiting for SOMETHING to happen, and it really never did. I think there were huge opportunities in the plot line, but it's almost like Auel lost steam because she never pursued them. For instance, the whole book could have circulated around a dramatic meeting or conflict between the Others and the Clan, followed by understanding or resolution. Also, Ayla's character did not \\"ring true\\" at the end; she was uncharacteristically weak and fearful. Sorry to say, but we should skip this one, and keep the good memories from Clan of the Cave Bear."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This is the book to read when you need to fall asleep. The excruciating detail will wear any reader down. I loved the series but felt the characters in this book had no personality. Ayla has become such a goody-goody with none of her previous fiery personality and Jondalar has none of the character he had in the previous books. The new characters introduced in the book are sadly lacking in development. Rather than buy Shelters of Stone, read Clan of the Cave Bear."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I've only got a precious 60 more pages or so to go to finish this book...but I must admit...I'm rather disappointed.Most of Ms. Auel's books span the course of several years...and much happens to the characters. I looked forward to this book for about a dozen years...and it only spans the course of about a year... For a lengthy book...it doesn't cover much ground in the lives of Ayla and Jondalar. And she hasn't invented one solitary thing throughout the whole book! Not at all like her!I sure hope the next book is waiting in the wings. I'm still a big fan and all...I just expected to get more caught up with my all-time favorite characters after all this time waiting. A lot of the book was just a recapitulation of the previous books...Ayla's unusual background...and the things she and Jondalar learned on their journey...I just expected a lot more. The book is very detailed and well written as always...but not much happens... And I feel that Ms. Auel missed the opportunity to utilize the character of Marona effectively... Maybe something will happen in the next 60 pages to change my mind.I'm really glad to have the book...and nothing would keep me from reading it...but I've been re-reading all the other Earth Series books for years and years and years and years...so I did not need the recapitulation....

In fairness, I did enjoy the parts where there was some action(!) and was actually sorry when the book finally ended, as it is obviously set up for a sequel, in order to resolve many unfinished issues.This book is definitely only for the fans."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Wow, I came to write a little review to find over 300 negative ones. I don't think this was such a bad book. I wasn't overly fond of The Plains of Passage (I just wanted them to find a home already) so I guess I wasn't surprised with the length and the detail of this novel. Nor was I expecting much after that one. As one reviewer wrote, she's creating an entire world and society and I guess she or her editor felt a need to explain it to us to the last detail.Yes, I too waited 12 years for this book and while it isn't Clan of the Cave Bear, I didn't expect that. I like the characters and like the fact that the story continues. She could have just quit writing them but she didn't. Perhaps she should have, but it's too late for that now. Besides, this is a series folks and how many series that run longer than three books really live up to their predecessors? Or the first one? Maybe we expected too much?I didn't mind the repetition. I didn't mind the repetition. I didn't feel that Auel was cheating or talking down to her readers. She felt a need to explain her world, so be it. The book and story weren't the greatest but I'm glad to have read it for myself, glad the prehistorical world continues, glad that Ayla can live (or try to live) a quiet life and bear her child in peace. I don't mind Ayla as a seemingly flawless character. I don't think of her as a real person but a composite of modern humans and our greatest strengths. I don't mind for one novel seeing an example of our best selves. If you don't mind that, then you won't mind the characterization of Ayla in this novel. If you are expecting more than that, reread Clan of the Cave Bear.I didn't buy the hardcover. I borrowed this book from the library. And I dragged it around for a week while I read it. But I will buy it to add to my other paperbacks in this series. Series like this don't come around too often. I say if you like the series, buy The Shelters of Stone. Read it and form your own opinion and give Auel one last chance with the next one . . . but get them from the library first.For those who feel real cheated and angry, Auel did print an apologetic letter for the length of time it took her to write this tome in the back of the new editon of The Plains of Passage. Maybe that tone of apology was for more than the 12 years. Take it as you wish."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I too have been following the Earth's Children Series right along, although I knew when I finished \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear\\" that Jean M. Auel was never, ever, going to top that book. Not only was that a masterful combination of archeological knowledge regarding the lives of Neanderthals with the creative inspiration of their peculiar memories, but the story is so powerful on a mythic level being a retelling of the expulsion of Eve from the Garden of Eden (think about it: Ayla is cast out several times having to do with her violation of gender roles). When I started reading \\"The Valley of Horses\\" it was obvious that the characters we met in the first two chapters, Ayla and Jondalar respectively, were eventually go to meet (and probably have really great sex). By the end of that novel we knew that eventually Jondalar was going to take Ayla back to his people, the Zelandoni. At the end of \\"The Plains of Passage\\" they had finally arrived at his home, and that is where \\"The Shelters of Stone\\" picks up.The biggest issue for me while reading \\"The Shelters of Stone\\" was figuring out what the book was about. At face value it would seem to simply have to do with the acceptance of Ayla by the Zelandoni. After all, she has a funny accent, has a trained wolf and horses, and has the habit of stubbornly insisting that flatheads are human beings. Although Ayla wins over most of the camp, including the more powerful members, there are several individuals who end up holding pretty big grudges against her and I spent most of the book expecting something horrible to happen to somebody although none of these potential villains is anywhere close to being in the class of Broud. As for Ayla herself, she repeatedly insists that all she wants to do is mate Jondalar and bear his baby (Ayla knows that this idea that spirits create babies is a big misconception). Therefore I was surprised, and rather pleasantly I must admit, when it turns out that is Ayla's ability to be accepting of something new that turns out to define the novel's climax.Although I did not read the foreword until after completing the novel, I thought it was interesting that Auel wrote this book somewhat differently. Since the locations are based on real prehistoric caves she has visited in the south of France, Auel wrote the descriptions first, to ensure their accuracy before proceeding with her narrative. But while the accuracy of the geography is well grounded, Auel creativity has broken loose big time in terms of prehistoric music. Auel has written a lengthy work called \\"The Mother's Song,\\" which pops up several times in the novel and is reprinted in its entirety in the back. Here is where Auel is going way beyond the scant evidence preserved in the archeological record to flesh out her characters and the world in which they live. Still, in the final analysis, in this book the archeological information ends up being more important than the narrative, albeit pretty much by default.Perhaps the greatest irony of \\"The Shelters of Stone\\" is that now that Ayla and Jondalar have finished their journey they not only spend a lot of time telling about what happened on their trip, but most of what happens in this novel recalls similar events in early volumes in the Earth's Children Series. Ayla continues to look out for the weak and helpless, especially for any child considered \\"deformed\\" by the community, and if the reader does not draw a similarity to what happened in earlier books with Durc and Rydec, then Ayla will draw the explicit comparison for them. There are actually more flashbacks than sex scenes this time around. The worst thing I can say about this book is that for the first time I finished one of Auel's novels and did not have special scenes that I wanted to go back and read (Tom Clancy did the same thing in his last Jack Ryan novel and he has me worried as well).Apparently there is one more volume to go to complete the story of Ayla, and for the first time I have some idea as to what the ultimate climax must be. Certainly the next volume will have to have more going on in it that \\"The Shelters of Stone,\\" which will take additional hits for because it provides so little to fans of Auel's heroine after so long a wait. Maybe once we read that final book and are better able to gauge what Auel was setting up in this current volume, we will have a better appreciation for this fifth book. But for now it is pretty much the literary equivalent of treading water."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have been an avid fan of the Earth's Children series since the beginning. After waiting 13 long years for the sequel to Plains of Passage, (which, in my opinion, started Auel's lack of wonderful story telling that the three previous books had had)you can imagine my disappointment when yet again we have an incredibly long boring stale story. Most people who would read Shelters of Stone are familiar with the Earth's Children series; therefore, we do not need an entire book of rehashing the past 4 books. There were barely any new story lines and each page was racked with long drawn out personal histories of people that didn't really matter to the story as a whole. Auel could have gone soooo many places with this new book, when instead it's just another narrative on how to skin a deer. Believe me, it pains me to not like this book because I really wanted to...but Auel made it so hard to really get into and enjoy. I can only hope that the next installment of the series goes back to the beauty of the first 3 books. Although I probably won't be able to read it as well because I'll be about 80 when it finally comes out."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"After waiting 12 years or more for this book I was very disappointed!!!The story is repetitive at times. Also, there is too much attention to detail. I think Ms. Auel spent too much time writing this book. I found myself skimming over the descriptions to get back to the story.Too many new character introductions, some of which have detailed story lines and then are never mentioned again.I have loved all of Jane Auel's other books and hope that the next book in the Children of the Earth series is more like her other books.I usually abhor abridged books but think that in this case it might be a better choice.If you do not have the other books in the sereis borrow it from the library or from someone that already has it."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I really loved the first 3 books in the series and liked the next 3 in the series, but felt the books were becoming too much formula plot lines. This book was such a disappointment! She has so much to work with to create great drama and has seemed to instead repeat herself endlessly about the animals, the crafts, the history, geology, etc... Not to mention the laughable descriptions of the sexual eposides.This is a definate must miss."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"It is apparent Mrs. Auel wrote this book to cash in on the popularity of her first four Earth's Children books. Much of the writing in \\"Shelter's of Stone\\" seems to be copied from the other books. The descriptions of caves, clothes, tools, etc. are wordy and endless. The character's are weak and if there is any plot, I can't find it. Auel uses 741 pages when she could have told the whole story in 25. Save your money and don't buy this one and you can be sure I will not waste my money or time on reading her sixth."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have read the other books in the series and waited anxiously for this one. This latest is so repetitive that I don't really believe Jean Auel wrote it. An example is that the Mother's Song is about three pages long and is repeated three times. When Ayla is introduced to members of Jondalar's family, the lengthy formal introduction is repeated each time she meets a new member, and there are about two hundred members. It is not until about the last three chapters that the book picks up the pace and we begin to get a story line. Maybe this is where Jean began to write. The novel could be considerably condensed by tightening up the prose and eliminating the redundancy. Where was the editor? I felt embarrassed for the author. I probably will read the final book, but I certainly hope it is an improvement."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Ayla and Jondalar arrive at his people's home, where some people are awed by the things they bring back while others are nervous and/or hostile.There, now you can save yourself the trouble of reading The Shelters of Stone. This book has nothing new to offer. The pages could have been recycled from the third and fourth volumes, changing people's names and titles to fit. Ayla meets Jondalar's people and goes through the same process of introduction and mutual discovery that she's gone through with every society she's encountered throughout her journey. As if we hadn't been there when she raised her animals or discovered the firestones, here we're subjected to those same tales as Ayla tells them to her new people - not once, not twice, but half a dozen times - and only one iteration is noticeably condensed from the others. At this point it would be perfectly acceptable for the author to say \\"Ayla showed them the firestones and they all murmured in amazement,\\" or something to that effect, but no, each time someone new comes along we get another three-page demonstration (and I won't even mention all the new people who have to be introduced to the horses and the wolf). You can get through the first 400 pages without discovering anything of great interest. I recommend finding something better to do."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I think I first started reading Ayla's saga when I was in junior high. Ayla's determination to survive through great diversity completely captured my imagination. The first three books were so exciting and Ayla's relationship with Jondalar was sexy and intense. Finally, the Fourth book came out when I was in high school. I thought that Plains was ok for a transition book, but I really just wanted to see what would happen when Ayla finally met the Zelandonii. Little did I know that I was going to have to wait another 12 years for that to happen!I think Auel has gotten too caught up in describing the scenery and has forgotten what made her series memorable in the first place: the story. This seemed like a rehash of The Mammoth Hunters except there was no tension between Jondalar and Ayla and the supporting characters were not as memorable. Mammoth Hunters was painful, but that was what made it such a page turner. You didn't know if Jondalar and Ayla would get back together. You didn't know if the Mammuti would turn hostile towards Ayla because of her association with the clan. The supporting characters were fully developed. Rydag and Nezzie seemed like real people.After seeing how Jondalar initally reacted when he found out that Ayla lived with the Clan and had a child of \\"mixed spirits\\" I thought that the Zelandonii would completely freak out once they met Ayla. But if anything, they seemed more tolerant than the Mummuti, who were suppose to be a very open people."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"....because she could do everything else.I have read all of Auel's Earth's Children series and I have to say that is book was a disappointment.First off, the characters are all one-dimensional, boring and predictable. We all know that Ayala can do, say or wear anything and it'll turn out to be \\"right\\". Jondalar is such a wuss, lol. I mean, does he ever disagree with Ayala or get over his insecurities of every man desiring \\"Ms. Perfect\\"?Another thing are the explicit sex pages. Ok, how many times to we have to know when Jondalar is going down on her? Yes, yes...feels great; I love it too but there are so many times you can read about it before you start turning pages 3 at a time to skip over the taudry and tedious 3rd rate, quasi-porn.All and all this book was NOT her best. I'm really wondering if Ayala will ever see her son, Durc again. Maybe Jean should concentrate on giving the readers what they want! THat loose end needs to be tied!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I read the other books of this series all in a day each... this \\"The Shelters of Stone\\" has been at my night-stand for weeks and I am only half-way through it... Mrs. Auel this time takes to long describing things, people and places, and the story itself never takes off... a great disappointment after a 12-year wait."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I enjoyed her previous books. This one is, if not the most, at least a serious contender for, the most boring book I have ever read. Thank God I'm finished with it. What preserverance to complete it at all!."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"About 1/4 of this book is well written. The rest [sticks]! Yes it is that bad.I love the Earth Children series but I am not going to say this was a good book just to be a loyal fan. ... It has SO many inconsistancies, way too much repetition, and no plot what-so-ever.Do yourselves a favor, if you must read it, wait until you can get it a the library. Don't waste you money."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Like one of the other reviewers, I felt that I was led into expecting several conflicts between characters (which made the other books so interesting), but the conflict fizzled out or was avoided every time. It is as if Ms. Auel deliberately avoided every conflict.Also, I felt that Ayla is being pushed into becoming a religious Zelandonii although she has made it clear that she wants a home and family with Jondalar instead.The original Ayla would refuse to be forced into such a mold. Remember the sling she taught herself to use when women of the clan never touched weapons.Remember how in every other place she met people, she told them the whole truth about her past (including her son, Durc) and then dealt with the conflict. This time she so badly wants to be accepted that she won't acknowledge her son.In the first four books, I felt there was an in-your-face integrity about Ayla. When she made mistakes, she dealt with the consequences. When people didn't like her because the Clan was her family, she didn't try to play it down. Although she was hurt, frustrated, and angry, she just went about her business and expected them to deal with their own feelings.Zoelena spends much of the book trying to trick or coerce Ayla into becoming more involved with the Zelandonii. She emphasizes how difficult it would be to be mated and raising a family while being a Zelandonii.Ayla is happily mated to Jondalar, finally, and expecting his baby. WHY would Ayla be tempted to give it up?It just doesn't make sense. For 5 long books now, all Ayla has wanted is a family and to belong. WHY would she give the family up and place herself in such a strictly proscribed religious life?It is even obvious that Zoelena's concerns aren't about helping Ayla grow. In the book it clearly states that Zoelena wants to control Ayla's healing gift because it might cause some unnamed trouble to allow her to continue to heal without being a Zelandonnii.If Ms. Auel is true to Ayla's original character, I don't think she would make her become a Zelandonii because Ayla would fight against that unnecessary control.I also felt there was a lot of repetition of things like describing: how to domesticate a horse and a wolf, the joy of riding Whinny and Racer, how Ayla learned which plants worked for ailments. Even the big hunt was repetitive. Jondalar and Ayla have used their horses many times to guide stampeding animals into a trap. The sex too was repetitive. I re-read the first 4 books before reading the new one, and the sex scenes and descriptions of their feelings were almost exact repeats.I felt that many of the descriptions were taken from the previous books and dropped into this one.I did not hate the book, but I was so disappointed. Now I don't know whether I even want to buy the next one."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The only good thing I can say about this book is that I didn't have to buy it. It was a birthday gift from my sister. What a way to celebrate your 60th birthday. I eagerly awaited the 5th installment in the saga of Alya and Jondalar. Jean, you have insulted all of your devoted fans. Give us credit for having read the previous books and stop repeating yourself over and over and over again. Enough already. If you can't do any better than this, forget the 6th book. Sorry Sis, I wish I could get your money back."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"AFter waiting so long I felt cheated after reading this book which could have been summarized in one sentence. Ayla reaches final destination, mates, and has Jondalar's baby. The rest of the book is totally plagarist from the other books in the series. All the events are exactly the same, just the names are changed. There was absolutely no new plots involved. What a shame."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"...I feel that the story is very slow in developing in this book. The book doesn't get much into the spirit world, travel, or details of landscape. My hopeful interpretation is that book five is an introduction to book six, and that book six will bring the adventure back. Let's hope we won't have to wait more than a year for book six."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I should have read the book first. I never listen to critics or book reviewers, and I should have. The book was O.K. That is a very mild term for a book that, having taken 12 years to write, should have been a WOW. I have been a faithful reader of the Series, and I honestly expected The Shelters of Stone to have just as much \\"punch\\" as the prior books...it looks like Jean Auel got bored with this series and, realizing she has one more to do, repeated herself ad nauseum. I will read her final book in the series, but I won't buy it unless it is at least fifty times better than Shelters of Stone."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"There was no character development in this book. The characters were either perfect beyond belief or just downright bad and lazy. The protaganists, Ayla and Jondalar, have become one dimensional and boring. The antagonists don't actually create any conflict worth writing about. The book is unbearably repetitive, and the physical background descriptions were endless. Too much of the book spent time reiterating what had happened in previous books, I think unnecessarily. Or maybe I've just matured in the past 12 years and expect more...What a letdown."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I had been looking forward to the next installment of this series for many years. The research is impecible.The description of the life-syle of the characters, their tools, hunting and gathering methods, ceremonies and rituals, the role of the shamans and the leaders, the hierarchy of the skilled craftsman and the incredible caves was accurate. The reader could relate to the place and time through the wonderful word pictures.The constant repetition of the various experiences throughout the book was mind numbing. A reader really can remember the description of how the horses were tamed, how the spear thrower was developed, etc. from Chapter 3 to Chapter 15 to Chapter 23. There was too much redundancy.The sex really got boring. We know they were really physically attracted to each other, had great sexual compatibility and had sexual relations whenever they could. But was this really meant to be a 'romantic novel' with endless, repetitive sex? The 700+ page novel could have been cut to 400 pages."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I've am a fan of this whole series of books. I don't think there are problems in this book. The repetition of certain things is done throughout the series. I believe it was necessary for people that picked up book 5 without reading the others first. I am waiting for the next book! Want to find out what happens next! Think the series is just wonderful and shows lots of care taken to make the events interesting and believable."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Honestly after reading all the lousy reviews on this book I was prepared for a disapointment. But I have to say this was a wonderful book. I have read all five novels back to back and was eager to get to the last book to see what would happen with Ayla and Jondalar. I'm delighted that they are married and have a child and that Ayla finally has a home she can call her own.. And I am dying for the last novel in the series. I hope it will not take a long time."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"So maybe some of the other reviews would have been a bit less scathing if we'd all learn to read a little faster. And I, too, am not much of a fan of repetitive poetry, BUT this is still the best of the series since the Valley of the Horses, which may never be equaled. Also, faulting Ms. Auel for refreshing the memories of her readers after 10 years between books is just a bit cruel, especially to those older readers (myself) who desperately need memory refreshing.This book had all the magic and wonder of the previous books. The setting was well documented and beautifully drawn. The main characters were interesting and the addition of new protagonists has me waiting for the next installment. Give this book a chance. Read it in pieces as I did, don't make it a marathon."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Jean Auel started out with an exciting story of Ayla, but threw the series, she slowly either lost interest or just forgot how to write. She is loosing her followers, who have watched Ayla grow. All hopes for Ayla to return someday, and find her son Derk are all but lost, as the books become more boring and seem to only fill pages with gibberish. The #6 book in the series is not out yet, but I think I will read threw the pages before I buy it, to see if its worth the purchase."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Like so many readers I've waited the last dozen years wondering what happened to the rest of the series. When ... announced that it was time to preorder I sent in my order and waited to see what I'd be getting. My first thought was that The Shelters of Stone is the biggest book yet in the series so I got out my copy of The Plains of Passage and was surprised to see that it was actually 7 pages longer. All of the books in the Earth's Children Series are long, long winded,Shelters isn't really any different. Here we get to the long awaited end of Jondalar and Ayla's long journey and like the other books for your money you get page after page of detail about all sorts of things from cooking and religion to geology, biology, and even primitive architecture. Definitely not a book for the impatient or those with a short attention span. I found this latest book to be very much like Ms. Auel's earlier efforts with only a few minor exceptions, I think Jondalar grew a couple of inches and got a year younger and Ayla's Clan accent has become either stronger or better described (it is that at least). There are still some sex scenes in this novel but they are toned down in nature from earlier stories. Some of the other reviewers seem to hate everything about this book, I see it as being remarkably consistent with the rest of the series. I do think that the new reader should start out with The Clan of The Cave Bear and work their way up to this book, you might wonder just what's going on if you just jump in the middle. I do wonder how the series can reasonably end in just one more novel(that was the original plan at least)we're left with threads for two or more it appears to me. It is a very long book but it's got something for most every one, a good book to buy."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Bought 2 copies of this continuing saga for birthday presents.

If you have not read books 1 through 4, read them first. There was a few slow spots, but it is there for those who have not read the previous books. I would have liked to see more between Ayla and the old fiancee and more between Ayla and Brukeval. The ending was okay, but it is not as suspensful as the last book. I look forward to the next book, but I hope it is published sooner than this one. Hopefully, there will be more on Ayla & Jondalar's baby and tension between the tribe over Ayla's abilities."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I just started the series, at \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear\\" lvl on May 1. 13 days later I completed the last book \\"Shelters of Stone\\". The book flows well with the others and is a good next step for the series that leaves you grasping for more. I feel sorry for those who have had to wait 12 yrs for this book, and don't think I could make it that long till the next. It's easy to become intimately involved with the characters, and althought the extreme detail of scenery can get alittle tough, the main focus is still deliciously interesting. This book has alittle less of the \\"intense events\\" than the others, and is more involved in the day to day life stuff, it still holds it value in the series. Over all, I really liked it and breezed through in 2 days."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"If you have to know how Ayla's world turns out (Will she perform heart transplants? Power Zelandonii civilization with cold fusion? Tame a mammoth instead of eating it?) then by all means read this book. And, I think if you are a fan of Romance Fiction, like Nora Roberts or Diana Galbadon (sp?), then you would probably enjoy it.If, however, you want a gritty exposition of the human ice age, forget about it. Or, read the book for amusement value. Otherwise, read Clan of the Cave Bear and stop there. That book managed to be a great piece of storytelling. Shelters of Stone is a tired piece of romance fiction from an author who is obviously tired of writing the series.Best thing I can say about it: it is MUCH better than Plains of Passage, a throwaway effort on the part of Auel."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Carrying on the story.

If Ms Auel really did write (or compile) this book she has treated her readers with contempt, and her publishers have neglected their duty to us. Perhaps she was persuaded against her better judgement to squeeze out one more book, for this is what it feels like.Most readers will have read the previous books in the series and know them well, but Ayla and Jondalaar's history is raked over again and again - a synopsis at the start may have told any new readers all that was necessary. If repeated flashbacks to this history, repetitions of the \\"Mothers Song\\" and extremely unsuccessful attempts to describe numerous painted caves (needs an illustrated non-fiction book - how about it Ms Auel, as you have obviously lost interest in the story line?) were extracted from the volume, it would be half the length. Shame on your publishers for letting this go by.I should have appreciated more honest reviews from all and sundry, including Amazon, before the book appeared for sale, and feel let down by them as well. Perhaps more honest reviews are in order now."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The book is just the one I needed to fill in the gap on the series.

We look forward to next one."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Clan of the Cave Bear is on my top 10 list of favorite books. I have read it and others in the series many times over the years, both in book form and on tape. Though the other 3 books were not as tightly written, they were entertaining and interesting. But not The Shelter of Stones. It is 700+ pages of nothing. It is a rehash of what happened in the past with no depth or creativity. Nothing new happened and even the old stories was told in a very shallow way.All the talk in the earlier books about how Jondalar's kin felt flatheads were so abhorent - the supposed reason for Jondalar's strong reaction in book 2, and embarassment in book 3. They get to his home cave and his kin just say, \\"huh - there're human? Gee, that's interesting. Thanks for telling us. We'll have to think about it. \\"I suppose the next book could actually have some plot to it. But I'm not going to hold my breath. 700+ pages and we didn't even meet anyone from the Clan.I agree with the readers that disappointment does not even describe my feelings. If you are a fan of the series, you may want to skim through it just for continuity. There is always hope that the last book will be better. But I wouldn't put it high on my list of things to read. Re-reading the other books (which did over the last year) is much more enjoyable."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I am a huge fan of Auel, and I love all of her books. I was thrilled when I found out that the fifth book in the series was finally being released. Overall this installment is not as eventful or fresh as the first four, but I think that it is definitely worth the read. I think that some of the previous reviewers have been a bit hard on this book. More than once, I stayed up late into the night to read just one more chapter. Also while the book may start out slowly, if you stick with it, you'll find that the last couple hundred pages are worth the wait. Auel also does a huge amount of foreshadowing and character development that she obviously plans to create stories around in the next and final book. I think the next book will be a winner if she stays on the track that she started at the end of this one. Since it looks like the next book will also be set in the same geographical region, it will hopefully not take her as long to write. I, for one, enjoyed this book, and look forward to the next one as well."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Fans of the Earth's Children series have waited for this fifth novel, sometimes dispairing of seeing it published, for years. I would like to say that it was worth the wait, and in some ways it was, but it was not without some disappointments.Like all of the books in this series, Shelters is voluminous. The need to describe a culture that no longer exists takes a great deal of space. As do the descriptions of the landscape (with its distinctive flora and fauna) and the development of the characters, almost all of whom are new to the series. Putting that aside, there are places in the story where the author feels compelled to go on and on about events that are described in great detail in earlier books of the series. This occurs with too much frequency in this book. There are entire parts of this work that can be skimmed over without missing a thing. The bulk of the book could have been greatly reduced if the editor had taken a more liberal hand in dealing with this problem. The pace of the story is irreparably harmed by this repetitiveness.Ms. Auel is a very gifted writer. The amount of time she has put into the development of the characters makes them believable and gives the reader a need to know what happens next. Her extensive research pays off in the wonderfully detailed descriptions of the story's setting allowing the reader to \\"come into\\" the story. The plot development, at times sluggish, is interesting enough to keep the reader going but could have done with a few more twists. Some of it was very predictable.In all, I enjoyed the book because it is part of the series and because I do want to know what happens to the characters. Anyone who has read the series to this point, has invested a great deal of time in the story and wants to see it to its end. It is unfortunate that there was such a great expanse of time between the fourth and fifth installments. The Shelters of Stone was a long time in coming -- emphasis on long."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have been one of Ms. Auel's addicted readers throughout her entire series. I fought my way through The Shelters of Stone for the first 275 pages and finally tossed it aside. Replay, Replay, Replay. I enjoyed the five page spread on the caves in France in one of the 2001 editions of National Geographic significantly more. 13 million copies printed of The shelters of Stone! My copy got trashed. A great disappointment to this previous fan."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"After waiting 11 years, I was thrilled and disappointed. Thrilled to finally have book 5 here. Disappointed, as not much happened. There isn't the \\"drama\\" to this volume that appeared in earlier. No threats to Jondalar and Ayla's relationship, no threats to their lives, no real cultural problems or fitting in problems. What I do see is Jean setting the scene for the next volume.We will see the resolution of Ayla becomming Zelandoni, there will be some interaction with the clan, and Ayla did make some enemies. I expect to see more drama with them in book 6.All in all, an enjoyable, light read."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Like many fans of the Earth's Children series, I eagerly awaited the publication of Shelters of Stone, after being quite disappointed in Plains of Passage, on both first and second readings. I was hoping that Ms. Auel would once again hit the stride from the first three books, but, alas, while an improvement over Plains, Shelters is largely a description out in search of a story. It appears to be a pastich of large chunks of previous books for the two or three people out there who might not have read the first four, endless and tedious \\"formal introductions\\" that read like the Biblical \\"begats,\\" plus lots of her research materials and descriptions that she felt a deep need to share, lightly encased in a fairly forgetable boy gets girl, girl gets acceptance story. Lacking in the intricate interplay of characters of the earlier books, peopled with largely cardboard figures (Zolena/Zelandonii being something of an exception), I must say I was disappointed. I may wait for the library or the paperback next time. You may want to as well, for this one."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Jean Auel has written 5 books in this series. This one is the poorest. It drags, page after page, it drags. It is repetitious to the point where I skipped whole paragraphs. Much of it is re-hashes the previous books. The sex appears to be added as an afterthought to relieve the boredom. I kept hoping, but nothing ever happened that grabbed my attention. \\"Valley of the Horses\\" was fascinating, it sits in my bookcase and I'll re-read every couple of years. Shelters of Stone I'll donate to the local libary."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have waited for so long for this book to come out and I was disappointed in it. Don't get me wrong the story was good but the author repeats sections over and over again. I like the detail of the backgrounds and the land but I highly doubt that prehistoric women were giving oral sex the way Jean portrays it. Seems like soft porn to me. ..."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"After waiting all of these years for Auel's latest book, this book (like the Plains of Passage before it) was a disappointment. The book is far too full of background material (by book five readers should be clear about the story) and the dialogue leaves a great deal to be desired. Near page 400 the book picks up slightly, but falls off again and never regains speed. Auel's first three books are a delight and a must-read. This last book is yet another transition book (like book four) and leaves the reader baffled. In 12 years the author couldn't seem to get it right, and that's a shame. Do your wallet a favor: buy the paperback."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Unlike the first 4, I can \\"live\\" without Jondolar and Ayla for a while. I thought after 12 years of waiting for this book, a lot of new ground would have been covered. I would have hoped that more than 12 months of their life would have been revealed. There was just too much time spent on repetition and detail to the land. I was more interested in the characters life and what they had been doing for the last 12 years! My imagination wondered more years than the actual pages. Oh well.Maybe the next book will complete their journey and purpose in life as told by the one who has so masterfully created them."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I was totally dissapointed by this book. It lacked originality and adventure as the other previous 4 books provided. The 700 some odd pages of introductions and rehash of the other books was totally boring . I almost put the book aside, but kept reading expecting something interesting to happen, but did not."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I'm in agreement with everyone else. I was disappointed in SoS because of the long, detailed, repetious explaination of everything. One positive point. It did pickup speed towards the end which will perhaps make the sequel a better work. Good luck Jean!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Jean Auel does it again. This book is just as good as the previous 4. This book will have you wishing it wouldn't end, and when it does, it has you wanting more. Fabulous read, highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I was a very young girl when I started reading these books and have been waiting a very long time to reconnect with some of the most interesting characters in modern literature.This novel is a little disappointing for the reasons that other reviewers have stated, the repetition of stories from the previous books, the repetition of text within this book (one song lasts a number of pages and is repeated three or four times within the book), and apparent lack of plot.However, this novel has a lot of redeeming qualities. The first refutes the problem of the lack of plot. These novels are works of anthropological fiction, meant to take us into the lives of peoples who lived a very long time ago. This book, while it doesn't have much of a plot, does certainly take us into the everyday lives of the Zelandonii - from how they preserved food, bartered, traded, went to the bathroom...This is as close to \\"reality TV\\" as you get in a novel. I didn't notice the lack of plot until I had finished the novel because I was so fascinated by the factual information that was woven into the text. I look on this novel as a set up to the undoubtedly powerful conclusion being written and researched currently. I look forward, in fact, to the Clan perhaps actually sticking up for themselves and the battle which will undoubtedly ensue.Sometimes, the factual information so tediously researched seemed to become \\"textbook\\" like in its tone, but I feel that it was necessary. We are dealing with a people so far removed from our current existence and a landscape so different from anything we know now that the lengthy descriptions were absolutely necessary to provide a mental image of the rich culture of the Zelandonii and how it was completely tied to the land. One of my friends stopped by as I was reading and asked what was happening. I mentioned that a man had just been gored by a wooly rhino and my friend thought that was ridiculous, and today it would be - but 35,000 years ago, the landscape and creatures were different and man was not always as safe from those things as he is today.Most important to me in these novels has always been the way in which Ayla examines the cultural values of those around her. She questions everything, from the role and placement of individuals in society to the validity of some religious beliefs, and this is what makes her such a powerful and fascinating individual. This novel strikes a chord then when it inspires us to do the same thing with our own cultural values, which are often times just as arbitrary and based in superstition.The theme of prejudice and hatred towards those that are different runs strongly through this novel as it has through the others, and different characters have to deal with intolerance for others in many different ways and for different reasons. I think that the deeply imbedded nature of the hatred between peoples and the constant fight to change it is what hooked me into the series and I cheer internally for Ayla everytime she convinces someone to reexamine the ideas s/he has about the people around her. Some of the characters (however badly named) were so ignorant she could not change them. The tension created as a result gave the book a dimension of reality sometimes missing because Ayla's character is attributed with such a wide variety of strengths, she never seems to fail.Overall, I feel that this novel lived up to my expectations(though I did expect more sex) and I was not disappointed (except that there wasn't more sex). :) I can only say that I hope I don't have to wait ten more years for the next novel."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have just finished SHELTERS, and for the most part I was pleased. I have also just read all the customer reviews on this addition to the Earth Series. I DO understand the frustrations that other readers felt about all the repetition, but I as for me, I read each or the earlier books when they were first published and have not re-read or reviewed them; therefore, I had forgotten much. For example, I had forgotten that no one had firestones, forgotten much of the adventures of Thonolan and Jondalar, forgotten about Baby, and that no one has figured out that sex between men and women is what creates children (although Alya suspects, of course), etc., etc. I mean, it HAS been 12 years. If you have just recently discovered the series, or have re-read these books, then yes, much will be repetitive and boring. But lucky for me,I never re-read books, even favorites like this series, because, frankly, there are just \\"too many books, so little time\\" - I will never finish all the books I want to read in my lifetime. And personally, I found book 4, PLAINS, to be the snoozer of the series. I just hope #6, which will surely bring Durc into the mix, is published before either I or Ms Auel dies."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"You people are ridiculous!! You don't deserve the 6th book. You've totally missed the point. Ayla, Jondalar, Marthona, The First, Laramar, Brukaval, etc, are archtypes of the people all around us. There is much to consider and learn. We can all find our nature in one of these characters. Why exaclty is Ayla loved, Jondalar desired, Marthona respected, and Laramar despised? Who do we all know who reminds us of each \\"fictional\\" people? Compare democracy to socialism in the Zelandonai and todays societies (USA, Soviet Union, South Africa, EU). What do we do with individuals who are unproductive? Uncared-for children? Children who have birth defects? How is wealth measured? Is monogamy realistic? This book is as great as those who read it. Sure, the story could have gone a few different ways. Write your own series if you think you can do better."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Jean's Clan of the Cave Bear began my obsession with reading and I was not at all disappointed with this one. I have read the reviews of others on this book and in a way I agree with them. This book is repitive but I think that it was necessary to repeat certain facts. I think a lot of her loyal readers forgot that not everyone has read the previous books that began Ayla's journey. I also think that they also forgot that in real life many of your own characteristics and decisions are based on your own past events. Hence, even though it is unhealthy to linger in your past it is important to remember it. I also agree with the fact that in this book at the end I felt left hanging. I did read her comments and she said she was researching for the sixth one so I'm assuming that the reason the ending was left that way was because of the sixth to come. In fact, I think most of the events in this book are to set up the next one. I think that in the final book everything in this book will make sense. Although I think this book played out a little longer than it needed but overall it was a great book. Again her descriptions and details and research continues to amaze me."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I read Auel's other books years ago, and was surprised when I was told a new one was available. I truly enjoyed this one more then the others, as it ties together the past with the present, and overall is an excellent story. (However, I also recommend reading the stories in order, for this draws on the knowledge of the past books in the series.)I really enjoyed the other books in the \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" Series, as I love the main characters, Ayla and Jondalar. In Auel's past books, though I enjoyed the story, I found myself at times felt bogged down by too much description of scenery, and in a few books, too much time spent on intimate moments--over and over. But I kept reading because the main character is captivating and I desired to know what happened.I felt this book was the best yet! The author did not bore me once with too long descriptions and the story was interesting all the way through. There was less repetition and more exciting and wonderful new experiences for the characters. This book was an awesome conclusion to the past books as well as a real new beginning for Ayla. With many challenges to be seen ahead. Her life is never easy, but the way she faces life's challenges in this story are incredible.It was extremely hard to put down. I am really looking forward to another book about these characters, as I feel their lives have really just begun! I am hoping the author will finish another book very quickly, and keep the quality as high as in this one.If you like or can relate to the main character, Ayla, in this series, I am certain you will appreciate her choices and the direction her life is taking. I don't want to ruin the story for anyone, so I am not going into details, But this is definitely the best one yet!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"As I learned after reading it, this book was completed after the author's death. It would have been kinder to leave it undone. The story just rambles on and on. And my chief complaint with the whole series is this: Foreshadowing and dramatic build-up always lead to nothing. Ayla always seems on the verge of some exciting discovery. Through her dreams, chance encounters, new but familiar surroundings, we are drawn to expect some great spiritual revelation, but nothing ever happens with them. There is one more book promised to end this series, but I will not read it... Unless I become an insomniac."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Shes done went and done it again. I have read and enjoyed the entire (up to now)series by Jean Auel and look forward to the next book in the series. The best and in my opinion only way to read and enjoy the (earth children) is to start with the first \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\"."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This is the latest story created by Jean M. Auel of the Earth's Children stories. This book contains the fruits of Ayla's labors from the previous stories and her acceptance into her lover's people. A very good book."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"OK, the other reviewers are correct. The book has no plot in 750 pages and the poem is really bad. So how can I give the book 5 stars?I love Auel's characters. I love the world she creates. I love reading about how people lived 25,000 years ago. I am fascinated by the teas they made, the animals they hunted, how they erected a tent, their hierarchy, their relationship with the environment. I enjoy it all.So, even though the plot was absent, the author does an amazing job of transporting me into the world that she creates. And even if that world simply contains the boring activity of day to day life, I read it with pleasure because of the colorful fantastic nature.In fairness to the other reviewers, let me say that I started reading the series only a year ago and just finished the final page of the final book last night. So I didn't have to wait 13 years as other readers did.Therefore, if you love the world that Auel creates, you may hate the fact that she forgot a plot, but I think you will love the book."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"After reading some of the reviews here at Amazon.com I really wondered if I had made a mistake buying this book. But after speaking to my sister in law who incouraged me to read the book, I decided to go for it. I must admit I was absolutly hooked. I stayed up late a few nights because I wanted to find out what happened. I gave this book 5 stars.She has set up some great story lines for her next book, which I cannot wait to come out. I want to know what happens with the People of the Clan and of those with mixed blood. The guy that makes the barma, what is going to happen between him and Ayla.Is Ayla going to become a Zelondonia or is she going to be the first?To all of those people that gripped about the detail that Ms Auel went into that is what makes her books so intresting, if you had read any of her previous books you would have known that. Also, for her repeating herself - yes, she did repeat of few things and refreshed our memories on a few things. which I for one was glad of - I did not have time to go back and read the other four books. Ms Auel I take my hat off to you for a book that was well written and very entertaining."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I just finished the Shelters of Stone today. I have read several of the reader reviews. I get the impression that some of the people who have been reading this series are not as loyal as they thought they were or they would have been able to see what Mrs. Auel was doing with this last book. In the Plains of Passage we spent a year traveling with Jondalar and Ayla \\"hearing\\" about Jondalar's home and people. Now they finally reach their destination. In my opinion Mrs. Auel is trying to give the reader the same sort of detail explaining Jondalar's people and home that she had, in the previous books in the series, with other people and locations. I for one was very interested in all of the detail. I wanted to know all about Jondalar's people and home. I am very impressed that she has done enough research and made the effort to include enough detail that a reader could sit down with a map of the earth as it was at the time the series is set and figure out where the journey started, the approximate route that was taken and where the journey ended. I thoroughly enjoy the fact that the detail would allow me to draw a detailed map of all the locations they stopped. I have been very impressed with this series and with Mrs. Auel's writing. I eagerly await the next book!! Thank you Mrs. Auel for writing this series!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"It has taken entirely too long for this latest installment to arrive. Some fans of the series I know are dead! And they were young when the series started! This addition to the Earth's Children series is worthy of the history made by its predecessors. It stands as a wonderful addition.I get the feeling that the editor was asleep for this one. Ms. Auel is brilliant with her descriptions of life in prehistoric France, but the editor blew it. One gets the impression that the vignettes in the book may have been written in a different sequence and at significantly different times and then put together for the book. Were they written to stand alone or before the final chronology was determined? The editor should have cut some of the redundant detail. Perhaps, they paid her by the pound!?! The detail of life during the last ice age remains great. It is easy to see why awards have been heaped of Ms. Auel. The book is excellent!My major critisms...where is the major clan encounter? We follow Ayla and Jon for 8 months to the final birthing of their offspring and then jump to Whinney's new colt, but no clan contact...is this to be book 6? I hope I live that long! I hope Ms. Auel lives that long! Also, the protagonists invent all kinds of things in the earlier books, but stop inventing in this one...I expected that they would invent the bow and arrow this time and wait until the next book to get to metalurgy..."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I'll admit to being one of those fans that read the first four books in this series 15 times a piece! They were wonderful. But after waiting the twelve years it took Auel to write this fifth book, I was sorely disappointed.The style, the excitement and the herbalism i had grown to treasure in the other Ayla books were really lacking in this one. The rehashing of old stuff was over the top, and I think the editor didn't do such a great job of catching the repitition Auel insisted on writing. I guess it would have been helpful for someone who hadn't read the other books in the series, but even then, some of the repition was within this same story!Had i not known better, i would have believed this book written by a totally different person.On the flip side, if you are a die-hard fan such as myself, this book is a must. If only to offer us hope for the next one!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I read this within 24 hours of it coming out. I do suggest though that you do read at least one of the other books before diving straight into this one, not that it really matters, but it will draw out the enjoyment of this series if you are new to this series.Enjoyable, warm and wonderful read.I would love to see another book after this one with perhaps her becoming a zeleandia and also other members of the group slowing learning how to have wolfs and horses as pets etc. Also I could see the next book having trade negotiations with the Clan as well as perhaps a bit of trouble there too.Gosh I am a little annoyed I read the book so fast, I wish I still had some chapters left!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have read all of Auels Earth Childrens books except her fifth one. However, based on the reviews that have I read, I was not exactly dejected. Its just that I would have liked for Auel to write something about an encounter with Ayla's real mother or perhaps someone who knew her mom. It would have also been interesting if Ayla could once more see her son, Durc. I also think that she should make Ayla more human since, not this great heroine who knows about everything and who almost always does everything right. Perhaps Ayla should have some sort of rival, like someone quite similar and popular as her so that readers may find more suspense. Auel should have also added to her novel unexpected occurences and new things. I don't want for Ayla to always save her patients and invent the latest stuff. Why don't Auel just say Ayla is a goddess! Readers don't like to know what to expect throughout the whole story. We want to be surprised! I do recommend all of Auel's books. ..."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Wonderful series prior to this. Shelters of Stone, however, tarnishes Jean M. Auel's reputation. Quite frankly, I don't believe she wrote it herself."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This is the fifth book in the \\"Earth's Children\\" series of books by Jean Auel with the first two of these being the best by far i.e \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" and \\"Valley of Horses\\". It continues the story as Jondalar and Ayla decide to journey back to his home, a good year's trip away. Considering that it's a trip from what is now Russia to France its a considerable distance. Ayla is concerned his people will not take kindly to her but she quickly wins over some, especially Jondalar's sister, mother and the zelandonii who sees something special in her (no surprise there).The book is quite slow to get going and doesn't have the pace or fascination of the first two or the emotional depth of the \\"The Mammoth Hunters\\" or \\"Plains of Passage\\". It isn't bad however and the author does not appear to have run out of ideas like some do when it comes to a waning of the initial creative impulse so often seen in other series, e.g. Diana Gabaldon.The book does lack a bit of drive and joy though, some scenes are repetitive and without real passion and the people can sometimes seem one dimensional which they weren't in the earlier books. Nonetheless quite good."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"As a writer, I was blown away! Don't let the caveman stuff put you off. This is excellent, awesome reading. Auel is a masterful story-teller, first creating a world then unfolding a story that had me turning each page with wild anticipation. I don't want to spoil anything by giving it away, but trust me, this would be money well spent on some first rate thrilling reading! I suppose I'm biased since Baby is her pet lion and my name is Lions. It's awesome story-telling!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Jean Auel has done it again! This book is magnificent, and i have come to expect no less from this author."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I really enjoyed the other books. I too was looking forward to this one. But nothing ever happens. The descriptions are too long and the story is very redunant. I skippped over page after page until I finally decided to put it down."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Contrary to some Customer Reviews I have read, I found \\"Shelters\\" to be a most interesting addition to the Earth's Children Series. When Ayla, Jondalar, the horses and Wolf finally arrive after a year-long journey at the Cave of Jondalar's mother, Ayla is astonished to see that so many people live in such close proximity to each other. Unlike the Clans these folks seem to thrive living in large groups who are fairly close to their neighbors. And herein lies the account of how the early people found that there are many advantages to living in larger groups close by their families and friends. We see that their society is still controlled by Cave leaders, medicine people and healers, but they have much freedom in where and when they move about and what they do with their time.There is a fair amount of repetition in the narrative, especially in the formal introductions, but to me it in no way detracts from the overall experience. There are also a number of flashbacks and memory-recall scenes, which to some may seem excessive, but merely refresh recollections about major events which occurred in the previous books of the Series.This book focuses mainly on the differences and similarities of the Clan and the Cave dwellers. It shows how these ancient people dealt with the obstacles they were forced to overcome in their daily lives, and perhaps more importantly how they began to live in larger groups with an early form of government.The Shelters of Stone is as rich in detail as we expect from the author and she continues to provide a most fascinating glimpse into the distant past from whence we all came. I whole-heartedly recommend \\"Shelters\\" and all other books in this series. They provide an insight, although written as fiction, into how things may have been.But do yourself a big favor and read the five books in order, starting with \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear.\\" The entire Series is well worth your time."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Though each book in the Earth's Children series is special in its own way, this one is my favorite. Ayla has finally made it to her fiance's homeland and the resulting inter-personal intricacies are enthralling. From start-to-finish, Auel keeps readers on a spectacular journey. Her plot twists are not merely for momentary enjoyment; they are necessary for the continuous development of the characters and their relationships. Amidst this interplay, Auel intertwines rich period detail; it does seem, however, that, starting with Valley of the Horses, she acquired a tendency to let her plot get embedded in an overwhelming amount of technical information and, worse, pages and pages of tiresome sex scenes (how many times do we have to read about Ayla and Jondalar's \\"Pleasures\\"?!). But with a story this unique, imaginative and compelling, I'll take whatever I can."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I liked Clan of the Cave Bear but Auel gradually slipped more and more into cheap sex novels as she went along with the series. Shelters of Stone should be sold in porn shops."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"ENJOYED THIS BOOK AS WELL AS THE OTHER 4. lOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT ONE."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"5th in a series of early man. What is truly amazing is that this story is just as exciting & wonderful as the other four! For an author to maintain the reader's attention for such a lengthy novel has to be considered one of life's wonders. Will there be another in the series? If so, can't wait."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"When I read Plains of Passage I couldn't wait until the next installment of this intriguing series would be out. Almost 13 years later, I was excited when the announcement was made. At last, the adventures of Ayla and Jondalar would continue. Whinny, Racer and Wolf would be off with their human companions exploring and discovering yet more good \\"stuff\\". As I read through Shelters of Stone it became obvious to me that this book is much different than those that come before it. First the story stalls a bit because Jondalar and Ayla finally arrive home. There's no reason for them to camp out....experiencing tests and trials galore. They're home...safe among those that do love them and will love them. Second, a huge number of new characters had to be developmented...infact an intirely new civilization of separate caves had to be created.To the casual reader I guess these changes do cause the story to bog down. But there is still enough here to justify reading the book. Watching the adoption of new technologies by this group of people is interesting in itself as is the idea of people keeping and working with animals. I thought the idea of the Zelandoni (the healers) holding the fire starting technology to themselves to inhance their prestige and power an amazingly human touch provided by Auel. Of course they couldn't and didn't but it makes them the type of humans we can identify with.Auel develops new lore and traditions of the Zelandonii people from the very beginning of the first chapter. This is no easy task under any circumstances.I believe that those that read this book will not regret it when they've finished. I also believe that time and reflection may make those that do not like this book presently change their opinions.If you don't want to buy the book check it out from your public library...In either case you'll enjoy the read."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The detail, the panorama, and the story are wonderful. I had anticipated this book and the its release with joy after over a decade. I wasn't disappointed in the least. You'll love this book if you are a fan.I am now anticipating the 6th and final book in the series and wonder how long that one will take...."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The story of Ayla and Jondalar in this fifth book of the Earth's Children series, picks up where the previous left off: Ayla is pregnant with Jondalar's child and nervous to meet his family. As in the past, she impresses those around her in a short period of time through her strange accent, firestones, healing skills and her control over Whinney, Racer and Wolf.The book unfolds slowly, feeling at times more like a lecture in paleoanthropology (both in tone and detail) rather than telling the intriguing story of the girl of the Others who was raised by the Clan. Though fascinating in its own right, the data on the Ice Age and its people are overbearing. Judging by the number of people thanked in the foreword, Auel has obviously done her homework, but it felt like I was doing mine. The pace is such that even at hundreds of pages in, we have but begun to meet the Zelandonii.During the first half, the story is predictable and repetitive containing scenarios seen in previous books - even the love scenes lack the steam of earlier books. Ayla remains on centre stage and plays the role of saviour and role model for the weak and spiteful and, not to forget, spokesperson of the Clan. The Zelandonii, including Jondalar's old flame, seem unusually open and accepting of Ayla's background, unlike previous Others, and are (almost too) quick to adopt her. Ayla herself remains nervous of meeting new people - perhaps with good reason, as she also creates some enemies for herself.The second half delightfully picks up, and it is almost a sigh of relief to see the story begin to flow again. Auel demonstrates a talent for captivating Story-Telling as she paces through events that take place during the Summer Meeting and the following winter.There is a certain maturity in the writing that didn't seem apparent before. Auel takes us through a more comprehensive understanding of the spiritual beliefs of the Zelandonii (though I'm not convinced that she needed to repeat the Mother's Song so often). Spirituality also becomes more pertinent for Ayla, as can be expected, and Zelandoni needs to convince her to put aside her fears of the spirit world. Ayla has tremendous potential to influence the community, but will it be as the zelandonia see fit?Three stars since Auel shows her true talent in the latter part of the book, and for sheer determination to see the project through. I will certainly be reading Book 6 - I couldn't leave my favourite heroine hanging now, could I?"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"After eagerly awaiting the 5th book for over 10 years I find myself disappointed in it. It was very slow going at the beginning and introduced too many new characters who didn't seem to have a whole lot to do with anything. Brukeval and Laramar could have been made into better antagonists but were left kind of hanging. Don't get me wrong...I loved her first three books and the fourth was alright but I guess I expected more out of the fifth book because it took so long to be finished. Hopefully the 6th book won't take as long and will be better than the 5th."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Better then the fourth book, answered questions that I had about certain characters.

It's pretty tired looking so if I decide to keep the series I'll probably get a different one."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The saga continues and Auel is at her best. The historical tale continues. The Clan of the Cave Bear etc, etc was enjoyable and Auel&#8217;s ability to create intrigue is undiminished.The cave dwellings in France are detailed so that those who have never been there understand them as if you were a park ranger there. Excellent narrative descriptions of the caves, how they lay, and the directions they face and how they were used. This part is as good as can be written and a first class job was done on this material.I was hoping that Ayla would finally catch a break and be able to enjoy life but petty back scratching women interfered again. The intrigue seems to be less skillfully done than in the other novels but this is an enjoyable read. If this is Auel&#8217;s worst novel it would still be world class by other authors. I highly recommend this book to everybody."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"If you have not read her previous books then you know what has happened but if you have read the other books in the series then there is a lot of previous history . A good book altogether"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Tedious in some areas and almost like a history book! I think the author spent way too much time researching the surrounding area, plants and animals when they were already mentioned in the previous books. Also too much reviewing of what happened in the other books. If you read this one, there's no need to read the others before this and way too long. Seems like the author sticks in the sexual scenes in odd places like the publishers told her to in order to sell books!

Not necessary for the reader to understand story."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"There are changes to the audio version of this fifth book from the first 4 books that left me wondering, \\"Whose idea was this anyway?\\" Sandra Burr continues to read for the series and does an outstanding job but whose idea was it to suddenly make Ayla sound like a cross between Bullwinkle's Natasha and Zaza Gabor? It's very distracting and her Clan accent is MUCH better left to the imagination as in the first 4 books. Plus she doesn't sound like the Ayla we all know and love, but some stranger. Also the cool tribal music signaling the beginning and end of each disc became some generic elevator music sans even a nod to anthropology. May even deserve 3 stars but still glad to have yet another book connected to the great CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR (has it really been thirty+ years?) Still worth a read or listen despite these annoying changes and I have hopes there will be a seventh in which Ayla comes full circle and discovers her roots."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This book took a long time to arrive from the supplier and was not as shown - in fact I had time to read the last book in this series (1248 pages - large print) before I got a chance to read this one - and they were ordered at the same time. It was a much smaller novel and the print was smaller than I had expected that I would receive. The condition of the book was not bad but there were a lot of folded pages on the inside. I don't dispute that the price was a great deal but I do wish that the supplier had said more about the condition of the book before I purchased it."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I am reading the last 2 books of this series.

I was thrilled to get it and complete my collection. Thanks to Amazon, it was quick and easy."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Contrary to what many others have said in their reviews, I found this book to be just magnificent reading, and very interesting. Love the prehistoric background and the people that Jean M. Auel has contrived. Just like modern days!!! I look at my wonderful appliances that wash the dishes, the clothes, and cook the dinners with a flick of a switch somewhere -- and marvel at how the prehistoric people managed. Such hard work!! But who knew? Anyway, I highly recommend this very long and descriptive book about Ayla and Jondular and their family life among many different tribes. I hope the author will continue the series with Ayla's daughter growing up. Ms. Auel does fabulous research and makes you want to go visit the area that these books in her series take place. She definitely can write beautiful descriptions. I recommend this book for great reading and historical significance, 'cause this all really did take place numero thousands of years ago. The paperback book is heavy and hard to hold if you have any arthritis in your hands, though. Don't know how that could be helped, as it is a very long book. Buy it!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I just re read Shelters of Stone for the second time and enjoyed it just as much and probably more .It refreshed my memories of the others in the series of Earth's Children books written by Jean M. Auel. I am anxioously awaiting the release of her next book which will be coming out very soon.Her books are so well written, one can feel the extent of her research."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have been an avid fan of the Earth's Children series since the beginning with Clan of the Cave Bear and eagerly (not to mention inpatiently) waited twelve years for this supposedly final installment. Sadly, I was left disappointed with the literary quality of the book, and unsatisfied with the ending. The first three books in the series were engaging and the plots tended to move right along despite the detailed descriptions of the environment and the herbal lore. The next two were somewhat weaker in overall plot and character development and had (even by my liberal standards) an excessive amount of gratuitious graphic sex that seemed to be filler for sheer titilation. This installment, though I wanted to love it, plods along for most of the book, and has shallow cardboard cutout characters thrown in rather than developing them into the full, vibrant characters they could have been. Jonayla (an irritating combination namje, by the way Ms. Auel) spends the first third of the book as nothing more than a prop. Ayla loves the baby, breast feeds the baby, holds the baby in the air naked to pee, Jondalar babysits, rinse, repeat. Suddenly Jonayla is five. What happened in the intervening years?Ayla's training, though obviously speculatory, had the potential to be fascinating, but came across in large part as a never ending description of cave art, sometimes even describing the same cave more than once. I love cave art, but the written word can't do it justice and the descriptions rapidly became boring and repetitive. Don't even get me started on the Song of the Mother. Include it one, perhaps twice, but don't subject us to it ad nauseum. I found myself skipping right on past it every time I saw it, muttering unkind thoughts about its presence yet AGAIN in the story. The overall impression was that it was mindless filler, and I expect far more than that from a book I've waited over a decade for. I appreciate detailed instructions on making shelters or on the medical applications of the herbs Ayla uses, but far too much of the book was page filling repetitive fluff that served no real purpose. Honestly, the book could have been cut by half and greatly improved for the heavy handed editing.The final section of the book is where much of the actual plot develops, but some things I had hoped for never materialized. Where is the reunion or even passing encounter with the Clan? Can't we get a glimpse into Durc's life as an adult, even if only in a drug induced dream? What is the Clan's reaction to the new learnt signing abilities Ayla had taught her many acquaintances along her travels? The ending of the book falls rather flat, but does leave the door open for yet another book. With any luck Ms. Auel will actually address some of these missed plotportunities...I just hope we don't have to wait another twelve years since Jean is now 74! I'm sure she's got the research done, now she needs a capable ghost writer and a strict editor with a mighty red pen."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I agree with the other reviewers when they said it was rather boring at times when there was way too much repeated info---and the songs were a bit much for me---I think the lyrics could have been edited a bit without changing the meaning---after all, it is only fiction. It has been quite awhile since I read the last book in the series so some of the info was helpful to bring me up to speed and I think for anyone who has read the other books should read this one as well----but I didn't enjoy it as well as the books that came before this one."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Have enjoyed ALL 5 books by Jean Auel with Clan of the Cave Bear being the slowest read, but glad later that I finished the 1st of five.

Hopefully this is not a trend.My complaint really is the Optical Character Reader Translation to create the Kindle edition and or the human editting done after the translation. This was horrible as there are many words misspelled and blatantly these are reader errors.

I thought my remembrances of long rambling sentences and overdone passages might have been wrong, but if anything, it is worse than i recalled.

We already knew how the animals would be received and how the new discoveries would be revealed. The book only got interesting near the end, otherwise it was an endless littany of formal introductions, review of the previous 4 books and many many many detailed descriptions of the landscape and geography (yawn).This is an ok read for an Auel fan.

I'm sorry to report that Shelters of Stone was anticlimactic and a disappointment.The main characters that I have come to know and love have been reduced to mere cardboard cutouts. The endless descriptions of the Zelondoni locale are mind-numbing and the constant repetition of introductions and past history are boring in the extreme. I began skipping most of this unnecessary narrative before I was even half through reading the book.I had the book on backorder with Amazon for months and couldn't wait to find about about Ayla's and Jondalar's matrimonial and the birth of their child. These two significant events were treated by the author in a casual and offhand manner as compared to the endless descriptions of the Zelandoni landscape. It was very depressing.If you are a real fan, you will want to read this book. Don't invest in the hardcover...wait until it comes out in paperback. That way you won't feel as disappointed by your investment."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I eagerly waited for Ms. Auel's fifth installment in the series and went out and bought the book pretty much immediately after it was out. I have a mixed opinions about the book. On the one hand, Jean Auel's characters are still very likeable, and it is great to finally meet the Zeladonii, who did not disappoint. On the other hand, I feel that Ms. Auel's has overused the same theme for the past four novels. Ayla meets new people; most like her; some don't; then something miraculous happens to convert those people, etc. This is now getting a little tedious.

There's no plot; no tension; no suspense. Much of it is actually a clip show, with Ayla and Jondalar endlessly rehashing their past adventures and inventions. Nothing of note happens. A & J return to the Zelandonii, mate, and have a kid. There are hints of conflict with the Clan but nothing happens. The characters are plastic, too-perfect people and the writing is slow, static and rife with both authorial intrusion and needless info-dumps.Pages of truly bad rhyming religious doggerel -- which are, along with much else in the book, repeated several times -- add a touch of ludicrous awfulness.It's boring.

I kept wondering where everything was going, only to realize I was at the end of the book! The only plus is that using the Earth's Children series as soft-core porn seems to be an idea that has been given up in this book. I read it because I HAVE to, in the hope that she may again wow me. And, of course, I'll read the next one, as will everyone else, so perhaps writing something actually enjoyable won't matter anyway as far as the profit margin goes. Yes, I'm a sucker.

The animal friends are still there, wowing the prehistoric residents of France.

If you have forgotten the last books, never fear, every past event and vignette is told (and retold) often. This book has something for everyone but is based on the drama of prehistoric humans trying to eke out a living by merely hunting and gathering. Interspersed with this are lectures/discussions on society, early cooking methods, herbology, abortion(!), mythology, racism, more racism, mating rituals, mysticism and anthropology. Every few pages there are also endless introductions as Ayla meets the Zelandonii. And, of course, just when the reader is about to be lost from the umpteenth repetition of the phrase, \\"Ninth cave of the Zelandonii\\", Ayla and Jondalar escape the crowds of Zelandonii, go off on their own, and engage in the steamy romance that has made them famous, and made these books unsuitable for children.The actual plot does not progress much other than Ayla trying to settle into Zelandonii society, mating with Jondalar, and having her baby, Jonayla."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The Shelters of Stone: Earth's ChildrenTo say that I was appalled by the bad reviews of this book would be an understatement. I read several of the \\"bad\\" reviews after reading the book a couple of times AND listened to it on audio. Perhaps I read a different book than did some of the reviewers. I read \\"The Shelters of Stone\\" by Jean Auel and loved it. It carried the same flavor and style of the first four books of the series and I am anxiously waiting for the next book.Perhaps what some whiney people didn't figure out was that Ayla and Jondular have finished their year long journey and are now settling in to his home and her new home. They get married and start a family. They deal with ignorance and bigotry. They teach new ideas. They become constructive members of their community. (unlike some of the reviewers)One reviewer claimed to have skipped parts and skimmed other parts ... actually admitting to not having read the entire book ... and still had the nerve to say it was bad. Another reviewer said Auel wasn't good at writing... and another said Auel didn't even write the book... and on and on and on...To the people who spent paragraphs complaining and whining about how bad they thought the book was, listen up... Where I come from, we have a saying .... \\"put up or shut up\\". In other words, do it better (if you think you can) or quit complaining.People, give it a rest! The book was fun. I laughed at times. I cried at times. I was entertained. Jean Auel did her job. I am patiently waiting (with more manners than some reviewers) for book 6."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"What is she doing to this series? Clan of the Cave Bear was magnificent. Valley of the horses was interesting. Mammoth Hunters was tantalizing. Plains of passage was barely entertaining. This book is even less entertaining. She doesn't answer questions. What happened to Durc? Surely there is a lot more to his story and the flatheads then this. Surely, there has to be more going with the original clan. I mean, where is the story? She just rehashes everything again and again and it takes pages and pages and pages to get any plot. She is slow writer and I can't believe I waited this long for this thing. I feel like a flathead for actually reading this thing."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I really enjoyed reading all of the preceeding books in the Earth's Children series. So when I saw this book at my public library, I checked it out immediately. Unfortunately, this book is not the same as the quality of the series I remember.Throughout the book there are many details about prehistoric lifestyle and environment. I appreciate the amount of research that went into creating an accurate depiction of the time. However, it slows the pace of the book down to a crawl. Long narratives that are unimportant to the plot occur every 5 to 10 pages. Some explanations are described over and over again. The book is filled with repetitive text on medicines, hunting technology, and lengthy formal introductions of the umpteen unimportant characters in the story. I dislike having my \\"hand held\\" while reading a story, and too much is explained and not enough is left to the reader's imagination and intelligence.Only a few new major characters are introduced in this book, and not enough time is spent fleshing them out and exploring their relationships with each other. Only a few minor events occur in the lives of Ayla and Jondalar, the main characters in the book.The character of Ayla does not seem as believeable as she once was. She is tall, blonde, beautiful, has super-human hearing and sight and she is stronger than most men. She knows more than the tribal elders, and has invented fire, animal taming, and new medicines. Jondalar is tall, blond, handsome, and strong. He's smart and caring, he's invented the spear thrower and has a big ---- to boot. Come on! Stop pulling our legs!Their trials and tribulations now are nothing compared to the physical and mental abuse they had to endure when they were young. Ayla was very believeable and evoked much sympathy when she was first introduced in Clan of the Cave Bear. Now, she is like the Queen of the Senior Prom and she must put up with some teasing from her less popular classmates.If you liked the previous books in the series for their prolific and superfluous erotic scenes, you will also be disappointed. Perhaps it is because I have aged 10+ years since I last read the books, but these scenes seemed to be only roughly sketched out and hastily tacked on to oblige the readers who appreciate these scenes.My advice is to read only the first 3 books and stop. Get the Cliff's Notes for the other two books. You won't miss much."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This was a definate disappointment from such a talented author. What it basically came down to was a review of the first 4 books. I agree with the others when they say it could have been a 100 page book.I was absolutely delighted when this latest book was finally published. But it soon wore off. After such a wait...maybe my expectations were too high. While Mrs. Auel lives up to the descriptive history she is known for, and I love, there really is not much of a new plot, new character development, nor any great conflict. Instead most of the book was taken up with lengthy introductions between Ayla and the Zelandonii, and the many times she showed them how to make fire - each time with a drawn out description.All that said, if you are planning on reading the 6th book, you should still give it a read.I truly hope that Auel revives her tremendous gift for story-telling, that made the first 4 books utterly captivating, in the 6th book. And that we do not have to wait as long as we did for Shelters of Stone."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The Auel series has its up and downs. I do like this book because I think Ms.Auel has talent and after reading it, I went back to the begining to re-read the whole series. I think this book is great if you want to know what happens when Ayla meets Jondalar's family and tribe. I also agree that Ayla is a superwoman (no one in fiction or non-fiction could be this wonderful). I would like to see Ayla have a strong female rival in the last book. I also think Ms.Auel needs to learn that basic rule of writing \\"show don't tell...\\" I am sick of hearing about \\"vivid blue eyes.\\" Also the sex scenes, I just skip them now. I don't think they need to be there in \\"vivid detail.\\""},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz... Snort! Oh, excuse me, I must have fallen asleep over my copy of Shelters of Stone again.I felt almost obligated to read this book in spite of the bad press it's received because I read each of the four previous novels in this series. I didn't like Plains of Passage very much, but had high hopes that Shelters of Stone would recapture something of the feel of the first three books. Alas, Auel has presented us with a tedious doorstop of a book that in the end left me wondering why I bothered to work my way through the whole thing. The plot goes nowhere, there is little character development, and there is so much repetition of material that I found myself skimming pages more and more frequently as I progressed through the book. The whole thing is so badly edited and the conclusion is so abrupt that I was left with the impression that Auel walked away from her computer to get a cup of coffee and while she was gone someone transmitted the unpolished novel to the publisher without her knowledge.And the Mother's Song... Oh, God, the Mother's Song. What can I say that other reviewers haven't already said? It's one of the most outstanding terrible poems I've ever read, rivaling some of the stuff in \\"Very Bad Poetry\\" (edited by Ross and Kathryn Petras). Never mind the fact that it's repeated several times. One reading was more than enough to convince me that this is one of the worst poems ever written in the English language. It should be awarded prizes based on its sheer awfulness and the way it makes your hair stand on end when you read it.To be fair, I have to say that Shelters of Stone isn't ALL bad. I enjoy books that focus on social history, fiction or otherwise, so the descriptive passages about housing, hunting, and ritual that annoyed so many other reviewers were often interesting to me.In addition, I was happy to find that Ayla and/or Jondalar didn't invent the wheel, at least not yet. I've almost been expecting this to happen and was delighted to be disappointed in this respect.In short, there is very little new information in this book. Auel takes 700+ pages to tell us that Ayla and Jondalar are mated, that their daughter is born, and that Ayla has decided to become One Who Serves. Sorry, Amazon, but I can't recommend that people purchase this one. If you're devoted to the series and feel that you must read it, check it out at your friendly neighborhood library and save yourself the purchase price."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The only way I was able to finish this book was by skipping huge chunks of it. This series (Earth's Children), which began with such promise, has become completely lame. Jean Auel should put Ayla and Co. out of their misery if she can't think of some new story lines. If you must read this, get it from the library. Jean Auel doesn't deserve any of your hard earned money for this turkey."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I always like the Earth's Children series and I eagerly awaited the release of the 5th book. I was greatly disappointed with it. I found it very dragging, repetitive and had no definite plot going on. It was very long but it had no actual substance. It's suppose to be the 2nd to the last of the series...it left me bored to tears. I do hope the 6th and final book would have an exciting conclusion."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"A bad book made worse by the fact it took twelve years to write. I really cannot add anything else that has not already been said. Ayla is the source of all technology, she discovers/invents every tool that ever existed. She is perfect in every way, shape and form. Far from making mistakes as she did in Clan of the Cave Bear, she executes every form of etiquette perfectly, no matter how new or strange it is to her.The book is poorly written, with cardboard characters that have no believablity. It's poorly edited, with massive amounts of repetition and run-on sentences. Entire sections of the book can be skipped with no loss to the story. Auel never seemed to catch on to the idea that a book can be short, and still be good.I won't go on any longer, because everything that needs to be said has been said in the spotlight reviews."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have read the previous books and thought they were great (though earlier works were better than some of the later ones). This one was horrible. No plot but lots of repetition. Did she just discover the copy and paste function on her word procesor? This book did nothing more than rehash the story line of every previous book. The lack of a good plot was frustrating. Jean started out several good twists but did nothing with them. Characters that could have caused some interesting friction just melted away into nothing. I like a happy ending as much as anybody but it would be nice if there were some twists and turns to the story line and the possiblity that all may not turn out rosy. In the end I felt that this book was something Jean just pushed out to leverage off of the popularity of previous books - a way to get some fast cash. I won't waste another dime on this author. If she can't spare the time and dedication to her readers to release a polished work of fiction then I can't spare my time or money for it either."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"OK, first off, I enjoyed Shelters of Stone. I waited 12 years for it and was not disappointed. While it was NOT one of her best works, Ms. Auel wrote a very entertaining book that answered many questions and tied up a few loose ends left by her previous novels. I understand the need to repeat much of the content from the previous novels - as she has a new audience, some of whom had never read any of the prtevious books - so this one had to be able to stand alone while at the same time be able to entertain those of us who had been left for 12 years without answers to what would happen to Ayla when she came to her new \\"family\\".On the negative side - the Mother's Song - while the poem loosly fit iambic pentameter in meter and style, it was so poorly composed that I found that it distracted from the actual meaning of the poem itself. Additionally, it could have easily been reduced to 4 stanzas and still have just as meaningful. Additionally, to repeat the poem in its entirity 3 times throughout the novel was extremely irksome. Beyond that she felt the need to explain the meaning of the minute details of the poem to the point that I felt insulted. The poem was in English. I speak and understand English. The relevence of the poem was totally clear to me the first time I read it. Auel did not have to explain it to me.I am most definitely looking forward to the next book in the series in which Ayla \\"comes into her own\\". Hopefulls , Ms. Auel won't bore or insult us again with her poor excuse for poetry."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I too eagerly awaited Shelters of the Stone, as I had so enjoyed the first books in the series. I too am very let down by the lack of spirit and repetitious passages of this book. I was recently disappointed by Diana Gabaldon's latest novel The Fiery Cross, after rating her series one of my all time favorites. Maybe I expected too much of these last novels since they were so long in coming, but I am not waiting with eager anticipation for any follow up books. However, I will probably read them only because of my long-time loyalty to the series."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"As soon as I heard this book was coming out, I placed the date on my calendar so that I could buy it immediately upon release. I had read the other four books, and was hooked after reading Clan of the Cave Bears. By far, the first book was the best, and I really was rooting for the character, Ayla. I read the other three books, and my interest waned a bit with each, but in general I was still enamored with the series. However, Shelters of Stone was not the book I was expecting. I must agree with many of the other reviewers who were tired of the repetition that Auel used, and I found myself skipping over large repetitive sections of the book. In addition, as usual from books 2-4, I continued skipping over the romance novel love scenes of Ayla and Jondalar. Enough about his large \\"manhood.\\" I feel that these romance novel interludes were added to books 2-5 to attract a larger reading audience, which is a real shame because the first book, Clan of the Cave Bear, did not have these scenes and is by far the best. However, I digress. The main thing I did not like about Shelters of Stone was that throughout the series we have followed almost every single day of Ayla's life, starting at age 5, or so it seems. However, when it comes to her pregnancy, which was built up to the be the climax of the storyline about her use of contraception/Jondalar's desire to have a child of his hearth, Ms. Auel almost skips it entirely. Instead, it was like a fast forwarded version of a pregnancy. I must say though, that although I was disappointed by the book, it was readable and I have read it once again since my initial read. Also, I will tune in for the sixth installment, just to see how it ends. I guess after you invest that much time into something, reading 5 books, you just need to know the ending, even if it appears it may be anticlimatic. My suggestion is to read this book if you have read the other four, and really need to know what happens to the characters. However, if you are not emotionally invested in the characters it will probably not be worth your time."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I would like to give this book three and a half stars: three is not quite enough, four is a bit too much.The book is badly in need of editing. There are extraneous and redundant sentences thoughout. The first 200 pages or so are both repetitive and badly written. 100 pages could have easily been cut out of the beginning, and it would have been a vastly better book.Nonetheless, the second half of the book partially redeems the very poor beginning. Auel returns to the highly descriptive, beautifully imagined, and evocative prose of her previous books. The repetitions are both fewer and more relevant to the story line. Although not as exciting as her other books, I think that this is in the nature of a book describing Ayla's more domesticated life with Jondalar's people.The ambiguity of the ending retains the suspense of the series going into book 6, but perhaps is a bit too cute by half. Nonetheless, this is not what impinges on the overall quality of this book. Alas, the editing process (or more accurately, lack therof), particularly at the beginning, was such that this book is not at a par with Auel's other novels."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I can summarize this book in 3 words --- \\"Here, meet Wolf\\".Over 700 pages of repetition. No plot development. No climax (much less an anti-climax). It basically details all the relationships at the \\"shelters of stone\\".Ms. Auel had already begun to repeat herself (in full detail) quite a lot in the 4th book of the series. In this 5th and disappointing addition to the series, she was apparently given editorial rights to this book. Big Mistake. Someone needed to take scissors (not just a blue pencil) to the manuscript."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I plodded through this excessively repetitive tome, reading over and over about the same things, and wondered how the editor(s)and publisher of this book could have let the author get away with such undisciplined text. Or was it the long-awaited windfall profits from anticipated sales to fans that motivated them. Of course, the author is primarily responsible for this endlessly pedantic prehistory, which does not even do justice to the cave paintings or their artists. This is a sad way to reintroduce oneself after 12 years, practically a generation having passed in the meanwhile. If another twelve years pass before the final book is available, I doubt if anyone will stick around to read it. I read some fan literature that extrapolated this book's plot and found it much more entertaining and was sad to find that the author-fans stopped in mid story. I think they could have written the whole book and it would have been grand. If these authors are still around, I would encourage them to post the rest of their work. We can all enjoy their creation, in the same way that other fans have rewritten Star Wars Episode One to edit out the drivel Lucas put in. Maybe it will also give Auel some inspiration, which she sorely must need to have taken so long to produce so little. Remember, Jean: Bigger is not necessarily better."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Was she paid by the word? If so, she earned her money. Every sentence in this looong, slow and dreary novel was repeated, rehashed, resaid and reiterated numerous times. The book could (and should) have been a quarter of the length it is. The dialogue is unbelieveable at best, the psychological insights hilariously anachronistic. The only genuine feeling is when cave drawings are described. The sex scenes obligatory every 75 pages are a howl and the fashions are to die for. Read it if you must, but Jean Auel has lost the touch and produced a really bad, padded monstrosity of a wooly mannoth."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Ugh...how much can one read about the landscape...the rocks...the rivers??? and Ayla & Jondalar having sex?? I skipped through most of the book and was still bored.

Reading it took longer than usual, and I even skipped large sections that rambled on with scenic description, or dull rituals. The endless, repetitive introductions, along with showing people how to use the fire stones, over and over, bored me to death. I hope the final book is better! I think Jean Auel took too long a break from writing."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"So disappointing. The plot drags, and the characters are uni-dimensional and not rounded out like her other books. Also, the plot conflicts are trite and stereotypical. I'm glad I took it out of the library. I own all the other books by Auel and have re-read them several times, but am not planning to buy this one, or read the next one (unless the reviews are phenomenal).In case I was remembering with rose-colored glasses, I chose to re-read Clan of the Cave Bear (the best in the series). The characters were well rounded with clear understandable motivations that led to how they acted. Iza, Creb, Brun, Broud, along with Ayla \\"the outsider\\". Even the secondary characters were rounded out: ie Uba. Then, I re-read Valley of the Horses--interesting in that we learn more about the culture of the Others through Jondalar & Thonolan, and how Ayla survives being alone. And of course, the development of Ayla & Jondalar's relationship. I re-read Mammoth Hunters, and thought it was okay. I actually liked Plains of Passage, but didn't re-read it because I can't find my copy.I am a neophyte about the historical period the series takes place. I'll have to defer to the experts about whether Auel's research is accurate. But, the principle parts of a novel should be plot and characters. These elements are sorely missing in The Shelters of Stone."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I mean honestly, who here actually read word per word the numerous pages filled with chants/prayers and song lyrics? I'd turn the page to skip ahead and lo and behold - - more lyrics! eeks! I'd turn the page again and goodgollymissmolly! More lyrics! Over six pages of funeral song lyrics. Gee, how captivating. And what's with that long poem at the end of the book? What? Is Miss Auel trying to be hip? Hoping to score an MTV spot? Is she going to change her name to MC Auel? I've followed the entire series all these years. The endless sea of boring and needless details from this book has now confirmed this is the last book I'll read by Auel and whoever else attempted to help her write this snore of a story."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The author has really lost it with this book. It's 720 pages long but for its content it could be 80. Nothing happens. Auel repeats over and over and over again certain phrases that will drive a reader crazy. If I hear, \\"The one who is first among those who serve the mother\\", one more time, I'll go crazy!Apparently, Auel has intimidated all editors. This book clearly didn't have one. Not only is the book over-written for so little content, it is poorly written. People are constantly \\"smiling broadly\\" at each other. Jean - can't you think of another phrase?I feel used. In reality, Jean wrote one great book (the first) and three so-so books after that. Then, she sucks the life out of her readers for a few bucks with this latest effort. There is no way in the world that she doesn't know how bad this book is. If she were an unknown author trying to get this published she would be laughed out of the building.The kicker is the lame, lame, lame name that Jean chooses for a particular new character. It's just about the worst cop-out I've ever heard and it reeks of laziness, or it reeks of over-cuteness, choose your poison. What a dreadful end to a dreadful book."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Not only does absolutely nothing happen in this book, but it is so poorly presented that you really don't want to spend too much time reading this. Skip the long paragraphs, skim through the vast majority of the dialogue, forget about the poem, and wait for book #6.

Slow, painfully repetitive, and WAY too long for very little plot development. I made myself finish it (skimming the last half) just because I wanted to know \\"what happened\\" - in case there's a next book. Not sure I'll even read any next book at this point unless the author and editor make a concerted effort to trim. Also not sure why author has to make Ayla the inventor of all human advancements - first to tame a horse, first to use a spear thrower, first to use a sewing needle, etc. Talk about a Renaissance woman! Makes the character that much more unbelievable!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I've never felt compelled to write a review here before but I feel I must for Shelters of Stone - if only to save someone from spending their hard-earned cash. I've read the previous 4 books in the series and enjoyed them in spite of the (sometimes interesting and sometimes tedious) attention to detail. I don't even know if I'll spend the time finishing this book. There are too many other good books out there to be wasting my time on this one. I'm half way through and nothing has happened, and, from other readers' reviews, I don't think much is going to. I don't know how many more descriptions of river banks, rock outcroppings and caves I can stand.My disappointent lies less with Ms. Auel than with the editor and publisher. An author is human and can sometimes deliver and sometimes not - who knows what's been going on her life in the past 10 years - but shame on the publisher for allowing this to go to print when such devoted fans are obviously anxiously waiting for its arrival! Life is too short to waste time, and money, on boring and tedious literature like this. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone, although I would happily recommend any of the previous books in the series."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"It took me two goes to read this 5th installment to this series and I found it satisfactory. (Just)Jean Auel has obviously gone to extraordinary lengths in her research for this on going saga and her writing is quite exceptional.It starts off at the end of 'Plains' with the introduction of Ayla into the Zeladonii settlement that's followed by the usual Oohs and Ahhs resulting from her beauty and her unusual qualities of living and survival and her way with animals.The Zelandonii settlements are well described and you meet new and occassionally interesting charaters.My main beef with this book is the fact that nothing very much happens.You get a retelling of many references of previous adventures, there's some hunting, a death, a couple of birth's (human and animal) A big deal of a funeral, lots of discussion about he relationships between 'Flatheads' and the 'People', and the odd verbal conflict between halfcasts and ex-girlfriends. A bit of talk about whether men's spiritaul essense of physical essense is responsible for the bringing forth of new life.etc etc oh, and a summer meeting of all the Zelandonii caves.A lot of this has been done before and I found the story very repititous.The ever on going love story between Ayle and Jondalar was a little flat this time around, and the explicit sex scenes were a rip complete off from other books in the series. It wasn't so much the sex among the caveman epic like in previouys volumes.This book should have been more of an addendum to the \\"Plains of Passage\\" than a direct sequel, and it could easily have been a couple of hundred pages shorter.Another thing, this book did not take 12 YEARS TO WRITE!!!! Regardless of whatever rumour you wish to believe, I personally believe that this book has been waiting in the wings for years for some unknown reason and I personally wont wait another 12 years for the next installment.To put this in perspective, 'The Mammoth Hunters' and 'The Plains of Passage' are definitely the crowning achievement in this saga, while the first 2 books are a great intro. 'The Shelters of Stone', while worthy enough for the 'Earth's Children's' junkies, this series need a definitive ending in the next installment(s). A reunion with Durc or with Ayla'a lost family would be a fitting closure. Or Ayla could be just killed off. Either one would suffice for me."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I started reading the Earth'c Childrens series almost 20 years ago, and have eagerly waited each book as they were published. I would have to agree with the previous reviewers that this book was disappointing. Of the entire series, this one is the worst. Contrary to assertions that this book can be read as a stand alone book from the series, it cannot -- is is far to dry and complicated for anyone but an utmost Auel fan to get through.It had been speculated that this book would tie up loose ends and take the protagonist, Ayla, back to the home of her spouse. That homecoming was dreaded by both parties, as his people had little tolerance for the poeple whom Ayla called family. That said, after waiting for years for this book to come out, the experience was completely anticlimatic. Ayla & Jondalar travel across prehistoric europe to his home in France, and lo-and-behold, there is no traumatic reunion, there are no big conflicts, just a lot of writing about nothing, and dozens of little side stories on characters that do nothing to further the plot. I am prone to believe that Auel did not even write this book. There are several inconsistancies, including spellings of names and tribes. It appeared that the person who wrote this book, was not overly familiar with the other books in the series, as there is a definate break in the continuim of the story. I can only hope that the last book in the series comes out in a reasonable amount of time, and that it is written better than this one."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Anticipation grows like an ice-pack. After a few months you have a bleak winter. A few years of waiting produces a glacier.After enduring the 12-year Ice Age of waiting...my anticipation for Jean Auel's 5th book had long ago been pressed and ground down into a small hard diamond of hope that what was eventually released would be well worth the wait.When Shelters of Stone finally debued, I reserved a copy at the local bookstore, raced down there the day it was released, and as eagerly as a 12-year-old devours Harry Potter, started leafing through the pages.I have not felt this let down by anything connected to Auel since that sad mockery Hollywood made of \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\".The fifth book did not begin to approach the brilliance of the first one - it couldn't hold a flame to the second or third, and I'm afraid it didn't even measure up to the fourth.While Shelters of Stone does approach the high standard of anthropological research established by Auel in the Earth's Children Series - there is little else to distinguish this two-pound tome.Ayla and Jondalar have become flawless and godlike - they continually astound the Zelandonii with their discoveries and innovations, but they lack the little character flaws that made them believable before.Though the book is frought with the usual jealousy Ayla seems to arouse in those who are intimidated by her obvious superiority, drama is sparse in this book. There are few interesting subplots other than a humorous high-school stunt concocted by Jondalar's former lover.The book is comprised largely of flashbacks to prior books and repetition, repetition, repetition ad infanitum. How many ways can Jondalar and Ayla make love? How many times can we endure Ayla's introduction? How many more friends and family members are we going to have to meet?There are a few hints of what is to come - and I can only hope that some of Auel's singular brilliance and originality shine through again.I don't think I can survive another Ice Age unless there's a fire at the end."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Please don't get me wrong: I am a big fan of the Earth's Children series and was looking forward to reading the latest novel - especially after having waited 12 YEARS!But this one really was an insult especially to the fan but also to any other reader.This is the most audacious attempt at using your devoted audience as a cash-cow ... that I've ever come across.The argument, that the book had to be released to a completely different audience is not true!! I mean, if something is even trade-marked as \\"Earth Childrens series\\" ... I don't know a different definition of a \\"series\\" but that every sequel is a follow up and that a little bit of pre-knowledge is simply expected!! In that case you can't fill 3/4 of a sequel with neverending repetiton!It's too bad the marketing department of her publisher had the biggest influence on this book:- ideas that would have been just right for a gripping sequel to the other 4 books obviously had to be spread out in order to allow for a 6th (which is surely) to follow up ...- thus there appeared to be no major plot developed in this book- the repition just drives one crazy!- of the 870 some pages approximately 1/3 to 1/4 is worth ones while the rest is absoutely boring and in stark contrast to the previous novelsWell, I hope we won't have to wait too long for the 6th book and I also hope that as a compensation it'll live up to the 4 other books!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Jean Auel's \\"Earth's Children\\" series would have been limited to a single novel had \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" been written in the same tedious fashion. Ms. Auel's eagerly awaited fifth novel of the series, \\"The Shelters of Stone\\" is a study in excrutiating, minutiae. The reader makes progress across this vast and wonderous landscape with a magnifying glass, never seeing anything beyond the short focus of the lens. I confess to quitting the book after 260 odd pages. Ms. Auel is, in my opioion, an incredibly talented author, otherwise, I would have quit 100 pages sooner. Perhaps this was a 100 page novel that was filled with an additional 600 pages of very finely crafted descriptive verbage. I guess I'll never know."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have been a fan of this series since Cave Bear was first published. My favorite book was Valley of Horses. When I heard Shelters was on the shelves, I ran straight out and bought it and was planning on devouring it that night.That was on the day it first hit the shelves and I just got through reading it. It was like walking up a sand dune with a 50lb pack on my back. I had to make myself read it.Maybe it is a setup for the next book, that's the only thing I can think of. Like The Empire Strikes Back. It set up Return of the Jedi and that was about all. I'm trying to convey as much respect as I can to Ms Auel, as I do admire and respect her work. I have a BA in Anthropology, and believe me, she's done her homework.I was so starved for something profound to happen in this book, I was actually hoping Jondalar would bite the dust in a hunting accident towards the end. But, what more is there for them to do? They've completed the journey and there are no more worlds to conquer."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"When I was a quarter of the way through the book,I kept expecting some excitement, such as I found in my favorite, \\"Valley of the Horses\\". And now I'm almost half finished, and Auel is explaining how there always seems to be a cup at the spring for people to drink from....duhhh I sure hope the next book gives us some of the ole' Auel."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Really a reminder and a rehash of her books. Did not have a story line. Really disappointed."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"After a decade, both Jean Auel and Robert Waller produced follow-ups to previous hits. I read both and wished I had not wasted my time nor money. Shelters of Stone and A Thousand Country Roads both lacked inspiration and originality. I will not turn instead to fresh voices in literature. Try \\"Lost Nation\\" by Jeffrey Lent or \\"Shade of the Maple\\" by Kirk Martin for refreshing, lyrical prose that is fresh and compelling."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I was so excited when this book came out. 11 1/2 years was so long to wait. I thought that there were many interesting parts to the book, but that overall, the book lacked the excitement of some of the earlier ones. However, I must say that I am looking forward to the next book, given that Ayla's life has taken an amazing turn and has a promise of greatness and drama."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Shame on you, Jean. After 12 years of waiting this was a huge disappointment. No action, nothing new. I've re-read the other books in the series over the past 12 yrs., but will not be re-reading this one! Sorry I bought it. Should've just borrowed it from the library."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"After waiting so long this book in the series was slightly dissapointing mainly because of the referance so frequently to the previous books.It also felt that nothing important really happens and that the action will start in the next book.However it was readable and a must if you have read the rest in the series."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Repetitive, slow, and too detailed.How could there have been a 12 year wait for a book that was for at least the first 700 pages a repetition of the first books? How many times do we need to be told Alya has to go to the bathroom more often now that she is pregnant? Do we have to have her show how to make fire over and over and over? Where is the plot, the suspense, the action?I do not recommend buying this book, get on the waiting list at the library."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I read the first Clan of the Cave Bear when I was only a child and the next two before I was barely a teen. I have waited patiently for years checking the shelves regularly for the next in the series - hoping to drink in more about Ayla and er incredible life. When I recieved my book on Monday I sat down immedietly to begin what I new would transport me to another world ... I was not dissapointed.Of course Ms. Auel new book does not contain the excitement of her previous 4 as we know much already about the Zelondonni from Jondalar and how people wil react to Ayla, her animals and her affinity to the Clan. What is so striking in this book is we finally really see the womenly side of Ayla and how it pulls with her naturally calling to be something more. We are thrilled with the birth of her daughter and her warm embrace by Jodalars family . I was only slightly dissapointed that the story spent so much time telling about the previous novels (please let people read them on their own next time) and felt it lack a certain direction and seemed that Ayla fit in a little two easy. Of course it is a great set up for the sixth and final book with all the characters floating around Ayla .. will that too take a decade - please say no I don't think I could take having to read it with my grandchildren!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I actually found this book to be a let down. I felt as though Auel was just setting up the scene for her last installment and barely brushing the surface of her characters, their emotions, and conflicts.I still gave it 3 stars because I am, like others, just addicted to this series. Its a good read for those who follow the series, and hopefully we won't have to wait as long for the last book."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The year long journey from the lands of the Mammoth Hunters in her last book; Plains of Passage is over.Ayla meets Jondalar's mother and sister and his spurned girlfriend who he left behind. Marona despises Ayla and tries her best to embaress her but infact it strengthens her instead.But when they discuss the Clan members with Marthona, Ayla's ties to them is revealed but they do not mind her ties to them except for a few members of the Zeladonii who don't like the Clan.I have read this book within 24 hours after I got it last Sunday morning. My mom is right now reading it, so far I give it four stars. It is a little off from Plains of Passage and Mammoth Hunters but it is good."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Ms. Auel has exceeded her previous efforts. I have been entranced by her concept and the depth of her research. She is a story teller without equal. Each of the Earth's Children series has been exceptional. Shelters of Stone follows the earlier tales and ends leaving the reader eagerly anticipating the next installment. Heaven forbid it takes another 12 years. I particularly enjoyed the speed with which the story moved and without sacrificing the vivid descriptions of the climate, resources and struggle to survive in this era. Ms. Auel skillfully blends research and inspired imagination to project a believeable environment and life style. Her concept of the spirituality of her people is a delicious blend of fact seasoned liberally with enlightened conjecture, producing a well thought out religious structure. Ms. Auel again blends education with a lively story, simultaneously teaching and entertaining. I eagerly await the next installment of my favorite story and characters, told and drawn by my favorite storyteller. May it come soon!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I think that the book was amazingly well written, and it carried us through meeting all of Jondalar's kin. Carried over from the Shelters of Stone, Ayla is pregnant, and she has a baby. Ayla encounters many hardships from people who doubt her medical knowledge because of her upbringing. We are introduced to the Zelondonni, the women Jondalar used to love. Over all, this book stands up to it's 12 year wait."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"While I was disappointed in the content and repetitious nature in Shelters of Stone, I was intrigued by the plot line and am anxious to see how the whole series wraps up in #6. Any word from any source on when the new book will be coming? I started reading the series in 1980, and 25 years (so far!) is a long time to stick with a series. I hope it's not another 12 years until the last installment, or I will be too old to enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have been reading some of the other reviews, and I would like to express my opinion. To dismiss this book as Jondalar and Alya get home, Alya has a baby is the equivalent of saying of Clan of the Cave Bear: Cro-Magnon girl adopted by Neanderthals, grows up, gets kicked out.Shelters of Stone introduces many new characters: Jondalar's mom and other family, and explores the stresses of a city type civilization. Alya has to learn to live within a group of a thousand or more. The conflicts are of a subtler sort such as how to handle group pressure. Not all conflict is fangs at your throat. Sometimes it is someone whispering behind your back."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I if you've read the other four in the Earths children series this is a follow up. find out what happens with Ayala and Johnular when they reach his people. if you haven't read the other four books I STRONGLY recamend that you read then first in order to know what some of the referances mean and who the pepole are. The Clan Of the Cave Bear., The Valley Of the Horses,The Mamouth Hunters, the Plains of Passage in that order."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Most of the reviews on here are pretty harsh. Some go into such great detail as to why/how it is bad, it is a little bit silly. Maybe if the book weren't being analyzed to death, it might be enjoyed more. I enjoyed all of the books in this series. I agree that maybe Jondalar was a bit wimpy, but I was more interested in Ayla anyhow, since she is the main character. As some others mentioned, I too would like to find out what happened to Durc. It would be interesting to have another book, where Ayla goes back to the Clan in search of him. Anyhow, if you aren't sure you should spend your money on this book, borrow it from your local library."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"...The story has good continuity with previous books but is a bit heavy on description of landscape and review of first four books. I enjoyed Shelters of Stone...If you're not a big fan, you can wait till it comes out in paperback."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I thought the book was very good. It does get a little boring to me because of so much explicit detail written in on everything. The book is around 750 pages but well worth the read. Can't wait for the final book."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I love to read books, possibly more than anything else. No I am not obsessed with reading, I have friends and everything else like a normal teenager should. In the past few months I have thought of Ayla as a friend. Jean Auel's books were introduced to me by my mother. She had read Jean Auel's first book, Clan of the Cave Bears, when she married my father. She thought I would this love this book as she had, and my oh my she was right! (Yes I actually said my mother was right!)Immediately after reading Clan of the Cave Bears I made my mom drive me to the bookstore to get the rest of the series. I was one of the lucky ones, I didn't have to wait for the books to come out. Which is good because I don't have a lot of patience when it comes to waiting, but who does? I think it is safe to say that I finished each book within a matter of 2-3 days.On Thanksgiving I was in the middle of The Plains of Passage, and I couldn't put it down!!! I read it all Thanksgiving day! Then I started the Shelters of Stone. This was one of my top favorites in the Earth Children's series. Yes, I agree it was a little repetative, but all books are! And when people say Ayla is some-what of a goddess, perhaps they are right, but in my opinion it was the power of the human mind that lead her to her discoveries. I must say this series was a great discovery, and that all should discovery it."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Definitely! It took me 2 days to read and I loved almost every minute, I found some of the harking back to previous books a little tedious, but then,I reread them just before \\"Shelters\\" was released so I didn't need my memory jogged. A good book to catch up with \\"the story so far\\" and lead in to the sixth and last. I wouldn't have missed it."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"then you will apreciate this book. But it did tend to ramble. For those of us who are used to Auel's style, it was not a huge surprise. At times I felt as though I was re-reading all the books over again. I felt however that it was really satisfying to read overall, and I recomend it to all who have enjoyed the series."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Waited years for this book. What a disappointment. It is boring, repetitive, and has no story. I don't think that the same person wrote this book as wrote the first four. It stinks and I want my money back for the TWO COPIES I bought."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I like page turners...Story was good. Just that I expected more from such a best seller."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I bought this book with the expectation that it would follow the same line of writting. And it did. To say that the writting on and on about the flora and fauna of the time was tedious to read is rediculous. To say that it's too convienient for Ayla to just happen to be around when a person needs to be saved is ludicris, especially since it is her job as a medicine woman to provide aid and assistance. To say that the amazing sex lives of Ayla and Jondalar are too amazing is expected of people looking for something other than a Jean Auel novel. These are expected moments when it comes to an Earth's Children novel. These are moments her reader's can depend on, and frankly those who were looking for something else, should have purchased another author's work. I loved this book because it was a continuation of the same story, following the same lines of thought as in the previous four novels. You get what you pay for when it comes to Auel, and to expect something else and act surprised or even disapointed is truely niave. If you're interested in other work of the same genre try Joan Wolf's Daughter of the Red Deer or The Reindeer Hunters or Brenda Smith's Secrets of the Ancient Goddess or Elizabeth M. Thomas' Reindeer Moon instead."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I decided to write a review because this book has such a low rating compared to her other books. I just finished reading all 5 books for the first time and I thought it was fantastic. If you've read all the books in the series then you should know what to expect. Alya's perfect, smart and everybody loves her. Don't let the reviews discourage you. I can't wait for the next book."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I loved Auel's first 4 books. But this new book has gone over the top with politics and ultra radical liberalism. Lets be honest, Ayla now represents radical feminism taken to insane levels. I can't stretch my imagination far enough to possibly believe that life could have ever been so perfect back then. It doesn't matter that its 10,000 years ago, Ayla has mastered birth control, gets drunk, sleeps around, is a strong leader, hunts, fishs, is a medical guru and completes every other masculine task known to man. She also teachs the entire tribe to accept severe racial differences. I'm surprised Auel didn't have Ayla somehow attending college in Berekely! Lets be real, do you really think this could have happenend in such a harsh enviroment where survival was at stake every second of the day? I just don't buy it and I think Jean Auel is trying to shove her politics down our throat. Read at you own risk."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I was surprised to see the negative reviews on this book. Picky, picky! Are the negative reviewers all published authors too? Or maybe just professional critics? Jeesh! I thought it was a great story and really enjoyed it...in fact I've reread it a couple of times. It was a nice visit back to the characters in the original series."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Excellent book to begin with, Sandra Burr's oral recitation is fantastic. For die hard Auel fans the audiobooks are great for pronunciation."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Well I don't think I need to go into all that was bad about this book, so many others already have. I was disapointed in it after waiting so long. That isn't to say I didn't enjoy reading it because I did. As one of the reviewers said \\"Ayla meets and greets and greets and greets...and greets and greets and greets\\". Yes, I too, got tired of the same greeting over and over again. But I am very curious to find out how her dream pretaining to her two sons are symbolic and not as they seem. I like her writing style and have enjoyed all of her books. I am looking forward to her newest book."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I can appreciate fine literary writing, but there is also a place in literature for books driven by strong plots and stuffed with interesting information. It seems to me that Jean Auel's books belong to the latter category. Many people are fascinated by the shadowy origins of humanity; Auel has created a richly textured world that presents a plausible picture of those origins. I could hardly put down the earlier books in her series. This one was not quite as much of a page-turner--I read it over several days rather than over a couple of long, intense sessions--but still an absorbing reading experience. Anyone who has followed Ayla this far on her journey will be thirsty for more information about this character and her vividly imagined world. I must say I disagree with another reviewer who said you don't need to read the earlier books because of the flashbacks in this book. The earlier books are a must, and they set up the reader to appreciate the more leisurely pace here. I do think the numerous sex scenes are superfluous, even if they make the picture of ancient life more rounded and complete. I sort of skim or skip over them, because they don't tend to advance the plot or convey any new information about this fascinating world."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Granted, I didn't have to wait 12 years like most fans, cause I only discovered the books 2 weeks before the new one came out. And I'm glad! Cause after finishing the 4th book I was so caught up in Ayla's world that with the 5th book, it was just a continuation. The only downside to \\"The Shelters of Stone\\" is that there's so much geographical descriptions, but that's Jean Auel's signature and it's just my impatience speaking here. The book is absolutely awesome, and I can't wait for the next one and I hope it doesn't take 12 years! Ayla is such a strong woman.."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"What a let down I hope the next book comes out sooner and is better than this one. I started reading this series when I was 17 years old and am now 33 so I am invested in the story. When I finished reading the Plains of Passage I was not even married and now have been for over a decade. The day the book became available I was first in line and couldn't wait to spend a quiet weekend in my most comfortable chair reveling in Ayla's next adventure.I have to say that I read through the entire book with my normal vigor but I feel almost betrayed in what this book has done to a once powerful storyline. The antagonistic characters in the book are transparent and no effort was made to develop or resolve their conflicts with Ayla. Other than the complaints at the different ceremonies and the foreshadowing malevolence they wished upon Ayla and Jondolar in their thoughts we are left at the end of the book knowing that we have been hung out to dry. When I finished the book I had the same feeling I get when a Sunday night movie special ends with a to be continued right in the middle of the main plot. I hope Jean Auel's 'to be continued next Tuesday's episode' is not eleven years down the road because if it is as weak as this book is then it will not be worth the wait or anticipation I had while waiting for this release.On a more positive note, hopefully the next book will resolve some of the many open plot items left hanging in the Shelter of Stone. As I mentioned earlier, I have been an avid and loyal reader to this series and I hope to be rewarded in her next book. Finally, I hope the wait is not so long that I receive it as a retirement gift."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This book continues the story of Ayla and Jondalar, sending them home to the Lanzadonii after quite a while of wandering about. It's well-written, with fascinating characterizations and dazzling detail. This time around, the sex didn't get in the way as much. As usual, it's a good read and gives insights into a way of life long since gone."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Ayla being THE main charecter aside, In every one of Jean's books in this series, I felt like I was there, her descriptions of everything in detail were so rich I could taste, feel ,smell, and hear the entire stories, Bravo Jean!! Keep up the great work! Anxiously awaiting the next one!!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Ayla, heroine of Auel's four previous \\"Earth's Children\\" books, arrives at last with her beloved Jondalar in the land of the Zelandonii. At the Ninth Cave, Jondalar's home, his family greets him after his five-year absence on a Journey all the way across Europe and back - at the farthest point of which he met Ayla.It's been a long Journey, and all the two travelers want now is to settle into the Ninth Cave's intriguing stone shelters and prepare for the arrival of their first child. Not to mention for their official mating, at the Summer Meeting of all the caves of the Zelandonii. Telling the stories of their travels, bringing home the spirit of Jondalar's brother who set off with him and died along the way, and introducing his fascinated yet frightened people to Ayla's animal friends (the horses Whinney and Racer, and the four-legged hunter Wolf), would be enough to deal with; but of course the young couple soon learn that there's more.Zelandoni, the Ninth Cave's spiritual guardian and healer, recognizes Ayla immediately as one of her own calling. That isn't what Ayla wants, however. Yet as she works through the adjustments - large ones and small ones, sometimes with Jonalar's help and sometimes standing on her own - and makes a place for herself among her lover's people, the gradual revelation of her gifts and skills convinces the older woman more and more firmly that among the Zelandoni is where Ayla truly belongs.I've noticed that many readers are unhappy about this book's recapping of events from the four preceding volumes, and I can understand their viewpoint. However, I think I know why the author chose to write \\"The Shelters of Stone\\" the way she did. This fifth book in the series tells the story of Ayla's spiritual journey, which really began in \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear.\\" Every event that \\"The Shelters of Stone\\" recaps, it fits into a pattern that only now - at this greatest turning point yet in Ayla's young life - becomes visible. To her, and to us.I didn't find the paperback edition's nearly 900 pages too long at all. I can honestly say that I savored every single chapter.- Reviewed by Nina M. Osier, author of \\"Love, Jimmy: A Maine Veteran's Longest Battle\\""},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I did not know what to expect from this the fifth book from Jean Auel. I waited, along with uncountable numbers of people across the World, for the \\"next one\\" and hoped the wait would not be much longer.I was not disappointed! \\"The Shelters Of Stone\\" is, by far, the best of the series. I have watched as Ayla has grown from a frightened lost child into a woman of presence, power and great beauty. Jean Auel describes all of Ayla and Jondalars \\"discoveries\\" and achievements in such a plausible way. From \\"firestones\\" to riding horses and taming \\"wolf\\" to the more in depth ideas on reproduction, Jean explains the events so \\"matter of factly\\" than one begins to be drawn in and believes that they are reading an account of one who was actually present.The Shelters Of Stone is not a book to be overlooked and believe me when I say you wont be able to put it down!I am left now having to wait for the next and final installment, feeling rather flat after such a high. If the sixth book is only half as good as The Shelters Of Stone, I will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I finished the book last night and it is excellent. It does help if you know the other four books before it, but Jean does explain the background of alot of situations throughout the book. Welcoming Jondular home and getting to know his family is excellent.....Ayla fits in quite well despite her differences. The book brings you through her pregnancy, their mating, the birth, and also the birth of the new baby for Whinney. Even wolf makes a friend fo his own kind too. Lots of new chartacters to get to know...... makes me look forward to a more careful second reading. And yes there is sharing of Pleasures for Ayla and Jondular, not as many as I thought there would be for such a big book.... but the ones there are excellent and well done ;) Even the characters that do not get along with Ayla and her background get you into the book and wanting more. Ayla and Jondular are back and enjoy it!!!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I enjoyed the extensive detail of the period and places. Besides loving the characters and storyline in this series I read it for the history and facts. Where else can one learn so much so easiely and enjoyably. I can't wait for book six. I just wish there was a book with illustrations of the many extrodinary things and places she describes. I'd love to see how my images relate to reality.

We listened to the first 6 tapes on a vacation. He refused to continue, saying it was way too long and drawn out. I agree it does have more intricate details than any book I've probably ever read or listened to. However, because it is so long and detailed, it is sort of soothing to me. I get in the car, pop in a tape, and feel transformed back to another place and time. I hear in detail all of the mundane matters of the people of long ago. The love story between Ayla and Jondular (not sure how to spell their names) is nice---they are way too focused on day to day life to engage in any romance-type constant passion, but Auel definitely includes some (equally detailed) intimate scenes. In fact, if it weren't for the rare (every 3rd or so tape) sex scenes, I would donate it to the library when I am done. Overall, I like the tapes. It is an interesting book---I look forward to hearing bits of it as I drive, and I don't care what my husband says---long is just right for this author."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"When I found out Jean Auel had a new book out, I bought the hard cover not wanting to wait for the soft to come out. That was a mistake. I have been a big fan of Jean Auel for years, and have read her previous books numerous times. Shelter of Stone however left much to be desired. Her detailed description of \\"everything\\" was a bit much. I enjoy a good detailed book, but this one was overdone. I had to force myself to pick the book back up and continue reading it. The first five hundred pages were slow going, but after that, things picked up and it was easier to read. Hopefully her next book will be less descriptive of rocks and ledges and more of the story of Ayla and her new homeland."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I am a big Auel fan having each of her previous books in hard cover and having read them multiple times. There are about 700 pages in The Shelters of Stone, compared to Clan of the Cave Bear at around 450. Auel's books seem to becoming longer and more descriptive but at the same time the time line in the story becomes shorter. I was disappointed when after being three-quarters through Shelters of Stone only a few months have been covered (versus multiple years in her first two books). It also seems that Auel must repeat herself describing characters multiple times in the same book. One character's description, Echozar is described three times in Shelters of Stone - this is a character we knew in the previous book. I found myself having to skip sections of description because it was the same thing that was said a few pages before. I am hoping that Auel isn't repeating herself because she believes her readers are too stupid to remember one character, or one event, from time to time. Or is she just trying to stretch out a storyline so that she has enough for her expected and final 7th book? I had high expectations for this book and am very disappointed at the result."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This book was such a let down, I almost want my money back. I had been griping for years about the Earth's Children series and where in the world was that new book. I was so excited to finally to see the book alive and in print that I bought the first copy that I saw and settled myself in for an absorbing session. Imagine my surprise when I encountered all the other books mushed together in 750 pages of dry, tasteless reading. The repetition of the background of Ayla and Jondolar was really..... bad. I am trying to not sound harsh but I would only recommend this book if you go buy it used in paperback. We will see if the 6th book can recoup my faith in this series."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Good grief. What a bunch of hogwash these reviews are. If you love this series, you're going to love this book. Period. I couldn't wait to turn every page, and hated to see it end. It was actually a relief to me not having all the drama in this book. I am waiting patiently for the next installment."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This novel reviews much of the previous four novels. By itself it is not a great novel and not up to standard with the previous four. I believe \\"The Shelter of Stone\\" fills the hiatus from Novel four to hopefully Novels 5 & 6 yet to come. Mrs. Auel can write a better sequence now that she has caught us up to date. This, again, is hopefully a preview for two more good ones please! GOOD REVIEW WITH A BUILD UP FOR THE NEXT ONE BUT NOT AS GOOD AS THE FIRST FOUR!!!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I borrowed this book from the library after been put off from buying it after reading the comments on this board. I am one of those male readers that thoroughly enjoyed the first 4 books up to now. The Clan of the Cave Bear ranks as my favorite book of all time.This time, however, I felt like I was reading the Mamouth Hunters all over again, although with new characters. The same story tended to unfold an there was never any new direction in the story that made me take notice and increase my enthusiasm level. In some ways, this book reminds me of a typical flashback episodes we see in some TV programs. I enjoyed this book - it was good but certainly not as great as the other ones.

What a disappointment! After four tales of high adventure around which were couched loads of information about stone age living, we come to this new effort. I have slogged through the first 300 pages of this tome, and now it rests on the shelf. (Editing out reduncancies and there might be a worthwhile thirty page read here). In those first 300 pages nothing more exciting happens than a dirty trick involving clothing and a death at a hunt, providing I suppose a plot ploy to expose Ayla's healing powers. Not much high dudgeon here. Frankly, the book reads more like ... manual for the stone age then a tale fashioned by a writer who proved capable of excellence in her earlier works.\`"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Great research, thin plot.It seems like Mrs. Auel is trying to set-up for book six.The entire ending was very rushed.Where Plains of Passage was wordy with landscape description, this was wordy with 'The Mother's Song' and people repeating each other's formal names over and over and over.Book One remains my favorite.At least we shouldn't have to wait so long for book six since Mrs. Auel is getting older."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"OK--maybe it wasn't the best of the series--but it was the best one in the past ten years. Seriously, the book did seem to show signs of repition and we did spend alot of time re-hashing the plot lines of the previous 4 books, but if you haven't read the other books--or its been 10 or more years since your read the books---it was nice to be reminded about important plot lines that one may have forgotten. I enjoyed this book very much. I think the best thing I can say is that when I finished the last page I was ready to pick up book 6. Unfortunately,it appears we will have to wait another year or so to see it published."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I see that many reviewers got frustrated with the repetitive nature of this book. Yes Ayla's appearance and speech are talked about often. Yes, introductions with Wolf happen often.But Auel has always done that. She goes into depth. That is what she does. In some instances I feel it is too much depth, but no more in this book than the others of the series.While I admit it did get bit tedious in places, I would not say that it made the book that much worse than the others. I still love Shelters of Stone as much as the others. The characters are amazing. They do grow deeper each book. I love the story of Ayla and will read the next (and from what I hear final) book of the Earth's Children series.If you liked the others, definitely give this one a try as well."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I had read the reviews ahead of time and knew that we would not see Durc reunited with Ayla, so I was not expecting it. I found this book to be pleasurable (no pun intended) and satisfying. I will eagerly await the next installment. Lets hope it doesn't take her as long."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Better than the 4th. As good as the first three. Worth the wait. Thoroughly enjoyable.Wish some of these other reviews didn't contain spoilers. And one of them seems to be about Plains of Passage! Travel journal? Sex scene every chapter? That's not Shelters of Stone!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This is a great follow up to the other 4. the other reviewers seem to find the explanations that they loved in Clan of the cave bear and the others found them anoying in this book but they are the deffinition of auel's books. She has based her career on creating a world that is so real you feel like you are in it yourself. Without the thurough explanations and detail this wouldn't be possible. This book is great."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This book was worth the wait. I don't want to put a spoiler, but it really comes full circle with the other books. Jean manages to incorporate so many real-life experiences of our time into their time. The only down-side is that it leaves me wanting MORE and I hope she will provide just one more book. She travelled to France and did a lot of research for this one."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"If Valley of Horses made you cringe, if Mamoth Hunters made you gag, if Plains of passage put you to sleep, fear not, for here at last is a book that stands up to the original! The plot is interesting; the writing style polished, but down to earth; and the characterizations supurb. I even found myself liking Jondalar for the first time! Ayla in particular is better here, she has truly become a character almost anyone can both admire and relate to. Without giving anything crucial away, after a year of traveling, Ayla and Jondalar reach the Zelandonii (Jondalar's people) at last. Since Ayla is now pregnant, she's quite naturally glad to be among other women once again, and yet, will all of Jondalar's people be welcoming? Expecially once they realize she was raised by Clan, whom they look on as animals? All in all, this was a great book that I truly enjoyed. All the supporting characters as well as the main characters were portrayed realistically and well. I recommend this book to anyone sixteen or older who has an interest in the far past."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Not long ago I was introduced to Jean Auel's &quot;Clan of the Cave Bear&quot; as required high school reading and I have been thirsting for her work ever since. Her implementation of archeological description is amazing, and the society she has created for these ancient peoples is ingenious. But the fact that I put off college study time for 700+ pages of trite, regurgitated information from the previous four novels is incredibly disappointing.I felt as if I was forcing myself to paste my eyes to the pages and endure the dull plot, which lacked much needed character development and REAL attention grabbing conflict. There were simply too many superfluous characters who had no real impact on the novel at all. I was hanging on every page, not because of what was happening on it, but because of the hope that the next one might hold something interesting.I pray that this is just setting the stage for a phenomenal fifth installment, because this one could have been cut to a quarter of its size and still provide the same monotonous information. Granted, the last 200 pages picks up significantly, but not enough to redeem the overwhelmingly bland plot of the previous 500."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I found this last book the best. Less focused on the sex life of the characters and more about character development. It was good alone and it interested me in the next. My mail critique was that several time she (the author) got lost in details of the setting in the midst of a dramatic point between the characters. I do appreciate its length."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This book was excellent - as an introduction to the next book in the series. There's really not a main climactic point, just a series of lesser ups and downs. There are a few great moments - mostly anything taking place in a cave - that make the whole thing worthwhile. This book has taken a lot of flak, but if the point of this book was to introduce everything that is to come in the next book, it served its purpose."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Familiarity with prior novels in Auel's prehistoric 'Earth's Children' series will contribute to both background and an appreciation for Shelters Of Stone, the continuing story of Ayla and her love Jondalar.

Unfortunately, I can't say the same thing for this one. Almost the entire book consisted of Ayla retelling events from the last four books to everyone she encountered. Some sections even seemed to be cut and pasted from earlier in the book word for word. The new plot elements were also very weak when they weren't overwhelmed by repetition. For the amount of time between this book and the previous one I expected better."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Even though I enjoyed most of the previous books in the series and looked forward to reading this one, I found it was not only a terrible book, but a boring one.Repetitive, uneventful, heavy, unpleansant to read, etc. etc. Nothing justifies reading hundreds of pages to sumerize it in only a few words. Ayla and Jondalar ger married, Ayla has a baby, Ayla proves (yet again) that she has wisdom and 'powers', end of story.I feel cheated and fear the publication of the next one in the series."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The much-hyped, long awaited continuation of the saga of Ayla and Jondalar is finally here, and what a non-event it has turned out to be. The characters have turned to cardboard, the plot is plodding and, judging from the repetition and belabored descriptions, Auel must have been paid by the word for this mammoth disappointment. Auel's meticulous research and knowledge of the paleolithic era are, as always, superb--but that's not enough to elevate this potboiler to the level of her previous works.Since nothing happened or was resolved in this volume, there's sure to be another. I only hope Ms. Auel doesn't make us wait another ten years, and that she is able to capture the magic of her earlier work, so sadly lacking in Shelters of Stone."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I read the first book, I was hooked. I read the second book, and it was pretty good. I read the third book and started to get disinterested. I read the fourth book and I was disapointed on the focus of constant sex and how much of a heroine Ayla was. The fifth book, sadly, follows in this pattern.Not only is there an *extreme* amount of sex, but Ayla being 'accepted' seemed forced. And the fact she keeps discovering things upsets me. Flint, 'spear-thrower', sewing, taming animals, ect, it's just very overdone.Ayla has no real flaws, which I think, is a huge problem when reading this story, as the reader has nothing to identify with.I've heard people talk about a story about Durc and what happens to him. I think after Valley of Horses, that might have been the better idea."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"We fans have eagerly awaited this 5th novel, only to be seriously disappointed.What we were served is an overpriced, under creative work of tediously simple verbiage, constantly repeated, ad nauseum. The least experienced reader would abandon this book without hesitation. The more savvy fans are likely to be more disgusted, than disappointed. We learn nearly nothing new, no creativity, beyond trite descriptions of myriad cave paintings. No effort is made to either share interpretations, nor suggest something \\"mystical\\"...any conclusion may have been better than none.Ayla's \\"rape episode\\" is so jarringly out of step, as to be totally misspent type. Volumes of character creation and evolution, then an abrupt departure of good sense. The ungraceful manner of the thought process that led each character toward the moment, simply do not mesh. The hubris displayed by our Author is purely insulting. Mz. Auel's loss of contact with feasibility is an overestimation of her competence, a misuse of our trust and custom.Were a refund available, I would absolutely be first in line.

Jean Auel is so skilful at describing the little details of everyday life--What shall I fix for dinner? Can this be mended or should I go for a new one?--that the reader feels right at home in the environment. I sent this book to a friend in England. She decided at 10:30pm \\"just to read two chapters to get into it\\" and resurfaced at 2:00am! I can't wait to read the final book--and yet I dread the ending. Since I have the books, I can just start back at the beginning."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have read all of her previous books, but The Shelters of Stone is one of the better ones.

This book carried an interesting plot thread and ended with me wanting more . . . a good sign."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Stellar,I would and sit and read for literally three to four hours at a time. I enjoyed this book as much as The Clan of the Bear. Valley of the Horses was also interesting.Mammoth Hunters good, Plains of Passage I found to be tedious.

I felt Ayala's joy and her trying times with Jondalar's people her people.I am waiting with bated breath for The Land of Painted Caves."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I found the books for the most part enjoyable. Unfortunately, as with the other Earth's Children books, I was again disappointed to find myself reading (and in the case of the current book, listening to) sexually explict details that should be saved for magazines sold only behind the counter. If not for these graphic passages, which add absolutely nothing to the story line, the books would be a delight to read. In fact, I can see the series being read by preteens and teens alike. The fictional books might even spur a kid's interest in history, geography or anthropology. Auel's books would merit a better rating but for the passages containing detailed sexual content randomly scattered throughout. Okay, some folks enjoy erotica and that's fine -- go to a porn bookstore to get your jollies. The Earth Children Series is a good read without adding gratuitous sex to the mix. So, how about some new editions sans the porno, please."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Other reviewers were spot on when they mentioned that most of this book was little more than a rehash of previous books. It makes me so sad - the fascination I felt when I first started reading about this world, such as the craft-making, taming of animals, etc. has been stripped away, repetition by repetition. I especially disliked the gratuitous sex scenes that have replaced the warm intimate moments between Ayla and Jondalar. I ended up skipping them to get to more interesting parts, except I found out there weren't very many at all. As I got to the end of the book, I realized I had skipped at least three quarters of the book, because most of it was repetition ad nauseum about Ayla's wonderful character. I used to think Ayla was wonderful too, but she's just not believable anymore ever since she became \\"Super Ayla, Master of the Universe\\"."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This fifth book in the Earth's Children series lacks the wonderfulness of the first four. While Auel's bad is definitely better than some author's good, it may prove to be a disappointment to some readers, and I definitely recommend that anyone whose never read the series before start at the beginning with Clan of the Cave Bear. This book does not suit well as a stand-alone.For those not familiar with the series (and a possible spoiler) Ayla was a little girl when she was adopted into a clan of Neanderthals. She was raised by them but eventually had to leave, and in doing so leave her son behind, to try to find others like herself. She didn't find them right away and instead spent time in a valley where she makes unlikely friends with a horse and lion. Eventually though, a handsome \\"other\\" named Jondalar ends up in her valley and they fall in love. The travel for awhile and stay with a tribe of people called the Mamutoi for a bit until finally making a perilous journey far to the west where Jondalar's people dwell.This book starts when they first reach the Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii, Jondalar's home. People are excited and anxious for awhile as Jondalar and Ayla have brought their two horses and wolf pup with them, which before now, had never been heard of. They meet several people and have to convince them of Ayla's worthiness to join the Zelandoni. Some people are taking far too much of an interest in her however, and the First of the Zelandoni (spiritual leaders, healers, etc.) wants her to become a Zelandoni herself as she is believed to be too dangerous left to her own devices. But all Ayla wants is to have her matrimonial with Jondalar and raise the baby that she is currently pregnant with.The characters are not as well written in this book. Ayla and Jondalar are once again too perfect. All of Jondalar's immediate family is too perfect as well and it would have been nice to even see some average people that were close to him instead of exceptional ones. It would have made the story much more believable. Those that aren't the nicest of people are usually far away from his family. The Zelandoni kind of creep me out too and I'm sure Auel wanted to make them sound important, but to me they just sound like a cult wanting to bring people \\"into the fold.\\"The writing is very descriptive but it doesn't work well for Auel in this novel. It gets boring at parts and often times, I really didn't care what a certain cave that is only mentioned once in the entire novel looked like up and down and inside and out. I was also disappointed with how she chose to incorporate her research. There were new things she must have learned and wanted to add but made it seem awkward if you were familiar with the other books. For example, she goes to great lengths to describe an Elan (spirit of a person) and uses it quite heavily in this book, however, Jondalar never mentions it in any of the other books. Auel explains this by having Jondalar trying to keep it simple for Ayla, but one would think that something so important to his culture would be the first thing he share with her. I can understand wanting to include research, but sometimes it just hurts the book instead. Another thing people should note about the writing of this book is that it has a lot of sex scenes that are very descriptive.I like the series and as said before Auel's bad is still pretty good. I look forward to reading the finale and seeing what resolutions are made for Jondalar and Ayla's adventures.Book 1: The Clan of the Cave BearBook 2: The Valley of HorsesBook 3: The Mammoth HuntersBook 4: The Plains of PassageThe Shelters of StoneCopyright 2002749 pages + Character ListingReview by M. Reynard 2011"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This book (despite its brick-like size) read like it was supposed to be the first half, instead of the whole thing. Auel introduces rich characters, sets up interesting conflicts, both intra- and inter-character.... and leaves it there. There is very little resolution of conflicts, and that makes it seem incomplete and unsatisfying. Nothing is resolved in this book. No one makes any decisions. People don't like each other, and people have problems to solve -- but no one ever solves any of them.I thought it was a good book, up until about the last 100 pages, when it became clear that there was going to be no resolution, no conflict-solving, nothing. There was a brief attempt during the last few pages, but it only created more conflict that still wasn't resolved.The other problem I noticed was Auel's obvious monologues on the history, development, etc of the society. I appreciate that she's done a lot of research for her books. I appreciate hearing a bit of that straight from the author. But she has some theories that seem awfully far-fetched to me (and no, I'm not an expert, but I -do- read a lot about archaeology) and expounds at length about them, usually when she doesn't have any interesting action going on. I wish she'd put more action (and conflict resolution!) into her stories, and less of her author monologues.That said, Ayla is strong, as always, and Auel does set up some awfully interesting conflicts for her to live with in her new life with the Zelandonii. I enjoyed the portrayal of the early society, and I definitely enjoyed seeing Ayla finally settle down and start a life with Jondalar. The characters, while slightly over-populated and not quite as full as they were in other books, are still relatively rich and interesting. The names are confusing, but it could be much, much worse, and they aren't too bad. The plot moves at a decent speed, and Jondalar's mother is worth the effort of reading the thing.It's a decent book. Not worth buying in hardback, but maybe in softcover, and certainly worth borrowing from your friend or your library."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Jean Auel needs to break out of her mold of trying to make the latest book a stand alone book for new readers. With the latest book this technique has gotten unmanagable. She spent at least a third of the book going over material covered in previous books. She needs to understand that this is a series and she should assume that her readers have read the previous books. If she wanted to include the old material in a short prologue to bring those who haven't read the other books up to date, this would work, since those who have read the previous books could just skip it. As it was, I found this book boring. It was a big disappointment!!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Auel continues to fascinate with her research and speculations about the life of pre-historic man, however, she missed her opportunity with this book. Amazingly, Ayla is only 19 at the END of this book?! She should have aged Ayla, which would have had its own interesting possibilities, and made this book about her children. Fans of this series waited a long time and there is little progression in the story to show for it."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I cannot believe I waited so long with high expectations for this book. I wished for it to tie up so many loose ends and instead it only created more. As far as I am concerned the last three books have been a total loss. It has taken three books and many years for us to get from Ayla being, what 17, to the 19 she is now. Puleeze!!!Also as another reviewer mentioned, the sex is out of this world and that is not the point of the story. The introductions are ridiculous for people living in the time frame they are in. And the flowery language they use and some of their descriptions do not seem to ring true.Please, enought sex, enough on the spear thrower and the fire stones, etc. etc. If someone has not read the previous books they can go out and buy them. Please don't put us thru the endless drivel of describing this again and again, each chapter in each book. We know the food they ate, and we know Ayla is beautiful.I also have a problem with the babys name, Jondayla?? Did Jean M. Auel lose her imagination?? Even IZA would have been better.Where is she going with a girl baby? I assumed that Durc would one day meet his half-brother. The story leaves us hanging about the secret cave that Wolf finds, yet it is the Earth Mothers cave? This book has taken us only nine months further along in the series. There are a lot of loose ends that need tying up.I also will wait for the paperback issue of the next book, if there ever is another one."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I certainly agree with the majority of the reviewers that this book as a big diappointment. After waiting for many years to follow the continued journey of Ayla and Jondalar, we get a book that could have been written in a lot less time than 12 years - maybe 12 months!The first 350 pages of the book are pure filler - endless repetitions of greetings and titles - information from the first few books - in truth, absolutely nothing happens during the first 350 pages. But, even though the story picks up after page 350, it seems rushed - so much more could have been said in a lot fewer pages. The whole book seems like an introduction to book 6 and the final chapter of the Jondalar/Ayla saga.Yes, I will buy book 6; however, if a new reader were to pick up SOS, he or she would not understand why faithful readers were so excited about this book being published - it just doesn't capture the original exciting story of Ayla and Jondalar. And, if I were a new reader, it certainly wouldn't make me want to read the first few books to see what the fuss was about."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I just finished this book, but it is definitely not a cohesive, self-contained story like the other 4 books. I shouldn't have bought hardback. Jean Auel has a great story to tell, but unfortunately she does not tell it very well in this installment."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This long-awaited book is just a long, boring review of Auel's previous books.There's no significant plot, only place descriptions (the same places over and over again), explanations about the animals, firestones and other discoveries (which we already read in detail in previous books), too-explicit sex (not that I mind sex, but I get tired of it), and bad naming skills (if you've managed to get to the end of the book, you'll know what I mean).I'm tired of Ayla being so perfect, of her always ending up within the top-rank people, of her being the smartest person on Earth (I guess she'll eventually invent the wheel), etc.\\"The plains of passage\\" was pretty boring, but it had some thrill in it. \\"The shelters of stone\\" is boring, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.I'm very disappointed."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I had to give it two stars because the years of waiting and hype gave me much more entertainment than the book did. I have yet to read a more dissapointing book. After years of waiting... years of Jean explaing she's taking her time to get it right... and this is the result? You meet Jondalar's people, one by one, and hear again and again (and again) the \\"formal introductions\\", the explanation of wolf, the horses and spear throwers. Most of the \\"new\\" dialogue makes me think it's set in the 1980's. One can overlook the grammatical errors (there are numerous), but they should be an embarrassment to everyone that OK'd the book. I hate to say it, but this is not a good novel. I found myself skipping whole pages just so I could read something that interested me. You can throw out half of this book, and still get bored.I just cannot believe anyone actually read this and said, \\"Jean, this is a wonderful book.\\"WAIT FOR IT IN PAPER BACK... I wish I had."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Sorry to say, there's not much of a story here. The whole book feels like a set-up for the next, last book. Everything came too easily for our heroes & there was just no real DRAMA to be found. Ayla is easily accepted by Jondalar's people, they get mated, Ayla & Whinney have their babies and Ayla decides to train for Zelandoni. The whole summer 'meeting', rife with potential for juicy plot developments, is rushed through with little incident. Other, minor characters that were introduced play no real part in THIS book.Ms. Auel does her usual careful research, of course, but falls flat on plot this time and I just can't help but feel like she didn't really CARE about this book. I have a strong suspicion that the final book will really pack a wallop and the drudgery of 'Shelters' will prove to be key in the development, but, honestly, I feel as though I've been fleeced!Please, Jean, hurry up with the last one, ok? We waited too long for this particular letdown. You owe us one."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This book was disappointing. I have eagerly anticipated this fifth book in the Earth Children series for over 8 years and I was shocked to see how much Auel basically plagarized from her previous books. If someone else had written the first 500 pages of the book, Auel would have been able to successfully sue them for using her work.I understood that in the first 100 pages or so that it was necessary to recap the previous books and it might be necessary to re-tell a few stories to explain things, but Auel is insulting the intelligence of her reader with this level of repetition. The book could have been shortened by 300+ pages if Auel had chosen to eliminate repetition and plagarism of her own work. I absolutely loved this series prior to reading this book and I think that the series should stop at this book.I also was tired of Ayla's perfection and glad to see that she was willing to behave badly when others behaved badly with her. Her naming skills could also use some work. I'd like to see her become a little more shrill and possessive at the very least. Maybe she could let the wolf kill someone she doesn't like. Or have some indiscretion with one of Jondalar's family members and make Jondalar go insanely jealous again. Possibly even some bad sex--does everyone have multi-orgasmic sex in Cro-Magnon times?!!? Let's make her a little human, please!...I know that Auel is writing a sixth book. I hope that it's better than this one."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"After twelve years of waiting for this book, I could barely wait to start reading it, especially since Plains of Passage had been so boring and I was eager for the story to actually move along. I saved it for a 12 hour flight, thinking the 765 pages would keep me busy and interested until I got home. So wrong! By the time I was a few pages into Shelters of Stone, I couldn't imagine getting through the whole book simply because the writing was so painfully bad. But I did, and in abour four hours because it has to be the most repetitive book ever. I cannot believe Auel or her editors actually put that many excerpts (and I think one of them was even put in multiple times) from previous books. I cannot understand why Auel or her editors would think readers would need a recap of how Ayla invented or tamed everything for the Nth time. The last two chapters have all the plot movement there is. Read those last two chapters in the bookstore, or if you're flying British Air, look out for my copy-- I didn't even want to bring it home."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I remember reading the Plains of Passage on the bus during a school field trip we had in high school. I was so excited when the Plains of Passage came out, because I had waited a whole 2 YEARS for it to come out. I started reading the books when I was in junior high school and completely loved them. After I read that book (skipping a lot of the exposition about grass) I remember feeling slightly disappointed, but also thinking that the next book would be really great.There would be a lot of conflict with the Zelandonii considering the reaction Jondalar had to Ayla when he first found out she was raised by the Clan. Also, maybe we would see the first couple of years of life of her child. Maybe the whole Clan/Human conflict would come to a head. Heck, we could even see the return of Derc. I was satisfied that we would get the answers. ..Well, I've been out of high school for 11 years now and finally the next book of the series came out. What. A. Waste. Of. Time.That was the biggest snoozefest I have ever read. I suffer from insomnia, and reading a couple of pages of that book was a sure-fire way for me to catch some zzz's. How did her editor get away with allowing Auel to turn in that garbage? I think Auel has the mistaken dillusion that she's an arthopologist and not a writer. Fine, write an anthropology book. But the next time you want to disguise it as a novel, count me out."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Having read all previous Auel books, mostly with great enjoyment, I looked forward to this latest. It feels like Auel's heart was not in this one, and frankly I could not even finish it, abandoning it half-way through.The interest in a book about ice-age people would be in the author's insight into a different way of life, different social patterns, even different thought patterns. Enlivened by Auel's curiosity and research, earlier episodes were both believable and interesting, most especially the first \\"Clan of the Cave Bear,\\" a gripping, realistic portrait of how the world may have appeared to Neanderthal man.Granted that Ayla is now with people who are recognizably human, nonetheless, shouldn't there social and thought patterns by different from ours. Is it inevitable that Cro-Magnon man arrayed himself into little family units, with parents and children living together like families in suburban houses. Is it believable that ice-age humans had liberal sensibilities like ours. And even if so, is this an interesting book?There are too many anomalies here. The people depicted clearly had no sense of agriculture, no crops, no livestock. They lived off of what food they could kill or gather each day. Surely they were frequenly near starvation, and must have had to move about frequently. While we would like to believe that our ancestors lived harmonious social lives, it is too much for me to believe that this was not a world of great and irrational violence. Auel's people never seem to suffer from disease, just the occasional accident. They seem to value cleanliness in exactly the same way we do, and this also seems quite far-fetched. If nothing else, wouldn't they have continual toothaches, not to mention numerous other diseases related to a seasonally deprived diet. Surely communities in this age were always on the brink of extinction, but you get no sense of that in this book.What is nice is Auel's depiction of their appreciation of handicraft and fine art.She peppers the book with detailed, but largely irrelevant sex scenes. And there are numerous very silly episodes."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Read the first couple of pages and then skip the next 250. It is all review. Auel should assume that people who are reading this book have read the others and should not spend 250 pages re-hashing what we already know. We already know people will be \\"amazed\\" and \\"disbelieving\\" of Ayla's and Jondalar's previous adventures. We do not need to sit with them while they tell the story to each of Jondalar's relatives.We also already know Ayla and Jondalar \\"share pleasures\\" more and better than any earthly couple ever did or could. I am not reading this story to get a \\"thrill\\". In the last book, it got to the point that whenever Auel wrote about pleasures, I just skipped it, because it disturbed the flow of the story. This book was no exception.I want more depth, more story and less review. I haven't given up on the series yet, but if I have to wait another 10 years for the next - I won't be buying it."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"...mostly because I kept telling myself, \\"I know there's a plot here somewhere. If I keep looking, I'll run into it any minute.\\" Alas, I was mistaken. Honestly, folks, this book's entire storyline can be summed up in a couple of sentences, and not very interesting ones at that. If Reader's Digest is still doing condensed versions of books, they might be able to make a readable copy of SoS, but, I, for one, have no intention of wading through this mess again. I really enjoyed the first four novels, and my copies of those are in pretty shabby condition from rereading, but this one's going to stay pristine. If you're looking for rich characterization and a top-notch story, try Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series - at least he releases a new one every couple of years."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I am thankful for a novel which can both educate and entertain.At first I figured the novel's constant repetition was merely to introduce the new reader to the background material. But enough is enough. True fans do not need an extensive recap of the first four novels.Reviewers commented that the birth of Jonayla was glossed over.But many births are just that--uneventful. The second birthwasn't as physically or emotionally traumatic as when Aylabrought Durc into the world, and almost died from it--at age 11.On a positive note, the introduction of Zolena (Zelandoni) wasenjoyable. The idea of an obese woman who is portrayed aspowerful (like Roseanne or early Oprah) rather than pathetic,is refreshing.The plot moves along unevenly. In many places it moves at asnail's pace, making it very tedious. Then it would skim overother sections, making it hard to follow.Hopefully the final novel will recapture the excitement of thefirst four books and not be as disappointing as Shelters of Stone."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I am a voracious fan of this series and have read the first 3 books several times. I was especially entranced by \\"The Mammoth Hunters\\" - Auel's ability to show Jondalar's struggle with his own demons, Ayla's misinterpretation of his response to her, and the wonderfully 3 dimensional characters of the Lion Camp. Then, in her journey across the \\"Plains of Passage\\", Auel got lost. The characters grew less and less interesting, but the overall anticipation of Ayla's introduction to the Zelandonii kept you anxiously flipping through to the end. I was so excited to spot this book that I pre-ordered it several months in advance, much to my disappointment.Jondalar's father and other brother (hugely important characters in his life with a lot of potential for character development) are never really addressed. Marthona flits in and out, as does Zolena/Zelandoni who is a little more fleshed out (pardon the pun). But, again, you would expect such strong women with such attachment to this man to hold off on their acceptance of the foreigner for a while longer. There was absolutely no lingering discomfort for Zolena and Jondalar. I I believe Auel \\"quick-fixed\\" that hurdle by throwing a few hundred pounds on the poor woman. No threat now! I was so intrigued by the potential for all these characters and very let down by the lack of conflict, drama, and character of the book. Please, please redeem yourself in the next one, Ms. Jean. Hint, by the 5th book, we know all about Ayla's historical demons. Touch on them if you must, but 100's of pages wasted on recap was overkill. We remember, write on!!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"After waiting with great anticipation for 12 looonnggg years, I actually took the day off work when my copy arrived so I could immerse myself back in the Ice Age! 300 pages later, I gave up and decided to clean house instead. I now know why the book has the shortened title of SoS - 'cause if I EVER saw a book in distress this is it! I am now perfectly willing to believe all those rumors that Jean is dead - she couldn't possibly have written this drivel.(well actually she did, it was just in books 1-4) This has been my favorite series of all time and now, sadly, I don't care if she ever gets around to publishing book 6. Even Ayla's skills as a medicine woman can't revive this victim."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This 5th book in the \\"Earth's Children\\" series has been eagerly awaited for a remarkably long time. Given the amount of time Auel has been working on this novel, it is almost mind-blowingly bad. I have a hard time, in fact, believing it is even written by the same person as the other books in the series. The writing is poor, there is very little plot, the pace is excruciatingly slow, and above all it is unbearably repetitious. Not only does Auel remind us over and over again of things that have occurred in other books, which alone would probably be forgivable. She also repeats herself within the book over and over, both by literally repeating what the characters are thinking a few paragraphs after first revealing the information (sometime she tells us three or four times as if assuming the reader to be too dense to get it after being hit over the head with it twice) and also by repeating the same plot point endlessly (for example, Ayla and Jondalar reveal the \\"firestones\\" to each other character in the book individually, so that the reader has to suffer through the identical scene at least five times; same with the \\"spear-thrower\\" and the animals and the \\"pole drag\\" etc. etc. etc.).If she couldn't think of a story, she shouldn't have written the book at all, much less subjected us to 800 pages. It is shameful that she will make any money from this piece of dreck, much less the huge amount she will undoubtedly pull in from it."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"What a disappointment!! I really expected a story, plot & character development after a 12 year wait and 800 pages. What I got was a boring formula written book with lots of rehashing of old material and characters turned into cartoons of themselves.

I'm cured!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I waited 12 years for this?!?Most of the other reviews have said enough. Basically, this is disappointing. I barely was able to slog through it once, and have tried and tried to read it again (unlike the other books, which have been re-read countless times - especially Mammoth Hunters).The book is written as though the author didn't remember details from the other books. Misspelled names...things that just don't jive with what had been established in the other books...and NO PLOT. And don't get me started about the baby's name, or how anticlimatic the Summer Meeting was. Ugh.I can only hope that Book Six is better...however, I will be checking it out of the library rather than shelling out the money...Sad, sad, sad..."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Length, anybody can do. Research is nice, but laundry lists of extant flora and fauna left me skimming. Remedial writing is insulting. Sample: They can go many ways from the top of the path. They can go up. They can go down. The plot? Jondalar and Aylar ended their journey and were mated. Whinney and Ayla had baby girls. I distinctly remember enjoying books one and two. Books three and four began to slide, but I was still with the series. I still cared what was happening and wanted to know more. I hardly ever skimmed. Call me unreasonable, but if it takes somebody a decade to write a book, I expect more. And do I want to wait 12 more years to find out that Ayla becomes the next One Who Comes First of the 9th cave, leaving Jondalar to tend the kids and the hearth? NO. I knew that."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"For me, this series began phenomenally (Clan) and has slowly but steadily gotten worse. Auel seems to have run low on ideas and resorts instead to recycling material from the previous books. This 5th book is particularly bad about repeating what happened in the previous 4; I got sick of Ayla re-telling some facet of her life's story to every new person she meets. Even if Auel wants to remind us of some of the other books' details, she could have done so much more succintly. Also, she is more repetitive of story ideas than ever -- Ayla heals someone to prove she's a great medicine woman, Ayla goes on a hunt, Ayla proves the value of the horses to everyone, Ayla is ostracized by some people for her Clan background, Ayla forms a special bond with someone who is crippled, blah blah... I understand a lot wasn't going on in the Stone Age, but if you have to repeat some elements of previous stories or some ideas, they certainly don't warrant the same elaboration as in previous books. It says a lot, to me, that I could read the first sentence of every paragraph and occasionally a smidge more and not feel lost in the slightest as to what was going on. Over 700 pages? Please! Less is more, Jean.With that said, I couldn't stop skimming the story. As much as I hated having to filter through this vastly over-long book (even the sex scenes were overwritten, as someone else pointed out, and how many more ridiculous euphesism can we take, really?), I became so interested in Ayla's life in the first three books that I forced myself through this 5th one as I did through the slow parts of 4 and will through 6, and I think fans will find it fun to play in the Stone Age again even if ultimately not much happens.As literature goes -- a really terribly book; as quick reads go, not the worst you could pick."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Oh, did I mention this book is repetitive?Note to Ms. Auel: I read the first four books already. You didn't need to repeat every single piece of information from each of them every five or six pages. I lost track of how many times Ayla explained (in detail!)how she came to befriend those animals.The \\"Mother Song\\" is repeated so many times I can practically recite it myself now. Just in case you happened to miss it the hundred or so times it appears in the text of the book, Ms. Auel helpfully repeated it at the very END, too.And the sex scenes - ick. I began skipping over them because I knew how they'd unfold - they are practically identical word for word. I could easily write a \\"Jondalar and Ayla Sex Scene\\" myself at this point. The other thing I soon began skipping over was the introductions. They were repeated over and over and over again, and they're paragraphs long.Evidently time flowed strangely back in the mists of prehistory. Events of a couple weeks crawl by at a snail's pace, and then all of a sudden several months fly by and the book is over. Why, Ayla didn't even have time to invent the microchip or pilot the space shuttle!Several issues were brought up and then dropped, never to be mentioned again. Perhaps they'll be resolved in the next book, which I will NOT be rushing out to buy in hardback. I'll wait until it's remaindered and pick it up for a couple of bucks. What a waste of my time and money!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Having been an obsessed fan since I was 12 years old, when I first read Clan, the anticipation of Auel's fifth book has occupied my thoughts for more than ten years, and mine was the first name on the waiting list at our library for more than a year. I expected The Shelters to be bursting with the same life, challenges, innovations, and relationships as the other four; needless to say, those are not present to the degree I imagined. First, a nitpick: Auel's forward, in which she acknowledges support from many, many different sources, contains no statement thanking \\"Gentle Reader.\\" The reason this is upsetting? There are ten of them - ten long years between #4 and #5: ten long years of Ayla, pregnant and poised to meet the in-laws; of re-reading and then re-reading again and at the end of Plains, waking abruptly from the dream to...nothing; ten long years in which Auel's fans sat a vigil, waiting for our \\"fix.\\" To not recognize that one's readers are paramount, in fact are the lifeblood of your work, can be considered a serious lack of judgement. If this was an oversight, so be it - but the recognition was necessary, and missed. End of nit. Now - forward, ever onward. My ambivalence is an issue of loyalty vs. the need for a good read: I am almost ashamed that I am dissatisfied. The research is well-grounded and descriptive, but not present is the expansive attitude and attention to minor detail employed so effectively in the previous titles in the series. The culture, customs, products, and activities remain largely unexplored and in fact appear as mini-essays with no clear beginning, no clear end, and no tie-in to the passages in which they are included. Interaction is relatively bland. I was not nearly as fully drawn into this book, emotionally and intellectually, as I was with the others. I find the repetition of the Mother's Song highly irritating, very close to offensive and insulting, and am not ashamed to say that I skipped it after the second recitation. In addition, the constant rehashing of prior events (which was never present in such abundance in the first four) is quite distracting, and seems to me like a gimmick to fill space, as are the continual, nearly word-for-word, demonstrations of spear-thrower and firestones, and the paragraphs devoted, over and over, to the naming of ties. Worst of all? No thrills! Where is the highly-foreshadowed conflict between Ayla's Clan upbringing and mixed-spirits son and Jondalar's closed-minded people? Where is contact with the Clan itself? Where is the wildness? Where is the 'newness?' Where are the GUTS? There ARE echoes of greatness, very faint, but present nonetheless. They're just crowded, slightly faded, and overlaid with curiously flat detail. Development of the storyline never quite seems to ring with Auel's past definitive harmony; relationships between characters fail to deepen and become quite as vital, or as vibrant. I love the ongoing story, but I'm unsatisfied with the execution. I'll stick with the series because I'm hooked and because the story in essence is delightful and sustaining, but when I re-read in sequence, instead of the feeling of slipping back into Ayla's bountiful world, with its breathing people, living landscapes, and accompanying whole-body being-thereness, Shelters of Stone will be something I have to get through to get to the final book - which I dearly hope regains the charm, charisma, and adventure of the others. Summing up: character development and relationship exploration - almost nil. I didn't bond with anyone. Plot - bearable but plodding, inconsistent incohesive, no twists, buried under a jumble of names and places. Style and tone - a shadow of what went before, undeserving of Auel's talent, lacking in verve and nerve. All in all, entertaining but a disappointment, worth reading simply because it fulfills the obligation of \\"what happens next.\\""},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Home at last, our wandering prehistoric couple. After 173 pages, I have progressed through less than three days of the return of our hero, Jondalar, with his exotic and mysterious Ayla to the Zelandonii people. On the fifth or sixth day---I think I have lost count---we are dissecting the anatomy of a prehistoric funeral. To get to this high point, I have endured some of the lamest dialog, been subjected to pages and pages of rehashed material from the previous four books, and been bored to sleep with excessively detailed descriptions of the local flora, fauna, and geology. Much of the dialog reminds me of old television westerns like the Lone Ranger. Images of Jimmy Olson and Clark Kent popped in to my head at one point. The writing does not meet the quality of some young adult literature. I have read the first four books, more than once, the Clan of the Cave Bears at least three times.At page 256, I had to return this book to the library for renewal---which was disallowed due to demand. Now, I may never finish; little in the first third of this book compels me to pursue the last two thirds. There are too many other books in my reading list to waste my time with this fifth bloated sequel.What ever happened to the writer who created the first four books of the Earth's Children series?"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Not surprised to see reviews that agreed with mine. Waited over 10 years for this book - loved the first four. Fifth is a re-hash of books 1-4, no depth or richness to characters - very superficial. I kept \\"waiting for it to get good.\\" I periodically re-read the first 4 books simply because they are so complex and always learn something new. Not in this one. Don't see how Ms. Auel can wrap this up in only one more book. As an avid, avid fan - I was totally frustrated by this read!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I discovered this series right before the 4th book was published and loved the first three books, devouring them all in a row and cherishing them. I found that Plains of Passage (4th book) began to be more about anthropology and history than story line. This 5th book has the same problem. I was waiting anxiously, for about 10 years, for this book to be published and ran out to buy it in its' first week of publication. Reading the introduction, I realized the author has spent many years researching the anthropology and sociology and history and that is to be commended. It seems apparent that she jumped through many hoops to be accurate and informative in her writings. Unfortunately I felt the story was a bit lost in the details of the factual writings. (I feel sad writing anything negative about this book though, as I do love the series and appreciate Jean Auel's hard work and dedication to \\"getting the information correct\\".)Despite my love of this series and of the characters, I found it hard to be captivated by this book. With her previous writings (especially the first two), I stayed up very late at night because I just could not put the book down. That didn't happen with this novel, I am sad to admit.There were too many facts, more detail than I ever care to know about. Yes, I am interested in the ways of life way back then, but I don't care to hear of such detail about how a food storage bin made of rocks is constructed-to me, that is boring. I guess I am a visual person and many times in this series I have wished for small line drawings on the sides of the page to illustrate some things such as the spear-thrower, a hide being stretched out, or the weaving loom, or the appearance of an herb used for medicinal purposes. I want more story and plot and emotions than information about their lifestyle.Just when I was curious about what would happen next, there was too much detail about things. For example, just taking a walk to take a bath ends up being a lesson in biology of plant life. I kept thinking, \\"get back to the story\\" and \\"for goodness sake, just take a bath\\". Another example is that near the end when Ayla is very close to going into labor (to give birth) they are talking about how to make a knife blade. At that point with less than 40 pages to go I'd had enough of the academics and wanted her to have the baby, for goodness sake!In the beginning of the book the days drag through, one day's time spans many pages. With the business of the story in those first days, added in with the factual information, it was too much. Then at other times of the story they suddenly zoom by in number of weeks or months.I would have preferred more story and more emotions. There were many times when I felt Ayla should have had stronger emotions and they were not written about. There were also some occurrences that I thought could have been played out in more detail or picked up later in the story, although perhaps that will happen in the next (and last) novel. For the diehard fans of the Earth's Children series, I think we'll read the book (despite any negative reviews) and cherish the book anyway, (reminding ourselves it is still superior to most fiction out there). The fans will anticipate the last installment of the series, and to see how Ayla makes out in her next phase of life."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This book was a complete disappointment. It basically meanders through countless pages of soft porn and repetitive descriptions with no plot or character development. None of the characteristics that made her earlier books good reading (insight into anthropological discoveries about human origins and development, descriptive scenes in which we are introduced to prehistoric animals and habitats, well-developed characters whose behaviors are motivated by plot twists) are in evidence in this volume. Instead, we are left with luke-warm husks of characters, many of whom are simply introduced on one page, only to disappear for good two pages later, with no seeming connection to the plot, and with no contribution to the development of the story. Ayla, who in previous volumes is portrayed as a strong, confident heroine is reduced to a sniveling, weak and submissive creature who continually worries about her mate's undying love, meeting and anticipating his every need, and being a happy little hearth-wifeThis trite novel takes a shallow, sophomoric look at current social ills such as alcoholism, single motherhood, and child neglect and applies cliches in the form of Ayla-turned-social worker to redeem them. However, the characters involved seem one dimensional and one feels that perhaps they are in the book simply to provide an opportunity for Ms. Auel to expound upon her social views.Finally, there are no conflicts to resolve, no obstacles to overcome, and no real reason for the reader to continue to turn the pages of this dull book. It is, quite simply, an overblown soap opera put in book form. In short, you'd spend less time and money on a Harlequin Romance, and probably get a better story."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I wish I'd read the reviews before I rushed out and bought the book. I've been waiting with baited breath for 11 years for this book, and I couldn't be more disappointed. CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR was terrific; VALLEY OF THE HORSES was interesting; THE MAMMOTH HUNTERS was a little disappointing because of all the cavegirl meets caveboy, cavegirl loses caveboy, cavegirl gets caveboy back. But I enjoyed THE PLAINS OF PASSAGE, trying to figure out what part of Europe they must be in.I agree with a reviewer who said that it's amazing that an editor let this stuff fly. It totally pains me to say it, because I was such a fan. The book could have been cut in half if all the endless introductions were left out and the repitious backstory condensed.Even when the story was tired in the other books, I was interested in the healing aspects, the literary suppositions of religion, and the other anthropology insights.It read like a lot of cutting and pasting to me. Wish it hadn't."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Reading Marcinetta's review... \\"it's a beach/plane reading book\\"... made me realize why I enjoyed it as much as I did. I was surprised that I liked it as much as I did, but, I was reading it on the plane and at the beach. Fun, light reading that I could easily jump in and out of. Honestly, after her last one, I almost didn't read this one. I'd pretty much given up on Jean Auel's series. I was so bored by the long drawn out \\"Plains of Passage\\" and the ridiculously drawn out sex scenes. While her new novel suffers many of the issues you read in these reviews, this book is better than her last one,and I did enjoy reading it. The key was not going into it with high expectations. I think that is the key to these books any more. We all got hooked with \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" 20+ years ago...Ayla is like an old friend and you just want to know how she is doing. My opinion...if you are into these books, read this one, it's better than the last one. And I actually look forward to her final novel. I'd like to learn more about the Zelandonnia spritual word, and if Jean Auel heads the reviews of her readers, just maybe she could do justice to the final book in this series."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Maybe I had to wait too long for this book. Maybe Auel was pressured into writing it & her heart wasn't in it. Maybe she didn't even write it. Some one of these has to explain the vast difference in enjoyment I experienced between the first 4 books and this one.The more I think about it, the more I wonder how this book even made it out the publisher's door. There was too much repetition & rehash (after 12 years I think readers had too much time to read & re-read the other books and know the past backwards & forwards). Not enough interesting plot development occurred - everything that I expected to have happen in maybe the first 1/4th of the book took the entire 700 pages, and little new or unexpected things happened to spice up the expected events. I suspect 90% of her readers could have fashioned a more exciting plot than this book had, especially after having over a decade to let their imaginations go at it. There were too many characters and sidelines to the story partially developed & then dropped. With all the wait between #4 & #5 I assumed extensive research was involved, but the background development resulting from any research was far inferior to the depth of the 4th book.This book is, at best, an uneventful bridge to book #6, IF Auel's readers are not too annoyed at having rushed out to pay hardback prices for this one to even bother to buy the next one. The things of importance I took away from this book could have been conveyed in a few chapters of the next one. Surely the editors could have seen how inferior this book was to the first four. The publishers can only have been concerned with reaping hardback revenues, not maintaining the author's reputation, to have allowed this book to go out their doors the way it is. I cannot imagine the paperback doing well at all, and if there is to be a 6th book, she has a major redemption task in front of her."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Most of THE SHELTERS OF STONE is pretty tough sledding. Ayla and Jondalar arrive at the Zelandonii caves. The people are amazed that she's tamed animals, Wolf and Whinnie and Racer. They're even more amazed when she shows them a better way to build a fire and her thread puller (the needle). Later, she saves an injured man by suturing his wounds. By now we should know where this is going. I have to confess that I didn't, until maybe the twentieth time Auel has the head medicine woman/doctor/priest, Zelandoni, ask Ayla if she's ever thought about studying to become a zelandoni (the priests have the same name as the people). If we look at SHELTERS OF STONE, as a transitional novel, it's not as hard to take. Ayla must learn to accept the fact that she has an obligation beyond becoming Jondalar's mate and the mother of Jonayla (I don't think I'm giving anything away there, since I was able to predict the name of the baby as soon as I learned she was pregnant).Despite its transitional nature, the novel has numerous flaws. There's no plot. There's no real antagonist. Auel fumbles about trying to find one. Laramar, a drunk who won't take care of his children, hates Ayla because she's a foreigner, yet is given a higher status. Brukeval, who's part Neanderthal, loves Ayla but hates himself because he can't admit who is really is. Marona, Jondalar's former girlfriend, tries to embarrass Ayla by giving her clothes meant for a boy. Ayla's so far superior to any of these people that we don't worry much. So then, the only remaining thread is Ayla's journey to become One Who Is First among the Zelandonii. Pretty dry stuff. I would imagine most people wanted to know if Ayla would find Durc, her son by Broud, a truly worthy villain from CLAN OF THE CAVE BEARS. But she's only nineteen in this one, and he would be about eight years old, living far away. You'll have to wait for the final book of the series (if you're willing to read it).Another flaw would be the constant repetitiveness. It's almost as if Auel was her own editor. That can't be, though; she thanks one in the acknowledgments. The worst example is Ayla's idea that men contribute to the birth of babies. I didn't count the number of times it was mentioned, but it must have been at least two dozen.There's some clumsy writing going on here as well. The poem at the end of the book is terrible. And the sex scenes are embarrassing.So now we know why it took Auel twelve years to write this novel. I can hear the arguing now among the editors at Crown. Will anybody buy the next book after suffering through this one? Probably. But the people at Crown and Random House and Scribners and Little Brown should think about delegating their responsibilities to agents and their sales forces. I loved CLAN OF THE CAVE BEARS and the following two, but I won't be reading the next one, I can guarantee you."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I enjoyed all of Jean Auel's previous books and looked forward very much to the next in this series. After 10 years I had expected a work surpassing the previous. Unfortunately this book does not fit the pattern of her scene-setters. It is clear that JA has expended a lot of effort researching the location and prehistory and she commits a lot (excessive amount) of this tome overlaying the known around the characters-who-might-have-been. But now the credibility that one person made all these discoveries and had so many extreme characteristics begins to pale.What is lacking is story. I could summarize what Jean Auel stretches over 750 pages into 3 sentences. Several times we are led to believe that there might be some action, but potential fades to disappointment and more monotony. I did not put this book aside for two reasons. First, I was always prepared to give her the benefit of the doubt, based on her earlier books. Second, I hope/trust that this volume is a scene-setter for her finale, which hopefully will provide more reader interest."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Unlike most true fans, I have not been waiting for eleven or twelve years, I just finished the series last summer. (I'm a junior in high school.) However, that does not change the feelings that I have for this book. This was so repetitive that it bored me to death. Not only do we hear constant introductions, which get so very, very long, we also hear about the animals, former discoveries, and long descriptions of the landscape and what the animals look like, and so forth. We are led to believe that there will be a dispute between the Clan and the Others, yet nothing ever happens. We are led to believe that there will be arguments between Ayla and Marona, Brukeval, or Laramar, yet nothing ever happens there either. We also are led to believe that Zelandoni of the Ninth Cave will talk with Ayla about all kinds of things, yet it really doesn't happen. After the buffalo hunt, not only does it disappear after someone gets trampled, it jumps again to something else. The book is well researched, but not as well as in the past. We never really hear about Ayla's medicine skills, until toward the end of the book when a boy and Wolf are both hurt within about fifty pages. The summer meeting is anxiously anticipated, and yet again, NOTHING EVER HAPPENS!! What happened the wonderfully written books we have all read? This was a major disappointment to me. Can't Jean do any better than this? I hope that she has a good excuse, because twelve years is a long time to come out with a book like this."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I just finished reading Shelters of Stone and I have to say that I expected more in the PLOT department. I enjoyed the new adventures of Ayla and Jondalar in the land of the Zelandonii. I appreciated that they have finally reached their destination and can rest... I wanted to learn so much more about \\"what happens next\\". I think that there are really only 5 or 6 major events in the story and they are, for the most part, left in limbo for the next book. I understand the concept of leave them wanting more... but I would have liked to get a few of the book' issues resolved in the 700+ pages. By the time I was at the end of the book, I felt that there was still so much story to tell...As I was preparing for the release of book 5 I did refresh my memory regarding the storylines of the other 4 books. I am sure any other fans did the same. Most of the repetition was not necessary. I got tired of reading the repetitive sections of the story and found that I was skimming the text until I got to something new... although I think that I too may have memorized the song of the Mother. How many meetings must be chaired for there to be any action on the part of the Zelandonii regarding Ayla's \\"new information\\" regarding flatheads.I was very interested with the storyline between Ayla and \\"The First\\", I suppose it could have been resolved sooner... not much of a surprise there, especially considering her history in the previous books has been sort of leading up to this. I got rather frustrated that I was the one with the realization before Ayla. Usually she is so perceptive... maybe with others and not herself???This being said, I am still looking forward to book 6 and I hope that it will answer my questions and tie up all the loose ends in Ayla's Journey. I just hope that Ms. Auel gives me a lot more plot and a lot more credit."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I fell in love with this series when I found out I had a disabling diease. I was weak and felt lost. This series gave me strengh to fight back and make me feel better about myself. I felt like I was Ayla out there all alone. The Valley of the Horses gave me the most strengh and is by far my favorite.I felt in The Shelters of Stone there was too much repeated discription of the shelters and rock formation. I also go tired of the long introductions with family names. I did enjoy the story and discription of Jondalar's family and friends. I thought the map in the book was very helpful although if you don't have the other book handy it is had to tell where Ayla started from with the Clan.

The problem is, it lurches forward for something like 700 pages. Ayla has journeyed with Jondalar (her mate) home to his people. All of them have names like Marona, Farona, and my Sharona (sorry about that) and they mostly welcome her. Ayla goes about her usual tall blond medicine woman persona (it's catching) while sharing pleasures with Jondalar, and being the very best cave person she possibly can be. All the while she is tormented that her new family may discover her Neanderthal heritage and tragic past. Let us leave the neolithic Martha Stewart to her pleasures and reread Diana Gabaldon. Forget it."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"It's been said by others, and I will agree. There is way to much repitition from other books. I never want to see the 'Mother's Song' again and I am very well aware of how to domesticate wild animals. But, honestly, that's not what irritated me about this book. What bothers me is the lack of follow through. I waited and waited for a major confrontation with Brukeval, Laramar and Marona and in the end all I got was Ayla's acknowledgement that she had made enemies. Was it Madroman who was leaking the secrets of the zelandonia? No mention was made of it after Zelandoni said there was a serious problem she had to take care of. After Ayla and Jondalar's trial isolation, not much else was mentioned about the summer meeting. Jonadalar's trip back to the cave to make Ayla a dwelling could have been interesting, adventurous and touching, but it was totally glossed over. He left, he came back. I did like Ayla's relationship with Zelandoni. I also liked the side story of Lanoga and Lorala and later, Lanidar. I would have liked to know what happened to the other children. Ayla was going to make Bologan some clothing with his help, but that part of the story was not told.Overall, if you are a fan of the series you need to read this book. But I really hope that Ms. Auel ties up the loose ends she left in this book when she does the sixth. It would be nice if the final Earth's Children book came out in a year or two, rather than 12."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Mrs. Auel did a brilliant job with her first book, Clan of the Cavebear. Having read everything after, it is painfully obvious she was lucky. All the books after bear out the fact that she should have stayed a housewife, and not pretend to be a professional writer. Someone has taught her how to pad a book with repetitive musings by the main character about events from the first book, ad nauseum. With this latest installment, she has perfected the craft of telling very little story while piling on the number of pages to justify the hardback cover price. I think Mrs. Auel ought to be ashamed of herself for putting out such trash. However, I imagine her aim is to pad her bank account better than she has padded her books."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Rock formation, rock formation, new character... etc.The sad part is, the rock formations are more interesting than the new characters.

If she could not be more imaginative, she shouldn't have written another book. There is absolutely no tenuous story line. There is no intrigue and tension. Come on, do you think having to wear boy's underwear in public is high stakes? Even the birth of Ayla's child is an anticlimax, and the baby's name is atrocious. Every possibility of danger alluded to is dropped by the wayside. Nothing pans out. After reading adnauseam about the strange rock formation, and previous books' reference to them, nothing huge is revealed. Much repetition and nothing new, other than being a lengthy author's forward to her next sequel.My daughter bought me this book for Mother's Day, and I had looked forward to reading it for 10 years. I absolutely love all of the other books in the series and still continue to re-read them yearly. It pains me to have to give such a negative review for Shelters of Stone. I'll definitely read the next installment; however, I'll borrow it from the library first before I decide to purchase."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"It seems like we had to wait forever for this installment of the Earths Children series and I believe it was worth it overall. I found The Shelters of Stone a wonderful continuation of the story of Jondular and Ayla but the constant referring back to previous books a little to much to bear. I found myself skipping pages at a time because the same scenes were being brought up from books past.That is my only criticism. I do have to say that I will purchase and read the last book in the series the day its released but I hope it will not flashback as often. Will it answer all the questions provoked by the previous 5 books? Will it end with the 6th installment or grow further? What will happen to Ayla, Jondolar and their child? I also hope it doesn't take 10 years for it to arrive. I do recommend this book to all who enjoy stories of prehistoric culture. Those of my friends who gave this series a chance were not dissappointed. Neither was I."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I am a huge fan of Auel's earlier books. I enjoyed reading about the certain discoveries of Ayla and Jondalar, the descriptions of the landscape, etc. I looked forward to this book for many years, but it did not live up to my expectations.In a 1,000+ page book, the entire goal was to get to the Summer Meeting. It took 700 pages for Jondalar and Ayla to walk into camp, then finally make the journey to the Summer Meeting. What happened in those 700 pages? Not much.However, there were plenty of name recitals: \\"Ayla of the Zelandonii, daughter of the Cave Bear, wife off Jondalar the Traveller and Flint Napper, friend to Whinny and Racer, subject of boring book, creation of Jean Auel\\", etc. My guess is that if you took out all of the name recitals, you could knock 100 pages off the book.Sadly, a tedious and uninteresting book.

This is the one I have been waiting for, where Ayla gets to settle in and really work on her identity - instead of the other books (which I also enjoyed) where there was change and high drama every few chapters. The conflicts were subtle but continuous and I felt that Ayla and Jondular became more \\"real,\\" encountering people and problems that we can relate to. As for the detail, while there is quite a bit, I also enjoyed it and even went out on a successful hunt in the local woods and found / used soapwort as well as a few other things as described in the book."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"if that were available.

I had anticipated a final chapter, with Ayla meeting Durc and her Clan at some point, and living up to a dream she had about Durc and a new child she had meeting on perhaps dangerous ground. Or maybe I just dreamt this plot. At any rate, since MS Auel is writing another book, I sincerely hope she can get down to a continuation of the story and not simply a rehash of prior books with one new event!!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I read the first chapter on-line at Amazon, and was a trifle suspicious as it was yet again the usual intro with the \\"meet the animals....etc etc\\". However I figured that after the last debacle of \\"plains of passage\\" where 50% of the book was a repetition of the previous 2 books, the editors had put their 2 pennysworth in and some strict editting had come into play. After all this one had taken 10 years to complete!!!!???!!So it was my birthday and thought why not complete the set... and I paid good money and bought the book!...I was [cheated]There is nothing new, in fact to look at the 5 novels in total, if you removed all the repetitions from them all (e.g. She's preggy- so she has to pass water frequently not just once once -but twice- three or even more.... ) (and Jondalar does love to clean his toothypegs with a wintergreen twiglet!!! 2-3 times in SOS, 3 times in POP, 4 time in MMH, and twice in VOH) theres really isn't enough story line to support any more than 3 books.In fact there's certainly no new story line in this book. If you look back to The Mammoth Hunters it was inevitable that she was going to be the all powerful earth mother..... she didn't even struggle much against it... so what could possibly be new in the next 6th book? just more of the initiation into Auels version of yet another ceremony.... It would have been much more interesting if new characters had been developed after the Valley of the Horses, and we moved a decade on from these people. After all she's been going around spreading these \\"radical\\" ideas around.... So.... what did happened back in the mamutoi camp when she left??? ...... What did happen to Broud, Durc and and all the other characters ....???It really isn't good enough....... the first 2 novels were excellent...... but p'raps Jean Auel needs a ghost writer to complete the series."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Well, I'm glad I wasn't holding my breath for this one. What a disappointment. The plot (such as it is) takes so long to unfold it isn't funny. Much of the book is just revision of events in previous books. While this may have been somewhat justified (after all, it's been a long time since the last one), the stories really only needed to be repeated once. But instead, Ayla and Jondalar repeat the same information at great length to various people over and over again. Surely \\"Ayla explained about finding Wolf\\" would have done, rather than a three paragraph reminiscence every time someone new was startled by Wolf.The long descriptions of pretty much everything in Ayla's environment also became wearing for me. While most of the interest in the books is reading about how humans used to live, the amount of description and way it is phrased was a bit much for me. In one passage the author actually referred to the sun as 'the shining orb', which left me thinking of Flora Post's tortured literary efforts in Cold Comfort Farm.It was also amusing to note that Jondalar's sexual technique has not varied in the slightest since the previous books - apparently he is a one-trick pony. Although I genuinely like the characters of Ayla and Jondalar, this book was dull reading for a lot of the time, and not in the same league as Clan of the Cave Bear."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have a tendency to agree with the editorial comments about this book rather than the readers' comments. I didn't think that this was a bad book at all. On the contrary, I think it was a good reintroduction to this world of Ms. Auel's. The only negative comment that I have is that there was a lot of repetition about previous books in the series, but I think that can be attributed to the fact that it's been twelve years since the Plains of Passage was published. Ms. Auel, I'm sure, felt that she had to bring everyone up to date since it had been so long. I found the book a wonderful representation of what life would have been like for these people in a normal year(without wars, trials and tribulations). Plus we got a real good picture of the way things were made and just what these people had to do to survive in what could be considered a cruel and hostile environment. I also found that at the end of the book, there is a lot of ground work laid for what is supposed to be the last book in the series. Now Ayla and Jondalar are mated, they have a new daughter and Whinney has a new foal. Bring on the rest of the saga.

I was so excited when I heard the book was coming out, but like many others, I have been sorely disappointed. Nothing exciting happens. There could have been great conflict with Jondalar's ex or with Brukeval, but there was nothing!! All we had were Ayla and the ever smiling Jondalar (how could one guy smile so much) and a smart ... One Who is First. She was one of the most irritating characters I've read in a long time. She was pushy and a know-it-all, not the spiritual leader one would think. Ayla has become way too wonder womanish. She does it all, and I guess no one else has ever thought of any of these things! I will read the next book, but it will take a miracle on Auel's part to make me a believer in Earth's Children again."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This book is one of the mose tedious reads I've ever slogged through. What a dud! Nearly 800 pages, and NOTHING HAPPENS. Auel has become so enamored with exploring her characters' motivations she's forgotten the need to entertain. This book is more of a paleoanthropology text than novel. Auel introduces scores of characters and gives none of them depth. As usual, Ayla is a superwoman who can do anything. Single lines of dialogue are often followed with up to two pages of descriptive asides that left me wanting to scream, \\"Get on with the story!\\" That is, if there was a story. If this was the first book in the series, it would never have seen the light of day. Auel repeats scenes over and over, such as people's fear at first spotting Wolf. Jondalar is his usual wimpy self who doesn't come to Ayla's defense when she's humiliated by Marona. All these pages, and there's ONE action scene! And even that one doesn't directly involve Ayla or Jondalar. It's probably for the best, since Auel has always been a terrible action writer. I can't believe I waited feverishly for 12 years for this turkey. Where was her editor? The book is full of hundreds of pages of needless descriptive detail that rob the story of any momentum. Auel seems to think it's entertaining to the reader to spend nearly the whole book inside her characters' heads. This one is even worse than that prehistoric romance novel, The Mammoth Hunters.

After four masterpieces of modern American art and a twelve-year wait, fans of the Earths' Children series were given a novel which could be more purposeful holding up a broken table than as a cherished classic.The main problem with the book is that Auel is EXTREMELY repetitive in her descriptions of things that the reader should already know. It took the author over 300 pages to describe one week, during which she elaborated on the horses--Whinney and Racer-- numerous times; the fact that Ayla has an accent and sounds different than everyone else, which is obvious considering the lengths she traveled to get there; the firestones... I could go on and on. She spent amazing amounts of time describing ideas that the reader already knew, and then ignored new topics, the most important examples being Ayla and Jondalar's mating and their child.Now, am I a complete pessimist and have absolutely nothing positive to say in the novel's favor? Similar to Auel's previous literary works, she does do an execllent job describing the landscape and other details. She also came up with some interesting ideas and points throughout the novel relating to the social norms of the Zelandonii people.As a Auel fan, I would suggest buying this book in the effect that you will need to know some of the things that happened in The Shelters of Stone for the next book that will hopefully come out soon and relieve us!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Got this book as a Christmas gift at my request because I, like a great many other people, waited a long, long, long time for the fifth book to appear. How do I tell my son what a horrendous waste of his money this book was! I have read the other reviews so I won't go into great detail. The one-star reviews said it all for me. Don't want to risk being as REPETITIVE as the author. However, quoting P.T. Barnum, \\"There's a sucker born every minute\\". How true...I'm one of them. Terrible book. If you feel you must read it, get it at the library."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I was so disappointed in this book. 741 pages of not a whole lot happening. Ayla and Jondalar finally made it to the Zelandonii people to meet his family and friends. They get married. She has her baby. That's the whole book in a nutshell. So what was on those 741 pages? Ayla meets every single person that Jondalar knows and we get to read about their formal introduction each and every time. Sometimes the intros take a half a page. Ayla gives her formal titles each and every time as well. Each and every person who meets her hears about how 2 horses and a wolf came to be her companions--and we do too even though we already knew about it 2-3 books ago. A lengthy three page poem about Mother Earth--we are treated to this not once but THREE times. Was Jean Auel's editor sick or on vacation? As always, Ayla is a compelling character and Auel's descriptions of stone age life are fascinating but there isn't a lot of meat to this book and hardly any conflict. You keep waiting for something to happen but it never does."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I was fortunate to start the whole serious back in February, and by the time I finshed Plains of Passage, Shelter's of Stone was out the next week. I am facinated with the entire serious, and this one was just as great as the last. I am a huge history buff, facinated with pre-historic times and anthropology, and this entire serious had taught me so much. Ayla is such a beautiful character, and Jondalar is a man that the reader falls in love with right along with Ayla. The book inspires so much in the imagination, thinking about what life looked like back then, the people, the landscape, the wildlife. Its facinating, the research that must have gone into a project like this series. I'm not one for really giving a review on english standards, I just know that I loved this book for the creativeness of the characters, the imagination it inspires, and the research of history that went into the book(s). I eagerly look forward to the sixth and final book, but I don't think I can stand to wait another few years for it to come out. And once it does, I don't think that I'll want it to be the end."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This book is MADE of stone--and prehistoric conversation. Endless and infuriating recapitulations, a lethargic pace, non-plot, characters with not a whit of life to them, useless, tedious, drawn-out descriptions of rocks and topography, and worst of all, dialogue that would disgrace one of those softcover books that fifth-graders buy in school. Have I left anything out? I wonder if Jean Auel ever did have anything to offer besides earnestness and a certain tempo. \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" has been blown up with helium four times, each time with less and less content and more and more pages. I have read every page she's written up to now and I feel foolish for having done so."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Plot SPOILERS follow: THE SHELTERS OF STONE is the fifth installment in Jean M. Auel's sweeping Earth's Children saga and is a must-read. Here, the author continues the story of Ayla and Jondolar as they've now navigated their way to what will become south-west France and have finally reached Jondolar's home of origin. Jondolar is heartily welcomed by his people, the Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii, and especially by his high-powered family and his former love Zolena, now become the massively statuesque Zelandoni, the mystical and spiritual leader of the Ninth Cave tribe. Ayla, however, is greeted with curiousity and with a pinch of fear and suspicion as her exotic looks, different way of talking, and unconventional mannerisms (not to mention her horses Whinney and Racer and her fearsome Wolf) combine to make her an uncertain entity.THE SHELTERS OF STONE takes place over the course of many months, chronicling Ayla's quest for acceptance from the denizens of the Ninth Cave as the Zelandonii go about their normal, every day struggle for survival. A huge portion of the book tells of the Ninth Cave's migration to and the goings-on in the annual Summer Gathering, the traditional time in which massive hunting and gathering take place to prep for winter. It is the site of official mating ceremonies amongst the various Caves, and also wherein Ayla makes a momentous discovery. From the outset, Ayla makes herself an invaluable member of the community as her innovative healing methods, consummate hunting skills, and generous, helpful spirit intrigue and captivate many of the Zelandonii. Additionally, Ayla's revolutionary method for creating fire and her almost magical ability to communicate with her animals go a long way into gaining her acceptance and status from Jondalar's tribe and, later, from the other Cave tribes.But, naturally, it's not all milk and cookies, light and goodness...The Pleistocene era was fraught with many a hazard which constantly challenged the Cro-Magnon race. Savage predators, the inimical climate, and tribal and social politics and infighting often prove to be an unlucky combination which Ayla and her adopted people must strive to overcome. The issue of the Zelandonii's deepseated prejudice against the Clan (the Neanderthals), derogatorily dubbed \\"flatheads,\\" often rears its head in this book, especially affecting Echozar and his intended mate Joplaya, half-Clan Ninth Cave member Brukeval, and, of course, Ayla, who herself was raised in a Clan and had given birth to a half-Clan boy. Along with the bitter Brukeval, Ayla's strongest detractors number a malicious, jilted ex-girlfriend of Jondalar's and a disgruntled and slovenly brewer discontented with his lowly position in the Ninth Cave hierarchy and jealous of Ayla's rapid escalation in status. Meanwhile, the Zelandoni of the Ninth Cave, much impressed but simultaneously wary of Ayla's varied skills, talents and ever-growing influence on her people, is determined to add her to the ranks of the priestly Zelandoni so as not to undermine that mystical sect. But Ayla insists that she just wants to be Jondalar's mate and a mother to his child. Will fate intervene?Ayla continues to be a luminous heroine and I'm always up to reading about her and her exploits, but other characters, while not as compelling, become quite endearing. Jondalar continues to be a steadfast (though kinda boring) love interest, but I quickly grew fond of Folara (Jondalar's perky younger sister), Marthona (Jondalar's wise mother), 12-year-old Lanidar of the deformed right arm, and, of course, Whinney, Racer, and the awesome Wolf. The Zelandoni of the Ninth Cave, unfortunately, proved to be too enigmatic and controlling for my taste.I read THE SHELTERS OF STONE years ago when it first came out, and I've just now finished re-reading it. Glancing at this webpage, I was startled by the pretty low overall rating this book engendered from the Amazon reviewers (an average of 2 and a half stars from more than 700 reviews). Having read a number of the negative reviews here, I noticed that some of the beefs seem to be that many passages are repetitive, that Ayla may have been depicted as too perfect and too universally desirable, and that the author just may have lain too many discoveries or inventions at the feet of her protagonist, to the point where a certain believability was sold down the river. But here's the thing: other than, perhaps, the numerous ongoing callbacks to events transpiring in past books (which actually helped me out as I've forgotten several details), none of the other perceived miscues bothered me, now or when I first read the book.Now, I haven't read the five books in quick succession, having instead read them as they were individually released, so maybe perusing the novels one directly after the other would lend one a better insight to any \\"decline\\" in Auel's writing. I dunno. In fact, for some unfathomable reason, THE SHELTERS OF STONE is the only Auel offering I've read more than once. Be that as it may, I haven't observed the author's writing in any state of decline.With respect to the Ice Age aspects and the anthropological details found in this series, Jean M. Auel wouldn't have sold millions of copies if not for the strong, very rootable archetypal character of Ayla. No, I'm not a real fan of pre-historical fiction; rather, it's the story of this resourceful Cro-Magnon girl raised in a Neanderthal clan that drew me into the author's world. Now, I'll even agree to having become blinded to the author's possibly flawed, too ideal depiction of Ayla. I don't care. I'm perfectly content with her being portrayed as a humble, loving, beautiful superwoman with an instinct for healing, nurturing, and indiscriminately helping those around her. Those are the qualities I'd long admired in Ayla as she persists in persevering and overcoming her travails, and I don't believe that Ms. Auel has overdone the maintaining of these qualities.Auel's talent lies in seamlessly weaving in her research with a reader-friendly narrative style which eases the reader into the flow of the story. A friend did comment negatively on the endlessly lengthy fashion in which the characters introduced themselves to each other. But, remember, oral traditions must have played a very key role in the Cro-Magnon lifestyle, so all those long-winded intros, to me, are very relevant as they directly impact the cavemen's sense of selves and their pertinent place in status, lineage, and history. At 700 plus pages, THE SHELTERS OF STONE never got boring for me, even the second time around. Now, I wish Jean Auel would just go ahead and finish off the sixth and final book already. It's been a while, and I have a yen to catch up with my friends from the Pleistocene era..."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I just finished reading *Shelters of Stone* after it sat on my bookcase for almost four years. I enjoyed all four of the preceding novels. Therefore, I forsook my '39 page rule' (if the author hasn't hooked me by the 39th page, I give the book away.) I expected that in almost 800-pages, Ms. Jean would get around to introducing new concepts, new cultures, new \`happenings', or new stuff. But *SoS* turned into a repetitious travelogue of *Plains of Passage*. It is long, ponderous, dull, and boring!I was astounded when I noticed that this is review #756, and the average rating is 2.5 stars. Look at the bell-shaped curve of 1 and 2 star reviews predominating, tapering to the least amount of 5 and 4 star reviews.The story dies after page 200, the author seemingly tired of writing the book and proceeded to pad it with 570 more pages of repetitive recollections from past novels instead of finishing it off in 400 pages. Perhaps Ms. Auel was paid by the word!But I kept plugging away, getting more and more upset at Ms. Auel for explaining almost everything repeatedly--the long-winded name introductions; the stories of finding and domesticating her animals; the customs of the Clan, how much an angry Brukenval looked like her old tormenter Broud. Even the \`sharing Pleasures' parts were repetitious. And when the \`The Mother's Song' was repeated for the 17th time, I almost gagged.What's also bad about this mammoth effort is that nothing happens. No new inventions and no new places (other than some under-described caves and cave paintings). She introduces new characters, but most are one-dimensional and uninteresting. The ones who do show some promise--like Brukenval, or Larimar the brewer, Echozar of the mixed spirits, or even the ponderous Zenandoni are neglected, under-described, or under-utilized. Auel prefers her repetition to fleshing out these characters, creating interest, and advancing the story line.In the previous novels Ayla and Jondalar were responsible for most of the technological and philosophical advancements of humankind to that point: the spear thrower, use of flint and steel in starting fires, the sewing needle, domestication of the wolf and horse, the horse halter, the travois, human genetics theory (Ayla's theory of mixed spirits), and where babies really do come from. In *SoS*, Ayla and Jondalar invent nothing, go almost nowhere, and do little except share Pleasures, get mated and have a baby. Oh yeah, I forgot. Jondalar's Mom does invent weaving.There are no major threats from nature, animals or people; no clash of cultures. Just flares of Cro-Magnon temper and different opinions on the nature of \`flatheads'.For almost 800 pages I kept waiting for something to happen, for Durc to show up at the head of The Clan. For a blizzard, a flood, a plague or earthquake. Another adventure or trip somewhere would have been nice. There wasn't even the trademark Auel anthropological monograph on how to make a flint axe head, basket or garment.I'll probably get suckered into the next/last book in the series if she ever completes it. But first I'll read the Amazon reviewers opinions and if it is recommended by you, I will rigorously apply my 39-page rule."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Other reviews here are pretty blunt about the weaknesses of not only the 5th book in the Earth's Children series, but of the growing problem since The Mammoth Hunters.I am a great fan of the series. I enjoyed learning about the theoretical and practical landscape of the time period. I would think about a description of a plant and try to relate it to something I might find in my backyard, or imagine gouging out a slab of wood to make a bowl, or picture the handworking of a hide.Ayla is meant to be \\"every woman\\", so it's through her we're introduced to insights and inventions and deep observation. I am sorry that Ms. Auel didn't think to hand more of these to other characters, and have the main characters carry them along on their Journey. The Plains of Passage alone would have been much improved, as well as truer to the nature of discovery and invention.I have always been disappointed in Jondalar's dimensionless character. He's not a match for Ayla. As it stands, he's barely there. He was a one-dimensional, homesick worrier on his brother's Journey in The Valley of Horses. A self-pitying mess in The Mammoth Hunters (I actively disliked him and couldn't understand why Ayla would love him at all by the end of that book) and a selfish, annoying worrier in The Plains of Passage. By Shelters of Stone, he lives up to his potential. With nothing left to worry about he's barely present except to agree with everything Ayla says or thinks.There was so much that could have been made of him, especially in this book. Ayla is a stranger and he is home. That theme was reduced to a one-liner in Plains of Passage. Imagine how that might feel; what tensions it SHOULD have created between them. He's welcome, she's excluded. Her fondness for flatheads and the (completely forgotten and unlived upto) hatred of them by the Zelandoni people. Jondalar suffered (interminably) through self-doubt in Mammoth Hunters, yet didn't flinch a moment once he was home. (Where, in the face of his friends and family and witnesses to his childhood indescretions, one could reasonably assume he'd have at least an uncomfortable moment.)Ms. Auel was at great pains to explain the kinship debts and value-exchanges between peoples. Yet, Ayla's foreign origins are glossed over and made trivial except as tension from a single misbegotten Zelandonii drunkard. This alone should have been explored and shown to be deeply difficult. Status was, and is, a hotly contested reality even today. Anyone who's worked in an office and had to settle for the broken stapler and a small cubicle would understand it.How would they handle a woman without status, and no visible wealth, without knowable ties mating into a well-placed family? Why wasn't there more dissention and why wasn't Ayla involved? Why wouldn't Jondalar lose status? In my opinion, he should have. His family should object, not everyone should automatically love her. It would set up some good tension and give Ayla something to overcome.I appreciated a great deal about The Shelters of Stone. As another reviewer pointed out, not all conflict is overt. Ayla makes enemies here. (although I note, she is never 'responsible' for it.) Peer pressure and conflict is introduced. Inability to overcome prejudice and fear. I liked the author's poem-song, very much. I was rather sorry she beat it to death.Ms. Auel explores more deeply the concepts and ideas that might have surrounded death, mating, and conception. I truly liked reading the reactions of some people, like Denanna, (who weren't demonized first, that is) to new ideas. We don't fall in love with new ideas immediately, and human nature hasn't changed that much in 35,000 years! I also liked reading about reasons that a large populace might break itself into smaller settlements, and even hints about the origins of all the settlements throughout the books. I liked the exploration of the Zelandonii homelands, the cave painting descriptions, and the spiritual side of the people brought to life.However, I have to agree that the Ayla character has suffered in the last books, as well. Though independent, smart, and willful she wasn't perfect. She made mistakes. Now she's become cardboard; she never does. If someone dislikes her, there's always an underlying indirect cause. She's always happy, content, and able to relate. She only gets angry on behalf of someone else. She's lost her humanity.I'm with other reviewers on this score. Not everyone has to think she's nice and beautiful. More people should be envious because she's given status they will never see, some should hate her because she brings uncomfortable change, some because she is rather arrogant, or because she has no compunction about challenging their long-held beliefs.Agents of change cause conflict. Where is that in the portrayal of Ayla and the society she's trying join? We've been promised it through thousands of pages. Here we are! And what happens? Nothing.The only conflict we're given is weak; caused by spite and mental problems. That's not only insulting to the established storyline, it's weak storytelling. People aren't that polar. There are any number of shades of feeling. Ms. Auel did the same with Frebec in The Mammoth Hunters and it was every bit as disappointing then. Why couldn't Frebec keep right on hating her? He valued normal and she was anything but.I also have to take exception with a tone change in The Plains of Passage and The Shelters of Stone. In these last two books there are polemic passages. Using supposition and fiction to draw parallels with modern views and comparing those views disfavorably. I'm a feminist, and I abhor vilification and intolerance, but I don't think that living 35,000 years ago made mankind perfect or astoundingly open-minded.Finally, I have to agree with the repetition problem. I firmly believe that the allowance of chunks of repetitious and tedious material is due to the length of time between books; to give us something hefty to read in exchange for the increasingly long waits.If I had the ear of the editors, I'd recommend not doing so. I'll be honest, if I wasn't hooked on Ayla's story, I'd have stopped with Plains of Passage. I just want to find out what the denouement of the story will be at this point. I skip-read a lot of Plains of Passage and The Shelters of Stone. You could be winning whole new fans of the series with a solid, 350-page engaging story rather than frustrating series fans with a 750-page tedious one.Charlene Dewbre"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Oh, I hate to write this, but Shelters of Stone is a TREMENDOUS disappointment! Stephen King often says that he is accused of having \\"diarhhea of the word processor,\\" but that condition is better applied to Ms. Auel and this monstrosity.To bring you up to speed: Ayla, after many fantastic, interesting and wonderful adventures, finally arrives at the Ninth Cave of the Zelandonii. Yay! We look forward to meeting many intriguing people (we meet one, two tops), we look for conflict because of her upbringing (no big deal), we look for lots of interesting details of her pregnancy (the birth takes, like, 2 pages total), and we grudgingly expect descriptions of the landscape (TONS), and of the flora (EVEN MORE).The book seems to have been written with the aim of a stand-alone novel in mind. Fans of the series will quickly tire of the endless repetition of past stories from the previous four books. Once or twice wouldn't be terribly hard to deal with, but three, four or five times? And oftentimes the passages are lifted straight out of the previous books! However, even new readers will tire of the lack of plot, lack of character development, lack of adventure, lack of everything except constant repetitive description.The editors of this book either were out to tea for 12 years, or they are incompetent.I can only hope that the few dangling mini-precursors lead to a more satisfying sixth book (said to be finished and locked in a safe-deposit box waiting for the next decade). One can only hope...."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Oh Goddess, deliver me from the interminable sex scenes that were about as repetitious (not to mention stiltedly, embarrassingly worded) as those with my comatose, alcoholic ex.

I actually cringed in some parts...!Aside from the \\"tumescent manhood\\" references, what else can I say about this book that has not already been said by legions of pissed-off reviewers?Yeah, I'm an Auel freak, yeah, I've waited forever for this book, yeah, I paid full price for it at the buttcrack of dawn the first day it went on sale (which I never do, being too cheap to buy hardcovers ever, but this was the long-awaited AYLA book!). The repetitive, pages-long introductions, the collective amazement as Ayla reinvents everything from fire to sewing needles to possibly deodorant pantyshields with wings, gets old in a hurry. The new information in this book could have been boiled down and extracted to maybe 200 pages. It's been a long time, but I'm not quite suffering from Alzheimer's yet, and it was rather insulting to be handed, verbatim, chunks of the other volumes and endless explanations.There *was* a part where I was moved to tears, but for the life of me I can't remember when...I gave this two stars instead of one (and had there been a no-star rating I would have given it one) due to the fact that--despite Ayla turning into the Martha Stewart/Barbie/Britney Cavegirl Conglomeration from ..., it was nice to wander back into her world again. Like coming home.Way too many characters with forgettable, silly names (did she really have to name the baby Jonayla?!). A few well-developed, multidimensional characters--as in the first book or __The Mammoth Hunters__--would have done more for the story. I spent way too much time flipping to the back to keep everyone straight, and for folk who were mentioned once or twice, unimportant to the story, and then forgotten.Jondalar turned into a slavish, dumb lug, which was disappointing (I kept picturing him looking like a slackjawed Fabio clone). His undying adoration wore thin after a few pages. And Ayla--I used to love her, but lordy, has she morphed! The only interesting character in this story was Zelandonii.I did so want to say something positive about this book. I even reread it. Ayla's world, even the Paleolithically perfect one she now dwells in, is preferable to mine, and it does provide escapism. But I think next time I'll settle down with one of the first three, and hope that Book Six is better!In the meantime, I'm putting my copy up on [local store] for the bargain price of [price] or so, if anyone wants it.

That's my theory after reading... what's it called? The Mountain of Mediocrity? The Ravine of Redundancy? The Boulders of Boredom? Oh, right -- \\"The Shelters of Stone\\". This reputedly took twelve years to write, and seemed to take at least that long to read.I usually enjoy kvetching as much as the next person -- OK, probably more than the next person -- but it truly pains me to pan \\"Shelters of Stone\\". I've been a fan since \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\", and have read all Jean Auel's previous books many times. Like other fans, I looked forward to this book, and I *wanted* to like it -- but SOS (note initials; they're appropriate) is the literary equivalent of a clip show, and not even one which put any thought into selecting clips.As far back as \\"Valley of the Horses\\", Auel included expository flashbacks so new readers could keep up. While *some* explanation might be necessary, the flashback problem has increased exponentially with each successive book in the series, and at this point, it's truly unwieldy and distracting.It seemed as though *everything* that happened in SOS recalled some similar incident in the past that then, of course, had to be dredged up. Entire chunks of all four previous books appear to have been recollected verbatim. At one point, Ayla encounters opposition from Labrador, the dirtball town drunk, and wonders whether she'll have to demonstrate her firestones to win him over, as she did with Freebird, the dirtball town drunk of the Mamutoi, who opposed her two books ago in \\"Mammoth Hunters\\". When even the *character* is rolling her eyes and thinking, \\"Oh, no! THIS again?\\", you know the well is running dry.In addition to over-reliance on flashbacks, the book is *internally* repetitious. The same scenes, conversations, explanations, and introductions -- zillions of introductions, with all of everybody's names, titles, and affiliations -- and (Goddess help us all!) that long-winded poem/song (which wasn't riveting the first time around, let alone the third) are repeated, not just once or twice, but what seems to be every few pages. Then they're repeated again. And again. It's not only repetitious, it's redundant. Very redundant. The same thing over and over. She goes on and on. She doesn't seem to know when to quit. Sorta like this paragraph. Boring? Annoying? You betcha.Worse, for all the book's cumbersome length and wordiness, it doesn't seem to actually *go* anywhere or *do* anything. Pages and pages are spent on obviously painstakingly researched factual information about various flora and fauna, which I enjoy -- *up to a point* -- and which probably would have enhanced the story if it had been applied with a more sparing hand...And, oh yeah -- if the book had *had* a story. There was potential here, which never got fully realized. Auel ended the previous book with Ayla and Jondalar arriving at the caves of the Zelandonii, and at the end of this book, 700-some pages later, that's pretty much where they still are.The many confusingly named characters (there's a glossary in back, but I was already doing enough page-skipping as it was), basically just milled around. The good guys and bad guys are equally bland, and no character is developed to the extent of, say, Creb in \\"Clan\\" or Talut in \\"Mammoth Hunters\\". If Auel felt she had to write a book this long, some of the space might have been better utilized by creating characters with depth and complexity, and giving them something interesting to do, instead of yet another description of the medicinal properties of such-and-such plant.We're repeatedly set up for *something* to happen: Will there be a confrontation with the Clan? Will Madonna make trouble? But nothing happens, or something starts to happen and then is immediately, effortlessly resolved. Other plot threads simply fizzle out, as with Bologna: Why was he found unconscious? Did he fall down in a drunken stupor? Did someone assault him? If so, who -- and why? After a flurry of speculation, the matter is abandoned, and we never find out.Ayla and Jondalar have become -- dare I say it? -- boring. With nothing to do, they've deteriorated into one of those eighth-grade Going Steady couples that the rest of us found so sickening, holding hands and saying, \\"I wuv you, Pookie\\". I was wondering how they'd make the transition from adventure to domesticity; how they'd interact with the rest of the Zelandonii (whom I'd presupposed to be a lively and varied bunch like the Mamutoi); how Ayla would adjust to motherhood (especially because she never really got much chance to experience motherhood the first time around, since she was separated from Durc so abruptly); how she would feel when a baby wasn't an idealized memory, but a day-to-day living creature who demanded her time and energy, even when she'd rather be doing something else; how Ayla and Jondalar's relationship would change once Ayla got a few stretchmarks on that perfect body of hers and was too busy to make Jondalar the center of her attention (he's obviously high-maintenance)... It's debatable whether that would have been a better book, but at least it would have been a *story*, not just a lot of strung-together flashbacks and rambling descriptions.Aside from the fact that I think Auel can do much better, the actual writing style doesn't seem like hers. The hundred-odd pages that don't consist of repetition are curiously flat, with none of Auel's usual sparkle, richness, and gusto. At no time was I pulled into the story, as I was with previous books.Even the most die-hard fans should beware. I don't think Jean Auel is capable of writing a truly bad book, but she's obviously capable of writing a disappointing one. Sigh. I guess they can't all be gems."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I am a big fan of the Earth's Children series and was looking forward to reading the latest novel.

How many times can you describe how Ayla came to tame a wild horse (in excessive detail)?I believe that the book did a good job of setting up the final book in the series, but I am confident that I could have skipped book 5 and not missed anything of importance."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"In a way it was almost inevitable that Book Five would not please everyone, because there was so much anticipation building up to it (for 12 years, no less). Perhaps there was also too much expectation that this book be like the other books.The way I see it, each one of the books has its own \\"theme\\" or flavour. Book 1, was of DISCOVERY - we were finding out and learning a lot along with Ayla. Book 2 was of INDEPENDENCE where Ayla learnt to rely on herself, and was very innovative and discovered things that were later to become her greatest achievements (eg befriending animals, fire stones, not to mention Pleasures *lol*). Book 3 was about SOCIALISING - Ayla learns about the Others, represented by the lovable Mamutoi, and there's the fun along with confusions and misunderstandings. Book 4 was about JOURNEYING - Ayla goes from place to place, and learns heaps about how others do things.However, Book 5 is about SETTLING IN - Ayla has reached \\"home\\" and is just trying to settle in, she meets her in-laws (as Auel herself puts it!), gets mated and has another baby. If you compare this theme, it is definately not as high-powered or interesting as the other books' themes, but is a valid theme in itself. Sure, I agree there was more repetition than was totally palatable (the endless introductions, the fire-making three times, the Mother song in great detail twice) but in a way it really sets the pace for \\"home\\" - home is not a place for massive bouts of discovery or difficulties; some petty in-fighting yes, and Ayla's motherly side is evinced in greater detail, but nothing really earth-shattering. Another reviewer said in a earlier review that this book was not so \\"tense\\" to read, and I think that is certainly true, there is an almost relaxing homely quality to reading it. That's one thing I had noticed about Auel's books, they set what I see as the themes off very well. For example, when I read Book 4 about journeying, I felt really tired by the end of it! In fact that's the one book in the series I would not casually pick up to read just like that; like Jondalar, it's going to be sometime before I want to make another long Journey again! Likewise, Book 1 had me feeling very curious and enjoying discovery; Book 2 was highly sexed; and Book Three was full of complex human relations - and it all brought me into the themes on a viceral level. Therefore, I wasn't too put off that Book Five was kinda a Comfortable read!The other reason why Book 5 might be not as satisfactory is that unlike the other 4 books, it is not self contained - there are a lot of loose ends to be tied up in Book 6. In Book 1 there was closure as Ayla left the Clan; in Book 2 there was closure when Ayla's solitude ended; in Book 3 there was closure when she left the Mamutoi; in Book 4 there was closure when she ended her Journey. In Book 5 though, nothing's been resolved with her enemies, and Ayla has just struggled to accept that she is going to be One who Serves, but she hasn't embarked on anything yet. Therefore, IMHO Book 5 and Book 6 in a way will form \\"one book\\". There will be closure of the issues brought up in Book 5 in Book 6, the theme of which I tentatively predict will be SPIRITUALITY. Afterall, Auel herself drafted Book 6 at the same time as Book 5.So cheer up everyone, I'm sure we will all enjoy Book 6 tremendously - it's when Ayla will fulfil ther great potential. In a way, she is almost like an incarnation of the Mother herself, with her Lumi-like Jondalar by her side!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Like the other reviewers, I was profoundly disappointedin this book.I was a loyal Auel reader for her first four, thoughadmittedly they descended into mostly tedious botanicaldescriptions and repetitive sex scenes by the third andfourth books.There was so much potential in _Shelters of Stone_--apregnancy, marriage, Other-Clan relations, intrigue.But none of it is developed. I can't believe how muchtime Auel spends on inane repetition of details fromthe earlier books, and on incredibly annoying sidecomments to the reader about scenery and reasons fortraditions. (A good author makes those clear fromthe story.)Much of the book reads like a bad home movie, withno editing--for instance, we read about how Ayla wasthinking of stopping to say hello to Folara, and thenhow she does but Folara is a little bit busy rightnow, so they decide to talk later when she gets achance. I mean, please. Who needs to read that??My eyes started to glaze over at around page 200, whenreally there had been no plot development whatsoever.This book reminded me of the movie _The English Patient_(though if possible, it's worse)--the darn thing goeson about three times as long as it needs to. Really,for the number of years Auel spent on this book, she hasproduced a surprisingly poor result.I wish that a loyal Auel fan would condense/edit/revisethis book and add some punch to the plot. There area lot of people who would really like to read about whathappens to Ayla. But please, not another thousandthidentical breast->oralsex->intercourse scene."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I've enjoyed the other books in this series, but the newest book in the \\"Earth's Children\\" series was not worth the wait or the price. There is very little plot here - Ayla and Jondalar arrive at his home, and meet the family and tribe. The relatives have no personality to speak of; they are Ozzie and Harriet cut-outs who are won over to Ayla in a few seconds. The paragraph-long introductions of people to one another with all their ties, etc. quickly becomes interminable - the book could have dropped a good 50 pages or more if this had been eliminated. There is no way you will actually read through them all. Auel doesn't go in-depth enough with her research results to hold my interest. Looking into the crafts and techniques of the times could have been interesting. The conversations between characters are ludicrous and the logic mystifying. I mean, you have a people that can't think up an imaginative name (and just use numbers for each cave address) for where they live but can rattle off complicated mathematical descriptions of flint flakes (bifacial lateral triangles). Yeah, sure. There are many little plot-lettes - scenes that could have been expanded into an actual story line but are never explored. The \\"bad\\" guys don't do much more than plan one practical joke and throw a hissy fit. Maybe Auel will follow-up on some things in her next book, but at this point, I don't care what happens to any of them. Auel has cheated her audience."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This book was a disappointment. Like so many others, I had fallen in love with the characters and couldn't wait to see what would happen when Ayla finally met Jondalar's people. Talk about a let-down!Clan of the Cave Bear was such a good story with well-developed characters whom we got to know well. Even the minor characters were developed; for example, we knew that Ovra was shy and reticent, that Aba and Aga picked on Ayla in the hope of building themselves up in Broud's eyes, that Ika was friendly and outgoing, and that Goov loved his mentor and adored his barren wife. Even those most minor of characters were real people. The plot-line was solid; Ayla had lost her family and had to learn to fit in with a completely different type of people to whom she could not even speak. The only thing I never liked about that book was the long passages describing the flora and fauna; it would have been far better for Mrs Auel to work her research into her storyline. Instead, the research was completely separate. But my sister liked those research passages, and we all loved the book.The Valley of Horses was compelling. I got bored with the long-winded descriptions of how to make a boat, but the characters were again richly developed. The conflict between Jondalar and Ayla as they struggle with their different backgrounds was realistic and gripping. The reader became a part of the struggle and desperately wanted these two to get together and accept their love. It was very emotionally stirring with a solid plotline: Jondalar is traveling against his will, wondering what is the point to life, and finally meets the woman of his dreams. Ayla, meanwhile, has grown up as different and ugly and never fully accepted, believing she will live alone forever, and finally she meets a man who treats her as a rare jewel instead of merely tolerating her. VoH is an unashamed love story.Initially, I was very unhappy with the Mammoth Hunters, because I couldn't bear the thought of my two well-loved characters being apart and so unhappy. I actually cried (which shows that it was well-written). But the writing was rich with well-developed characters and a solid plot-line: Ayla has a completely different way of thinking from the Others, but she must learn to live with her own kind, while Jondalar must make a choice between his comfortable past or starting life with a very unusual woman. MH was realistic. Not everyone accepts her unconditionally: Tulie reserves judgment and Frebec can't stand her throughout much of the book. At the summer meeting, when everyone finds out about Ayla's Clan background, many continue in their blind prejudice while others overcome their revulsion. This was a realistic reaction. Overall, MH was a well-written and compelling story.The Plains of Passage was not so great. The plot-line was destined to be boring: the long journey back to the Zelandonii was rather redundant, with lots of traveling and then meeting people, and Ayla's background coming out, and then the revulsion and then acceptance, and then the whole thing over again. The traveling sequences were especially dull; lots of descriptions of the landscape, Pleasures, and that's about it. At least Auel gave us some little different adventure at each stopover; we had the broken arm of Roshario and revelation of the facts around Doraldo's death at the Sharamudoi, the evil leader of the Sharmunai, the rape of Madenia at the Losadunii, and the acceptance of Echozar by the Lanzadonii. Thus Plains of Passage was salvaged from utter boredom by Auel's addition of various conflicts to overcome throughout the book. And Auel developed many of the minor characters along the journey; in spite of their brief visits with all those different groups, the readers got to know many or the secondary characters well.Shelters of Stone, on the other hand, was pointless. We're all still trying to figure out what was the plot-line! OK, I know, it's supposed to be Ayla learning to fit in with the Zelandonii while struggling with the pressure to become a shaman. But what a mess Auel made with the story! First of all, none of the characters was developed. After 750+ pages, we still have only superficial knowledge of anyone in the Zelandonii. And where is the struggle to fit in with these people? We spent the previous three books with constant stress over whether or not Jondalar's people would like Ayla, to the point that they almost didn't go back, and now she just waltzes in and fits in like she's always lived there. No one cares about her Clan background. Heck, they even have an \\"abomination\\" living with them (Brukeval)! I'm sorry, but that was just too unrealistic after all the agony Ayla's background brought into their lives in the previous books. There should have been a huge reaction to Ayla's clan upbringing, just as there was at the Mamutoi summer meeting. Then there was the introduction of so MANY different minor characters, none of whom was ever developed to any degree. Was Auel having a contest with herself to see how many names she could come up with?The plotline of SoS was actually the same plotline as the Mammoth Hunters: Ayla has to learn to fit in with a group of people in spite of her background, and she is pressured to train as a shaman. The only difference is in the subplots: in MH, Ranec lures Ayla away from Jondalar as J struggles with his feelings, while in SoS, uh..... there was no compelling subplot to rope us into the story. Both books cover the same amount of time (about 8-9 months), but SoS is just so pointless. Why did Auel write this book? What was the story? All we saw was Ayla introduced to a bunch of different people, so many that we can't even remember their names. She goes hunting with her new people: whooptie-do. She sees cave paintings, attends the summer meeting, and comes home. There was no story here, folks! This could have been a look into the life of my next-door-neighbor!I believe that SoS would have been a compelling and worthwhile book if Auel had bothered to develop a few select minor characters, just as she did in all the previous stories. Where she went wrong in SoS was to introduce dozens and dozens of new people and then to have them all parade through the pages of her research without a single person standing out. Not even Zolena or Marthona is developed to any degree. Ayla should have had personal and deep relationships (good and bad) with a few individuals. These few people could then go do all those things Auel wanted them to do. But there should have been real people doing them. In Shelters of Stone, not even Jondalar was a three-dimensional person. And Ayla herself was almost 2-D.The book was truly disappointing."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Pre-historic drivel......I forced myself to read almost every word....the alternative entertainment would be drilling holes in my head with a slow drill. Even the sex scenes were cut and pasted from earlier work......And how many dramatic inventions and cultural innovations can one gorgeous 19 year old come up with? Please.......And we had a contest at our house: who could aloud read from 'The Mother's Song' the longest without dissolving in laughter. Is this a humorous book?"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Only once before in my life have I failed to finish a book because it was too bad to continue; The Shelters of Stone makes that twice. Not since Clan of the Cave Bear, and perhaps Valley of Horses (which was good, if not as engrossing) has Auel turned out a really good story. Quite frankly, all I remember of the third and fourth books is that every time you turned the page, they were having sex again. The story line in The Shelters of Stone is not only boring, but the language is stilted and bland, and not at all helped by the fact that Ayla (a character I used to admire) seems to feel she must explain every little detail of life, over and over...and over, pointing out repeatedly how she knows and understands what nobody else does. Why did I buy the book? Once again, I had hoped that Auel had returned to the style of her original Clan of the Cave Bear, only to find she had not only continued her bland style from the last two books, but it's actually gotten worse! (Makes you wonder, quite frankly, who's been writing what.) Well, on the bright side, the book is thick enough to make a good doorstop."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"It was with great joy that I discovered the 5th book was finally being released. That joy dampened with each page I turned. It is never a good thing when a reader can literally skip several pages without missing a plot point. Very few novels need to be this length, Shelters of Stone is not an exception to this rule.Ayla and Jondalar finally reach his home. The cave with the great overhanging stone eluded to in The Clan of the Cave Bear. Once there, Ayla meets Jondalar's extensive - extended family and gets ready to finally celebrate their matrimonial. There are several characters who naturally cause minor ( and I do mean minor ) problems for the super-couple but they are easily overcome. Eventually they marry, start a home and Ayla delivers her new baby, Jonayla. I have to agree wholeheartedly with a previous review that said Ayla treats the birth of her child and the child itself almost as an afterthought.It is inconceivable that a woman who was forced to abandon her first child and misses him to the point of obsession can be so cavalier about the new one. After the harrowing birth of Durc, this was a minor point in the novel. She does look at the child and her reaction, \\"Look darling we had a baby! Isn't that special?\\"My 2 major complaints are the mountain of useless descriptions of the flora and fauna of the area and the endless round of introductions. It could be argued in \\"The Plains of Passage\\" that such pages of descriptions were important as they journeyed across Europe. Here, they add ZERO to the plot. It's not necessary and frankly, it's boring. It does seem as though Jean wants to justify her years of research by throwing it all at us in one fell swoop. As for the 'formal introductions': Even should this installment of the series be the first a reader reads, they are repetitive and useless to the advancement of the story.Beyond that, the characters are terribly two-dimensional. Either they LOVE LOVE LOVE Ayla or hate her with an all-consuming passion. There is never a middle ground. There was NO character development. I wanted to hear more about the people, NOT their clothing and dinner arrangments. We wanted to know WHY the boy was beaten. We wanted to know about the character lives, not cave wall irregularities. For all the talk about Joplaya and Echozar's mating, one would think they'd be given more than 2 lines of dialog...which leades to another point.Ayla has been speaking the language Zelandonii for roughly 2-3 years - almost exclusively in \\"The Valley of Horses\\" and \\"The Plains of Passage\\". She's suddenly ignorant of words she's already used in that language? She suddenly forgets her preposistions, articles, etc? In \\"The Mammoth Hunters\\", she would frequently switch to Zelandonii because she was more fluent in that language - only now it's the opposite and Mamutoii is easier?The Zelandonii are remarkably accepting of her Clan background. This is inconsistent with Jondalar's almost violent reaction when he learned of it.The editing itself is terrible. Misspellings and punctuations errors abound. The proofreader should be fired.Last but not least, the ending was an indecent plug to buy the next book to see if Jean can tie up the mountain of loose ends.Read it at your own risk- buy it used if you must buy it at all."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I was so disappointed and bored with this book. So many passages are repeated and so much that I wanted to scream! I felt the book was so dry it could have fell apart in my hands. The other books in the series had life, adventure, and character personality that drew the reader in. Not so here. She fills the pages with boring detailed landscape descriptions that made me want to cry! I thought if I had to read through one more repeated \\"formal introduction\\" or sexual encounter between Ayla and Jondalar that she reused and reused through the book I would cry. I truly feel she threw this nonsense together to take monetary advantage of those of us who had enjoyed the first books. I really expected better. What a waste of my money and time."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I was excited to get this book, but quickly became disappointed in it. I almost started counting how many times someone remarked on what a beautiful couple Ayla and Jondalar make. There is no focus. The point of view is so spread around I started expecting to see points of view from various animals who happened to see the couple. In her earlier books, she had that tight focus of one or two points of view, which made for more tension and drew the reader into the characters. Not in this one.And the constant repititions of observations and various processes for making things made up at least a third of the book.So I ask - where was her editor? Was Ms. Auel padding for word count? She dragged a simple story into a huge, boring tome. As much as I want to see what happens next, if her next book looks as large, I won't waste my money on the hardcover..."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I personally bought this book, read it all the way through, and have read all of Jean Auel's previous books in this series. Of them, \\"The Valley of Horses\\" (arguably her best book) was terrifically engaging, mainly because the sexual tension between Ayla and Jondalar was so intense...every reader MUST have had an orgasm when the characters FINALLY did. However, it must be said that \\"Shelters of Stone\\" probably is a waste of time and money. Among its most noticeable flaws are these: The overuse of the verb \\"noticed\\". Ayla was forever \\"noticing\\" something. The constant repetition of the word/title \\"Zelandonii\\" in all its applications was highly annoying. The \\"Martha Steward\\" aspect of cave life, according to the author, was hard to swallow. Should we really believe Cro-Magnon people CARED about such things as shelves, decorated partitions, nice plates and cups? The weather was always fine. Give me a break...let it be cold and damp once in a while. Just about everything that occurred was rehashed at least twice again later on in the narrative. Whinney, Ayla's horse, is a \\"Przwalski horse\\" according to the list of characters (more correctly a \\"Przewalskii horse\\"), yet her offspring, Racer, is a \\"Cherski horse (rare)\\" according to the same list. If this is a real species (1) Whinney must have founded the strain for the story or (2) it is so obscure that none of the references on equine evolution mention it. Maybe it's supposed to be a color variation. Another hard-to-swallow event is the \\"summer meeting\\", where we are asked to envision a camp of over 2,000 people, all camping and foraging in the same area for a season. Just think of the sanitation problems! Ayla goes bison hunting on Whinney with all her baskets of herbs? Hard to believe everything didn't fall out at a gallop, not to mention the poor mare had to carry extra baggage. Lastly, all the characters have three syllable names (except Ayla and her animals, for some reason)and, once you notice THAT, it's hard to concentrate on the story and keep a straight face at the same time. This could be a good \\"beach book\\", it's certainly long enough, and you can stop anywhere and pick it up days later with no problem. Nothing ever really happens in the entire 754 pages to engage the reader and make him/her CARE. One final slam...the cover art is pretty inaccurate and disappointing. Yes, I probably will buy/read the next/final volume, sucker that I am. Hopefully, Mz. Auel can find it in her heart to forgive my luke-warm review. My apologies."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Jean Auel is a thougtful and entertaining Storyteller. I gave her latest entry to the Earth's Children Series an extra star simply because she does have masterful ability when turning a true tale of fiction -- as was done in \\"Clan\\" and \\"Valley\\". This installment, however, is nothing more than a recitation of archeological and prehistoric research facts, coupled with excerpts from previous books in the series. The detailed and often boring descriptions of local fauna, rock formations, and environmental evolution reads almost schorlarly.While it is not surprising that she has become an educated and skilled researcher over the years. I do, however, miss the characters and the simple story! When I pick up a book of this type I want to be entertained, not educated.I guess Jean's writing like our species also had to evolve. Too bad it went commercial and she could not continue to humbly tell the story of a few larger than life characters while sitting at the kitchen table.

And in every book Ayla is just at the right place to save someone badly hurt, there to be the big helper when there is a crisis. Can't Mrs Auel try something new?

Not even a brief \\"thank you for your patience\\" on her dedication page to all of us who put her financial portfolio in the stratosphere these 20+ years.It apprears she took her loyal readers for granted in a big way. It's obvious from the writing that she doesn't care about her characters or fans anymore. That's her right. It's also my right not to buy any more books from her - not that she needs the bucks.This book was an insult to her fan's intelligence. She wrote it like we had complete amnesia about Ayla's previous exploits. It was like she was more concerned with making the last 4 books understandable to a brand-new reader - as if any new reader to Auel would pick up book #5 from her series on purpose!My biggest gripe (and they are legion) is the spooky feeling that Auel didn't really write this book. It's hard to put a finger on, but the writing just doesn't have the same \\"punch\\" as the last 4. I think she simply lost her momentum and interest for the story in 12 years. It's obvious that her interests lie more with the archaeology/anthropology aspect than with the creative writing aspect - and it shows.I still give Auel kudos on her prior masterpieces - she deserves them, but I'll be very cautious about anything else she writes from this point forward, and I won't buy her books sight unseen. I'll read them from the library first!Jean, I hope you read all these reviews and take them to heart. We love Ayla's story, but are real disappointed in this offering.

AUEL \\"Earth's Children\\" I beleve is one of the most inspiring series of books out there. Yes it a series based in prehistoric ice age and the accention of man as the dominant species, but many over look that it is an moving love story. Its sory line has significance even to this day. Ayla cromagnon woman raised by neaderthals has to cope with being a minority in a male dominant society. It deals with racial inequalities, mix marriages ,standing up for what you believe in, and the power of women. It teaches that flexability,family, and tolerence is what make us human. It teaches perserverence, fortitude, and resilience when faced with survival. If your life depended on grouping with others for survival, it would you give a life altering experience that few have known. I believe todays society would benifit from this. Often I have wondered if I lived in prehistoric times would I have the courage of AYLA and all she faced. These books offer that experience to readers and also teaches early birth of moral values. The love between AYLA and JONDALAR is very real, and they faced many things that young and old alike face today.It also ponders the question when face with over welming odds that humans create, adapt, perserveer. I have recommend this series to all that can read. The sex scenes are just that, sex in the raw form, not shameful, or imoral just a very natural wonderful showing of love. Many only know the movie with Darrl Hanna as AYLA in clan of the cave bear, which I beleve she did a wonderful job, but that only scatches the surface of the wonder of ALYA full story. These books are self contained so each are a story in of them selves. Very easy reading and imformative.

I felt like Auel spent 750 pages setting up for the 6th book. There wasn't anything in \\"Shelters\\" to keep the reader engrossed. The last 4 books I couldn't put down, there was plot, conflict, interesting characters, etc. In \\"Shelters,\\" where was the central plot? Auel gives us the setup for some intersting things to happen (Marona, Laramar, Brukevel, Madroman, Ayla's training to become Zelandonni, trading and/or conflict with the Clan, etc.), but she never delivers the action, only hints at possibilities that we can only hope will be revealed in the 6th book. All I can say is that there better be a 7th book or the 6th book better be really long, because I don't see how she can cover and conclude everything in any other way. I love Auel, and I loved seeing my old friends again, I just miss that Earth's Children's feeling..."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Extremely disappointed after so long a wait! This book was overly long with much repetition not only from previous books, which I understand, but within the same story. Enough with \\"The Mother's Song\\"! I found the writing poor and not engaging, character development lacking and far too much time spent on describing, very confusingly, the \\"cave\\" environment and surrounding landscape. Here's a thought...illustrations!! The \\"map\\" inside the covers did not help! This seems to be such an interesting time in human history but Auel fails to really address this fully. The descriptions of how things were done (i.e. cooking, tanning hides, etc.) were great but...as an Art History student I was hoping that she might take the cave art aspect and its possible meanings a bit farther. She starts to but then seems to have forgotten that particular plot line and it just peters out. Too bad. Can't say as I'm eagerly awaiting the next one."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Jean Auel should return any and all monies she received from the sale of this book to all the tortured readers who had to endure it!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"For me, this series began phenomenally (Clan) and has slowly but steadily gotten worse. Auel seems to have run low on ideas and resorts instead to recycling material from the previous books. This 5th book is particularly bad about repeating what happened in the previous 4; I got sick of Ayla re-telling some facet of her life's story to every new person she meets. Even if Auel wants to remind us of some of the other books' details, she could have done so much more succintly. Also, she is more repetitive of story ideas than ever -- Ayla heals someone to prove she's a great medicine woman, Ayla goes on a hunt, Ayla proves the value of the horses to everyone, Ayla is ostracized by some people for her Clan background, Ayla forms a special bond with someone who is crippled, blah blah... I understand a lot wasn't going on in the Stone Age, but if you have to repeat some elements of previous stories or some ideas, they certainly don't warrant the same elaboration as in previous books. It says a lot, to me, that I could read the first sentence of every paragraph and occasionally a smidge more and not feel lost in the slightest as to what was going on. Over 700 pages? Please! Less is more, Jean.With that said, I couldn't stop skimming the story. As much as I hated having to filter through this vastly over-long book (even the sex scenes were overwritten, as someone else pointed out, and how many more ridiculous euphesism can we take, really?), I became so interested in Ayla's life in the first three books that I forced myself through this 5th one as I did through the slow parts of 4 and will through 6, and I think fans will find it fun to play in the Stone Age again even if ultimately not much happens.As literature goes -- a really terribly book; as quick reads go, not the worst you could pick."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I would have to agree that there is less tension in \\"The Shelters of Stone\\" than in the first four books- and there is a certain amount of repetition of plot in order to catch up non-series readers - and you can definitely \\"smell\\" a lot of \\"setting up\\" for the next book... I was so grateful to have the next book in the series that none of this mattered. My biggest disappointment was that it seemed to end too soon - kind of wrapped up an awful lot of plot in a very small percentage of the book. However, I would probably have been disappointed if the book had been twice as long - I just didn't want it to end.I have read it three times, bought two CD copies and one audiotape copy for myself, a copy for my sister, and two of my daughters. I guess you would have to say that I am more than fond of the characters. I think Auel has set herself quite a task for the next book because she has set up so many scenarios which will need resolution. I hope that she had the next book planned when she released this one - otherwise I'm not sure I'll live long enough to read it.My thanks to Auel for many, many hours of entertainment, and for fostering an interest in the world of the Neanderthals and Cromagnons.

She didn't even have a plot to the story! I appreciated her descriptions of the land and the crafts of the people in the other books as it was a part of the story. This time around, the scenery WAS the story. Did Ms. Auel write this book right after Plains of Passage and simply decide to publish it several years later to build a craving for this release? I thought Plains of passage was weak. I could have written a better sequel.Bottom line: The book was boring..."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I too had been anxiously awaiting the next in the series of \\"Earth's Children\\". Reviewing earlier plots was fine with me because I had forgotten a lot since the last book. But the book was basically boring. I was anxious for it to end. The worst segment was the complete details about the burial of the man who was crushed by a bison. It just went on and on and on. I wouldn't want to know that much about the burial of any person. And she kept repeating that poem about mother earth. I kept waiting for some conflict with the persons that didn't like Ayla but it never happened. The characters just sounded too modern for the era it represented."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"It seems that Auel was being paid by the word in this 5th book in her series. There is so much repetition and review that a fan of her previous books could skip pages at a time and not miss a single thing. Shallow characters, NO engrossing story lines or characture clashes, and not more than a glimpse of Ayla and Jondalar's new life together. Boring. Take out all the mindless erotica (that I skip anyway and always have), and about half of the flora and fauna descriptions, and every single recitation of the poem, and you will have a 100 page book to segway on to book number 6.

A marriage that was brushed over quickly. 2 other hateful, vengeful people and the flathead issues, 2 births ~and a soft ending.Apparently Jean is saving the interesting stuff for the next book. Because, Alya is not fessing up about her son. An the theme of FLATHEADS are repeative, as well as that poem about the beginning of the EARTH CHILDREN.Jean we got the POINT, we did not need the same thing pounded over and over again.This book left with a flat feeling. I was hoping for some spice not the bland that was a full half of the book.There is to be a final book ? I percieve so. But next time, I will wait on purchasing it.

As an avid \\"Earth's Children\\" series reader, I waited with breathless anticipation for this next book. Basically \\"The Shelters of Stone\\" can be summed up as a rehash of previous books, absolutely no plot and no lead-in to the next book. Haven't been this disappointed since \\"Star Wars: Episode One.\\" Nuff said!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The Shelter of Stone seems to have Ayla and Jondalars' characters at a standstill. They really haven't evolved much from the last book. Ayla has some wonderful insights on different cultures and religion, but nothing really stands out. The book just didn't have the same gusto as the first ones did. The storyline basically retold the stories of the first four books and whatever new things happened (like Whinney giving birth, the same arguments about the Clan,) had already happened. There was really no conflict. The characters didn't seem to be very rounded, one could almost guess what was going to happen next. I did like the book, but it just wasn't as capturing as the first books in the series. I always enjoyed reading about Ayla's healing abilities, but here, she only used them two or three times for the same situation; hunting gone wrong. I dove into this book expecting much more than was given. It was enjoyable, but not a book that would keep me up at night reading. Of course everyone will be looking forward to the next book to see what Ayla and Jondalars' adventures have instore for them and their children. I just hope the next book doesn't repeat the last five."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"After waiting 12 years for the next book in the series, I eagerly started plowing through it. Jean Auel is an excellent researcher, and I am very interested in what life was/may have been like for our ur-ancestors. But she is no novelist! The love scenes, introductions, relationships, pop-psychology, what a pot-boiler! This book should have been 1/2 the length. So much happened in the first few days of their return, that it took her 1/2 the 741 pages to tell and retell it. Disappointing, but then, all of the books have been since \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear.\\" She just runs out of steam."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I too was a little dissapointed in the repeativness (is that a word?) throughout the book. It seems that the first half just repeats all of the other four books over and over again, but then when the new stuff comes, it gets interesting again. It is a must read or there will be unfinished circumstances that should get told and they finally do in this last? book. Let's start a new Project Ms. Auel, and I will be first in line. You are an amazing writer."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"As I was reading this rather thick volume in record time, I realized that it was NINETEEN years since I'd read CLAN OF THE CAVE BEAR. So much has happened to me and Ayla in that time, and it was a lot like becoming reaquainted with an old friend. The references to earlier stories was helpful, albeit repetitive at times, but I'm anxiously awaiting the final book to see what kind of a Zelandoni Ayla becomes, and what happens between the zelandonii and the Clan people..."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This book was interesting in parts, but very boring in others. There was much too much background information, and I found myself skimming much of the book. The love scene dialog was boring and repetative. I would have liked more information about the characters, and much less information about the geography and the living spaces. Not up to the other titles in this series."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The Shelters of Stone could have been so much better. I looked forward with great anticipation to this book and getting reacquainted with the characters, but have to admit I was disappointed. I found myself skipping entire sections to get to the action, and learned little new about Ayla and Jondalar. Perhaps I made the mistake of reading this after devouring a book that has been highly recommended by other readers here: Shade of the Maple by Kirk Martin. Unlike Auel, Martin keeps the story focused squarely on the characters and their unfolding drama, which results in a page-turning plot that moves quickly toward a powerful, memorable ending. Incredible. Rather than resort to steamy sex scenes, Martin uses subtle interactions between well-developed characters to heighten the \\"connection\\" on a deep level, and you never leave this story. I hope that Auel will use a similar style in the next novel to draw me back into her drama."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I read this series for the first time in 1991 and have been waiting for this book ever since.I was very disappointed in the Shelter of Stones. The story had no flow and the main character of Ayla and Jondolar were almost written as secondary characters. They had hardly the level of interaction and romance that made the other books so enjoyable. Most of the book was a rehash of what happened in the first 4 books. She waits until the last 100 or less pages to get them married and have the baby.The authoress spent a chapter and a half talking about characters (whom we never got to meet at all) death. Who cares?J.M. Auel spent 12 years doing research for this and it shows. Her time would have been better spent working on character studies."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I was eagerly awaiting the 5th book in the Earth's Childern series, but it left me somewhat disappointed. In all of the previous books, there were numerous scenes of action, suspense, and intrigue. Even though they all would have the chapters of long descriptions of Pleiostcene life and ecology, they flowed better. The previous books also cover a much longer period of time. I estimated 80%-90% of the book takes place within the first few weeks Jondalar and Ayla return to the Zelandonii! Around a 1/3 of it is the first day back! It then seems Auel realizing how long the book has gotten, quickly moves ahead until its time for Ayla to have her baby. Many scenes were repetitive, Ayla and Jondalar seem to be constantly reminiscing in great detail. Even the expected controversy over her being raised by the Clan seems less dramatic. All but the dregs of Zelandonii society are quick to accept it and believe the Clan is at least worth an acknowledgement of their humanity. But, it was good enough for me to look forward to the next book. Maybe Ayla will invent agriculture or the bow and arrow?? Or make contact with the local Clans?"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"You can't please everyone and I suppose this is just one of those times. I purchased and read this book Saturday and found it just as interesting and enjoyable as it's forbearers in the series. I did find a few draw backs though.There are several grammatical errors that I feel would have been hard to miss if proof-read by a competent reader. They do not necessarily detract from the book, but they are a slight bit bothersome.I was a touch annoyed by the repetition. I did not mind the author&#65533;s retelling of activities in previous books as there were some points that were not as fresh in my mind. Unfortunately, I have to agree with one of the other reviewers in that there are only so many times you can describe how the horses are tamed or Wolf introduced.Regardless of the two points I mentioned above, I found the story entertaining and anxiously await the next book in the series. Hopefully the wait will not be as long."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I've followed these books from the start and was definitely not as gripped by this one as I was with the others. I love the descriptions of the landscape, the animals, the medicine, the people etc, but like others who've commented on the book, the repetitiveness of certain parts just gets annoying. If I'd had a dollar for every time Ayla described to someone in detail, how she came to have Wolf or Whinney, I'd be able to afford to buy the whole set of books in one go!Don't get me wrong, it's a great book and Jean does so much research and has so much passion for her work - but she does tend to get a bit long winded at times. To say 'Marthona introduced Jondalar and Ayla with their full titles' would have been sufficient after we'd read them all the first time!I was also expecting some sort of 'showdown' with Marona or Laramar, but it never came. I hear Jean is currently writing the 6th book, so maybe that's what she's got in mind for those two nasty pieces of work."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I bought Shelters of Stone as soon as it was available. It was a long wait, and I have to say I was relieved to find I enjoyed it thoroughly. My favorite in the series remains the \\"Mammoth Hunters\\", and my least favorite was \\"Plains of Passage\\". \\"Plains of Passage\\" read like a travelogue. I like detail, but hundreds of pages about terrain and moss etc. was a little much. So I was glad to find that with the story back among people that Jean Auel hasn't lost her touch. I can't wait for the 6th book."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I enjoyed the saga up to the Valley of the Horses, and was a little disppointed by The Plains of Passage. But this last book is nothing but a tedious account of the day-to-day life of some stone age tribe. It is slow, repetitive and boring. In fact it is about the only book I haven't finished in the last ten years.Just a book about the properties of plants."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This book was very enjoyable. The characters continue to grow throughout the series. I would have liked more interaction between Ayla and Jondalar, perhaps I expected it after the last book where they were traveling alone much of the time. I also missed some of the interaction with the animals. I did find some stories repeditive as they were retold continually throughout the book. Maybe if I hadn't reread the whole series just before starting this book the reviewing of past stories would have been better apreciated. As for the way they introduce a character everytime they meet someone new it could get pretty old. The end of the book was the best part, I was just getting to the story I really wanted to read right before it ended. Overall I would recomend this book to anyone who has already started this series. Hopefully it will not take so many years for Jean M. Auel to get the next one published."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Wow. Shelters of Stone was the first Jean M. Auel book I read- I was in the store and saw an interesting looking book on the bestsellers rack. So I picked it up, took it home, and started reading it. It was slow at first, and I had no idea what was going on, but after a while I got the idea and started to really like it. The introductions are repetative (\\"Ayla, of the Clan of the Cave Bear, Friend of Jondalar, Friend of Wolf, Protected by the spirit of the Cave Lion...\\"), and some might say the book has too much [love scenes] in it, and I agree- there is a bit too much, it's like, once every chapter. And the detail is repetative. But those are minor flaws. After I finished Shelters of Stone, I looked to see the other books in the series, and I checked out Clan of the Cave Bear from the library. The whole series rocks. I haven't read Valley of Horses yet, the Library didn't have it, but I'm about halfway through Mammoth Hunters."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"For as long as I have waited for this book,(and I went and reread all 4 previous books) it was truly disappointing. I just finished reading it this morning and I couldn't believe how it ended. Absolutely nothing was resolved! I was getting to the end and I couldn't figure out how so much was going to be finished in so short a time.I have to agree with some of the other reviews that said many things were duplicated in the book. It almost seemed as if she forgot what she wrote in a previous chapter and rewrote it 2 chapters later. I also didn't like how she kept repeating \\"The Mother's Song\\", once was enough. Especially since the entire song is listed at the back of the book.I certainly hope there is another book because it will drive me nuts not to know what happens to certain characters. In her other books there were always sections that I enjoy rereading but offhand I can't think of anything in this book.If there is going to be another book this one is worth reading. If not, then be prepared for a disappointing ending to the series."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"What a disappointment!

This books is a mix between a boring high school text book and a cheap romance novel."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"What a disapppointment! This book is tedious, over long and depressingly repetitive as Auel tries to recreate her dream world where everyone is nice to each other almost all the time.

I found it confusing, repetitous, wordy, and lacking in follow-through. .The numbering of all of the Zelandoni caves, as well as each having a descriptive name , often confused me. Especially when Jean Auel would use the different names/numbers interchangably throughout. As with her previous books, we again find out how spear throwers came about, how to use firestones, the lay of the land, (which is good if you are an archeologist studying the Danube river region and parts of France), and what it was like for man and beast to live in that era. I admit I skimmed and skipped many paragraphs when it became nothing but textbook material. Ayla did seem to have \\"grown up\\" in this book, having gained a backbone and level of maturity. But the hype of the Zelandoni's negative attitude of the Clan was a washout. If you are wanting to read it, rent it at your local library first, before purchasing it. I'm now glad I didn't buy it."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"No matter what anyone says about the Earth's Children's series--\\"The Clan of the Cave Bear (Earth's Children, Book One)is best,\\" \\"the romantic sequences are overdone,\\" \\"repetitious,\\" \\"too many anthropological and geophysical facts,\\"--the author, Jean M. Auel is a good storyteller. She recounts the saga of her heroine, the Cro-Magnon girl, Ayla with all the monkey-mindedness of an authentic human. In each sequence, we hear Ayla's thoughts, we understand how her brain is connecting with the current situation as it relates to other happenings in the past and because of this, sometimes redundant, style of narration, we are privy to Ayla's world in a way that few storytellers can duplicate.That is not to say that much of the criticism directed at Auel, most notably with regard to her last book of the series, \\"The Land of Painted Caves: A Novel (Earth's Children),\\" does not ring true. Many descriptive passages abound in all the books of the series which belie Auel's love of anthropology, however Auel's fascination with the subject might be best explored in a coffee table volume, complete with photos, that retrace the steps she took in researching the backdrop to her glacier dwelling society. For this reviewer, Auel's reliance on engaging her two lead characters, Ayla and her soon-to-be mate, Jondalar, in two-to-three page \\"leg A over leg B\\" sexual gymnastics every time there is a lull in the action seems almost sacrilegious and detracting to the otherwise beauty and ingeniousness of Auel's narrative. In this case, in particular, less would have been more.Auel plays with some interesting themes in \\"Shelters of Stone.\\" However, I believe her main consideration is not a literary one. Primarily, she tells the story of Ayla from the perspective of an outsider wanting to belong to a large community of people to which she was originally born. As a character, Ayla remains steadfast to her own truth. She believes the Neanderthals or \\"flatheads\\" as the Zelandoni Cro Magnons call them, to be different humans, not animals. After observing wildlife during her forced isolation (The Valley of Horses (Earth's Children, Book Two)), she has come to the conclusion that it is man and not a spirit who begins life in a woman. Puzzled over her frequent fugue states where she encounters Creb, the Neanderthal who raised her, she must come to terms with what her dallying in the Spirit World tells her about herself.\\"Shelters of Stone,\\" then, acts as an awakening of sorts for Ayla. Not only does she finally meet Jondalar's people and wow them with her animal friends, her healing abilities and her innate commonsense, she must realize that perhaps, life has something more in store for her than just a husband and babies. The moment when Ayla comes to terms with her \\"calling\\" and announces her decision to Jondalar brings this book of the series to its conclusion. Nonetheless, Auel wants to relate Ayla's timeline and strut her well-researched stuff rather than constructing an intricate metaphor comparing prehistoric lifestyles, sensibilities and politics to that of the present day. She does, however, underline her thinking regarding issues of ecology, discrimination and human nature all under the guise of Ayla's Zelandoni acclimation.I enjoyed this book in audio format; the reader did a fantastic job of distinguishing Ayla's \\"unusual\\" accent while still giving nuance to all the other characters in the story--she sounds like a Russian spy during the Cold War! Listening to the book rather than reading it meant I had to plough through the detailed lovemaking scenes that I would have ordinarily skipped. However, it also forced me to take a full accounting of all of Auel's information regarding flora, fauna and geography which greatly enhanced my understanding and appreciation for her accomplishment.Bottom line? In \\"Shelters of Stone,\\" Jean M. Auel furthers her telling of Ayla's history as she finally meets and joins Jondalar's family in the Ninth Cave of the Zelandoni. Auel provides her fans with more memorable moments while frequently reminding them of past experiences from the first four books and paves the way for Ayla to become something special in the eyes of those she once considered \\"the Others.\\" Be prepared for some repetition as Auel insists on a drum roll of names and affiliations each and every time Ayla meets another member of the tribe, but don't let this detract from the human drama, of which Auel conveys very well and with no need for sophistication. As the beauteous and talented Ayla cannot help make envious enemies who attempt to foil her in whatever way possible, \\"Shelters of Stone\\" provides a kaleidoscope of human emotions that prove that nothing much except technology has changed since the Ice Age. This reviewer would like Auel to continue this series past \\"The Land of the Painted Caves\\" to catch up with the couple again when Jonayla has reached a head strong maturity and locks horns with her savvy mom.

It ceased being objectionable. It occurred to me that Ms. Auel had \\"photographed\\" this portion of her world with a \\"macro lens\\" and had proceeded to tell her tale from a detail-oriented feminine perspective. Not much happened precisely because for most folks...over a very long expanse of human prehistory...not much happened. Except the day-to-day efforts of attending to the repetitive details of their lives. Phrased as a musical analogy: Shelters of Stone is like a repetitive Philip Glass tone poem rather than an epic Baroque symphony.Yes, I did sometimes wonder when the protagonists were going to unveil the nuclear submarine they had invented. And I admittedly cringed when hearing some of the tacky verbiage that described intimate interpersonal interactions. And I did wonder how, prior to the invention of distillation, \\"barma\\" was able to be so much more potent than regular wine. But all-in-all, the details made sense in the context of this invented world.Bottom line: as we say in Minnesota, this story \\"is different\\". Given the right frame of mind, it's a tale worth undertaking."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I agree with a lot of the other low reviews of this book. The only good thing about it is that I borrowed it from my local library (doing so in protest of how long it took the author to release the book!) so I didn't actually buy the thing! There was just too much borrowed content from the previous three books, almost as if the author ran out of ideas and took from the previous three in order to fill her quota for the publisher. As a fan of the previous three books, this rehashing was totally unnecessary for much of the borrowed material was hard to forget, even if you hadn't picked up and re-read any of the previous three books in that ten year span it took to finish the series.

It's not even my least favorite. While it's certainly less action/conflict packed than some of the other books, I think (hope) it's working to set up the next two books, and as far as integrating Ayla into Jondalar's society goes it works fairly well.One caveat: If you read the whole series in short succession the repetition (catching up readers who read the series in the wrong order) starts to get to you, as does the somewhat \\"Mary Sue\\" nature of the Ayla character."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This book was a disappointment to me in that it became very repetitious, much more than it needed to be. Ayla and Jondalar made their way to his people, and people there don't know what to make of her. The book goes on this way for awhile, and gets monotonous.A lot of scenery is described here as well.This is okay, but then, it just goes on a little too much.

It was with great anticipation that I picked up the fifth book, all the years later. Talk about a disapointment! Ayla faces no new challenges...it's just the same formulas all over again. The spark has gone from the series. Even the long awaited birth of their child was boring. I hope the sixth book will be better, but I won't be holding my breath. The magic is gone."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I love the Clan books, they are brilliant Science Fiction,like Star Trek, of which I am also a fan. Auel builds a fictional world that is consistent within itself and has enough resemblance to our world to have the ring of truth. As in good historical fiction, Auel has researched her prehistoric era well. Because it is fiction, it is impossible to criticize her for literary license or even selecting the science she will use and distorting or ignoring the rest. It seems like nit picking to point out the parts that are pure pulp, but I can't help myself.First of all, Ayla and Jondalar wouldn't have been blond. Their perfect looks seem to be derived from the much later Celts and super market romance fiction. Reporting the current state of scientific inquiry on the subject, Richard Klein and Blake Edgar wrote in The Dawn of Human Culture :\\"To some archeologists, cataloguing the behavorial differences between Neanderthals and Cro-Magnons smacks of Neanderthal-bashing, a kind of paleo-racism that all caring people should resist. Yet, our point is precisely that skeletal remains and genes imply that Neanderthals were not analogous to a modern 'race', however that is defined. Modern 'races'all originated very recently, mostly within the past 10,000 years...\\"As the Clan books are set at about 30,000 years ago, the people were probably a kind of generic brown.The Neanderthals were probably more different than they are portrayed by Auel. The above authors continue on that subject: \\"despite their large brains, their patent humanity, and their relatively recent existence...we suggest that they disappeared not simply because they didn't behave in a fully modren way, but because they couldn't.\\" Auel exaggerates their more sympathetic qualities and over emphasises their ability to understand and communicate (albeit wordlessly) abstract concepts."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This yawner reminds me of seemingly endless car trips when I was a kid. Is it really possible that the author of \\"Clan\\" wrote this turkey? - a Paleolithic soap opera drowning in herbal tea and endless introductions. I'm thankful I checked it out from the library instead of wasting [X]+, but I still paid 30+ days of fines to tough it out to the end. I think I'll celebrate reaching the end by brushing my teeth with a twig. (Did Jondalar use mouthwash? I forget.)"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I give this book a reluctant 3 stars, and only, because, it is in the line of a great series. At the risk of sounding redundant, the author repeats herself over and over again, like a doddering old senile person, who can't remember what they've told you five minutes ago. Finding myself reading about the same exact thing two pages later, and then a chapter later, and so on and so on, was very irritating. Jean please give us the credit to make the leap, when necessary, and please there is no need to pound our minds with repetitions, we get it the first or second or even third time, more is not fun. This book is a recap of the previous books, in the series, and a set up for the next one. You can totally skip this book and miss nothing. The only important things that happen in this book, are Ayla meeting Jondulars family, Jondular and Ayla getting married, having their baby, and then ending with Ayla agreeing to train to be a spiritual leader. Well, we knew those things were happening in the previous books, so what took so long to think up, nothing, new? I do think it was an ingenuous way, to recap the series, with Jondular and Ayla telling their stories, and adventures, to Jondular's family, highlighting the great art of story telling, being a way of life. But the editor should've cut this book in half, if not more. The first 500 pages of the book takes place in a time span of about one week, and is a chore to get through...it finally picks up the pace the last 300 pages. But the whole 800+ pages don't even cover a year's time. Even the few attempts at drama in this book fail to spark any excitement. I had to wonder as I was dredging through all the myriad of factual sounding detail, how much of it was really true to the time. Some of it is a bit unbelievable and the forward attitudes are a bit far fetched, for 25000 years ago. If those, long winded, sometimes tedious, details are not true, I would rather read about the subject in a history book. I choose to read historical novels to be entertained, as well as learn a few interesting facts. Please do not give me false history lessons in an novel, especially boring ones. And last, it has been my thought from the beginning of the series, that, maybe Ayla a is a sort of female Jesus, come to earth 2500 years ago, do you think? Well, I hope the next book lives up to the promise of the past books, and of good things to come, as set up in Shelters...Kathy Struewing."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have read most of the reviews and agree with most of them that it was a literary disaster.It's difficult to believe that after a twelve year hiatus this was the result. The book is boring ,repeating the saga of the previous books seemingly without end. Much of the story is concerned with repetitive long introductions which do nothing to advance a story line which never develops. Let's finish with the medicinal value of the herbs,the wild animals as pets,the rocks and topography and the startling new weapons. We have been through that in our previous journey with the perfect couple. What I waited for was Ayala's encounter with the clan and her son Durc ; and not an entire story only devoted to family introductions and a summer picnic.It appears the author is losing her focus."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"why do we read this novel? presumably because we've grown so fond of jondalar and ayla and their unique companions. valley of the horses was a wonderful story about a young woman's ability to survive through her imagination, creativity, determination, and a myriad of skills and values that she gained from the neanderthals who adopted her as a child. yes, the interwoven chapters about jondalar lead inexorably to their meeting. and the superficial tension surrounding her approaching marriage to another man in the mammoth hunters pretty much fills out that novel. but beginning in mammoth hunters and in passage of the plains, we spend so much time repititiously watching every new group of people react to ayla and her animals -- gadzooks, that woolf makes me uncomfortable; how strange to see her riding my dinner; and, wow and wow again, what a powerful woman she must be! yes, of course we enjoy this! we love ayla! we don't care if she and jondalar are conveniently responsible for three or four of the greatest innovations of the paleolithic era. irrelevant. well, this same obsession pervades shelters of stone. a saving grace is auel's having ayla fiercely defend the neandrathal-flatheads. this is admirable and an early moral equivalent of attacking racism. but goodness, here jondalar and ayla go again in this next chapter, meeting new people and going thru the whole reaction to the animals and wow that woman's powerful syndrome. so much of the last two novels has been horribly repetitive in this regard. shelters of stone's plot seems to barely get beyond this repetition. yes, our concern is with ayla's increasingly being accepted and respected by everyone. and yes, given her experiences with the cave bear clan, psychologically this makes super sense and we cheer her on every step of the way. that's what keeps us reading this stuff. she's a fantastic and most lovable human being who has made it on her own and done it the hard way! we just have to put up with so much repetitive blather to get there. but wait! there may be hope with the next novel: it's clear ayla's about to become, not just a zelandoni but the zelandoni of all zelandoniiiisss. shaman of all shamans, lover of all lovers, mother of all mothers. and as such, she's bound to deal with the flathead issue once and for all! oh.... i wonder how people's fascination, fear, awe of her relationship with the animals will play then?"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I had to buy this book as soon as I spotted it on the store shelf because I had absolutely loved the first four books of the series. I kept waiting for something significant to happen all the way through the story and was disappointed when nothing did. There was too much repetition throughout the whole book, from the presentation of the characters lengthy formal titles when they were introduced to one another each and every time, to Ayla's flashbacks of her visit to the spirit world with her former clan's mogur, to Zelandoni's Earth Mother's song/poem, and Ayla and Jondular's lovemaking scenarios. I will have no desire to read any more of the series if Jean M. Auel decides to continue with it."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"As the other reviewers note, this installment was a let-down. After a 10-year wait for it, I'd imagined great things from an author I'd previously enjoyed. However, my guess is that some of the snippets of character development and interaction will be key to the denoument of the story. So even though the writing is not as compelling as it had been, I still felt compelled to read the whole thing."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The excellence of the first 4 books of this series set my expectations for the 5th book. I however am quite disappointed. The characters/situations/nuances are not nearly as well-developed as in prior books. I agree with other reviewers: it is as if Auel is not even the writer here. I understand that there will be a 6th book in the series. I will consider very carefully before deciding to read the next book."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Like many others, I had impatiently awaited Ms Auel to publish No. 5 in the series. It was a long wait, almost 10 years, and for a time it seemed she disappeared off the face of the earthBefore Shelters of The Stone came out, I re-read the first 4 books, and was among the first to receive Shelters of the Stone on April 30th. However, as of today I am stuck on page 399 which contrasts with the Clan of the Cave Bear which I devoured over 1 weekend. Needless to say, this book was a let down.If one were to rate the 5 books in the series, starting with Clan of the Cave Bear most would agree with me that this one was a 5 on a scale of 5. Valley of the Horses was also a great book and I rate this as 4. However Mammoth Hunters was the start down a slippery slope for the series and I could only give this a 3. It was appearent that ideas on where this series should go were in short supply at this point, but it was still an enjoyable read. Plains of Passage continued the downward slope and I must confess, even the first reading I had to skip a number of pages, the re-reading was impossible for me, so I rated it as a 2 which may be generous. I believe Jean had simply run out of ideas, hence the long wait for number 5 in the series (but 10 years?). Unfortunately, time did not do anything to rejuvenate the Series. To be fair, since I have not completed Shelters of the Stone I can not rate it below a 2, but if it doesnt get any better............So the big question is should Jean Auel even bother anymore? I would say no, not unless she has some great ideas for the continuation or conclusion of the series that would do justice to Clan of the Cave Bear. Perhaps this one was just slapped together to reintroduce us (and her) with the story and characters before giving us the finale, but at this point I do not see where this series goes. So I will not be eagerly awaiting the next book as I was this one. When it does come out, if it does, I may wait awhile before buying it to see what people think first. But who knows, maybe I will be pleasantly surprised and she comes out with a blockbuster to match Clan of the Cave Bear."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I've been a huge fan of the Earth's Children series ever since it first came out. I can't remember when I've been so excited as when I heard book 5 was finally here! I bought the first copy I could get and read like crazy, just like I did with the other books.Sadly, this book came as quite a disappointment. As others have mentioned, there is so little that is new, and scenes we had hoped for never happened (or were over so fast you wondered if these were the same people that have been talked about all along). Over and over again we get the same stuff that's been in previous books, and a buildup to moments that never happen (I expect they will come in Book 6).If you have been a fan of the series, certainly you still have to get this book and read it. I wouldn't have cared what anyone said, I would still buy it and read it, just as I will when the next Harry Potter book comes out. But if you are new to the series, don't start here. And if you have read previous books and weren't all that thrilled with them, this is definitely one to skip."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Having read her other books and waited so long for this one, I found it a disappointment. I purchased the hard cover and the unabridged tape version. For such a large book, it only covered approximately nine months of their lives. It has too much review, not enough action and way too much description. The review should mainly entice readers who have not read the previous book to do so. I grew tired of all the formal introductions! At least, the problem with the young renegades group of Others men abusing Flat Head women should have been dealt with in this book. The description of the intimate moments ... between Ayla and Jondalar is good but becoming quite predictable. Too many loose ends were left for the next edition. Like finding additional fire stones; Ayla catching fish wither hands; Ayla's acceptance of her calling and induction into the Zelandonii as a healer and \\"One who serves the Mother\\"; Jondalars cousins child birth problems; and how Ayla deals with the few enemies she has made in the 9th Cave. Can Ayla prevent the confrontation between the others and the Flat Heads? How will Ayla deal with her fear of the next great earth quake? I hope the next book will not be so long in coming and will cover several years in the lives of Ayla and Jondalar with a lot more action!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I was sadly disappointed, I have been waiting for years for this book and I feel cheated. It looks more like a first scenario which lacks substance (except for the excessive geographic details). I'm not questioning Ms.Auel Research, obviously it's extensive and thorough but this time it doesnt come through as it should and the plot (what there is of it) is sugarly and sketchy. It feels more like a prologue (which it probably is) to a new book, at the end you are left with a lot of loose ends, nothing is settled or properly developed. All in all a terrible let down."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Where was the plot? Where was the drama? Where are the fantastic love scenes? I loved Jean Auel's first four novels and I highly recommend them to anyone but \\"The Shelters of Stone\\" was a huge disappointment."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"If you are looking for excitement, then this is not your kind of book. But if you have read the four previous Earth's Children books, then you will find great comfort in Ayla and Jondolar settling into a home and family after the travels and travails of their earlier episodes. This book took a long time (1 month) for me to read and I took to it slowly and comfortably. There is repetition in this that could have been omitted which would have reduced the page count of the book, but I do not find the repetition painful at all. This is a slow, quiet read and I certainly have enjoyed Jondolar's \\"return home\\" with Ayla opening the world of the Zelandonii to others. Be patient with this book and it will reward you."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Like many people I was thrilled when I heard Auel was finally bringing out the long anticipated fifth book in her Earth's Children series, so it came as a letdown when I grabbed up the book and began to devour the story only to find it repetitive and rather unexciting. I was looking forward to further adventures of Ayla and Jondalar, but was disappointed to find the majority of this book to be a tell-all about the first four books. I felt that I didn't constantly need reminding of what had happened in the other stories (if people are new to the series it is up to them to go back and read the first four books, not up to fans of the series to have to read all about them in the following books), and when the story did try to move ahead into something new, it seemed sluggish, and slow to get anywhere.Though I will definitely read the sixth book when it comes out (and hope it is more back to what made me fall in love with this series), I have to admit I wish I'd waited for the paperback edition instead.*Note. Though this review says it refers to the bookcassette, please note it actually refers to the hardcover edition of the book."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"All of the books in the series (except the first) repeat scenes from earlier books. It is more noticeable because there are more books from which to repeat and there is less action to detract from the repetition.The action is slow because SoS is an in-depth description of Alya's acceptance into a new culture. Alya has been accepted into many different cultures; her acceptance follows the same repetitive pattern: People frightened, Alya Help, People Accept, Alya Receive high status.Conflict is missing- no war, insane leaders, travel or new animals. Readers looking for that need to look elsewhere. The book gives a study of the sociology of the time and how the culture operated as a whole. Society's response to the challenge to the belief that the Clan are animals is reminiscent of the challenging of racial stereotypes in modern time.The book is not too focused on details; it is trying to show how the society operates on a daily basis. A great read for immersion into Zelandonii life."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"J'attendais ce livre depuis longtemps.

It's approximately 700 pages long and it took nearly 500 pages before it starts to get interesting. I skipped chunks of pages because they are pure repitition from earlier in the book. I'll probably buy the next one but only because of the first three and to see how it ends. Hopefully Auel won't let us down. If this book was half the length it would potentially have been great. I was disappointed."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Like many readers of the Earth's Children Series, I waited long years for this book to be released. I even took the time to reread the four previous books. I should have stopped after reading Mammoth Hunters. The plot lines ran the same course in Shelters. I was not pleased with Plains of Passage due to the transitory nature of the book and was hoping this would \\"pep\\" back up the series. If this is what we can expect from Ayla and friends in the future, I would aviod subsequent works. The one bright spot was the hint that the next book might provide something new.

That was up until &quot;Shelters of Stone&quot;. I was almost entirely let down by this book due to the fact that I waited almost 6 years to read the next saga in Ayla's life. The book seemed to lacked the heart and soul of the other books, especially &quot;Valley of Horses&quot;. I felt like she almost didn't know what to write about and all the characters and description, including Jondalar,Wolf, the horses, and even the food that had been such a big part of the previous 3 books, were forgotten about and she was trying to build and/or change Ayla into almost another character.

I read this book simply because I have read them all and her first book was extraordinary.

Suddenly she seems timid when it comes to things that she used to not be timid about. I loved the character of Zelandoni though, and like others, get the sense that alot of stuff will \\"come to a head\\" so to speak in book 6, but I'm still bummed about this one. I will buy book 6 for closure but I doubt that I will read any other books by this author in the future if she writes another series as I've heard suggested.All I can say, \\"WHAT A BUMMER!!\\"!!

Jean Auel's Shelters of Stone. I really liked Clan of the Cave Bear, and Valley of the Horses was pretty good (if you overlook Ayla's almost McGiver like ability to invent every major innovation of the neolithic period), but this new book in the Children of Earth series falls flat in comparison.Although Auel tries to keep the same attention to detail that was obvious in her previous books, it comes across here as just page filler trying to justify the price of a 700 page hardback, and much of the descriptive passages are very repetitive in nature. The plot itself is almost non-existent and what there is of it would be more appropriate on a afternoon soap opera or the pages of a Harlequin Romance... gratuitous sex scenes, jealous ex's plotting revenge, and leering bad guys trying to cause trouble, all with one-demensional characterization.And, being an Anthoplogy major, I took exception to the obvious modern western mores, ethos, and cultural biases that she gave to these cro-magnon peoples. Although archeaologists have unearthed a lot of physical evidence from this period and place in history, it is a big stretch of the imagination to assume that they would react just like modern western humans to the same problems."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The problem with this book, is that there was no way that Ayla could have met all those people at one time. So we are forced to live through the formal introductions and stating of family ties and titles ad nauseum. We are forced to read and re-read the same scenes each and every time someone meets Wolf or the horses. If that weren't problem enough, we are also forced to suffer through the telling and re-telling (to many different people) of the death of Thonolan and various other events that took place in other books....I was so disapointed with this book. However, I am still glad I bought it and have a complete collection of the series. Let us keep a positive hope that the final book of the series will return us to the Auel writing style that we all love.I agree with everyone else about that \\"mother\\" song.

The novel reads as if the author had been paid by the word. It is BORING, to say the least.Auel uses totally unrealistic dialogue with her characters...and often useless repetition! It is a highly unsatisfying read, and words shouldn't even be wasted on criticizing it. It is truly a waste of time (at 753 pages).

Thanks to other reviewers comments I now know it ain't gonna happen. I'm not a writer but I think even I could have come up with a decent plot, like...the Zelandonii, Ayla, and Jondalar all in a conflict with the Clan -- Ayla meeting Durc -- Wolf biting Zelandoni's hand and she hauls off and wacks him -- something please happen to end this boredom!!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I wasn't far into this book when I found myself thinking this wasn't Jean Auel writing it.

By the time I plodded half way through I had a mental picture of someone learning to cut and paste. The endless repetition of the introductions, and the word Zelandoni, became most annoying.

I have really grown in awe of Ms. Burr's narrative abilities. It is like I see only the characters and landscape in my head rather than thinking it is an actual person reading to me. How she can maintain the voices for each character so seamlessly, is baffling! I'd love to see her in her processes, preparing for each part of the story and each person represented. Just amazing!Ms. Auel's story is still fresh and keeps me curious as I read. There are parts that are getting a bit over done. But considering that this book doesn't involve the travel angst that the previous books had, a stay at home boredom seems inevitable. Yet it isn't boring.The evidence of research throughout all these books is overwhelming! Yet it is presented as part of the story. In this way, Ayla's story comes to life.

We are both currently listening to The Land of Painted Caves.The reader Sandra Burr makes the story come to life. She reads so fluently and is a pleasure to listen to. Jean Auel is an amazing Author and Sandra Burr really compliments her work."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I don't know what the haters out there were expecting. Yes, the first book was amazing, and yes, every other book since then has failed to replicate the magic of Clan of the Cave Bear, but the time to be surprised by the change of tone was the second book, when Auel committed fully to a romantic/naturalist plot. Looking over the reviews, people seem to be shocked with each book following the same narrative thread, and exhaustive detail of its predecessors.Each of the first 5 books has kept my attention all the way through (and I don't read a lot of 700-page books). Each one has had amazing detail about the period. The worst I can say is that the authors goes into exhaustive detail about things we already heard, and introduces us to dozens of characters we can't always keep straight.Compared to most new fiction, this is a terrific book. Unfortunately, compared to what we knew Auel can do, it's only above average."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The Shelters of Stone continues to hold readers enthralled by the adventures in the ever changing life of Ayla. This book is the fifth in the series and held my attention just as the first one did. The descriptions of the surrounding environments and the people who are encountered cause the reader to feel that she/he is really a part of the Earth's Children in 25,000BC. Although I was \\"hooked\\" by the Clan of the Cave Bear (Book #1) each book in this series is delightful. I could not put any of them aside for very long. I will be very sad when I finish reading The Land of Painted Caves (the last of the series) and only hope that Jean M. Auel will continue to bring us more of Ayla. I love these books!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I am reading the Earth's Children series this summer and this is book five. The second to last book. There is quite a bit of repetition, and the book could certainly have used some better editing, but I quite enjoyed getting lost in Ayla's world as she finally gets to meet Jondalar's people. One more to go."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I just started reading these books this year and have enjoyed them very much. I know shelters of stone is a little repetitive but I think it is one of my favorite ones. After reading four of them doesn't hurt to review alittle. I just wasn't disappointed as some people seem to be. My reading time is limited so I was just glad to find books I enjoyed as much. Am looking forward to starting on last one."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"For all ardent fans of Ayla and Jondalar and their creator, Jean Auel, this book is a gem The 12-year wait between \\"Plains of Passage\\" and this one was difficult, but will worth it! I really couldn't put it down. We finally get to find out whatAlya meant when she said that she had seen that cave before. Loved every word!!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The bottom line is, Jean has once again delivered a fun, entertaining read that also happens to be well researched and thought out. I took on about a hundred pages a day and finished in a bit over a week. And I'll bet so did everyone else who is out here in cyberspace complaining about things. Ayla is still wonderful, the ice age continues to be compellingly brought back to life, and I will happily buy the rest of our newly-minted Zelandoni's life story-be it in one more volume-or six! And so will most of you! So there."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"i feel that this book was indeed worth the wait. i truly enjoyed reading about the customs and concerns of the people, and was quite pleased that the descriptions of the landscape weren't quite as long as in some of the other installments...lol it's interesting to speculate on the condition of the land, but i'm more interested in the people (and the horses and the wolf) and how they relate to one another.this is definately a book i will pick up again. my only complaint is that it ended so suddenly and left me hanging....but it still gets five stars :-P"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This book seems to be more for the people that loved the series then for people that just read it to pass time. As in most of her Earth Children books she is very descriptive of the landscape (which could get boring), and has to remind people constantly of events that happened in the previous books... though you do get a little too much reminding... She could have shaved off 25 to 50 pages of landscape and past reminders, but the story really makes up for it. If you haven't read her past books do not read this one until you have finished the first four. If you do this book will have little meaning for you. The story of Ayla's journey ending really becomes a new kind of journey beginning for Ayla in this book. Ayla may have a new family, friends and a place to finally call home but she has new troubles, new fascinating customs to learn, and most of all new directions to go with her life that she has to decide on. The wonderful thing about this book is that it is still left open to so may questions, thoughts, and ideas for a sixth book. With the book being over 700 pages hard cover I found that I read it all in four days because it was so fascinating, and now that I have finished it I find the book leaves me anticipating and hoping for the coming of a sixth book to the series."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Sometimes life has a way of forcing us toward a detour. When I began reading the series many years ago, I was a stay at home mom whose only break was the opportunity to sit for a while and read. I waited patiently, then impatiently for the 5th book. Once even going as far as to contact Ms. Auel to urge her to get it done. She didn't. Life went on and so did my reading of other authors and materials. Imagine my excitement nearly 20 years later, when I purchased a Kindle Fire and began looking for reading material and discovered she finally did finish the 5th book, Shelters of Stone.I have not read it YET, but I will begin in just a few weeks. I am puzzled by the reviews, comments, etc. about the book. If you have read any of the other books, you know what you are going to get with this author. If her writing material can force us to think, compare, and discuss, it must be something special. I don't always like everything I read, nor do I agree with the content. But reading is about the adventure and the escape that it offers us. Freedom of choice of what we read is a fabulous right that we have. If what you are reading does not give you what you want or need, don't read it. That seems so simplistic and maybe it isn't.Thank you Ms. Auel for finally getting around to writing Shelters of Stone. It is probably about time to publish the final book and bring closure to these characters. Hope I live long enough to see it happen."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The first four books, as they originally came out, followed a consistent and attractive design pattern, thus they look like a series on your shelf and are artistically pleasing. The new binding looks completely different -- simplistic, boring -- and the text in no way lines up with that of the previous books. I don't believe they're going to get people to re-buy the earlier books in the new design. And the new design is not a correction to the original design. The decision makers at Crown Publishers have once again shown a lacking in sense of aesthetics and a lack of concern for their customers."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I kept waiting to get to the interesting parts, but they never came!

Auel's descrpitions brings the scenes vividly to the mind's eye. It is very difficult to put this book down once you start reading."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I just finished reading the book, and I wanted to say that I thought it was excellent, and I really enjoyed it. The entire series has been wonderful, and I am really looking forward to the next book. For the reviewers who said they were disappointed, bored, skipped pages/sections, etc., I am wondering if you read the same book I did? Yes, there was some repetition in the book, but I did not find it unnecessary or distracting. I have read the entire series over the last 1 1/2 years, so it was all fresh in my mind, and I did not find it to be a problem at all. With the amount of time between the 4th and 5th books, I would think it would have been helpful for someone who had not read the other books as recently. My first thoughts when reading a lot of the other reviews were that many of the reviewers were looking for things to find wrong with the book. (Short attention spans came to mind as well, but that's a whole different story by itself!) Could any of them honestly have written the book better? NO! I think it was very well done, and just as enjoyable as the previous 4. Of course the lives of the main characters have settled down a bit- their journey is over, they have a family now- isn't that to be expected? If I had been travelling as long and far as they had I would think my life would be more settled too! And I think if I had just arrived in a new place living with new people as Ayla had, I would probably be telling the same things over and over again just like she did in the book. I for one think the book was excellent, and I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Great book.

Jean's writing is like non other. her depth of research of the period she writes of is phenomenol, and it draws you in from the first page and makes you want to call in sick until you finish. extremely thoughtful, intelligent,and detailed style of writing. if you havent read any of her books, please start with book one and relish your way through. it is so very worth it."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"We wait sooo very long for new books in this series that sometimes it's almost as though they were reads eons ago. I wanted this book to come out much more quickly than it did. But it literally took me a couple of years to read. I kept putting it down because I just couldn't get into it until after reading at least 100 pages. After that point I ravaged through it. Ms Auel could possibly have condensed this one somewhat. It hasn't deterred me from the next in the series. Whenever that comes along."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Sorry but I had alot of trouble even finishing this book. I've read the entire series so far and enjoyed all the others. There are so many characters one needs some sort of outline to keep track of who's who. The dialouge is extremely tedious with far too much small talk that adds nothing but words to the book. I'm thinking Ms Auel wrote this in a hurry to fullfil a contract obligation."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"She can't sing. Just pointing that out to remind all those who are saying Ayla was perfect in every way. Yes, I agree it would be more interesting if she were more realistic, but you have to admit the author did give her ONE thing at which she is not perfect!Also, there were plenty of gay and lesbian characters throughout the series. Or if not exclusively gay/lesbian, at least there was some experimentation/3-ways."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Jean Auel should be an anthropologist, she researches her books that thoroughly. But she isn't boring, rather, her works are exciting, enthralling and educational - not to mention plausable. If the human genome project hadn't proven that we have no relationship to the Neanderthals (the Clan), her characters and story could have been real. As it is, her books make me wish that we still worshipped the way our ancestors did, and that we still had the exciting creativity that allowed us to survive to become the dominante species on our world. I can only hope that we haven't so destroyed our planet's ability to support us, that the rats will inherate the earth. I wish we all had Ayla's knowledge of plants and medicine - we would be so much better off with her abilities than with the pharmicutical industry's destruction of our body's natural abilities to resist the diseases that our ancestors managed as a matter of course. This is not only an excellent story (continuing the Earth's Children series), it and her other works are handbooks of nature's bounty and mystery. Anyone who claims to be literate must have this series in their library. I can't wait for the the next one!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have been waiting patiently for this book to come out in paperback, and finally it did. I have enjoyed all of the books in this series - I have read the first four twice. I found the Shelters of Stone to be less exciting than any of the others, mainly because there seemed to be less drama than I expected. But in the end, I was satisfied. It did not leave me broken-hearted at the end like Clan of the Cave Bear. I won't give anything away, but for those of you who have read the first four, it is worth picking this up and reading. Now I wonder how long until the next book gets published???"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I like the series but have found Ms. Auel like many popular authors needs help with trimming before publication. I enjoyed the story, liked the introduction of some protagonist who will obviously play important parts in the future and I look forward to the next book. I have to admit I found the interveiw on NPR helpful in understanding why so much detail. We listened to the book on tape so I can't skip ahead, I didn't find the repetition that unnerving but at times wished the story moved faster."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Ayla and Jondalar, have just completed a year long journey to arrive at Jondalar's boyhood home, where they want to live together among his people.

I have read each book as it has come out. I will be 35 next month. It is a long time to stay with a series. I was afraid that after so long that I would have no more interest, but it caught me right back up again. I am glad that she mentions things from the older books. It would be hard to go back and read them all again, and I had forgotten a lot. It was nice to have my memory jogged again. I look at this book more as a set up for the last one. She has never before left a book so open ended. I think it would be bad for someone to read this without reading the first four in order."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Honestly. It wasn't that bad. Not that you'd realize it from reading most of the reviews on here. I'll skip the plot summary, you can get that elsewhere, and just cut to the chase: although it was worse than some of the other books in the series, it was pretty damn good. In this review I'll address the three major complaints I've seen.1) The Mother's SongThough I'll admit Auel's gifts are more of the prose variety, the Mother's Song is NOT so bad its unreadable, as some reviews have claimed, nor is it so insanely long. Give me a break. If you can't handle a two page poem, what are you doing reading a 700+ page book?2) The extensive descriptionsFar from detracting from the book, these descriptions are what makes Earth's Children what it is. They are what create Ayla's world, far more than simple character development. It's the same with any great fantasy series. Why is Tolkien's Lord of the Rings so popular? Because not only does he tell the story, he creates a history and mythology surrounding the events. History gives the story meaning and makes the story plausible. Auel's biological, archaeological, and scientific data is just as much a type of history as any other; it is the history of prehistoric earth.3) RepetitionMy favorite, and the only one of the complaints, I think, which has any merit. However, even this criticism is mostly unfounded. Yes, the Shelters of Stone does have some repetition of past plot details. Honestly though, its been 10 years. Give the poor woman a break. Besides, all the books (excluding Clan of the Cave Bear) contain a certain level of repetition. This one just has a little bit more. I did skip over a few parts, but very few.The other repetition complaint I have seen is that Auel repeats the same basic plot details over and over (i.e. introductions to Wolf, formal introductions, firestone usage, etc.) This is even less true than the previous one. In the beginning, it is true, Auel does go into some detail about the above mentioned items, but after a short time she simply says something to the effect of \\"Ayla introduces [Mr./Mrs. X] to Wolf.\\" It takes a sentence or two really doesn't detract from the story at all.So there you have it, prospective buyer. Although not quite the caliber of some of the others in the series, its pretty close. If you are a fan of the Earth's Children series, and presumably you are, else why would you be buying this book, the Shelters of Stone is a worthy addition to the series. Go ahead and read it.NOTE: The rating given, 5 stars, is not accurate. I simply gave it to counteract the atrocious 2 1/2 star average user rating. I would really rate it at 4 stars..."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The long awaited sequel to Jean Auel's \\"Plains of Passage\\" brings our intrepid neolithic friends of 35,000 years past, Ayla and Jondalar, their horses, \\"Whinny\\" and \\"Racer,\\" and \\"Wolf,\\" their wolf (what else)into Southern France and home to meet Jondalar's Zealandonii extended family, the Ninth Cave, along with the future mother-in-law. The book is stolen by Zolena, the lovely older woman who introduced the pubescent Jondalar to \\"first rites,\\" who has now become the Reubenesque (and then some) Zealandoni, the First of those Called to Serve the Mother, a shaman/healer. Some old bitternesses Jondalar left behind him are rekindled (one vindictive, jilted-at-the-altar girlfriend) and the growing problem of Cro-Magon/Neandertal cultural conflict and interspecies breeding is explored. The discoveries Ayla and Jondalar have made in the Black Sea region and during their return trip along the Danube River Valley have immediate impacts on the Zealandonii. Spear throwers, fire stones and and improved methods of processing natural resources all find rapid acceptance. The reaction of the Zealandoni to the tame horses and wolf offer many points of humor. Ayla and Jondalar return to be joined in a formal mating ceremony. Ayla is already with child and Whinny is with foal -- even Wolf finds some romantic interest -- but then it is FRANCE! What can you expect in the land of romance. The love and acceptance Ayla finds is heartwarming as is her ability to contribute her healing skills, first to the benefit of the Ninth Cave and later to the entire Zealandonii tribe at their summer camp meeting. Mrs. Auel's lovely writing carries the reader swiftly through the 741 pages and one finds himself finished but eager for the next volume. Ayla is a member of the cave, has a husband, is soon to become a mother, but finds herself struggling with an invitation to become acolyte to the Zealandoni. Much of the book revolves around getting Ayla to realize she has been called to serve the Mother, perhaps moreso than many. As usual Mrs. Auel's research into probable life styles 35,000 years ago is impecible, and if she has erred anywhere, it is in the interest of bettering an already excellent story. Brava, Jean. Brava, Ayla. Give us more of the same in the next volume, we love it!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I've been a fan of this series for many years. I don't really think the problems in this book are that bothersome. The repetition of certain things is kind of annoying, but the repetition has been done throughout the series. I believe that so much of it was allowed in this book because of the likelihood that people may have picked up book 5 without reading the others. I also don't think that Jean Auel tries to portray Ayla as a superwoman. All of Ayla's discoveries are due to her unusual upbringing and the necessity of figuring things out for the sake of her survival. Even her powers in the spirit world may be mostly due to the root experiance that she had. This book may have seemed to move at a slower pace because Ayla and Jondalar have finally reached the Zelandoni and are trying to get settled down. Ayla has to learn the intricate details of the beliefs and customs of this new society, since the 9th cave will be her home."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Jean Auel's extensive research shines through in this latest book in the Earth's Children series.One of the things I loved about the first book, \\"Clan of the Cave Bear\\" was Auel's unique take on how the clan and the \\"others\\" discovered new ways to hunt, cook, process organic materials, and so on. Besides enjoying an interesting plot line, we, the readers, were introduced to a whole new way of looking at life as it might have been lived in prehistoric times.\\"Shelters of Stone\\" harks back to that first book with its insight into how the link may have been formed between prehistoric humans and the people we are today.

I am in love with Alya and her wonderful saga. I couldn't wait for Auel to write the newest one. I really enjoy the fine detail and careful attention to each chapter in Alya's life.While some parts of Shelters of the Stone were a bit redundant to someone like me who has read the first 4 books a million times; I think to a first time reader it is necessary.I want to give praise to Auel for all her research and knowledge on the Ice Age people and especially to her acknowledgment to our Great Earth Mother.Love and Light."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I think it's been something like ten years since I read the last book in this series and reading this story was like meeting old friends whom you haven't seen for a long time.This is the story of Ayla, a Cro-Magnon woman who has now traveled through five of the Earth's Children series. Along the way she met Jondalar another traveler, and fell in love. Together they have had many adventures in the previous books. In this most recent story, Shelters of Stone, Jondalar takes her to meet his family, the Zelandonii tribe.Jean Auel has again completed a lot of research and written a very thoughtful story of what Cro-Magnon men and women might have been like. Some of the actions of the prehistoric people rang true to me and others seemed a little too sophisticated for that time in our evolution. The pace of this book is a little slower than the previous stories and it seemed to me to be too heavy with descriptive passages. All things considered, it is an interesting story and I applaud the author for her fortitude and diligence in continuing Ayla's saga.Even though I've read the all of the books about Ayla, the first story, The Clan of the Cave Bear continues to be my favorite."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have an hour commute to and from wook everyday.

I have to admit I was a bit overwhelmed when I got this book on CD--28 CD's is a little over a month's worth of listening and I was afraid I would become bored with it, but it didn't happen. The narrator is very good and easy to listen to. I've been following the life of Ayla ever since I read \\"The Clan of the Cave Bear\\" so I was delighted to see that \\"The Shelter's of Stone\\" was available on audio!I've thoroughly enjoyed all of Jean Auel's Earth Children series, but this is the first I had on CD and read to me rather than reading it myself. It sparked my imagination just the same as if I was reading it myself and it made me wanting to hear more about Ayla, Jondular, Jonayla, Wolf, Winnie, Racer, and Gray. I hope the next book will be coming out soon!Warning: There are some graphic descriptions of hunting parties and the \\"sharing of pleasures\\".

I so much look forward to the next book and hope it doesn't take too long. I hope Auelwrites several more books to this series - going through Ayla entire lifespan and that of her children's- she give such great insight to what life would be like in the Pleistocene - the attention to detail andaccuracy is the series greatest strenght - perhaps one day the series will be turned into a movie(theather or for tv) with accuracy this time to what Auel has written."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"As the last book in this series, I was disappointed in it.

They will also agree that there is a point where the detail is no longer helpful but, instead, becomes a nuisance. Jean M.

Also, I enjoy the discoveries made by Ayla and the other humans, of opportunities that we today so take for granted (such as fire, thread puller, spear thrower, etc.) Auel's books rekindle my genuine appreciation for the earth and all it has provided for us. I love getting lost in the era in which the story takes place. This book in particular has also made me revisit the joys of being pregnant and having a baby (my 'baby' is now almost 4). The story surrounding Lorala, and Ayla's experience with having her own baby, really moved me. Jean Auel, you are such a wonderful inspiration to me! I am anxiously anticipating book #6!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I've been waiting to read this book for a long time. I read the first 4 about 10 years ago and almost forgot about the series. I will agree that some parts are repetitious from the other novels, but since it was so long since I read the first ones I liked the refresher. I was getting worried near the end, there weren't enough pages left for the story that I knew was still coming. I am thrilled to learn that there is another book coming.I read some other reviews, and have to say that I wish people kept a more open mind. This book is suppose to be set tens of thousands of years ago. The world, and people are very very different. I dont understand why some people couldn't grasp that people acted very differently back then.I loved every minute of the book, including the long descriptions of beleifs or scenery. Can't wait for book 6!!!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I waited anxiously 10 years for this book to come out. What a waste of emotion & time. The story moves at a pace similar to wood petrifying. Does Auel think her readers are all stupid? She must, she repeats & repeats Ayla's & everyone elses series of names, repeats not once, but over & over how each discovery was made (like using flint for fire or the sewing needle) or why Wolf is tame & how terrified Jondolar's people are when they see him. I also thought this was the last book. I guess it's hard to give up a cash machine like this series. I for one will not be making anymore deposits.This is my last Auel purchase. Hey Jean, reread one of your first books and go back to that imaginative, fast moving, action filled format."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Basic writing courses teach new writers certain rules for creating great stories. Auel breaks many of them. 300 pages in, the book has become hard slogging.The worst sin is info-dumping: research makes your setting realistic but there is a balance between using enough detail to make it vivid, and simply dumping in all the information you gathered. This entire book is an info-dump: speculating on prehistoric life is interesting, but Auel would be better suited as an archaeology professor than a novelist. The description of the landscape, the orientation of this river bank with that cave with respect to that outcrop, got so involved that I failed to form much of a mental image at all. (In contrast, Tolkien's description of Middle Earth, another complex fictional world, left me with vivid images of the scenery that I can still remember as if they were real, & he didn't weigh the plot down with them.) Auel even goes so far as to explain what \\"left\\" & \\"right\\" banks mean on a river. The infodumps are awkward: the author lectures, the characters lecture each other, and sometimes the characters even lecture themSELVES: \\"Ayla knew that this particular plant was used for... \`and this one is good for....' she thought...\\" It takes 60 pages for an \\"extra\\" to [end life] & be buried, so that Auel can explain the culture's funeral rituals. Anything you spend a lot of time on should be important to the plot; this isn't. The action stops again while we go on a tour of cave paintings, probably a thinly disguised report of Auel's own tour. It takes 8 pages to wash a baby. This minutiae of detail turns the book into a literary version of a prehistoric \\"Big Brother\\" program: we watch people sit around talking about nothing for hours. Why are there so many discussions about tea? Did Auel put one in every time she stopped for a cuppa?Viewpoint: she is into the head of every character she introduces (even the wolf!), and they frequently think the same things. Every time a minor character meets Ayla they think about her \\"exotic accent\\". Ok, we got that.... The scattering of viewpoint, in the same scene & even in the same paragraph, is a basic writing no-no, & results in a lack of attachment to any character. We don't feel strongly connected to anyone, therefore we don't really care.Rehash: imagine writing a story about someone who sailed around the world, had lots of exciting adventures, met interesting people, learned about their culture, etc. The story ends as he sails into his home harbour, the end of a great adventure. But THEN, you write a sequel in which he meets all the people who want to hear where he's been & what he's done, & you report all his conversations with these people, verbatim, & of course he tells some of the stories several times to different people, & they tell each other what he told them.... Who would want to read that? But this is what Auel does: the book is a rehash of the previous 4, & rather than stopping with a summary to refresh our memory, she reports things several times each.Repetition: conversations & events are repeated excessively. Something happens; we see it happen; then we see someone tell someone else what happened, then they tell someone else.... It's like during the years it took her to write it, she kept forgetting what she'd said a few chapters ago.Scene purpose: another basic rule is that every scene has to have a purpose: to advance the plot, reveal character, or provide needed information. A lot of scenes could be cut without affecting the plot because they serve no purpose to advance it. Case in point are the [partner] scenes which go beyond \\"purple prose\\" into vermilion or fuchsia... predictable, ridiculously overwritten, repetitive description which seems to have been stuck into the manuscript on a separate page at random intervals, and which contributes no new information about the characters or their relationship. Reading how perfectly infatuated they are with one another is tedious.Dialogue: weak. Again, it often serves no purpose in advancing the plot. It's repetitive & often inane: \\"That's amazing.\\" \\"Yes, it is, isn't it.\\" Characters tell each other what they're going to do, what they did a minute ago, where they're going now... Writing good snappy dialogue isn't easy, & it involves reporting stuff that moves the story, & cutting the mundane chatter.I could think of more, but \`nuff said already... It shows how much you can get away with once you have made a name for yourself. Great writing coaches like Jack Bickham would take this book apart, & he could probably have put it back together in 300 pages. I recommend this book for a writing class, to learn what doesn't work.A fascinating idea, the potential for a terrific adventure in prehistoric culture, spoiled by writing style. Did the publisher get the first draft by mistake? Like the [overweight] Zelandoni/Zolena, it's smothered by its own weight."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Sorry Folks... She should have quit when she was ahead. I am an avid fan of Jean Auel and also a would-be anthropologist who loves reading new information about this era & the theories of lifestyle comparison between Neanderthals & Homo Sapiens, but this pretty much bored the hell outta me!Reviewer Trish Marie summed it all up quite nicely... tell me a story. In past novels, along with the detailed description of everything in this ice age, she did tell a great story as well and that's where she drew her large fan-base. This book was filled with information, some very intriguing, but most of it was tedious and repetative. I too skipped numerous pages throughout, wishing something more incredible and suspenseful would happen. Instead, I was left to my own imagination as to what else could have happened to liven up the book. Couldn't there have been something more intense happen in the first half of the book, other than Ayla proving she wasn't embarrassed to wear boys' winter underware in public? And how many times did we read the detailed description of her new ideas and finds, which we had already read about in previous books? I think I can now teach a class on how to start a fire with flint and \\"firestones\\", without even have seen the stones myself.I have great respect for Ms. Auel, and have even listed her as one of my writing influences in the past. I'm deeply sorry to say that she should have concentrated more on the story ~ breathing some life into it, or perhaps hung up her quill at the end of Mammoth Hunters. Having Ayla & Jondalar stay with the Mammoth Lodge, beginning her new family, could have been a very satisfying ending there."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I am listening to the book on tape. It has all the hallmarks of a book that was paid for by the word. Every detail has to be repeated in excruitiating detail. And the assumptions about peoples naivtae about animal husbandry and animal behavior are just not believable. Wolves would not be novel items around settlements, and would not be as well trained just one generation out of the wild. Not believable is to put it mildly. This book reads as if it is a first draft and was never reread by the author. Shame on you Jean Auel. Clan of the cave bear was a brilliant idea. This is book reads as if you were tired of the story and paid by the word. Give it up. Start a different story. Make up something new. Please."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I am so bored and I feel like it is a complete WASTE OF TIME. It is like a really bad soap opera - you waste your time on it because you became addicted to the series. This book is lacking everything that a devoted reader waiting 10+ years was expecting.Can Ayla do anything wrong? Can she be any more wonderful? What happened to the tension of her being accepted by the Ninth Cave? Where is the fear of a foreigner with such unusual ideas? Zelandoni, the One Who Serves, wants to reserve judgement on the \\"mating\\" of her and Jondular and absolutely NOTHING ever comes of it. Ayla is accepted and welcomed because she is so wonderful and since Jondular's family does run the tribe then I guess she's got the \\"in\\". Lucky her, huh? She becomes a Zelandonii before they even leave for Summer Meeting (around page 300 of the 750 pages)and even Joharran (Jondular's brother and leader of the Ninth Cave) questions why she should become a Zelandonii so quickly. Does it matter? NO! Ridiculous.Way too much repitition of everyone having to reach down and let Wolf sniff their hand, showing everyone how to use the amazing firestarters, which tea concoction should she try today?, isn't she just beautiful and would you expect Jondular to bring home a woman to be his mate that was any different? By page 350 I found myself skipping all the descriptions of the surrounding rocks, caves, and rivers and it was very easy to put the book down for any trivial interruption!This book is simply filled with nothing. I am very grateful that I borrowed it from the library and didn't spend a dime on it. Not worth a penny so don't waste your time which is worth a lot more than that."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Summary: Ayla and Jondalar return to his home. Everyone loves Ayla; Ayla and Jondalar tie the knot; Ayla gives birth to the hellspawn and while her name is incredibly stupid, it still ends up sounding better than Twilight's Renesmee.I don't know whether I should be upset that I spent all this time listening to the book equivalent of a 90's clip show or I should be laughing at the ridiculous joke of this being published. Or cry thinking about how many trees this destroyed on its route to the bookstore. Or rage about the number of books that were rejected to make room on the bookseller list for THIS.I've done my raging about this series; it's been a ridiculous, over the top Mary Sue-ridden barely concealed fanfiction-y ride. But I almost want to go back to all the previous books and bump up the ratings by a star or two (YES, a star or TWO). With ALL the complaints I've had for the last three books (and if you've read my reviews, you know THAT is a laundry list), those books look like literary GOLD next to this piece of Mammoth defecation.Gone are any attempts at making Ayla a realistic character. Gone are any attempts to take this story to the next level, to have ANYTHING to do with ANYTHING that has come before. Gone are any attempts to treat the reader with intelligence.Ayla is the biggest Mary Sue I've ever read. She is such a flagrant Mary Sue, I had to check to make sure that this wasn't fanfiction; I wouldn't be surprised to see this characterization from a thirteen year old girl on the internet, but from a 60+ woman? You coulda fooled me! Ayla is the sexiest, most attractive, most intelligent, most competent woman that the world has ever seen. She could heal cancer with willow bark tea; she can wear boy's underwear and a top with her boobs hanging out and no one will mutter a peep about her indiscretion--in fact, women will imitate her and every man will get a huge boner for her (and yes, this does happen). Everyone gasps in admiration about her ability to tame animal, everything she says is as if from the Mother's lips. She rushes into the town drunk's home to rescue his starving family, and the crowds cheer. She heals a stupid boy that was hunting rhino, and the audience roars. Ayla could blaspheme the Mother, destroy their religion, and burn the entire shelter to the ground, and STILL the ENTIRE Zelandani race would cheer her on.In fact, I took the Mary Sue test for Ayla. Wanna know what she got? 161. Know what that corresponds to? \\"\\"50+ Kill it dead.\\"Jondalar is still a whining baby. All he wants is for Ayla to remain flat on her back so he could pound into her all day with his massive dong. The only reason he turns down performing First Rites is because his massive dong would scare off the young virgins and NO ONE could take him all. WOW HOW FRAKKIN' ROMANTIC!! I wished so many times that he would fall off a cliff or chop off his hand or break his dong on Ayla's \\"petals of perfection\\".It is an insult to call the other characters \\"characters\\". The only ones who act even REMOTELY human are Marona, who is understandably upset because her fiance, Jondalar, ran off and she was left with NO COMPENSATION (and Jondalar is back, thrusting Ayla, the Woman Who Can Do No Wrong in her face), Brukaval, who wants Ayla to mind her own business for once, and the dude that Jondalar punched in the face and TOTALLY ruined his livelihood. Marthona, Jondalar's mother, accepts Ayla with barely a second thought. Same with Joharran, the leader of the 9th clan. Zelandani aka Zolena, the Dani woman that Jondalar loved SO MUCH and couldn't be with, is morbidly obese, conveniently \\"unattractive\\" to the vapid Jondalar. Everyone else that would have made a shred of conflict is painted so painfully villainous, it would have been more subtle to have them dress in black, twirl their mustaches, and cackle maniacally.And all the stupid poor widdle kids that Ayla has to rescue! GAH! For once, I would like this woman to do something selfish, for her own personal gain, instead of rushing over to the town drunk (who hates her) to rescue his POOR FAMILY, to shame all the rest of the clan women into giving the baby their birth milk because, \\"Even the Clan would do that, and you think they are animals!\\" In fact, I think Auel \\"wrote\\" half the book by just tossing in a new character that Ayla has to fix whenever she got tired of pasting in stories from previous books.There is so much repetition in this book, it's borderline plagiarism. We are reminded TWENTY-TWO TIMES that Ayla has an unusual, exotic accent. I am not stupid; I think I got it after the first time!! (I was going to post each one of the 22 quotes where it is mentioned, but I didn't want to get repetitive!) Other conversations that Auel has had in the past--every story from the last four books, where babies come from, how Iza told Ayla to wash up after having sex, how many times Ayla goes to\\"pass water\\" (and how much more often she is going to \\"pass water\\" now that she is pregnant)--is repeated over and over and over and over again. And then the introductions! GAH! Here is just ONE introduction:\\"I am Folara of the 9th cave of the Zelandani, blessed of Dani, daughter of Marthona, former leader of the 9th cave of the Zelandani, daughter of the hearth of Willamar, master trader of the Zelandani, sister of Joharran, leader of the 9th cave of the Zelandani, sister of Jondalar of the 9th cave of the Zelandani, master flintknapper and returned traveler who is soon to be mated to Ayla of the 9th cave of the Zelandani. She has a bunch of names and ties of her own, but the one I like best is \\"friend of horses and Wolf\\".\\"Imagine this for nearly EVERY \\"character\\" and multiply that by infinity. That is how many times I had to read this. If I didn't know better, I would have thought that twenty different writers wrote this book, threw together their portions in one big pot and sent it directly to publish.And if you thought the previous books were in any way misogynist, you haven't even SEEN this book. Here are some WONDERFUL quotes from this supposedly equal-rights culture:\\"She had become Ayla of the Zelandani and Jondalar's mate, and that came first.\\"\\"Though a stigma of shame was placed on those who did not wait until they had their First Rites, some girls inevitably did succumb to the persistent blandishments. But no matter how relentless the pressure, by yielding to it, the girls became ultimately less desirable as mates because it indicated a lack of sufficient self-control.\\"\\"It is true that your mate will not be as tempted to look with pleasure upon other women if you satisfy his desires.\\"\\"Maybe [Jondalar] should have asked [Ayla] before he started all this [so Ayla could become Zelandani]\\"Wow, HOW FAIR! Girls who have sex before First Rites are looked down upon because they can't wait. But boys? NOTHING. If your man leaves, it is YOUR FAULT because you didn't have sex enough with him. Sounds great, doesn't it?Oddly enough, there are only 3 sex scenes in this book. Not surprisingly, they are pretty much the EXACT SAME sex scene we've read since \\"Valley of the Horses\\":Jondalar goes for Ayla's boobs.Jondalar moves to Ayla's \\"petals\\".Ayla moans and can't believe how \\"ready she is\\".Jondalar wants to take her \\"right now\\" and can barely hold back.Insert Tab J into Slot A. Fireworks, explosions, flowers fall from the sky and angels sing.And then we have the Mother's Song. I have a great aunt that used to write poetry about what happened to the family in the past year (and force rhyme to death out of it) and put it into her Christmas cards. The poetry would be something like this:And Johnny did run to the store one dayTo say hello to his Aunt MayAnd what do you think should happen there?He found a cute, adorable, cuddly bear!THAT is better poetry that this horrible mess. And the absolute LAST THING I wanted was Ayla commenting on how moving and wonderful this poem was.I am SHOCKED that this book took 12 years to write. I would have given it 12 days: that would be PLENTY to pick through the last four books, copy all the stories from there and paste them into this waste of paper, sprinkling a bunch of senseless research, bad sex, and Ayla Sue prancing around, telling someone off for their \\"bad behavior\\" or saving the day for some poor, precious, downtrodded person.I just have one question: HOW THE FRAK DID THIS GET PUBLISHED?!?!!!?!? This is, without a doubt, the WORST book of the series so far. It is pointless, it totally negates all the tension of that the last four books have been building up to, wondering and worrying if Ayla would be accepted into the Zelandani. I've read fan fiction better written than this.So my advice? AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE!!Brought to you by:*C.S. Light*"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The fifth installment of Auel's \\"Earth's Children\\" series was a bittersweet experience to read. It was almost a relief to finally find out what happens after Ayla and Jondalar reach the Zelandonii. However, right from the start, the book starts out slow as a snail. Most of this book is conversation and majority of it could have been cut out because the focus is on past events that have already been explained four times. Most of the characters are fascinated by Wolf and the horses, EVERYONE notices Ayla's strange accent, and Ayla is the most beautiful woman that every man wants. Overall, this seemed like an unecessary book. There are only about three major events in this book and most of those you can probably guess: Ayla and Jondalar's irritating ex-fiancee finally meet, Ayla and Jondalar finally mate, Ayla has a baby, and Ayla has to decide whether she is called to become a Zelandoni or not. So, to be bluntly honest, this book could have been cut in half and still have been good."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"About a year ago, a friend of mine recommended this series which she described as \\"caveman porn, but good caveman porn.\\" I have to say that despite her all too accurate summary, I was extremely disappointed that it wasn't more than just that. I'm young enough to have missed all the hype about these books when they were released so I wasn't really expecting much, but after reading the excellent first book, I really wanted something more than just a couple thousand pages of repetitive sex, no matter how well written the descriptions of prehistoric life were or how well researched. What happened to the social commentary? What happened to the depiction of being a misfit of society? What happened to Ayla being the link between two tribes of people who ostensibly have nothing in common? What happened to the underlying theme of what defines our humanity?

To tell you how bored I was with this book, it took me almost a year to read it, and I normally can read a book that size in about 3 days. Needless to say, I found the storyline extrememly dry, and the conflicts she had to deal with never amounted to anything. Granted, some of this may come to a head in the next and last book, but for this book, there just wasn't anything to keep my interest. Towards the end of the book I became slightly more intrigued as to what would be happening to the characters, but in a book of this length it shouldn't take that long to get interesting.

I understand that they had to explain to the Zelandonii & the members of their cave, but Ms. Auel should know that WE KNOW what happened. Why make us read the same events over and over again? Why couldn't she just said \\"Ayla explained about how she discovered the firestones\\" that would have made me feel better. I read somewhere that this book is a buildup for the next book, that makes sense with the introduction of ALL the members of this cave, to explain each status & how they feel about Ayla individually, But Still....This book is overly repititious in every way. How many times do we have to hear about her unusual accent? YES WE KNOW!!How many times about the firestones? YES WE KNOW!!How many times about her animals? YES WE KNOW!!Although I found about the whole novel completely annoying, I did enjoy the Summer meeting & when Ayla does deliever her child. That, for me was thrilling.

It almost covers EVERYTHING in every book.I was lucky enough to read the previous novels about a year and a half before this one was released.

Because the time lapse between books is considerable, Auel had to spend time not only reminding previous readers of past events but also enlightening the first-time reader of the series in regard to the characters' history. As a previous reader of the other four books, I welcomed the history. Through the characters' telling of stories, explaining something, and teaching each other, the reader is effectively refreshed and brought up-to-date.Some of the many issues mentioned or addressed in the book are related to territory, mixed mating, survival of the fittest, birth control, abortion, homosexuality, the spirit world and jealousy. While some of these topics are more a part of the story than others, some are presented in a format of \`that's just the way things are'. In other cases, information might be shared between people in an educational manner or passed on in the form of an example. For instance, Ayla knew of a birth control herb and others are interested in learning about it.In regard to detail, Auel's explanations of making various tools are right on target. She takes the time to teach the reader about making the multiple wicked lamp, the thread-puller, the spear-thrower and other implements, such as the wooden box. On the other hand, her detailed descriptions of sexual encounters between Ayla and Jondalar appear, in my opinion, to be anachronistic and don't seem to fit into the story very well.The Zelandonii way of including one's past ties and connections when making introductions is very informative. Some of these are very long and reading them over and over every time an introduction is made is quite taxing.Jean Auel has stepped into the world of poetry in \\"The Shelters of Stone\\". The most powerful part of the book is the song/poem, \\"The Mother's Song\\", where the idea of creation takes on a new and dynamic position. Following the books format of long and detailed explanations, \\"The Mother's Song\\" is also long, but it gnaws at you to come back and read it over and over.**There is a helpful list of characters at the end of the book.**The Mother's Song\\" is also printed at the end of the book."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"...Egads, what a let-down.I won't repeat the criticisms so eloquently conveyed in the other reviews on this page (99 percent of which I agree with, especially the ones that point out that Auel smuggles in a geography lesson and calls it a story because she couldn't come up with one), but I would like to add one point of my own about why I'm so disappointed:After 4 books of being told how Jondalar's people won't accept a woman who had borne the child of a \\"flathead\\" and dreading the struggles she would face when she finally arrived, we find these Zelandonocrats to be a California-style culture who receive the news with a shrug and a \\"whatever\\" attitude, and now it's time for Lamaze class.

The story started off ok (more of the same), but included waaaaay too many recaps. I assume most readers have already read the first four books, and probably didn't enjoy this either. The second half (or two-thirds maybe?) of the book were not good. The story was rushed, missing detail and left me wondering if it was even written by Jean Auel, or if she handed it off to someone else to finish it in time for the release. Overall, not worth it. Clan of the Cave Bears will always be the best."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I thought from the beginning of the series that Auel created a good fantasy story. As a writer, however, she lacks rhythm and fluidity, and she doesn't know to cut to the chase. There were many parts of the books preceding \\"Shelters of Stone\\" where I found myself wondering whether an editor had seen the ms. The writing is extremely clunky.My impressions about the writing itself are aside from the extreme unlikelihood that a character like Ayla could ever have existed. She's the prehistoric wonderwoman who as a teenager is the master of her environment and the inventor of countless techniques, devices and implements that we take for granted today. Let alone that she tamed a cave lion, horse and wolf, saved Jondalar's life, and subordinated him in almost every way possible.Twelve years passed between \\"Plains of Passage\\" and \\"Shelters of Stone.\\" I suppose that's why Auel and/or her publisher felt it necessary to summarize the previous books in \\"SofS.\\" It probably took Auel half those years to make up the names for the seeming scores of characters. There are so many minor players that it's very hard to keep track.The book is extremely tedious to read, and I've been tempted to give up several times. I keep going because I want to find out what happens in the overall story. I'm about 250 pages in, and almost nothing has happened. I figure at some point there has to be a confrontation between the Clan and the Zelandonii, probably involving Ayla's son, Durc. Ayla's loyalties will be tested, and the denouement will occur. I figure that's what Auel is setting up, but she's taking longer than forever to do it. I wonder if it will even happen in this book. Maybe she's saving it for the next. In the meantime, Ayla drinks hundreds of cups of medicinal teas, meets every individual in the Zelandonii tribe one by one and almost nothing happens. When those few consequential things do happen, the action is barely portrayed and the dialog and minutiae go on forever. We get treated to the wonders of Ayla, her wolf and her horses over and over again. OK, they're domesticated, now let's get on with the story. And let's see Jondalar behave like a strong Cro-Magnon man, as every surviving male at the time must have been, rather than Ayla's subordinate sidekick.My guess is that the great majority of Auel's 34 million buyers are women who feel subordinated by the world and see in Ayla the selves that nobody has let them express."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"...unfortunately, what the previous posters said was true. I have been a long time fan of Auel and really looked forward to this book. But it really is like she ran out of ideas...she just kept regurgitating old stories over and over and over again. Not only that, but incidents that happened earlier in the book kept getting repeated. I got to one point in the book where I just couldn't read the Zelendoni Poem anymore and just skipped over it everytime she copied and pasted it (which was probably about a chapter in itself).But it was still nice to read a book of this nature and I probably will still read the next one....if it comes out sometime within the next 12 years..."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I loved Clan of the Cave Bear, but after that, each book in the series got worse. Auel has taken what could have been a great prehistoric fiction series and turned it into soft-core erotica. While reading the book, I couldn't help but get the impression that she spent more effort on the sex scenes than on the culture of the Zelandonii. The Zelandonii culture is virtually identical to all other Cro-Magnon cultures encountered throughout the series. I highly doubt that all prehistoric humans had the same ideals and worshipped the same deity in the real world, yet Auel paints them that way. I get the feeling that the culture of the people in these books represents Auel's ideals of a perfect world, with no warfare, no religious hatred, and no male dominance. And while these are among the ugliest aspects of human nature, denial of their existence does not make for an interesting or accurate novel. The characters are shallow- Jondalar is portrayed as nothing more than a sex object, Ayla is still completely unaware of herself, and the entire culture is encased in an extremely unrealistic sexual innocence that simply enhances the sex scenes- does anybody really think they were unaware of the connection between sex and childbirth? The only character in the novel with any depth is Brukeval, but even then it's not much. I enjoyed the setting of the novel though, and will probably get the next one, as books set in this time period are hard to come by. Hopefully, the next book will be more like Clan of the Cave Bear."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I hurried through the 4th book, to recall the story, since the last time I had read it was a couple of years ago. It wasn't necessary. Auel goes over what happened in the previous books SO MANY TIMES, it barely is necessary to have read them. And for those who want to know what comes next, this book seems to add nothing to the story. We know that Ayla will have to retell what happened to her many times, but it bored me to read it all over again and so many times. There is too much detail to things that happened in the other books, and no detail to what is happening now. And a lot goes unexplained, like why Laramar's son was injured, why was he in a fight. There is no depth to the the present story, too much \\"remembering\\" what happened to Ayla and Jondalar before. I really want to read the next book, since this one went knowwhere, but I hope there is more story to it."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"\\"THE SHELTERS OF STONE\\" took long enough to come out. Okay, okay, Ms Auel, we understand you are both a mother and a grandmother, but loyal readers waiting for the end of the story are not carrying children or grandchildren. . .While we are more than happy for your personal life, readers are left hanging. . .and twenty years, you must admit is a long cliff-hanger. . .I do understand that personal things happen.But the Fifth book comes out at last. And it's mostly a review of the the previous four books. Ayla has her baby. Good on her. Jondalar is a father. Good on him. . .but the bulk of the book is what happened before &lt;i.e., what happened in the four previous books; I mean every other page is a flash-back to what happened in books 1, 2, 3, or 4: and now book 5 is out and we're reminded again and again what happened in books 1-4>Ms. Auel, you write well, but some of us readers remember. We KNOW where you left off. We're with you. . .Yes it's been twenty years, but we've been waiting all that time, at the same spot in the story. . .What WE'RE waiting for is the climax. We're waiting for the finish. For myself, I'm over fifty years old. Will I get the end of the story before I join Iza and Creb?I don't mean this over critically. I just want to know if this story will be like the construction of I-285 in Atlanta: Will this be completed in my lifetime?"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Unfortunately Amazon doesn't let you rate a book with zero stars. How so little could happen in so many pages, I'll never know."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I got interested in this series by accident. I rented 'The Mammoth Hunters' from an audio book rental place a few years ago. I listened to the book and I was hooked. I have purchased the entire series that Jean Auel has written so far. It is a 6 book series, but only 5 books have been written so far. This is the 5th.This book does not come up to the level of story telling that the previous books did.* It is important to read the previous 4 books to understand some of the things mentioned in this book.* The author has included more of the recent discoveries about cave society in her book at the expense of the story itself.* Unlike previous books in this series, the author raises many questions in this book which she leaves unanswered.* I feel that this book is not complete. It is only a prelude to the final book in this series.I fell that this book is worth buying. But only if you are a fan who has read the previous 4 books and are intending on buying the final book when it comes out."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I found this book fairly interesting; for the first half, anyway. After reading a few reviews, my thoughts that this book simply rehashed the previous four were comfirmed. There was too much emphasis on how brilliant and beautiful Ayla was, and how spectacular her control of animals was; I got the idea after the first ten times. My hopes for this book were dashed by the time I finished it. All of the foreshadowing was for naught; tensions were built, and then forgotten about. Discoveries or decisions were hinted at, but never reached. The end of the book seemed rushed; events that were built up to be important were completely left out of the book, as opposed to excessive detail in the beginning (which I am a sucker for). In short: if you read the first four books, or plan to, do not read this one. If you've read this one, you've practically read the first four."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I waited 12 years for Ayla, and this book was a total disappointment. Nothing new happened, no new feelings, no new inventions, no new animals, no interesting story. Just a retteling of the previous books and a very expected meeting with the Zeladonii. Even the baby is only barely mentioned. I almost gave up in the middle it was so boring. I read the bad reviews and refused to beleive it, but if I hear bad review on 6 (who knows how long it will take to come out) I'm not going to read it. 1,2,3,4 were amazing. Jean, what happened to the magic?"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Shelters of Stone had lots of rich details in it about what Cro-Magnon culture could have been like. It also had a lot of foreshadowing to set up for the next book. It also contained repetitions of things (perhaps a bit too much) so people who hadn't read the series in a while could jump right in to this book. There are more kinds of drama than just quick plot twists. This book is good to pick up whenever you have time, read, and then put down for awhile until you have time to read some more. It's worth the price."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I looked forward to the next installment of the Earth's Children series, but found SoS a disappointment. It seems Auel is more concerned with length than content, because there is more repetition and recycling in this book than all her other books combined.Just how many times does the Mother's Song have to be printed? One time through was far more than enough...it's too long as it is. Yet we see it in full 2-3 times, plus a printing yet again after the end of the book.Endless introductions and listings of familial lineages. Endless recycling of portions of the previous books. While yes, some would be necessary, when the same story is retold (when others ask Ayla the same question that has been answered previously) we have to hear the WHOLE THING again.This book was more than twice as long as it needed to be. Instead of letting of really focus on some of the interesting new characters, we're bogged down in endless scenery descriptions. It gets to the point of being difficult to follow the relatively unsubstantial story and character arcs.Auel sets up some conflicts that could have become interesting if brought to fruition. Instead she all but comes out and says *Buy the next book*This volume was a cop-out...filler material...not really respectful of her fan base."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I wasn't far into this book when I realized the writing didn't even seem like it was Auels. My interest was perked finally when Ayla was tricked into wearing boys underwear, I thought \\"ok, now the story is going to take off.\\" Marona? was never mentioned much again. I kept waiting for her to make trouble. I liked the story of Ayla helping the starving baby. The summer meeting was boring, the wedding was boring, the birth was boring. Ayla didn't even have to cook, every meal was supplied by that lady who loved to organize parties. I had so much anticipation as I read... would Durc somehow arrive, would there be a confrontation with area Clan, would she make any new clothes to replace the traveling ones, would she get a tattoo, become zelandonni, would the drunk cause her trouble, or the mixed spirit man who hated her, why didn't everyone find out about Durc since this was such an issue in the other books? Even Zelandonni hinted that Ayla was going to cause trouble, I wish she had! I feel bad even writing this, I wanted so much for this book to be excellent."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"12 years of anticipation; 3 days of disappointment. Out of 750 pages, about 300 of them may have contained new material, and as others here have noted, even that was less than compelling. However, I wasn't crazy about The Valley of the Horses, either. I skipped almost all the chapters with Jon and Thon (and was thankful that it was split up like that so that I could easily bypass those parts) and was also bored with large sections of Plains of Passage. I appreciate how much research went into Auel's descriptions of flint tool making and of the flora and fauna of the epoch, but honestly... enough already.I think at this point, I'd like to see Ayla assert her otherwordly power and really freak people out, but that's unlikely. She will likely turn out to be the benevolent queen of the Zelandoni with the handsome King Jondalar at her side, and little Princess Jonayla (puh-leez).That said, I'll hope for better things from the last book because I am an eternal optimist."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"Like many other reviewers, I have read all of the novels in this series, and have found the quality of the writing (and editing) falls off dramatically after the 3rd book. I slogged through this one only because I wanted to see what advances the plot might take. Very few, indeed. Ayla is perfect; Jondalar is the perfect man; they are both so great, la la la.. The fourth book was painful to read, and should have been subtitled (My thesis on plant life in Neolithic Europe), but this was just awful. I honestly can't say if I care enough to read the \\"final\\" novel. What else could happen in it, except maybe Jondalar accidentally discovers how to create iron, and Ayla has a dream where Creb teaches her how to begin purposeful cultivation of plants, so that they are the \\"Parents of Modern Civilization\\" ??? Sorry, Jean, but you lost my interest a thousand pages or so ago. I think that I'll just re-read the first three novels."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I was pretty young when this book came out, so when I was older I started out with the first three and came to this one. [I read the fourth book later.]Sometimes I think this book is great, sometimes I'm just irritated by the amount of repetition in it. For instance, having an insight into everyone's thoughts might have been a brilliant idea-but all you get is yet another person thinking, \\"She has an unusual accent, but it's not unpleasant. I wonder where it came from.\\" BORING!Also, when Ayla was given some strange clothes so people would laugh at her, all she did was decide to wear them for a hunting trip. She was hardly embarrassed at all, which makes you wonder if she's either got her priorities misplaced or if she's a robot. [With the number of things she's invented already, I wouldn't be surprised.]I read in another review that everyone either loves or hates Ayla and Jondalar, and I have to agree. Someone who slightly disapproved of all their showing off would actually be refreshing. Even Zelandoni, who is supposedly a great healer and critical of many people, loves Ayla immediately and tells her she 'belongs in the zelandonia'.Ayla's 'look-out-for-the-little-people attitude is rather annoying as well. Granted, it was nice that she helped Lanoga and Lanidar, but she shouldn't have made such a big deal about it.On the plus side, the book is fairly well written with fewer grammatical errors than there have been. Also, it was interesting to see how Ayla convinced the Zelandonii about 'flatheads'."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"for such an unsatisfying book. Repetition, tediousness, dissatisfaction. Such a disappointment after the preceding four novels."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"This is a classic example of a series going downhill. As so many have remarked, the first novel was excellent; the second had interesting parts (although I grew tired of Ayla's inventions). While reading Mammoth, I wondered what happened to the author's ability to entertain, and Passage I could not even finish. Shelters of Stone is even worse, with the repetitions and lack of plot and lack of character development.Readers here have wondered why this book took twelve years to write, when the result -- according to so many -- was so very bad. If it had been a good book, that Auel was excited to write, it would have taken far less time. I believe that another reason for the repetitions is that the book was taking so long that Auel forgot what she was writing about -- or, if she didn't exactly forget, she at least needed to remind herself in detail, and assumed that all her readers would need the same prompting. She seemed to be unaware that reading a book takes far less time than writing it and that her loyal fans would not forget the events that took place a few pages earlier.This book must have been published for the money. Where was the editor? Where was the agent? But, ah, they are making money from this book too ... or who knows, maybe the published draft was far better than the original turned in by Ms. Auel."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"After reading and being totally captivated by the first 4 of the series, I waited impatiently for book #5. I am very disappointed in the book, but will continue to have high hopes for the conclusion of the series.My harshest criticism is of the sentence structure throughout the book. The writer did a poor job of portraying \\"cave-man style\\" conversation or speaking. Two sentences run together, separated by a comma do not depict primitive language or thought, and I do not remember seeing this in Ms. Auel's other books.Also, I resent stumbling over explicit sex in a book which I have chosen for reasons other than hot sex or romance. If you must, one explicit scene would be quite enough, and any other occasion to include romance or intimacy could be handled differently.I could not recommend this book to anyone, but strongly encourage everyone to read The Clan of the Cave Bear, Passage of the Plains, Valley of the Horses, and Mammoth Hunter. They were 100% superb!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"A total disappointment. I bought the book hoping that the authorhad returned to the wonderful storytelling skill she demonstrated in The Clan of the Cave Bear and the Valley of the Horses. By the time of her fourth book, The Plains of Passage she had almost abandoned the story and was so dedicated to flora and fauna that it was hard to read the book. The Shelters of Stone is even less interesting than the previous book. If you took out the part that was devoted to the characters that I wanted to read about the book would be only a few pages. Jean Auel either needs to get back on track or she should start writing educational textbooks. I absolutely will check out her next book before I waste any money on buying it."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I waited 6 years for this next book in the series and would have rather waiiting longer for a book with some depth. The book was repetitive and thoughts were not complete. Many opportunities to build the story were just put aside for the next series. Reading the entire book waiting for Ayla to have her baby and then very little is mentioned of the baby once it is born. Her first books were fabulous this was a disappointment!"},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I have trouble believing Jean Auel wrote this. Its missing all the story telling qualities of the first 4 books. Its almost a kindergarten version. Ayla was built up as a character with depth in the earlier books and becomes a shallow, power seeking brat. I love re-reading the other books, but this one is on its way to the Goodwill. Can't believe I waited this long for this drivel. yuck."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"At least the sex scenes aren't as numerous as in The Mammoth Hunters or Plains of Passage!This is a predicatable sequel with no real eye-openers. It all works out the way you figure it will. There were extremely repetitive parts (if I have to read one more time about how amazing everyone is by Ayla and her animals, I will scream) and some parts were just too easy-not enough conflict.That said, it was a light, interesting read. Wait till it's in paperbackNothing will every beat Clan of the Cave Bear."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I should of started at chapter 31. Chapters 1-30 was so boring. I skipped over a lot of the info. How many times can you describe a moutain, a cave, and how to make tea and fire.

I was very disappointed because it was so boring and repetitive. Where was the plot? I kept thinking that Ayla was going to decide to search for her son, Durc or that there would be an encounter with the \\"flatheads\\" and Ayla would have to act as an interpreter. I wish I could understand why Ms. Auel would tempt her readers with signs that either of these plots would develope but never followed through. I would have given this a two star rating if I hadn't had such high expectations."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"There are many comprehensive, articulate reader reviews here, so I hestitate to even write another. I am doing so, mostly, to vent my negative feelings about the author, who I feel cheated her many faithful fans. She made us love Ayla (and Jondalar) as we shared her life from toddler to womanhood through four books. Now, she has presented us with an unbelievable character who you soon realize will \\"live happily everafter\\", for this book is going nowhere with the little hints of impending danger and drama. Jondalar's cave community is as organized and civilized as any middle class 20th century American village. There is nothing believable here. Ms. Auel used our longing for another book as an excuse to do years of research and then she used Ayla's life to piece the facts into a book. There is no story, no credibility, no soul. I am sad for Ayla. I am mad at Jean Auel for taking her beautiful story and striping it of what was so special. She should be ashamed for taking our money."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00466HQ1A/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_imgThis book reads as if it were a pastiche of parts of previous books.

My brother, who is a great Auel fan, called me (because I am a writer and have a doctorate in creative writing, and he is an engineer) to ask me what I thought of the book. When I told him that it seemed to lack a plot, he said in a very relieved tone, \\"Well, I couldn't find one, but I thought maybe it was just me.\\"I hope the next book, which I gather is the last and which is already somewhat overdue, is better than this."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I was excited to have the Earth's Children series available for my Kindle, but the OCR errors in \\"Shelters of Stone\\" make it almost unreadable. Surely SOMEONE must review the copy before the book is made available for sale? The quality of the story notwithstanding (the plot rather drags, as others have noted), it's incredibly distracting to come across so many mistakes in the text when trying to read the story. Publishers need to institute better quality control when issuing Kindle editions of old manuscripts."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"The Shelters of Stone is the fifth novel in the Earth's Children series. It continues the story of Ayla and Jondalar as they reach the home of his people, the Zelandonii. Treated with mixed reactions, most of the Zelandonii come to accept the new couple and they are mated during the summer festival.For those who have followed Ayla and Jondalar since the beginning, the story is a bit repetitive and slow-moving. However, if you are unfamiliar with the series, the book can be read as a stand-alone novel. It continues to give the reader an in-depth perspective on the struggles and beauty of pre-historic life and culture. Overall I enjoyed this book and the series itself. I would recommend it to anyone interested in pre-historic cultures."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"We continue to be overwhelmed with \\"historical\\" information well established in previous volumes. The story line continues but it is weighted down with page after page of repetition. This volume could be half its size and sufficiently treat the topic.

Otherwise, a good read."},{"Title":"The Shelters Of Stone - The Earth's Children Series, Book 5","review":"I did enjoy this book but, my word, the novelty has worn off. I got stuck near the end where Ayla and Jondalar are preparing for their matrimonial, it just seemed to go on forever. Wasn't too keen on her getting pregnant- it was almost like our heroine's character is changing in a way we don't like, becoming normal. I sense that the main problem is it's building up for the final book in the series; setting up 2 or 3 Frebec-like characters (the would-be nemesis from the mammoth hunters). Or perhaps a meeting or battle with the clan is being prepared. The best part of the book was when they met the clan couple. I think parts 4 and 5 of this series are almost like time-killers. Pt.1 was Ayla with the clan. Pt.2 Jondalar travelling while Ayla learns, grows and survives. Pt. 3 meeting and living with her own kind and choosing jondalar as her mate. Pts. 4 and 5 are similar to 3 but with the novelty gone.
