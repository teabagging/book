According to the back of the book, and according to most of the reviews I read here, this book includes all kinds of information about Reiki, including the types of things that you would really want to know as a practitioner. They say it's a \\"must have\\", \\"to practice Reiki then this book is an excellent guide\\", \\"it will get you through the basics\\", etc. Simply not true!Mainly it covers how to give various attunements--pages 79-253 are JUST ATTUNEMENTS, with just one large photo with a bit of text on each of those pages! And even those are all very repetitive and could have been condensed (e.g. repeat steps 2-5 with a different symbol) with no loss of clarity.The other chapters are not comprehensive in any way, and don't even have much in the way of useful information. They essentially cover a few fringe topics in a shallow manner, and the entire book is large type so doesn't contain as much as you would expect (or hope) from a 300 page book, ESPECIALLY at this kind of price.If you are one of Murray's Master students and want lots of repetitive pictures of how to give attunements, perhaps you would like it, but even then, it's pricey for what you get."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"I was greatly disappointed with this book.

This book is in so simple and lucid language that when you read it feels like Mr. Murray is talking and explaining it to you standing in front. Mr. Murray has very remarkably driven the point home that Reiki is a divine energy and there is no secret what so ever a layman should not know. In fact before deciding to take attunements each individual should read this book so he knows exactly what is what. Fears that opening all the secrets symbols and attunements process will harm Reiki principles is baseless since one needs to practise with real devotion as explained by Mr. Murray to expereince Reiki in its full power.

They actually having useful information you can use with Reiki that has not really been published before. Besides all the useful information that would take years for a person to acquire and thousands of dollars, it's refreshing the books do not have the usual Reiki history (which seems to change every few years) and the self-serving dogma with the story of the person's Reiki journey, which hundreds of Reiki books have.I am sure Steve Murray's books have disappointed a few Reiki Masters because of the information they share with all, which might have hurt their bottom line. But it is interesting the Reiki students who are seeking information are not disappointed, but are extremely grateful, myself being one of them.After checking other Amazons around the world it seems people from around the world must agree with me because it is reflected in the sales of these two books.I will also mention Steve Murray's Reiki DVD Attunements are wonderful programs if you want to become Attuned to Reiki and become a Reiki Healer.

He expands on many more techniques for healing with Reiki and gives step by step instructions.

I gave up a few times because of the expense and the egos I encountered along the way. You know, &quot;my system is the only real one&quot; and the coast of thousands of dollars for an attunement. Also seemed like nobody really wanted to teach all they could have.This book goes well with Mr. Murray's video attunements. The book is easy to read and it is refreshing to see an author who simple wants to share Reiki with anyone who wants to learn it. I appreciate his comments about wanting to make Reiki available to the entire world.There is a good foundation of Reiki and he dispels some myths as well. He presents how he does certain things and leaves it open to each student's experience.All the symbols are drawn and usage explained.This is for the person who wants to heal others and have their own style as well.I suggest getting all three attunement videos and the book at once. I did the first 2 attunements over a few days and did the master attunement about 1 week later.

After reading this book several times and becoming attuned to all three levels of Reiki- I become armed with the knowledge and guidance I would need to begin and continue my journey with Reiki. The book is loaded with invaluable knowledge and personal experience of Steve's - which is a terrific way for someone new like myself or you to learn from others experience. The book combined with Steve's Reiki programs have given me the confidence, knowledge and guidance that I needed in order to proceed with this wonderful method of healing. What I liked most was the new thought that Steve pioneered, the thought that one can proceed when they feel ready opposed to waiting to learn more as the older traditional methods put lengthy times on waiting to proceed to the next level. I would encourage anyone who has a sincere interest in Reiki to consider this book and what Steve Murray has to offer. I am truely grateful and feel fortunate to have found Steve's book and program's.

All 3 of S. Murray's Ultimate Guides are now my only reference books because they teach and affirm my Trust in Reiki simply and clearly. I can visualize and remember each atunement and application. Wow.The next learning joy was Reiki The Ultimate Guide Vol. 2 and learning to work with Chakras and then I couldn't wait for Reiki The Ultimate Guide Vol. 3 to be published and the beauty of these books is that that they cover so many levels of the healing we want. Now when I travel I only take these 3 books, ever.Last December a friend and Reiki Master ordered the video, REIKI MASTER ATTUNEMENT Become A Reiki Master and being busy suggested I take it home and look at it. I saw the title but somehow didn't realize what it was. I'd received my 1st and 2nd degrees from a master in town but I took the video home anyway and sat quietly, following the instructions and upon completion felt this amazing powerful - electrifying energy and it was Then that I realized I'd received the Master Atunement. Later that day I gave my sister Reik and she noticed the increase in the healing energy instantly. I had no expectation when I sat down with this video - what a wonderful surprise! It's my desire for everyone to have Reiki and I appreciate that these teachings are clear, direct and simple. The teaching in these 3 books are like having my entire Reiki library simplified!"},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"I have been trying and trying to find a Reiki Master to learn from for a little over 2 years (ever since I received my first session from a dear friend of mine). The prices were outrageous ($250 for first and second level, and $10,000 for Master level), and I read on many sites that the \\"energy exchange\\" of this much money was to be sure that the student was *sincere*. I am very sincere about my desire to learn and share reiki, but do not have that kind of money to *prove* my sincerity. I became disheartened by all of that, and had almost given up on ever being able to learn, because the cost was way out of my reach. Then I found Steve Murray's books and DVD's. I received Steve Murray's Reiki 1, 2 and Master level DVD's and his 1st, 2nd and 3rd books as a gift from my dad who knew how very badly I wanted to learn Reiki, and am now attuned up to the 2nd level (and will study at this level for some time before taking the Master Level attunement). A short time ago, my dad was hospitalized for a subdural hematoma. I channeled reiki to him in the OR, and he says that he thinks he became more alert sooner after surgery in part due to my channeling the reiki energy to him. Even his ICU nurse was surprised that he wasn't more sleepy. I give alot of credit to the medical attention he received during his hospital stay, and I can't thank Steve enough for making his program affordable so I could do this for my dad, and for realizing that there are many sincere people who desire to learn for genuine and very personal reasons, whether or not they have that amount of money to prove it. I highly recommend Steve's books and dvd's. His books are very easy to read and hard to put down, and will be great to refer back to. The dvd's are very meditative and powerful too, and I will be using them for re-attunements as needed. Thank you again for everything, Steve! Keep up the great work you are doing!"},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"I became interested in Reiki when my wife's mother passed away.

You will feel different after the attunement(s). It has nothing to do with Religion. It's complete with photos, illustrations and easy to use language so anyone can understand. More info go to www.healingreiki.com. I could not put this book down once I started reading it. I became in a trance-like state when reading, and returned to normal a few minutes later after reading.

I had questions about Reiki that my Reiki Master couldn't answer, and so, I didn't feel confident to go out into the world and practice Reiki in a professional setting. I knew that clients would ask me questions that I, like my Reiki Master, wouldn't be able to answer. So, I prayed for guidance and asked to be directed to someone who could help me.Not long after my prayer, I found Steve Murray purely by accident. I had gone into a bookstore in Sedona, AZ and on a shelf in front of me was his \\"Reiki Psychic Attunement\\" DVD. I was a little skeptical at first, since my Reiki Master had told me that attunements needed to be received in person, but something about his creative use of Reiki intrigued me, so I purchased the DVD, along with Steve's \\"Reiki Healing Attunement\\" DVD, and I still can't believe the results I received!I received such powerful attunements from his DVD's!! I had always been psychic with natural healing abilities, but his attunements seemed to amplify my skills even more! I began having consistent clairvoyant visions after taking his \\"Reiki Psychic Attunement\\" DVD, and I received almost instant healing of some stress related conditions, I had been dealing with for some time, shortly after taking his \\"Reiki Healing Attunement\\", from his DVD. The results I received were nothing short of miraculous! I definitely knew then that there was power in his DVD attunements! And that attunements didn't have to be taken in person in order to be effective!So, I purchased all the rest of his DVD's and Books and have never been disappointed!! His Books are written so clearly and concisely that anyone, no matter what their educational background can understand them . Steve is very generous with the wealth of information he provides in both his Books and his DVD's , and when I was finished (reading his books and taking his attunements) I truly felt I had finally attained a solid foundation from which to practice Reiki professionally.I ended up finishing my Reiki Master with Steve Murray, and I truly feel it's the best decision that I have ever made! All my questions about Reiki have finally been answered through his Books and DVD's and I feel so grateful to have found him!If you are interested in Reiki education, there is no better person to work with than Steve Murray! I have read many, many Reiki authors and there is no one that comes close! I am convinced, that the results you'll receive, from Steve Murray's Reiki Books and DVD's, will truly astound you! As they have truly astounded me! I don't care what anyone says, distance attunements really work!!!My dream has been, for sometime now, to practice Reiki professionally, but I was afraid to, because I didn't feel I had all my questions answered. I didn't feel I had a solid foundation from which to work from, but now, because of Steve Murray's Books and DVD's, I feel that I finally have the knowledge and confidence necessary to succeed! Steve Murray's Reiki Books and DVD's have truly made my dream a reality! And for that, I will be forever grateful to him!Whether your goal is to work professionally with Reiki, or to use it to heal and enhance your everyday life, you can't go wrong with Steve Murray's Books and DVD's.

Basic information is pretty much the same as other reiki books, but this shows the symbols as the title says. Big part of this book is to show you how to give attunements to others, step by step pictures. Some part contains the information how to contact spirit and the loved ones that crossed over, and some reiki secrets. It does not show detailed hand positions to give reiki like other books that I read, so this guide may not be for the complete beginner.

I was thrilled to find Steve Murray's materials as a new resource that helped fill in the many gaps left by that first class. I am grateful and appreciative to all of my Reiki Master Teachers. However, I found Steve Murray's material to be very affordable and helpful.It is puzzling that other Reiki practitioners or masters feel the need to attack or denigrate this incredible resource for others. There is room for many different approaches and sources. It is up to the consumer to choose what feels right for themselves. If you want to take an in-person class, by all means do it. But if you cannot afford to go that route, this allows you to get started in the privacy of your own home for far less $$$.I am a Usui/Tibetan Reiki Master and Karuna Reiki Master. I have had both DVD, book-learned Reiki, and in-person Reiki classes. I can honestly say that I felt NO DIFFERENCE between getting attunements in person versus Steve Murray's distant attunements. Needless to say, we have ALL of Steve Murray's DVD's and books now. I received my first Reiki Master certificate from Steve Murray, which was greatly appreciated. Thank you Steve!I have been consistently impressed with Steve Murray's mission to help spread Reiki as far and wide as he can through these products. He is straightforward and is open enough to make himself available for questions. If you purchase Steve Murray's DVD's, get the distant attunements, and still desire an in-person attunement, and are near the Denver, CO area, please feel free to contact me for an in-person attunement to reinforce the DVD attunement through my email at reikitherapy4u \\"at\\" gmail \\".\\" com (run this together and substitute the \\"at\\" symbol). Just tell me Steve and Amazon sent you!Namaste, and Reiki Blessings to you"},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"Informative. Reiki info without the fu-fu earth child stuff you find in others. To the point. Like it."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"This is a great book to get you started on Reiki. I already knew a great deal about healing and many things metaphysical, however reiki is still fairly new to me. This book delivers the information you need to start your journey and it helps you integrate it into what you already know. The dvd's do work very well, however I actually found more energy in the book itself. It had a very intense energy to it and after reading the whole thing my crown chakra tingled for a while. This was just my experience though. I was very skeptical of the dvd's at first but after reading this book I was convinced and decided to give it a try. What I liked is that he is very open minded and does not assume to know everything or what is right for the reader. Everyone individual has their own beleifs and he does not impose upon those he simply expresses his opinion. He seems very down to earth and I found consolation in the fact that he does not talk negatively about those who would try to bring him down, but explains why they do so. Most reiki books are about history and hand positions. Thats great but I was looking for something to help build upon my prior knowledge of healing, and this was what I was lead to. Give it a try!"},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"I like this book so much that I currently own two copies and intend to buy more for friends. I've been practicing Reiki for 10 years now and I found the book to be extremely clear, accurate and helpful. I found the personal tips and advice from the author to be extremely helpful. I found myself wishing that I'd read this book years ago.The book explains what Reiki is and gives you information on using Reiki to heal yourself and others. This information is generally related to first level Reiki students. The book explains the Reiki symbols and gives advice on how to use them. Second level Reiki students are able to use these symbols for specific purposes such as mental/emotional healing or sending Reiki to others across long distances.The book explains the process of attunements. An attunement is done to connect a person to the Reiki energy. If you're reading this and you haven't done these attunements, let me recommend Steve's DVDs. You can find them here on Amazon by searching on \\"Steve Murray DVD\\" or visit http://www.healingreiki.com. You will also find additional books in his Ultimate Guide series. When used together, these make an outstanding program of study.The book really shines when it comes to showing a Reiki master how to perform first, second and master level attunements on others. This is an area that is poorly documented. I've seen many books and descriptions that left me with a feeling that I \\"kind of\\" knew what to do. This book gives you step by step instructions for each level attunement. For each step, there are pictures that show you what needs to be done. Every detail is well documented in the 150 pictures provided. These are so clear and so easily understandable that there is simply no room for doubt or confusion.The book wraps up with some very useful information on using Reiki as a basis for your spiritual journey.Here are links to the DVDs I've referenced in my review:Reiki 1st Level Attunement Become a Reiki HealerReiki 2nd Level Attunement Learn and Use the Reiki Sacred SymbolsReiki Master Attunement Become a Reiki MasterHere are links to the other Ultimate Guide Books I've referenced in my review:Reiki The Ultimate Guide, Vol. 2 Learn Reiki Healing with Chakras, plus New Reiki Healing Attunements for All Levels (Reiki: The Ultimate Guide)Reiki the Ultimate Guide, Vol. 3: Learn New Reiki Aura Attunements Heal Mental & Emotional IssuesReiki The Ultimate Guide Vol. 4 Past Lives & Soul Retrieval Remove Psychic Debris & Heal Your Life (Reiki - The Ultimate Guide)Reiki the Ultimate Guide Vol. 5 Learn New Psychic Attunements to Expand Psychic Gifts & Healing (Reiki: The Ultimate Guide)"},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"\\"I want to take this opportunity to express my deepest love and gratitude to Spirit and to Steve Murray for being a conduit for providing the incredible \\"Reiki The Ultimate Guide\\" series to those of us who needed to come home. That is how I felt when I started the process of reading the series of Guides that Steve has written and receiving the Attunements by DVD. There really are no words to express the changes in my life. I feel blessed to be gifted with the ability to heal others in word and now in touch. I have been a healer all my life but being raised in a \\"God fearing\\" environment I learned at a young age to suppress any other belief or feelings that I may have had. I am now learning that God is a loving God and wants only the very best for us and through us can provide the healing that the world as a whole needs NOW. I feel blessed to BE a part of the peace, harmony, love, kindness, compassion and healing NOW. The process of coming to Reiki has healed my life and me immeasurably in a short period of time. I know that Reiki will continue to heal my life and me by enabling me to gift this healing to others. I am more conscious of my eating habits, my smoking habits, my drinking habits, my thinking, my speaking, my protection, my level of PATIENCE and my BEING with others. Everything is changing within me and manifesting outwardly. I practice Reiki on myself each night before I go to sleep and afterwards I sleep so soundly that I wake up and it's already morning. I thought I was a peaceful person before Reiki but am finding a newfound peacefulness that surpasses what I thought I had. In a nutshell, I have \\"come home\\" and for that alone I am grateful. I look forward to every opportunity to practice, practice and practice. In Spirit, MaggieP.S.

I will be using methods like meditation and Reiki in my practice. In the past people marketed Transcendental Meditation (TM) to make large sums of money. The concept of meditation was good but using it to bilk large sums of money from others was just wrong. Reiki is at a crossroads. People must decide if it is to be used just as a money making scheme or for the betterment of mankind. The concept of Reiki works. It has helped many people. But like TM some see Reiki as a way to make large sums of money off others. Steve Murray has taken Reiki and made it available to everyone at a fair price. His books and tapes work.

This can be very dangerous and, to my mind, negates the ideals of Reiki. The whole point of having an attunement via a Master is to develop a relationship with a)infinite and healing energy and b) your Reiki Master. I have know of a few people who have become attuned in this way when they were simply not ready. They found the experience disturbing, even frightening.

I too read the reviews here before purchasing. I visited his website and came back here because Amazon always has the best deals. I took a leap of faith. The book is the foundation for the attunements. It is very clear and personalizes the Reiki Master who is giving you the attunements. I wouldn't do the attunement without having read the corresponding part in the book. You have to know what you have to know. The DVDs worked for me. I totally support this method and will continue on. I know there are different strokes for different folks but I gave it a chance it paid off. Actually, it paid off big time considering how much others charge for the same. I am extremely grateful to Steve Murray. He is a special and gifted guy."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"I have read all four of Steve Murray's Books, Reiki the Ultimate Guides 1,2,3, and Reiki False beliefs Exposed for all. I use them all the time as reference. I have been studying the Healing Arts for some years now, and felt my greatest shift in energy when I first took the Reiki One Attunement through Steve's DVD program. Now I am a Reiki Master, and I owe it all to Steve Murray's belief that Reiki should be available to all. I studied Reiki for about 6 months prior to finding out about Steve Murray's program, I thought it would never be possible for me. All the other programs cost too much and I had to travel, which was another expense I didn't have. I have still read other Reiki Books and Information, none of them were as thorough and informative as Steve Murray's 4 books. They filled in all the holes that the other sources left out or didn't want to release. In my opinion this Program is the best out there, nothing is cryptic, it is all easy to follow and understand, at a fraction of the cost. Without these 4 books by my side, I would have too many questions, and not enough answers. Which would hinder me from giving the best Reiki Service I can. Thank you, Steve! Keep up the good work, I believe you are spreading a powerful message to the masses, that message is of peace.

The books are a clear and straightforward instruction in Reiki, Reiki practice specifics like grounding, protection, intention, preparation for both healing practitioner and recipient, and ethical considerations. Although I have previously been given Reiki attunement, I chose to purchase the 1st Level, 2nd Level, and Master Level Attunement DVDs and experience them from Steve Murray. The attunements were exceptional and I have every confidence that I am completely aligned with the wonderful universal life energy of Reiki both for my own personal benefit and to offer in service to others. Additionally, I have purchased both the Psychic Attunement and Healing Attunement DVDs and would highly recommend these to practitioners, students, and anyone interest in Reiki."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"The day after reading this book and receiving the first level attunement, I felt heat and tingling sensations in the palms of my hands and could feel the energy flowing out of my hands when directed toward another person. I became more aware of the healing energy through me and how to direct it with intent and purpose.This book will help reinforce, strengthen and confirm your natural abilities as a healer. The author invites you to use your intuition and experiment with what works best for you. This is a manual that explains why and how Reiki works for everyone, use of the Reiki symbols, and how to give attunements for Reiki Masters. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn how to use healing energy for themselves and others. It just makes sense to tap in and start healing yourself and those around you. I can't think of one reason not to use Reiki everyday to start to heal and transform your own life, those around you and even the planet."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"I purchased all of Steve Murray's attunements for Reiki 1, 2 and 3 for Reiki Master plus his book and all have been wonderful.

I have even astral traveled several times and have had others say when I send long distance to them they are floating or see visions and had one person astral travel with me one time while channeling reiki to them. I recommend his attunements very highly and also his books and music. Thank you Steve for making these available to us who cannnot receive these attunements in other ways.

When I first took Reiki there were many secrets that weren't supposed to even be discussed with others who were not attuned. So many hushed truths. I just mean there were stuff taught that you're not suppose to share to others until they pay and take the class. So I understand how this book must have shocked many Reiki Masters. It shows the secret Reiki Symbols and how to use them. And you know what? I think it's time to share the powers of this healing technique to anyone and everyone who wants/needs it. And it should be taught at an affordable price. This book does all that."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"Steve's book is really revealing openly many things that many others don't do.

Suffice it to say that those Reiki recipients whom I have been working with for some time have commented that they notice an increase in Reiki power -- and they didn't know that I had been doing further study with Steve Murray's Usui Reiki system products; they simply knew something was different. As a newly-signed author myself, I love his writing style; Steve is straight to the point without unnecessary wording --- I like and appreciate that.Steve Murray's books and DVDs and absolutely priceless and will remain in my personal library as invaluable reference materials in the years to come.

His detailed instructions and lavish photo demonstrations of the various attunements and techniques are invaluable for those who don't want to memorize or can't remember something they've been taught in a weekend class.The attunement DVDs are a wonderful low cost way to receive the attunements, especially for those who are not intending to go into Reiki as a business, but simply want to learn how to do Reiki for themselves, family and friends. My personal belief, based upon my own experience is that long distance attunements do work. I've been doing Reiki for myself and for those near and dear to me. I feel the success of the treatments is vouched for by the number of people who've been referred to me.I appreciate Steve's attitude that the actual healing is the important thing, and that lineage and apprenticeship to a Reiki Master should take a back seat to that. Some people do need that sort of structure and instruction, and that's fine. Those so inclined should definitely pay the money and take a class to receive their attunements. Personally, I already had a background in Therapeutic Touch and Crystal healing, & I view Reiki as an enhancement of what I was already doing.I found Steve Murray's books and DVDs valuable, & I'm pleased with his maverick view of a subject which should be allowed to grow and evolve, lest Reiki fall prey to too much ceremony and institutionalism."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"Steve Murray's Reiki VOL 1,2,3 and Reiki False Beliefs and Attunement DVD's are nothing short of a miracle.

Steve's products have made it possible for me to become one. His attunement DVD's really work and his Healing attunement DVD is a must buy. It really works. I wholeheartedly reccommend these books and DVD's to anyone wanting to heal themselves or anyone wanting to become a Reiki healer.

It used to be, that receiving Reiki attunements was expensive, Reiki Masters were few and far between and Reiki knowledge was kept hush-hush (only known by a few).This book is amazing. Yes, I have been a Reiki Master for several years and when I wanted a thorough review, this book came to me.There are so many photos here that show how to give Reiki Step-by-Step. This almost makes attending a real classroom to learn Reiki, unnecessary (although you may still like to take one or two for hands-on practice and training).Steve Murray also gives tips on how to use Reiki to heal the past, the future, relationships, etc which are so helpful."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"This book is great and exactly what I was looking for. In my Reiki classes all the teacher gave out were a few limited handouts. This seems to be the case with most Reiki classes. And I was never taught how to do a Reiki Psychic or Healing Attunement. This book has many photos and is easy to read and understand which is truly wonderful. I can actually see how Reiki Attunements (1st, 2nd, Master, Healing and Psychic) are performed with the symbols.This has helped me immensely in learning Reiki.The book also talks about many other topics, including preparing for Attunements, Psychic Debris, and protecting yourself.I would guess the few people who did not like the book already know how to perform all the Attunements by heart and are teachers. For me (and from reading other reviews and sales of the book) this book with all the photos and text is the best. There's plenty of information in the book for all levels that they should know. If you are only a 1st or 2nd level Reiki healer or thinking about having an Reiki Attunement, you should know how an Attunement is performed before you receive one. Now, try and ask most Reiki teachers how Attunements are performed. It's a sure bet most will not tell you they can't and mention they must keep it a secret for a variety of reasons. Or for a large fee they will show you.Mr. Murray has three other books in the Ultimate guide series and DVDs that are excellent also.

The author shares Reiki with the world in an honest, simple and understandable way and you can feel that his intent is genuine. After attunements I always felt an inner shift occurring, felt like each time my energy vibrations were lifted to a higher level that left me with a feeling of inner calm and at the same time inner strength. I like Steve words at the beginning of each attunement \\"I believe at this very moment our energies are connected in the now\\". These are not just words, it is something that really happens in time of attunements, it is very real. Before attunements Steve Murray gives detailed instructions on how to prepare yourself for the attunements, what to expect during and after attunements, which position you need to hold your hands. All the smallest questions that you might have about attunement are covered. The same is with Steve Murray's books. They are extremely clearly written guides, (step by step, with photographs) how to give Reiki 1st, 2nd , Master, Healing and Psychic attunements (volume 1), how to perform Healing Attunement with Chakras to help heal a specific physical ailment or disease (volume 2) and how to perform Aura Healing Attunement for specific mental and emotional issues (volume 3). Reiki False Beliefs exposed for All has all answers that you can imagine about Reiki in easy to understand question - answer form. Quoting Buddha (volume1), Rumi (volume 2), Confucius (volume 3) and Lao Tzu (Reiki False Beliefs...) in the beginning of each chapter is also a very nice and inspirational touch. You will get the wealth of information about Reiki symbols and their use in everyday life, about charkas and meridians, about aura and its layers, how to sense, see and protect it, what its colors mean, how to prepare and protect yourself from physic debris during healing session etc.Reading Steve Murray's books makes you feel light and uplifted versus scared and limited since Steve always recommends to take from his teaching what resonates with you and leave what does not.I truly believe that taking Steve Murray's Reiki Attunements and studying his books from cover to cover will give you enough knowledge and confidence to be a Reiki healer to heal others and yourself .

It's hard to tell if his motiviation in publishing Reiki secerets is noble or commercial. Nonetheless there is lots of useful information in the book, including the full set of symbolys needed. Much information and Steve's personal philosophy is repeated, this continues into the following book. I'm currently reading that one, which has rather good references on the chakras."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"I was an advance practioner of Reiki, and took the master attunement on dvd, but this is incomplete unless you get hold of this magnificent well illustrated book,it was for sure the right decision,it will teach you what is needed to be a true Reiki Master."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"The Reiki techniques are presented in a simple easy to understand format.I appreciated the author sharing the healing and psychic attunements; other Reiki authors only mention them and never explain how they are performed."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"It's about time someone step up and write a book to show how to pass attunements.

Also included is additional info that everyone will find helpful. It's so simple to understand, much simpler than the way I was taught.

You will be happy with the book."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"This is an awesome review of Reiki basics with all those little things you may have forgotten over the years.After reviewing all four books (Reiki Ultimate Guide Volumes 1-3 and Reiki False Beliefs Exposed For All) I found that the sections on psychic sugery (Volume 2) and the entire book(Volume 3) about aura attunements really grabbed my interest the most. I plan on using the aura attunements where I can in my practice, starting with myself. I am also interested in the Reiki Healing Attunements because when I was taught my level 1 and level 2 we didn't really have such things, it was a more hands on, balancing with specific spot healing when needed. I like the approach of using the chakra's and appreciated the layout you gave for the chakra's and their associated physiological areas. Again, very useful. These books and the 3 DVD attunements have totally changed my perspective about my practice of Reiki. I can truly see why you term these volumes as a Toolbox. I would suggest that any serious Reiki Practitioner should read and re-read these as they are definitely applicable to the 'real world' applications of Reiki. Thanks to Steve Murray for his insight in getting these out to the world!"},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"The first line of this book, which says \\"I believe at this very moment as you read this, our vibrations and energies are connected in the now\\". As soon as I read this I felt I am connected to Steve. I felt connected to his vibrations all throughout this book. I did finish the book in only a few hours. This book tells what other Reiki books don't. This is a must read for all the people who want to find the secrets which are generally hidden by reiki masters. It tells in detail, about all the attunement process, step by step with pictures. All the symbols are there with pictures and how to activate them. Some people feel that that the symbols should not be displayed like this. I disagree completely, I know that the symbols are sacred and should be treated with respect but I don't see a reason that why they should be hidden. And without attunement these symbols are just drawings, they cant be activated. Steve has also written about his experiences and the different things he does while giving treatments. This information is very valuable. This book does not contain any history of reiki or any other political views about reiki. All it contains is Reiki. There is also a chapter about how to contact the departed ones and the angels. This is a very informative chapter and it can help many people who want to contact their loved ones who crossed over suddenly or need any guidance from them for their higher good.This book is a must to have for any reiki believer at any level, be it be a healer or a Reiki master. There is so much to learn from this book. I highly recommend this book.I recommend the entire set of dvd's and books by Steve to everyone who is on a spiritual or just healing journey. Once you use these products with a open mind, your life will never be the same again.I urge everybody to experience Reiki. It can change your life for good in so many ways. It will heal you on all levels and make your surroundings more pleasant. After some time of continuous use, you will feel that things have started falling back in place on their own. You can go and take a Reiki session from a Reiki healer or try \\"Reiki 1st Level Attunement - Become a Reiki Healer (2004)\\" by Steve Murray. Any of the options will not cost you more then 30 - 40 bucks and you can experience the divine power of Reiki. It's such a nice experience to feel life sustaining force flowing through your body at your wish and you can direct it anywhere you like, even heal a living being. From there it will depend on your fate and your karma. But at least let your body experience it once. I can bet that this might be the best investment you can ever make in your entire life."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"I became a 2nd level Reiki healer about 11 years ago and never got sick until I quit practicing a few years ago. Recently I was diagnosed with a health issue so I decided to be in control of my own health again and restarted to practice Reiki.Among a few Reiki books that I purchased lately, Mr. Murray's book really surprised me because it was full of \\"technical\\" information but so easy to understand. I then purchased more of his books, DVDs and CD. I was skeptical about the DVD attunement but it works well for me. I'm using it almost every other day and can feel my Reiki energy flows stronger than before. I'm grateful for these programs and now a Reiki Master certified through his program.I have recommended Mr. Murray's programs to my friends who suffer from health problems or stress."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"I was enthusiastically recommending this the first Volume in the Ultimate Guide series, to a friend. She asked, 'But will I understand it, because you've had years of learning about Reiki and I'm just beginning'. My reply was that this guide is for us all and is easily understood as Steve Murray, the excellent teacher that he is, makes clear and even simple things that others make complicated and often do not explain at all. It is true that I began my Reiki experience more than twenty years ago, when I had to memorize the symbols. (I have to admit that I drew the symbols very small and secretly and carried them with me equally secretly, so that I would get them right.) Now to my great relief in Steve Murray's Guides the symbols are in plain sight and beautifully introduced in the stages of the attunements. Now I can proceed with confidence with Reiki. I can get it right and some of my learning needed correction.Each term is explained, as it is introduced. The book, as with all of the Guides, has been produced with great care and thought so that there is nothing superfluous but also nothing is omitted that can help in understanding Reiki, and what the attunements for the three levels are, why they are important and the process. The latter part is given in a step by step form, photographs together with the appropriate symbols in the correct postions. The questions one has about Reilki, e.g. can Reiki be sent to people in need of healing without their permission, (yes it can, with a provision), are answered as one reads further. Steve Murray knows the questions that we have and addresses the concerns and blurry areas; his many students have asked these questions and he explains all areas with logic and clarity and does not avoid the difficult or contraversial.Five stars don't seem adequate for this Guide and all the other Guides which explain in clear detail more specialized areas of working with Reiki. I haven't mentioned his beautifully produced and most effective DVDs. I am glad to have found at last the information I need in the Guides and DVDs. At last I feel my work with Reiki will really take off. I have much to learn but now I have the resources. My thanks to a courageous and excellent teacher, Reiki Master. Reiki has been brought out into the light, so that we can learn, become attuned and attune, and become the healing influences so badly needed."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"What can I say about Steve Murray and his work... I have been a Reiki practitioner for over a decade, and I can tell you that Steve's books and DVDs are among my most treasured possessions on my book case. I see his work benefiting both existing Reiki practitioners and those just looking to get started.Steve's books are like GOLD, as they are actually more comprehensive than the materials provided by most Reiki masters to their students. I am sure that many Reiki Masters must be upset with Steve, as he divulges information that most Reiki Masters believe to be secret, including all the symbols up to Master Level, and the attunement processes. Most Reiki books do not include this information, and have been very disappointing to me.After buying his first book, I decided, after reading the reviews, I needed to own the others. I currently have all 5 Reiki guides and the Reiki myths book. And, of course, the package would not be complete without the DVDs.I would say, though, that although the first book is excellent, it is not enough for me. I needed the Visual of the DVDs to bring it all home. So, I don't think that you can buy a single book, read it, and walk away a Reiki Master. Each of his books and DVDs, however, complements the others. With the combination of the Books, DVDs, studying and practice, you CAN BECOME A REIKI MASTER.What's awesome about the DVDs is that you can take the attunements over and over again. As someone who was attuned in person by a Reiki Master over a Decade ago, I can attest to the DVD attunements as being every bit as effective as in person.My only criticism is that the whole package should be sold as a complete set, as once you get started, you will want the whole set anyway. However, I guess that most will not want to plunk down that money (even though it is completely reasonable in the scheme of things) without first experiencing the quality of it with the first book.If you are interested in Reiki, and don't want to waste your time and money with disappointments, just get this material, and you will not regret it."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"This talent, ability, skill is quite amazing.I've gained it through a friend and i must saythat it is inexplicably beautiful.

Steve's introduction is quite honest and I know of others who share this philosophy and dedication to making Reiki affordable to people.What these books and DVD's can give you is a working knowledge of how to draw the symbols and the process of attunements both receiving and giving. The pictures are very easy to follow and detail hand positions and how and where to draw the symbols for passing on attunements. As for the complaints for not having the traditional hand placements he clearly states the philosophy behind his reasons to give treatment to specific places of the body and why. This made sense to me and as I know every practitioner is not the same. Getting the traditional placements online is easy.I also felt the attunement dvd's or video's Steve Murray has available are amazing. They are wonderful, life altering, and being absolutely blessed experience. Reiki is for everyone willing to learn and he provides it.

You will find everything you need in easy to understand language and photos."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"I have nothing but great things to say about Steve Murray's program. All his books are well-written, to the point, and very informative. I also agree that if you can send someone long-distance Reiki, it only follows that you could send someone a long-distance attunement. I was fortunate enough to be able to do both a Reiki 1 seminar in person, and Steve Murray's Reiki 1 DVD attunement with his books. Both taught the same information about the history of Reiki, what Reiki is and isn't, and how attunements are given. The only difference is that in the seminar we were shown how to give Reiki to self and others and had the opportunity to practice quite a few times. I think that if Steve Murray could make a DVD with a demonstration of giving a full Reiki session to self and to others, that would make his program complete in my opinion. However, you can purchase William Lee Rand's \`The Reiki Touch' set and that comes with a DVD demonstration. There is not an attunement in that set because they are of the belief that attunements must be done in person. The in- person attunement and Steve Murray's DVD attunement felt the same to me and I plan to do Reiki 2 and Master Reiki through Steve Murray. He also can send you a really beautiful certificate for each level you complete!"},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"Empowering!!I am by nature open minded but cautious.

Very congruent in all his writing and his mission statement.His DVD's and books empower you on whatever level you are interested in learning. He is a true teacher.

It takes the secrets of Reiki and makes them available to all."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"A couple of months ago, I received a Reiki session. After the session, I had this thirst for knowledge on Reiki. I started out by buying Steve Murray's Reiki 1st Level Attunement Become a Reiki Healer DVD (2001) and Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know. It gave me some basic information so I was able to understand what was happening during my session and why. I was totally absorbed in the Reiki process. After the Level 1 Attunement, I started giving my daughter and a friend Reiki healing sessions. I was amazed at the energy that flowed from my hands. His book was easy to read and understand. He listed each step to follow during the session. I have been able to study the book again and again. Each time, I gained more information. The more I gained, the more I wanted to learn more. So I then purchased Reiki 2nd Level Attunement Learn and Use the Reiki Sacred Symbols DVD, Reiki The Ultimate Guide, Vol. 2 Learn Reiki Healing with Chakras, plus New Reiki Healing Attunements for All Levels and Reiki Psychic Music Attunement CD Volume I and 2 ~ (Audio CD) Reiki Healing Music Attunement Volume 1 and 2 ~ (Audio CD) Again, I felt drawn to continue to learn. I continued the healing sessions with my daughter and have now included 3 other family members. Each session has given the receiver different a different response. They love to receive my Reiki healing and I feel happiness in knowing that I am helping them. I really enjoy listening to his Music Attunement Volume 1. My family love listening to the music because it relaxes them.Recently I received Reiki Master Attunement. I am anxious to experience this Attunement but I will do it when I feel I am ready.All his program and powerful attunements has enabled me to complete Reiki training at my own comfort level. Using his programs has allowed me to experience the gift of Reiki in my life and to share this gift with others. Reiki has given me more focus, balance, and energy. I feel a great sense of peace within me. I would recommend his DVDs and books to anyone interested in experiencing a healthier, more peaceful life. I want to thank Steve Murray for making Reiki affordable with all his tapes/DVD's/CD's.

I didn't want to get any of his books or dvds. I read some of the reviews from other Master's and they talked badly about his teachings and how an attunement could not be done by watching a crystal on dvd. But, later i remembered having a dream when i was younger of watching myself staring at a crystal on tv. I thought it was freaky and didn't know what it meant, but then it all came together. So i started off with his first reiki book, the psychic attunement, and the reiki level one attunement. I had better results than i thought i was going to get. I have a natural gift for healing and i've been using it un-trained my whole life. His books and dvds helped me out a lot. This is the real thing and if you are new and looking to try reiki, i highly recommend it. I don't write reviews and Steve Murray is the first review i've ever written on. This is because i want people to know that this is real and powerful. The DVD's are powerful and the books explain it all and enforce all that is Imparted to you. By the way, I am a Christian and you should know that Reiki has no religion. I recommend all the DVD attunements, and i've read the first 3 Reiki volume set and the false beliefs. I will be getting more of his books and teaching. But i hope that this review and his works help you like it's helped me in my entire life and the people around me. I've healed things from headaches and back pains, to two different friends that were in the hospital death bed, one with severe kidney failure and the other had AIDS and i helped bring his status down to a controlled HIV status. Both were overnight. night saying it will work like that for everybody, but know that it will work in it's own way, some way.

I have copies of several of his books, including this one, as well as the Reiki Master Attunement DVD. Having experience as a Level 2 Reiki practitioner prior to obtaining Steve's material, I was amazed to find much of what I struggled with and wondered about, explained in his easy to understand books with great photos! I already had other Reiki books, but Steve's are much more helpful. Don't let any critics tell you that Steve can't teach Reiki through books and DVDs. Energy has no limits. Upon completing my Reiki Master Attunement with his DVD, my abilities to use Reiki for healing, channeling and psychic connections were greatly enhanced within just a few days.

It's packed with everything you need to know or should know about Reiki, how it works, and how the attunements work. It also contains a lot of extra information so that you're sure to be left satisfied.Compared to the other books I have purchased, this one is the best, and most valuable. Other books merely \\"talk\\" about Reiki and attunements instead of explaining them. I remember having many questions about Reiki, and not being able to find the answers. Ever since I got this book I've been very pleased, and so have others that have borrowed it from me.This book doesn't go into the history of Reiki, but since almost every other book does I'm not disappointed one bit. You can find that information just about anywhere, even free on the internet.Overall, this is a great book. I find myself reading it on many occasions for reinforcement, and being a practitioner myself I find it very invaluable. Steve Murray also has many attunement programs on video and DVD which are worth checking out, as well as another book along the way. Great work Steve!"},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"If you are interested in learning about reiki and energy healing I suggest getting Steve's book and videos. I have had several different distance attunements myself starting with Usui the most popular, with Kundalini, Imara Reiki, and a few others. But not until I had gotten Steve's three level attunement videos and book The Ultimate Reiki Guide had I had much success. Steve uses a unique way to transform an attunement to the viewer.Steve's book explains many detailed items about using the symbols of reiki that I have found very useful. In his book he explains how to do a reiki attunement for opening and enhancing psychic abilities a healing attunement, and the first level, second level and Master level attunements, plus information about sending healing energy to animals and using it to protect yourself, not to mention to contact spirits related to relatives that passed on.I know this review was to be on Steve's book, but for anyone interested in becoming a reiki healer or master healer I suggest they get both Steve's book and his three videos to see first hand how he works with reiki to get the best understanding.Steve is a true pioneer! Another good thing about Steve's book is that he leaves out the history and of peoples opinions and research about reiki and gets down to how to use it without wasting time nor space in his book. Just about every book you pick up has the history about reiki which is okay to a degree, but after reading it once or twice that is enough. A true \\"How To Do\\" book.The best part of my review is that using reiki after Steve's attunements I have been able to feel better doing healing attunements on myself for my degerative disk disease and pinched nerves. So far out of all that I have tried, this has helped the most."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"This is a great book, the author keeps it straight forward and simple. It can be used to review what you learned when you were attuned to Reiki. It can be used to hand out to students as they are being attuned.

So, we started reading as many books as we could find on the subject. We felt we had a pretty good knowledge about Reiki and now only needed to find someone to attune us. After endless searching, all we found out was that nobody would attune us unless we took their Reiki classes. And, that of course meant spending thousands of dollars! There was no way that either one of us could afford that! Not with us just living from paycheck to paycheck! We were discouraged, but not defeated. Finally by chance, while looking for more books on the subject, we happened upon some reviews of Steve's book and DVD's. All of the reviews sounded good and sincere. And, the price was a lot better than the thousands of dollars every one else was wanting! We decided to take a chance. The book is AWESOME! It's full of wonderful and informative information. And, it's written in a way that anyone can understand. But, I must admit, even though we were desperate for attunements, we were both a little skeptical of attunements by just watching a DVD. Well, to make a long story short. We both just completed the Master attunement, and what a believer it made out of us! The intense and overwhelming feelings we felt after watching these DVD's was unbelievable! And, it wasn't just physical sensations. We both feel as if we have been attuned on every level, mentally, physically and spiritually!

I wanted to receive my 2nd degree and my Master's attunements but could not find a Reiki Master that I wanted to study with. (My original Master left soon after my first attunement and I have been unsuccessful in locating him.)For me, the attunements are a sacred gift passed in the traditional method from Master to student in an unbroken lineage. I am a Buddhist and an ordained minister and when I found Steve Murray's books and DVDs I was astounded. How could this possibly be? How could someone who is a Reiki Master attune me via DVD?I purchased the first book, \\"The Ultimate Reiki Guide\\" and began reading, I had never seen the symbols before, I have several friends who are Reiki Masters and had always wondered what they were, (the symbols) but I also was very aware of the secrecy surrounding Reiki and never dared ask.The day I finished the first book, I used the power symbol for the first time. I could actually feel the Reiki moving through my hands just as though I was in the middle of a healing session.I purchased the Second Degree and Master's Attunement DVDs and received the 2nd degree attunement. During the attunement, I felt a strong energy field pulsing in my third eye and then in my palms. Afterwards, I began sending Reiki to several of my friends, and then called asking them if they felt anything, and they both said that they had felt the energy.I watched the Master Attunement several days later, and again I felt the strong surge of energy in my hands. I am now using my Reiki in new and wonderful ways sending energy into the past to heal friends and family as Steve shows in his videos.I am grateful that this Reiki Master healer has chosen to share his gift with the world. His books are an incredible eye-opening encyclopedia on how to use the gift of healing. I highly recommend the books and DVDs and even the healing attunements (music CDs).

This book has taken what in the past seemed unobtainable to learn, cloaked in all of it's mysticism, into easy to follow how-to steps and brought it all to my access. All the questions I ever had regarding the subject are discussed. This is the most thorough all inclusive book on the subject I have ever seen, (and believe me I checked them all out). For anyone searching for information on the topic, I highly recommend this book, it is truly the only one you will need. Because of learning of Steve Murrays ability to consolidate so much information in his works I have purchased Reiki The Ultimate Guide Vol. 2, as well as his Reiki Attunement DVD's which are also excellent, as are his Phychic and Healing Music Attunement CD's. Within one week of becoming a Reiki Master from his DVD Attunement I have been able to send powerful Reiki to a severely ill newborn miles away, and also to a job interview my son was having in Finland. The baby is fine, and my son has the job he's always dreamed of the doors opened so swiftly we were all blown away, I have always known of and used spiritual energy but with the new understanding I gained from Steve Murrays books, DVD's & CD'S, all and more I've been working at so hard in my life now flows through me freely and effortlessly. Not to mention the profound visions I've had while listening to the music attunements. This is one book you'll be glad you bought!"},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"If you are planning to use, or have been considering trying, Steve Murray's Reiki Attunement DVDs...you need this book. This text works fine as an introductory Reiki manual when read by itself alone, even without trying the author's video Attunements. But if you definitely plan to use his Attunement program, or are wondering if you should try it, I absolutely recommend reading Murray's guide book first. And if your first Reiki Attunement will be Murray's, this Guide is a must. If you're new to Reiki like myself, you will need to read it through twice. Read it once before you take your 1st Level Attunement, & then read it a second time afterwards while you're experimenting with the Reiki. Because after you receive the 1st Attunement--it becomes like reading two different books. The first time through, you'll understand the material on an intellectual, theoretical level. On the second pass, once you're attuned to Reiki & working with it, you'll understand the contents in a whole new light, from the inside & at a far greater depth.If you have already taken Steve Murray's Attunements by video & were left curious or confused about what it was he was doing during your Attunement process--this book will show you in very clear verbal & pictorial step-by-step detail exactly what the author was doing behind the scenes in order to attune you to Reiki. It also explains & depicts what steps you will need to take to pass on Reiki Attunements, should you eventually choose to become a Reiki Master yourself. Unlike any other author, Murray pulls out all the stops, cuts to the chase, & \\"lets you inside the machine\\" to take a good look around, so to speak. I have yet to see this same material presented or approach taken in any other Reiki book available.Steve Murray has an excellent talent for simplifying & clarifying what can be an intensely abstract & complex topic, making the material easily understood & assimilated by the neophyte. His delivery comes from a practical, straightforward stand point--with neither the egotistical elitism, nor the control freak power grip, that sadly seems to plague this field. The goal of this manual, as with the corresponding Attunement videos, is to prepare you with the essentials in order to get you up & running with Reiki quickly. And I can verify first hand that they can & will do exactly that. If you want to absorb Reiki theory in-depth & fill in some of the gaps, you might enjoy reading William Rand's \\"Reiki: The Healing Touch\\" following Murray's guide book. But if you want to become attuned to Reiki & get busy with it immediately, Steve Murray's \\"Reiki: The Ultimate Guide\\" & his Attunement program comes with my highest recommendation. Murray delivered what he promises, & I was able to obtain tangible results very quickly. Reiki \\"tech support\\" is made available by e-mail by the instructor himself. So far as I know, there is no other Attunement by distance program quite like this one out there. All of Murray's materials have been money well spent. This has truly changed me, at a very fundamental level."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"Whether you are a novice or a Master, this book is for you!I am a Reiki Master of direct Usui lineage trained in Reiki before I found Steve Murray's book. I was extremely pleased and surprised when I read it! While there is nothing to replace the actual 'hands-on' relationship of a Teacher and Student, or a Practitioner and Client, this book is the 'next best thing.' Instead of just a casual reference book, it is amazing in its quality of writing and information contained. It coincided almost exactly with the history , training, and actual attunements I had received through my own Reiki Teacher.Murray makes available to all, through this book, the Way of Reiki, at a reasonable and affordable price. What was once shrouded in mystery and exorbitantly paid for is now readily available to the general public. . . as should be all good spiritual paths.The Sacred Reiki Symbols, as presented, are not only historically and traditionally accurate, but are easy to learn, memorize and duplicate through Murray's work.The author provides wonderful illustrations and step-by-step instructions on attunements and healing sessions, along with definite and inspired spiritual insights. His illustrations are clear and accurate.Murray's section on \\"beaming and scanning\\" is some of the clearest work I've encountered on the subject.Along with the traditional material handed down to me, I now use this book when teaching my students. I insist that they obtain a copy as their textbook and as an integral part of their training.If you are looking for a clear, lucid, thorough treatise written in straight-forward concise language, you should get this book. Whether an absolute new-comer to Reiki, or long-time Master/Practitioner, this book will not let you down. I heartily recommend it as a \\"must-have\\" for Reiki people everywhere."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"This is a fascinating energy practice.Some practitioners regard the contents of this book as secret information, only to be passed from Master to student. Many Reiki books do not include this information. As you read this book, you will discover that it does cover all the symbols up to Master Level, and the attunement processes.The author also shows the beaming and scanning techniques he uses in his sessions which are interesting.What is not included in this book is the history of Reiki, which you can easily find from other sources or on the internet.A more surprising omission is that it does not include the different hand positions, which would require me to buy another book.If you are looking for general Reiki information, or to learn about Reiki you should look elsewhere. If you are looking to practice Reiki then this book is an excellent guide."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"First of all, I would appreciate if you read this entire review- as it is one of the few that isn't biased by coming from one of Steve's students. Some of these comments are based on his other books as well; my purpose here is just to get you to think before you buy into his program. This review will be brutally honest, and hopefully will give those not familiar with his books something to consider when determining whether they should proceed with Steve's training or opt for a more traditional class. Although I didn't get my training from him, I have read a lot of what he believes. Some of it is good, and some of it is not so good- you need to think for yourself and decide what to take from it. You also need to keep in mind that this is Steve's livelihood. If he doesn't sell books and DVDs and all the other paraphernalia he offers on his website, he doesn't eat. What he writes about is ultimately going to be influenced by this, even if it is only on a subtle level. You could argue that he is doing this to be a nice guy, but my reply would be that none of us are in business to lose money. As an example, he sells a healing grid on his site for over $100.00. I have been using crystals for almost a decade- and the stones in that grid aren't expensive at all. Most of them are cheap, tumbled gems available at any crystal store for a few bucks a handful. Maybe he thinks his Reiki 'expertise' justifies marking it up to a ridiculous price- I really don't know, you would have to ask him. Just some food for thought.I could bore you with a long list of colleges attended, my qualifications and certifications, and provide you with information on my healing practice but I won't. Suffice it to say I have been doing this a very long time and have dozens of certifications in various healing disciplines- you can either believe that or not.A lot of Reiki classes are expensive. He is right about that. I think this author provides a way for people to learn how use Reiki without spending a lot of money, and that is fine. If you are someone that just wants this information to be able to practice as a layperson on family and friends I think his material is something you should buy. Also, if you are going to start a small Reiki practice and offer your sessions free of charge this may be a book to consider. However, if you can convince your client that learning these techniques from a book and DVD qualifies you to charge money for your services - then they deserve the result they get. My guess is a lot of practitioners that use Steve's information don't tell their clients how they were trained- as not a lot of people would be willing to spend their money if they knew how they obtained their \`training'. There isn't a lot of credibility in a certification earned through a reading a book and watching a DVD.Most healing disciplines are steeped in tradition, and have been taught by one person to another for millennia. Why? Because that was the only way to ensure the techniques were CORRECTLY handed down from one generation to another. An instructor can't correct a student if he isn't there watching him practice whatever it is he is trying to learn. Reiki is a discipline where we lay hands on another to facilitate healing. Why then wouldn't a Reiki practitioner want to learn how to perform these techniques by having hands laid on them? You can't have it both ways- believing that it is OK to lay hands on a client, yet not being willing to have hands laid on you in order to learn the techniques in the first place. As an example, Jesus didn't tell his disciples to go read a scroll about laying on of hands- he demonstrated it many times while they were in His presence.The author also believes that having a Reiki lineage isn't important. If that is the case, why does he give his lineage information in all of his biographical data? Ask yourself why are you interested in buying his products in the first place? My guess is that you know he is a certified Reiki Master- and he has the credentials to prove it. If the author didn't have a lineage to lend credibility to what he says, then he would just be \`some guy' claiming to know all these \`secrets' about Reiki. No one would give him the time of day, let alone spend their hard-earned money to see what he had to say. So do you STILL believe lineage isn't important, Steve? Anyone who thinks they have the right to teach Reiki to others without a lineage is way off base- this illustration demonstrates that clearly.I could go on and on listing other things I feel are less than accurate, but this gives you an idea. If you want to buy the product, fine- but consider how you plan to use the information. He does offer up some good advice on certain things, but don't buy into it wholesale. Think for yourself and take away the information you believe is valuable for your personal situation. I hope reviewing this book from another viewpoint has helped some people."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"Having practiced reiki at 1st and 2nd degree level for the past 3 years and constantly searching for the answers to many reiki questions, Steve Murray has produced a book that should be on the bookshelf of everybody who is interested in or practicing reiki.Having purchased and read many reiki books,I still found myself searching for answers, this book has answered many questions and explains in an understanding and simple fashion, the secrets of reiki that many reiki books and masters,for whatever reason were reluctant to share with everybody.I thank Mr Murray for making this information accesible to everyone! and look forward to volume 2."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"Steve Murray's _Reiki: The Ultimate Guide_ is a very well written guide to the art of Reiki healing. There is no 'shrouded in secrecy' mumbo-jumbo here, just a straightforward description of what Reiki energy is, the levels of training, how to use Reiki, what attunements are and what they are like, and (although they have appeared in other books over the years) the Reiki sacred symbols are also included. Steve also describes in detail (along with photographs of each step) how to give the attunements for each level of Reiki.For those who seek a clear, cogent explanation of Reiki healing, this book is one of the best. It includes just about everything one would want to know, except for Reiki history, which, as Steve notes, &quot;the majority of readers are fully aware of.&quot; A bibliography is included for those who desire to read further.As a Reiki Master Teacher, this book will be a great asset to my classes, as well as being a wonderful supplement to my Reiki training. I only wish it had been around when I was in training.Traditional Reiki Masters will be upset by this book, because it, like Toto, dares to peer behind the curtain of secrecy they want to keep so tightly closed. Some of my own training was rather traditional (i.e., fundamentalist), and I have to admit that as I read the book for the first time, I looked over my shoulder to make sure the Reiki Police were not lurking in the shadows.But, more modern Reiki Masters (and people who simply want to learn more about Reiki) should welcome this book with open arms, hearts and minds."},{"Title":"Reiki The Ultimate Guide Learn Sacred Symbols & Attunements plus Reiki Secrets You Should Know","review":"First, I'd like to say that this IS the best book I've found on Reiki attunements and symbols, scanning and beaming etc. On that level I agree very much with the prior positive recommendations. I take issue with the title &quot;Ultimate&quot;, however. I was looking for a book that would educate me about EVERYTHING I needed to know to become a Reiki practitioner, and bought the book because of the positive ratings and the word &quot;Ultimate&quot; in the title. I was very disappointed to find nothing in the book about how to perform an actual Reiki session on a client. There is nothing on hand positions for healing-self or otherwise, the ethics of touching another person or any of the other information I, as a newbie, needed to know about time spent in close contact with people requesting my help. If you are seeking a book that clearly explains the attunment processes, then this is the one.

Steve Murray's book and videos answered questions for me that had gone unanswered for a long time. As a Teaching Reiki Master, I have a huge library of Reiki literature and have read many books. This one book was the best I have found in my 30 years of work on my path to the light. I will use it as a teaching resource with my students and encourage them to purchase it as a guide. The attunement videos are exquisite! In my viewing of them I experienced energy and colors like none I have felt before. This had a dynamic effect on my faith in the work Steve is doing and in his methods for sharing Reiki with the universe. Kudos to Steve Murray.

Dear reader, if you're tired of mediocre novels just off the press by so-called living authors who have sold out or cut back on their ambition--and there seem to be many--you better try this novel. Yes, \\"back to the classics\\" will be my cry.You might have read the basic plot outlines, namely, that an aging Spaniard named Celestino Marcilla has been living in exile in Paris for over twenty years because he was on the losing side of the Spanish Civil War against General Franco and his Fascists; his sister dies in Madrid and Celestino goes back to settle the estate. The \\"action\\" of the novel takes place inside Celestino's troubled head--but what a mind! Celestino is tortured by his role in the civil war, the decisions he made--an understandable dilemma--and then he's like a spoiled brat old man; he can't stand the French he's been living among, but doesn't like his fellow Spaniards, and he even has the ingratitude to fall out with his devoted young daughter, Pascualita, as well as tell his best friends, Ruiz and Pineda to f---off. But wait, there's more. . . . .On the train to Madrid, to settle his sister's estate, Montherlant brings Celestino to a feverish pitch--fear of arrest and imprisonment are real since Franco is still in power--but Celestino is consumed by another fear, that his beloved bullfighting ritual will have been diluted my commercialism. Yes, this old war veteran is an aficionado, and his high-minded perfectionism is easily recognized as a spiritual necessity. As crotchety and irritating as the aging Spaniard is, every step of the way in this novel, Montherlant weaves in hints of Celestino's humanity. Yes, this is a novel about weakness and strength--about all of us--as Celestino realizes he is dying and must say goodbye to everything that he has ever loved: life itself.There are some great lines: Celestino: \\"Newspapers are more important than machine-guns provided there is no freedom of the Press,\\" and \\"I can't write my book because I have too many ideas.\\" Ruiz, his fellow exile: \\"If you had a job, you wouldn't have time to have ideas. I work, which is why I have no more ideas than are strictly necessary.\\"For those of us unfortunate enough not to read the original French, we've got Terence Kilmartin's translation, which seems impossible to improve upon. I've never regretted not reading Don Quixote--until now, since old Celestino is a bit quixotic himself."},{"Title":"Chaos and night,: A novel","review":"I don't know how this book ended up on my reading list, but there it was and the text was short, so I thought I'd take the plunge. And I'm glad I did. Besides being an engaging character study (the entire time you are reading this you are wondering whether this guy was truly a revolutionary or someone who is merely manufacturing his past), the ending was simply ... well ... magnificently executed. Read it."},{"Title":"Chaos and night,: A novel","review":"Some years ago I read Montherlants' THE GIRLS.I remember thinking, it's good but not especially compelling . It proved to be a book that didn't stick with me. I decided to read CHAOS and NIGHT largely because the Spanish Civil War interests me and I was curious to see what kind of spin an old reactionary like Montherlant would give it.The book centers around Celestino, a Loyalist veteran and refugee who lives in France.Now there was a time when such people were deemed heroes by the Left and I assume this was so in France. When the book came out in 1960 French literary culture was a left wing province and you'd expect a portrait of a Spanish Republican veteran to be downright reverential. But then you wouldn't be reading a book by Montherlant.I wondered what he'd do to such character. It's not a pretty sight! While Montherlant was fascinated by Spain, he clearly wasn't bowled over by the mythos of the Loyalists.Celestino is a bourgeois pseudo - anarchist and if you are one of those who has trouble reading a book with unlikeable characters, avoid this like the plague .I'm not bothered by unlikeable characters. However I did find Celestino grating.He is not merely unlikeable , he is a complete jerk.Shallow, not particularly well informed or well educated, utterly tone deaf to cultural matters and grossly insensitive ,Celestino imagines he is a deep thinker .He spends his days writing articles that can't get published and that no one wants to read.A talentless bore like Celestino does well to be very nice , instead he goes out of his way to alienate everyone he knows. Worse yet, in doing so he imagines that he is exuding nobility.Periodically he reflects on his civil war past, and Montherlant drops a number of hints to the effect that Celestino was a vicious political killer during the war.Unsurprisingly these reflections don't perturb Celestino.There is a profoundity to the portrait Montherlant gives us.Celestino is exactly the kind of person who becomes a political executioner.Crackpot ideas and abstractions have always been more real for him than the concrete.He tries to ignore the material world in favor of dwelling in an abstract world where he knows the truth and if he has to kill to attain it , so be it.There is a grim humor to this.That is, Celestino is so intellectually muddled he has no idea what his great truth is.He admits he doesn't understand Marxism .He realizes he's not really an anarchist.He actually hates the people he is so dedicated to delivering to the promised land.What he likes , and he is conscious of this , is destroying things."},{"Title":"Neptune: The planet, rings and satellites (Springer Praxis Books / Space Exploration)","review":"Neptune is the eighth planet in the solar system, the last gas giant and the last planet of any real size. Due to its great distance from the sun, everything that we knew about this planet, until Voyager 2 visited it in 1989, was determined by telescopic observation. In this book, the authors, who both worked on the Voyager science team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, summarize the discoveries made by the spacecraft, the spacecraft's design and the discoveries made by telescopic observations. As with all the books published in the Springer-Praxis, Astronomy and Space Sciences series, there are numerous high quality photographs, line drawings and graphs in this book. Other than a few children's books, I believe that this is the only text, which covers Neptune in any detail.The first quarter of the books examines the pre-Voyager findings from Galileo's possible sighting, to its modern discovery that was determined by mathematical methods and its possible origins. The next portion of the book, which is also approximately one quarter of the book, covers the development of the Voyager probes and their subsequent discoveries at Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus (Voyager 2 only). The remainder of the book focuses on the Voyager 2 encounter with Neptune in 1989 from the long-range pre-encounter observations to the post encounters studies. In this large section of the book there are discussions on everything from, rings and satellite discoveries, radio science, the moons, the moon Triton and its atmosphere, cloud structure and much more.A few final thoughts. First, if you don't have a great summary the Voyager mission, this book definitely provides it. Secondly, even though I have a technical background, I found some sections, especially the chapter of the magnetic fields a bit too technical. With that said, this book is definitive text about the planet Neptune."},{"Title":"Neptune: The planet, rings and satellites (Springer Praxis Books / Space Exploration)","review":"Neptune, the 8th planet in our Solar System. I won't say there are little books write on a single planet, however, books which write simply on Neptune, you can count. Apart from the technical masterpiece \\"Neptune and Triton\\" published by Arizona University Press, this Praxis publication is the best book on Neptune ever had.I remembered when this book was first published, I bought it immediately. Firstly, it is because this is one in the excellent Springer-Praxis book series, I always love the books published by Praxis. Secondly, \\"Neptune\\" is a special book, in early years; Miner also published a very good book \\"Uranus\\" for Praxis. Therefore, I didn't think buy bought a copy of \\"Neptune\\".When I not yet started my reading, and found that only the second half of book talk about Neptunian atmosphere, interior, ring etc, but used the first half to talk about the Voyagers and the pre-Neptune discoveries, I thought that that it was traveling out of scope.However, when I started my reading, it is not the case.Miner was one of scientists in-charging the Voyager mission to Neptune, his personally experience cannot be replaced by others. His writings are to point, no dummy words, everything he wrote are related to the Neptune findings. Even for those he mentioned for the Voyager findings on Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, are all concise and it's important for the story of Neptune discoveries. It is totally different from my first impression.More, Miner described the history of Neptune, the telescopic understanding of Neptune before Voyager; the story of Voyager, its beginning, preparation for the Neptune encounter, the detail sequence of events during the encounter as well as the in-depth Neptune sciences. From his firsthand experience, you can see how NASA's daily operation, and the details of Voyager mission, these are already worthwhile for the book.The only weakness of this book is the coverage of Triton is too little. Since Triton is a very important moon in the solar system, persaonlly I think there should be a whole chapter dedicated for Triton.This book is a great reading for those who love space exploration and the Solar System. This book is not too difficult nor too easy, so I suggest this book to those who have basic knowledge of the Solar System and planetary exploration.I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Neptune: The planet, rings and satellites (Springer Praxis Books / Space Exploration)","review":"It is a technical term \\"non-expert audience.\\" The editorial description of this book says that such is its target audience. A non-expert audience means that the intended reader does not have much -- perhaps next-to-no knowledge of the subject matter; HOWEVER, that same intended reader is used to going into depth and has similar or at least somewhat close level of expertise in some totally different area to what the author possesses about his/her subject. In short, one could say a \\"non-expert audience\\" reader is one who is very well educated, not afraid of depth and details, can concentrate well, but just so happens to know nothing of the subject matter he/she is about to read. Scientific American articles of the 70's and 80's are superb examples of writing to the \\"non-expert audience\\".That being said, are you one who likes or hates concentrated reading? That can have a bearing on whether you should get this book.However, if you are searching for a big compendium of facts -- in tables in many cases, this book would serve that one purpose admirably.Do you want to know details of how Voyager accomplished what it did? Be careful what you wish for: this book has much on that topic. (But so does Burgess' book on Neptune.)The book has much about Voyager's experiences and results at Jupiter. A very nice bonus. Jupiter is not at all covered skimpily. In fact, the book's title is nearly inaccurate as perhaps 40% of the book is about Jupiter and it's moons.For the scientific methodology / teamwork interested person there is plenty of that. What I found intriguing was how they discovered that a cause of blur in Neptune pictures was the starting and stopping of the digital tape recorder reels (needed due to low bit-rate required of the faint [how faint: seeing a penlight flashlight on Earth while standing on the moon!] signal from as far away as Neptune). The tape recorder reel starting and braking would torque the Voyager spacecraft! (A command was sent to fire thruster a few milliseconds every time recorder would start or stop.)If all you want is pictures, there are good ones, but better you get Burgess' book -- or Seymour Simon's children series -- or Asimov's series if all you want are pictures.For this book, you have to enjoy either lots of details -- content details and/or methodology details -- or having tabulations of facts (such as for all the Jupiter and Neptune moons). If neither of these appeals to you but you want more than a childrens book, get the Burgess book \\"Far Encounter\\"."},{"Title":"Bettler und Gaukler, Dirnen und Henker: Randgruppen und Aussenseiter in Koln 1300-1600 (Aus der Kolner Stadtgeschichte) (German Edition)","review":"This book is an excellent scientific study about the situation of outsiders in a medieval city. The study is based on written sources available in Germany (mostly Cologne).Outsiders in a medieval study were not only beggars, lepers, sick persons, gypsies, artists, magicians, prostitutes or executioners, but also barbers and doctors.The author managed to follow the course of life of some of these outsiders (beggars and prostitutes) from their birth to the grave.He gives also excellent examples of discrimination.He clearly proves that some of the medieval taboos are still not eradicated today.A very interesting and important sociological study."},{"Title":"The American Century Dictionary","review":"This dictionary was a very nice find.

Laurence Urdang is a genius!"},{"Title":"The American Century Dictionary","review":"The price of this book, only $3.99, is the biggest selling point; you simply can't be that price. Size would have to be the second factor that makes this dictionary a best-buy.

For instance, at the time this dictionary was published the city of Chicago had only one area code: 312. Since that time the area code of 773 has been created and the book, of course, does not reflect this fact.Definitions are also limited. The word \\"aliteracy\\" is not present and neither is \\"syncretic\\" but it does contain the slang word \\"wasted\\".If you are looking for a purely functional dictionary, your funds are limited, and you want something easily transportable then this is the dictionary for you."},{"Title":"Veil of Illusion","review":"I respect to the utmost the freedom of choice of a writer to write whatever he/she wants, but in this case I do wish the editor/publisher had stepped in and attempted to dissuade Ms Ryman from publishing this story as it stands. And I wish I had been given some warning about the plot before I read this sequel to Olivia and Jai. Olivia and Jai itself is up there with Far Pavilions as an epic story of love set against the 19th century British Raj.However, with this sequel Ms Ryman decides to deviate from romance, to the point of, as another reviewer here has pointed out, \\"having the guts to kill off a major character\\". If you are looking for romance and a continuation of the HEA of Olivia and Jai, I do not recommend this sequel. All your illusions will be shattered. In this case I wish Ms Ryman had preserved \\"the veil of illusion\\" for us romantically minded readers.My four star rating is for the high level of historical writing, plotting and characterization that Ryman always exhibits. Along with an exploration of the Eurasian community in 19th British India, in reality the focus of this novel.This is one book which I feel is flawed as it stands as a romance but is brilliant historical fiction. However, I like happy endings in my historic fiction. If a major character could be resurrected, another secondary character's marriage to a native given a more romantic aspect and happier ending, and more attention and resolution given to the romances of Jai's children I would be ecstatic.For romance readers, I recommend Olivia and Jai as a stand alone and also Ryman's novel Shalimar. I recommend this sequel to lovers of historical fiction set in India who don't mind crying buckets. Great portrayal of North India from time of the Mutiny to 1870s."},{"Title":"Veil of Illusion","review":"This is the sequel to Jai and Olivia which was an excellent book.

Olivia mourns her beloved Jai and she has struggled over the years to prove his innocence. Their children Amos and Maya bear the burdens of mixed parentage and stigma of their father's alleged heinous activities. Maya meets and falls in love with a high born Englishman, Christian Pendlebury, much to the chagrin of his parents newly arrived from England. Also involved in Maya and Amos' life is the mysterious Eurasian Kyle Hawkesworth who prints a local paper and also has a very hidden agenda (and a BIG secret) in respects to Christian's father Lord Jasper.This is a story that is very difficult to put into words, and is very different from Olivia and Jai. There are no star crossed lovers that keep you turning the page well into the night waiting for the next surprise, the first half of the book is actually taken up with setting up the story and providing the flash backs into what happened prior to the Mutiny.What this book is about is the plight of the Eurasians in colonial India, whether they are poor and base born or independently wealthy as the Raventhorne's are. Not accepted by either the British community or the Indians, theirs is a life lived in constant shadow and insecurity. The author uses several interesting methods with her characters to keep this theme at the forefront of her story, from Olivia's support of a home for women, to Amos and Kyle's interest in setting up a school for the lesser born Eurasian children, Christopher's idealistic dreams of what he can accomplish during his public service in India, and the most heartbreaking of all when Maya is rejected by a member of an Indian family she's known since childhood.As stated earlier, this is not a romance with star crossed lovers and a HEA ending for all, and if that's what you are expecting I recommend you stop and just savor the ending from Olivia and Jai and keep that in your memories forever. However, if like me you need to read the rest of the story and enjoy a novel heavy on the history and setting of 19C India and the British Raj along with an eye opening look at the prejudices of the time against the Eurasian population it's well worth your time searching this one out. Ryman was born and raised in India and her knowledge and love of the culture shine through making for a well written and well rounded journey to another place and time, and isn't that what historical fiction is all about? Four stars."},{"Title":"Veil of Illusion","review":"A majority of the important action is related in flashback style or one character telling another what happened. Rather annoying. Olivia is so caught up in her own troubles, she basically is ignorant of what's going on in her childrens' lives, which turns me against her character. Amos is just there. He doesn't play much of a part in the book. This is Maya's story, and she's not much of a heroine to root for. Plot twists were obvious and seen coming a mile away. I'll give credit, though, to Ryman having the guts to kill a major character."},{"Title":"Veil of Illusion","review":"Written with the same evocative richness as Olivia and Jai, this sequel does not disappoint. Presents an interesting alternative scenario within the much literated Indian Sepoy Mutiny of 1857, and the continuing saga of a family living in a social no-man's-land. Ryman has a clear, arresting style and an absorbing story. I'd read a grocery list if this woman wrote it, but hope instead to see another installment of the Raventhorne chronicles soon."},{"Title":"Veil of Illusion","review":"After the grand passion and depth to the characterisation in &quot;Olivia and Jai&quot; the tale of the next generation seems dull. The plot moved slower,and it was difficult to care very much about such milch-toast characters. It was a terrible disapointment to see Olivia reduced to a soppy dishrag regreting the past and wringing her hands. Where did all her grit go? Rebecca, you can do better!"},{"Title":"Veil of Illusion","review":"This book is just as good as Olivia and Jai. I loved every minute of it and I did not want it to end. I hope there will be another book about the Raventhornes soon."},{"Title":"Veil of Illusion","review":"No true romance, but desasters and hate dominate this story. But we fall in love with the children: Amos and Maya, as well as with Alistair...What happend to Maya and Kyle?"},{"Title":"Buy-to-Let Bible","review":"I must admit this is an excellent book and especially so for the amateur like myself who wants to understand the whole process of buying a property. One thing I love about this book is how Ajay has explained the whole process of buying a property from start to finish!This is an invaluable tool for someone who either wants to buy their first property or expand their portfolio. Ajay explains the whole process in a clear and concise manner making it easy to follow and giving you excellent advise on how best to approach and reap the best value from your property.Ajay talks from experience as he himself has followed these strategies and has been very successful with them. I have been interested in buy to let for sometime now and have to admit that after browsing through various books on this subject, the buy to let bible has to be the best by far on this subject! You will not find another quality book like this which explains the whole process of buying a property from start to finish.Ajay has also provided a reference section at the back of the book and this gives contact details of various lenders and advises on property hotspots along with loads of other useful information.A truly valuable book and a must have for all property enthusiasts."},{"Title":"The reproach of Islam: Together with a supplementary chapter on the work of the S.P.G","review":"Second ed., revised, 1909, London, Student Volunteer Missionary Union. (There are other editions printed by various missionary churches.) There are two nice multi-colored maps: \\"The Near East\\" and the fold-out \\"The Mohammedan World\\". The author relies heavily upon other Islamic writers: Sir William Muir, Prof. Margoliuthis, T.W. Arnold, Dr. S. Zwemer, & Rev. Canon Dale. The author noted: \\"this book cannot claim to be the result of any great originality of research\\"; sadly, but true. The chapters are titled: The Extent of Islam, Whence Came It?, How Came It?, What is It?, How Works It?, How Save It?--The Past, How Save It?-The Present, How Save It?-The Future, Chronological Table, Appendices, Bibliography\\". There are 40 nice, small photographs. This is a very pro-Christian view of the subject matter: Christianity is good, Islam is bad. The author's writing style is rather stilted, sort of an English boarding-school headmaster's talk. Wordy, no depth. Wanders around too much: in one paragraph the author is talking about Abu Bakr, then the next he is in Morocco, the third paragraph he is talking about Muslims in China, and by the fourth paragraph he brings in Greece and ancient Rome. Just short historical snippets; the reader is left trying to figure out how they all fit together. Of use only to those studying how various Christian missionary sects infiltrated Arabia during the late 1890s; such as noted by the Bibliography's sub-chapter titled: \\"Missionary Problems and Methods\\" that lists 16 such books, on p.357"},{"Title":"The reproach of Islam: Together with a supplementary chapter on the work of the S.P.G","review":"This book is issued jointly by a number of the Missionary Societies in Great Britain for the use of Missionary Study Circles. The author has tried to take a balanced view and looks at: 1-The Extent of Islam; 2-Whence it Came; 3-How Came It;4-What it is; 5-How it Works; 6-How Save it - past, present and future. There is also a chronological table and bibliography. The book contains a large number of black and white photographic illustrations and a map of the Mohammedan world at the end of the book. Published in 1909, first edition. In green boards with white titling the book measures approx. 7 1/2\\" x 5\\" with 367 pages."},{"Title":"La memoria del ojo: Cien a%7Enos de presencia japonesa en el Peru (Spanish Edition)","review":"This is an incredibly beautiful photographic essay that chronicles one hundred years of Japanese in Peru. It begins with the voyages, farm labor, and communities to move on to established businesses, WWII destruction and relocation, recuperation, and contemporary images.

I came back to this book several times during the treatment phase."},{"Title":"Mahogany Row","review":"Despite television and film representations of lawyers' lives as thrilling ones filled with intense cross-examinations, surprise confessions on the stand, and interoffice romances, the young associate's life in a law firm is filled with tedious research, endless motions to write, and often an obsession with partnership. For Mark McCoy, the narrator of MAHOGANY ROW, the past eight years have been more like the reality than the cinematic version. He now faces the partners' decision that will determine whether he joins the ranks on Mahogany Row, the luxurious wing that houses the partners' offices, or find himself out of a job with nary a thank-you for his tenure at Ashley, Stepford & Simpson. As it turns out, partnership becomes a vague afterthought when the Simpson of the firm's name turns up dead in McCoy's office with McCoy's blood on him and an incriminating letter on the desk.What follows is an adrenaline-filled, don't-stop-for-breath race through the streets, buildings, and boroughs of New York City. Dogged by a police detective with more than a passing resemblance to Peter Falk'sColumbo, McCoy seeks to unveil the clues that will exonerate him and save him from the forces that seem bent on killing anyone who might help him.Though nominally a \\"legal thriller,\\" as The Fiction Works identifies the book, MAHOGANY ROW owes more to the noir tradition of detective fiction. There are no courtroom confrontations, but author Wayne J. Keeley does demonstrate his knowledge of the law. In many ways, this eschewing of the typical legal-thriller setting adds to the novel's feel. McCoy does not deliver a dramatic and moving peroration to a jury but instead finds clues in the bowels of the firm's files. He does not extract a dying declaration or offer a brilliant and timely hearsay objection - and of course he cannot since dodging both the people out to kill him and the detective determined to arrest him while trying to solve the mystery fills his time very nicely. And therein lies the core of this book.MAHOGANY ROW's cast of characters is bleak in the noir tradition. Truth and justice seem to matter little to people hiding their dark secrets, pursuing their own agendas, or merely doing their jobs, and McCoy, whose future depends on the truth, must ferret out the truth. The noir elements are enjoyable, but they are not fully executed. The characters are not fully realized and tend to rely on archetypes - the savvy stripper and the unwavering detective, for example. Moreover, McCoy's survival seems unlikely given what he goes through. Keeley's writing also seems strained at times, as, for example, when he refers to Simpson as a \\"corpse a la mode.\\"At the same time, though, MAHOGANY ROW boasts an accomplished mystery. Keeley may not provide all the clues in the scrupulous manner of John Dickson Carr, but he comes darn close. Certainly, enough clues are there so that a determined reader can make a reasonable guess at the identity of Simpson's killer. Keeley seems to have taken great care to put the clues fairly before the reader, and he does so so adeptly that the reader who has finished the book may be surprised at just how early the first clue appears. For readers who cherish the puzzles and author-versus-reader duel of mysteries, MAHOGANY ROW delivers solidly so that the pieces all fit together when the final revelation occurs without any sense that the ending is contrived.One final point bears mention. The Fiction Works is a small publisher, and the editing of the book is unfortunately lax. The third line, for example, misspells the first victim's name as \\"Johnathan.\\" (The man is later identified as \\"Jonathan.\\") It would be egregiously unfair to say that MAHOGANY ROW is filled with typographical errors, but I did find enough that I found myself being taken out of the story a few times.MAHOGANY ROW is a fast read, and the combination of the nearly nonstop action and Keeley's generally brisk writing is sufficient to make the ride an enjoyable one and allow the reader to suspend just enough disbelief to turn the next page - and the one after it. While not great literature by a long shot, MAHOGANY ROW is certainly fun to read and an exceedingly well constructed mystery."},{"Title":"Mahogany Row","review":"Mahogany Row is a fairly decent book considering it comes from a small press and is apparently a first novel. The editors, however, could have done a more careful job of proofreading. You will find missing words and punctuation marks, as well as reversed, superfluous, and missing quotation marks. This mystery/suspense novel was penned by yet another attorney/writer. It is more or less written in the style of the hard-boiled detective genre, though the protagonist is the primary murder suspect, not the investigator. It has the hard-boiled genre's fast-paced nature, with short sentences, lots of action, the less-than-sophisticated hero, and occasional comic irony. It even has the requisite strange metaphors such as: \\"His office was Nagasaki after the bomb.\\" The author plays at profundity with an enigmatic homeless character but unfortunately never realizes it. The book is suspenseful and the mystery is fairly well-crafted and certainly interesting; the author keeps you reading. The ending is somewhat of a disappointment, however. The writer seems to have desired a twist, but because it is not as well developed as the central corporate mystery, it is a bit of a let down. The Epilogue is far too violent, sexually explicit, and, like a great many Epilogues, entirely unnecessary. It would have been better to have simply ended the book with the final chapter. Overall, Mahogany Row is an easy, interesting afternoon read."},{"Title":"Mahogany Row","review":"When Mark McCoy discovers his boss' body in his office, sitting in Mark's captains chair, naked, with his throat cut from ear-to-ear, he knew it wasn't going to be a good Monday. Actually, his entire week didn't look very promising.Since the killing took place in Mark's office, and he couldn't prove his alibi, he fell under the close scrutiny of one gruff Detective McGuire. Not only did that tend to bug Mark, but the irritation became worse when he discovered his life was being endangered by a wild driver in a large sedan who always seemed to be wherever Mark was. The driver obviously was very intent on running over him.As the inverstigation progresses it becomes evident that Mark has been set up to take the blame for the murder. Eventually an APB is issued on him, and he has to go into hiding. He is able to enlist the aide of Sherry Rainey, a typist in the typing pool in the legal firm where Mark is a lawyer. Sherry can get into records that Mark can no longer access. Fortunately for Mark, Sherry has decided to stand by him through his tribulations. In their efforts to clear Mark they uncover malpractice, fraud, prostitution, and more murders.Mr. Keeley has written a fast paced, action packed legal thriller. He explains the legal terminology so clearly that even this reviewer understood them. It is very easy to follow Mark through New York with such defined directions. The characters are so vividly word-painted that they virtually walk off the page.One very interesting book that should not be missed."},{"Title":"Mahogany Row","review":"Wayne J.

Mahogany Row opens strongly and gets even stronger as more and more details are revealed in this neo-noir crime thriller.

Even the most unempathic of readers will sympathize with the protagonist in what turns out to be an empire-shattering plot.Filled with vivid characters that materialize themselves for you as you read, you can't help but feel as though you are the one being probed and pushed beyond your limits; having been made the fall-guy for an organization that you gave your life to.

Author/Attorney Wayne J. Keeley creates an environment of peril in New York City for his lawyer protagonist Mark McCoy. In some ways, this book is more related to The Fugitive than a legal drama, you'll want to keep the pages turning. Throw in a dash of kinky sex, a curious romance and an omnipresent cop and you have the ingredients for a good, seasonal read.I had fun with this book and I think most mystery lovers will, too.

What troubles me is that despite the quality of this book, somehow I felt that the author is actually a very intelligent person.

Instead of an alcoholic private eye, our protaganist is a lawyer. Now this isn't just any smarmy yuppie scum lawyer. . . no siree. . . ., this is Mark McCoy a street-smart, raised in Alphabet City, New York City lawyer who's being set up to take the fall for the murder of his boss. It's time to stop playing the game and start playing hard-ball. After he narrowly escapes arrest, McCoy busily tracks down leads as he avoids hired assasins, stays barely one step ahead of persistant cops and keeps getting himself in so many jams he ought to go by the name of Smuckers. There's a few sprinkles of authentic sounding inside information to be found (about how law firms work)--which is probably because author Wayne Keeley actually is a lawyer (entertainment lawyer) in real life. It's a short book that began life as an e-book, is being considered for a film, and will be pushed with a sizeable marketing budget in the very near future. If you're looking for a fun, quick, pulpy read, this will not disappoint you. Christopher J.

If you're looking for a quick and highly entertaining suspense novel, you can't go wrong with this lean and gritty read. While the characters seem to lack depth overall, and many of the relationships are sketchy at best, the novel moves at such break-neck speed, you barely have time to notice. If you're looking for deep character studies and thought-provoking prose--you'll be disappointed.

From this point a series of dangerous coincidences alert Mark that somebody wants him dead.How could this be? Why is Mark being framed for Simpson's death? More importantly, what does Mark know that could have him killed? Follow this young attorney as he seeks the answers to his questions.Wayne Keeley's first novel starts fast and doesn't stop until the stunning conclusion.However, this rapid pace has its drawbacks. There is minimal time for character development. Furthermore, the players are forced to keep up with the plot. There is no time to reflect because the characters must hurry across town for the next scene.Several typographical errors are present in the non-draft copy I possess, but they provide minimal distraction.Nevertheless, Keeley's first venture into the world of legal thrillers is a valiant effort.

Repackaged and spewed forth by the publishers to make another buck?

CHECK IT OUT FIRST BECAUSE YOU ARE REALLY IN FOR SOMETHING IF YOU DON'T AND IT WON'T BE GOOD."},{"Title":"Social security number verification","review":"I remember seeing Katie Brown on TV and being fairly unimpressed; chancing on this book at a library, I borrowed it and was still unimpressed.All too often she seems to be trying too hard to be whimsical and cutesy-poo, with diminishing results. And there are ideas that are decent enough on their own, but combined with all the other ideas for her different styles, just ends up being cloying.Some are weird...like curtain rods made from push brooms and mops, or a lighting fixture made from rakes. A lighting fixture made from a wok actually doesn't look too bad, and some lights made from socks (!) aren't too bad either.Others, though, look good at a glance, but on closer examination don't work too well. A faux-quilt made of plaid wool scarves crisscrossed on a bed and pinned together looks authentic enough when just flipping through pages, but on a closer look just looks chintzy. A kid's room lighting fixture looks fun until you realize it uses flashlights and might not light very well (or possibly need continual batteries).And some are just plain weird and/or impractical. A coffee table covered with contact paper is OK enough, but another covered with sandpaper?!? Another, given a pebbles-and-grout top, actually looks kinda cool but might not be a good surface for a wineglass. But the idea of decorating a living room with actual tree branches strikes me as colossally bad (unless for a single evening); I can envision all sorts of cleaning horror stories as twigs and bits of bark, or possibly even bugs, start to litter the floor. (And heaven forbid they end up being a fire hazard...)There are some decent ideas with fabrics, including some very nice workable pillow concepts. The book isn't entirely useless; I would recommend using an idea here and there. But overall the styles are cloying and unlivable, with too much emphasis placed on whimsy and looks-good-at-a-glance and not enough on permanence, practicality, ease of care, and a workable graciousness. Try harder next time, Katie."},{"Title":"Social security number verification","review":"I'd seen magazine articles that featured Katie Brown's own homes, which are designed with a creative mix of antiques and modern pieces and somehow manage to look both edgy and cozy. But, this book was really disappointing. Full of ideas that are overly trendy and that I would quickly tire of, if I even liked any of them enough to attempt them. Somehow her personal style is not translating well to her books. Is her publisher encouraging her to aim for a less sophisticated look?"},{"Title":"Social security number verification","review":"As a huge Katie Brown fan, I was disappointed with this book. As a truly eclectic decorator, I am open to any possible source for design...scrap yard, junk yard, garden, etc. But, come on, a coffee table with a base made of coiled up garden hoses? A hard-cast clay sandcastle? Not to be totally negative, a few crafts, and that's what this book majors in, are cool. The corseted pillow, for instance, or the bright lights, big city illuminated table. This book is a good choice for newlyweds or students, first-time apartment dwellers on tight budgets. And for truly hip urban cats, I would recommend Pad: The Guide to Ultra Living. If we could give half marks, I would give this book two and a half stars for effort.

This book was great! Husni gives a different instruction in every other chapter. Chapters in between instructions are for interviews. He interviewed people who have already gone through the launch process. This was both informative and inspiring. I've read &quot;The Magazine Publishing Industry&quot;, and it wasn't as informative for someone interested in launching a magazine. Husni's nickname is &quot;Mr. Magazine&quot;,and with this excellent book, I would say he has earned it."},{"Title":"Launch Your Own Magazine: A Guide for Succeeding","review":"Although we are familiar with book publishing, we needed information regarding our upcoming magazine startup. I reviewed six books on the subject.The only one not returned was, &quot;Launch Your Own Magazine.&quot;I was looking for the nuts and bolts philosophy of this industry not back-patting and fluff. This magazine provided solid and useable information.The interviews, room for notes and easy writing style of Dr Husni made my research pleasant and interesting. His checklist at the end of the book was the cherry on a very tasty book.Bravo for placing information sharing above self."},{"Title":"Launch Your Own Magazine: A Guide for Succeeding","review":"As someone planning to start a magazine, I found that this is one of the better magazine start-up books out there, and it is doubly informative considering Mr.Husni is the leading expert in the field of magazines. He brings to the book a sense of being heavily involved in the industry.However, the book was excellently detailed in some areas while being skimpy in others.He provides great detail about the research process, evaluating competition, developing a plan, and designing the magazine layouts etc.Each chapter hits on one of these above topics(and more) individually in about 12 chapters. At the end of each chapter is a magazine profile: a tale from the trenches interview with a start-up magazine founder about how they started the mag and the problems they had to face. This is interesting as it provides some details about the process from a newcomer point of view.This is where the payload of information ends though. While Mr.Magazine gives us information about the theory part of the magazine development process, he doesn't give much info about the business side of things. Things like how to find and evaluate printers, how to drum up investors, what associations/organizations to network with, what media outlets to contact, etc.In other words, he's big on research and development, but not real world business. It was only when I looked at his bio did I realize he's a professor, which explains his semi-dissociation from the nitty-gritty business world.The only other complaint I have about the book is the magazine interviews. Don't get me wrong, they are very inspiring and I've even been tempted to subscribe to a few to understand the inner workings of success. However, after a few of these interviews they all start sounding similar...there are about 12 interviews and Mr.Husni seems to ask the same questions to all of them.To sum it up, this book has value in parts....just don't expect to be an expert by the end of it.P.S...Oh and a somewhat disturbing note about the magazines profiled: they're supposed to be the success stories of the ones that survived the 95% death rate. From the sound of the interviews they're the next big Atlantic Monthly, George, etc.However, in the process of researching these magazines (I was trying to see how big they grew since the time this book was published) I found that 3 out of the 5 mags I looked at became recently defunct. Now there's some inspiration for you people!!! Instant deflation aside, I'm going to go now and check the rest of the list to determine just how depressed I should be....and whether I should kill my magazine brainchild once and for all."},{"Title":"Launch Your Own Magazine: A Guide for Succeeding","review":"With respect to the other reviews, and to the author, I did not get much out of this book.

Since Samir discusses how the sale of Mother Earth News and its decay thereafter, the interview with Shuttleworth should be enormously helpful to the entrepreneur dreaming of publishing a magazine.Still, this book is one of three I will keep stocked on my reference shelf in the event that I launch a magazine.The book is an excellent companion to How To Start A Magazine by James Kobak and to Starting &amp; Running A Successful Newsletter or Magazine by Cheryl Woodard."},{"Title":"Launch Your Own Magazine: A Guide for Succeeding","review":"Devided half theory and half real stories it is perfect for starters in the magazine publishing business.

A friend recommended the book to me, knowing I would soon be traveling to Burma. I read it with that in mind, and soon found myself grateful for a book I would have delighted in under any circumstances. This Paduang tribal man has given us a generous look at his origins and early life, and then gone on to share his unusual journey into an entirely different world. He as is good at evoking internal conflicts as he is at painting exterior scenes. The book combines history, religion, cultures, current politics, and humanity. It is one of the most satisfying reads I have had in a very long time."},{"Title":"From the Land of Green Ghosts : A Burmese Odyssey","review":"I've read many books about Burma and travel to the country frequently.From the Land of Green Ghosts: A Burmese Odysseyis simply one of the best. Unlike a lot of memoirs, it is both poetic and passionate at the same time. Pascal Khoo Thwe, who struggled with English when he fled the country, has produced an English-langauge masterpiece. From his retelling of his role as a student activist in the prodemocracy protests of 1988 to the helping hand of a Cambridge professor, the book is filled with the mix of sadness and serendipity usually found only in fairy tales. After his escape from Burma, Pascal Khoo Thwe beautifully explains his dilemma as he is caught between the world of his village and trauma in Burma versus life in England. Pascal Khoo Thwe never recites a history of his country's problems, but rather blends them in seamlessly with his own life, providing a much more textured picture of the struggles people did (and still) face under the military dictatorship.From the Land of Green Ghosts: A Burmese Odysseywould make an excellent movie and I hope one day somebody makes one. In the meantime, definitely read the book if you have any interest in Burma, or just good literature."},{"Title":"From the Land of Green Ghosts : A Burmese Odyssey","review":"This personal account of Pascal Khoo Thwe's life works for me on many levels. I feel as if I understand what it is like to belong to a culture so different from my own. His writing was deeply moving and so descriptive that I do believe I can feel and experience how his culture lived.I wonder at the cruelty of human beings and I ponder this horror, especially in the aftermath of the disclosure of American torture of prisoners.I think about how the author struggled with the ability to make judgements during his time at Cambridge because of living his life under an authoritnarian regime. He had no experience of forming opinions and I understand now how Russians are having difficulty with a democratic constitution and are regressing to authoritariasm. So goes Iraq?I wonder at a jungle and climate and the paradise he describes.I think that the reader,myself was not up to the job when I skipped quite a bit of the jungle fighting toward the end.I would have liked to know more of how he was able to make friends at Cambridge which he only hinted at.Maybe another book?"},{"Title":"From the Land of Green Ghosts : A Burmese Odyssey","review":"This is a story about a man who wants to be free. He gave his reasons and I find it so stimulating to hear his life story. Elvis, the Gospel music, Jim Reeves, Janis Joplin and all that. It is such a good read. It is such an uplifting experience despite the pains and the sorrows. They are part of our lives. Don't you think?Jerry"},{"Title":"From the Land of Green Ghosts : A Burmese Odyssey","review":"Interesting story and easy to read but it is not clear how much of the narrative is autobiography and how much is fiction. The style is somewhat self-indulging and perhaps also a bit prosaic, even the description of the skirmishes between the burmese army and the dissidents/rebels, but perhaps reality is more mundane than fiction! (My mother was born less than a hundred miles from where the author was born)"},{"Title":"From the Land of Green Ghosts : A Burmese Odyssey","review":"Pascal Khoo Thwe opens this extraordinary book with the sentence: \\"When I was young I used to watch the rising sun with amazement.\\" Incredibly, Khoo Thwe sustains our amazement as he relates the corruption of Burma through his eyes while growing up in its remote mountains. His words are informative and caring, painting not with the brush of pity as he portrays his home village and his family in their humble lives, but with one of deference and honor.\\"From the Land of Green Ghosts\\" is more than an autobiography and more than a history: it is a testament to a young man's persistent search for truth and a place in life where he can just be happy. The author's prosaic language is suited well for the narrative, and a fine example of how well the author learned English in so short a time when his goals were achieved.It is also a sorrowful tale because the woes of the Burmese remain, the grip is still retained by the military junta. I highly recommend this book, as well as \\"The Stone of Heaven\\" by Adrian Levy and Cathy Scott-Clark."},{"Title":"From the Land of Green Ghosts : A Burmese Odyssey","review":"I liked this book immensely on several levels. As an anthropologist, I found it very interesting to get a Padaung's eye view, written in literate English, of his own background, his childhood in the remote, forested mountains of eastern Burma. The author tells of everything---from the strictures of Roman Catholic missionaries in far parts of Asia, to eating dogs, baby wasps, and snakes (with relish), his grandmother's stories, guardian spirits, a Padaung funeral. The Burmese political climate of the 1960s and \`70s merely lurks in the background until the author drops out of a seminary and heads to Mandalay to attend university. While information about various remote peoples is not uncommon, it is usually processed by foreign writers who have visited them. FLGG gives it to you from the horse's mouth.On a second level I admired Pascal Khoo Thwe because I'm an American, grandson of immigrants who left traditional villages in Russia for a new life, a freer life, in America. Odysseys like Khoo Thwe's form the essence of the American experience, but perhaps few are so dramatic---from university student, to jungle fighter to student at Cambridge University to published author. I can easily see the difficulties of becoming a new man (my family took the last name \\"Newman\\", but the real story is long) in a new country. I recalled Sir Albert Maori Kiki, a Papua New Guinean born into a Stone Age village, but who became a pathologist and high ranking Minister in his newly-independent country. I once had read his book, \\"Kiki: Ten Thousand Years in a Lifetime\\" and had been inspired by it.This leads me to admire the book on a third level. We who live in modern countries, whether East or West, tend to denigrate those who live in poorer, less fortunate nations often suffering under tyrannical regimes. We feel that they may not have the sensibilities that we pride ourselves on. FLGG is a book that will shatter any such belief. The human spirit flies into the heavens from every corner of the globe, in all epochs. We--as Man---are universally capable of the greatest transformations and adjustments, able to surmount suffering. Pascal Khoo Thwe's thoughts and feelings, as expressed in his book, are eloquent proof of this. From a brutal regime which suppressed all independent thought, from a jungle war with no mercy, emerged a thinking, feeling man. I felt proud to be a human being when I finished. I admit that his book even moved me to tears.A fourth reason why I liked FLGG is that it provides echoes of the same topic found in \\"Reading Lolita in Tehran\\" and \\"Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress\\"---the transformative power of literature and its ability to change human nature. As a student of English Literature, no matter how constricted, Khoo Thwe could respond to different ideas, imagine a different world. The theme is not the dominant one as it is in the above named works, but it is there. But now, Pascal Khoo Thwe, a Padaung, has produced a work to stand in company of the works of mankind. Read it."},{"Title":"From the Land of Green Ghosts : A Burmese Odyssey","review":"Culture and tradition, funny or deadly serious anecdote followed by a harrowing confrontation with Burma's brutal military regime characterize \\"From the Land of the Green Ghosts.\\" Yet the story is told so gracefully that one feels eased into a life and death struggle rather than abruptly confronted by it (as one might find with a Western writer.) The advantage is that the author, the gifted Pascal Khoo Thwe, can punctuate his narrative with a precise, violent detail. Heart-stopping scenes appear neither moral nor immoral, only horrifying, a postcard from one of the most repressed countries in the world.Thwe is unpretentious and perceptive. He has a gift for language few possess (indeed, English is not his first, second or even third language.) Still, the author fears that none of these assets exist in him. He is mistakenYet while it may sound like self-deception -- escaping jungle warfare to attend an elite college in order to \\"help\\" his people -- the book undoes this assumption. Admittedly, it is easier to write flowing prose in England as opposed to dodging mortars (or succumbing to malaria) along the Thai-Burmese border; but it is hard to imagine that any rebel fighter could have better informed the world about Burma's plight than is offered here by Pascal Khoo Thwe."},{"Title":"From the Land of Green Ghosts : A Burmese Odyssey","review":"This is a wonderful book and a very interesting read. It offers a both a detailed description of life growing up in a hill tribe in Burma and a broader look at the tragic consequences of years of totalitarian rule by the corrupt and failed government of Burma (now \\"officially\\" Myanmar). The author's journey to the border and subsequent escape from the country almost reads like a fiction novel. However, this true story is written with the respect and insight of a man well aware of the gravity of his country's plight. His book does the reader, and the people of his troubled country, a great service."},{"Title":"From the Land of Green Ghosts : A Burmese Odyssey","review":"I live in Thailand and have traveled to Burma (sometimes called &quot;Myanmar&quot;). I was prepared to like this book and I was expecting the heroic life story that I got. I was not, however, prepared for the beauty of the writing and the depth of the tragedy so simply, but touchingly, told. It is simply amazing to me that anyone can write so beautifully in a second language; Thwe is very talented. I hope that he keeps writing. I also hope that in his next book, he drops some of the reserve that characterizes his cultural upbringing and lets us into his inner life a little more."},{"Title":"From the Land of Green Ghosts : A Burmese Odyssey","review":"I don't post reviews, but this book was such a great one that I had to add my opinion.The author's very personal insights into the Burma's struggles are profound. His early memories growing up in a tribal Padaung culture present a fascinating look at how the Catholicisim taught by missionaries coexisted with tribal myths (a favorite quote, from his grandmother: &quot;The gods are like government officials. If you want things done quickly, you have to bribe the small ones.&quot;)As his education progressed, so too did the unbelievable repression of the various Burmese regimes of the day (1960s to 80s). His experience as a student freedom fighter are gripping, as is his remarkable account of how a chance meeting with a Cambridge professor led to his eventual escape to England.For me, this book did 3 things. First, it helped me glimpse the contemporary history of Burma (aka Myanmar), a nation that's always intrigued me, but a place of which I had very little knowledge. Second, it opened my eyes to some of the feelings and courage behind rebels and freedom fighters in oppressively-ruled nations, which allows me to read contemporary accounts of world events in a much richer context. Finally, it made me re-examine my own role in the world. While Pascal was fighting for his life as he made an unimaginable transition (to me anyway) from tribal to contemporary cultures, I was hawking software at trade shows or enjoying the tourist face of neighboring Thailand -- all with no idea of what was really happening in Burma. It was stunning that I could have been so ignorant to what was happening there at a time when I considered myself to be pretty aware of what was going on in the world.A fascinating and extremely well-written book."},{"Title":"From the Land of Green Ghosts : A Burmese Odyssey","review":"Burma (aka Myanmar) is a country of many, many different ethnic and tribal groups. While the majority (69%) are Burman, there are many others including Karen, Kachin, Shan, Mon, and the author's own Padaung tribe. (The Padaung are most famous in the West for their &quot;giraffe women&quot; who wear golden rings about their necks that elongate their profile to freakish dimensions.)Pascal Khoo Thwee's book is a narrative of his life as an ambitious young Padaung man trying to negotiate his way through the brutal, murderous, politically-dysfunctional culture that is modern-day Burma. It is an incredible story, cinematic in its dimensions and bizarre, fortuitous coincidences. Thwe gives voice to the Burma that nobody knows, i.e., life as experienced by one of its minority tribal groups.Thwe's descriptions of his life among the Padaung are extraordinarly rich, with all the subtle nuances that only an insider could provide. His account of his flight from a hideous regime and life among the anti-government insurgents in the jungle is equally riveting. Eventually, he escapes to the rarified academic milieu of Cambridge University. It is a great story (and would make a fine movie.)Unfortunately, it is in the account of his political awakening/transformation (the bridge between the two stories above) that the book falls flat. This was the most momentous and revolutionary period in the history of modern day Burma. It was when Aung San Suu Kyi came to world prominence and Burma looked like it had a hope of abandoning its decades long isolation and rejoing the modern (democratic?) world. One would expect that Thwe's narrative would sing at this point. Yet, it seems curiously detached -- almost mailed-in. It seems, in fact, to be reconstructed in significant measure from secondary sources. Only the death of his lover/girlfriend at the hand of the government has any resonance in accounting for his ultimate apostasy from General Ne Win's abominable political ideology.I acknowledge that this may be unfair to Thwe in that I am thinking like a Westerner. He is candid in talking about his difficulties in coming to terms with concepts such as &quot;human rights&quot;, &quot;democracy&quot;, and &quot;freedom of thought.&quot; Still, I feel that his account of the pressures that pushed him toward exile is woefully underdeveloped.On the whole, this is a fine book. I learned much about minority cultures in Burma that I probably would not learn anywhere else. But. . .if you want to understand the revolutionary events that led to the great Burmese uprising of 1988 I would suggest that you look elsewhere."},{"Title":"From the Land of Green Ghosts : A Burmese Odyssey","review":"Pascal, alias Khun Sa, has created an interesting autobiography of his life as a Padaung tribesman from the Shan States of Burma, who is picked up by a Cambridge don visiting Mandalay, where he is a student working in a restaurant. He later finds his way to England and Cambridge after his stint as an rebel insurgent - through the kindness and intervention of his British friend and the British embassy in Thailand.He writes well in English when you consider that most of his youth was spent in Shan States of Burma where English was not his language. However, one can feel the strong hand of his English and religion instructors or perhaps his editor in the content of much of the book. His mentor, Dr. John Casey, admits in the foreword that he was \`at first diffident' when asked to revise and cut the manuscript for publication, yet his input can be felt strongly in the final version. Pascal points out in one of the final chapters that Dr. Casey indulged in nostalgia for the imperial past of Burma. This prejudice comes through clearly when Pascal writes of becoming an insurgent to fight against the Burmese government which had replaced the \`golden age' of the \`old British Raj'. Burma/Myanmar has been involved in a civil war ever since the British completed their occupation of the country and several rebel groups would like to have the country return to the British colonial era or become Communist. This feeling comes through as Pascal consistently characterizes the government soldiers of Burma as the 'enemy'. His strong anti-government bias even comes through against the government of Thailand, which had protected him and his fellow insurgents in refugee camps there.Pascal's Grandmother is hauled out to amplify the anti-government screed and tell us what a paradise Burma was during the age of the rule by the British. She says: \\"We were prosperous under the British, but when they went, they took the prosperity with them.\\" She fails to point out that the British were replaced by the Japanese, who after a lot of killing were replaced by Nationalists looking for independence.We learn early on that Pascal's family introduced him to the Christian God and the Catholic Church. From that point on his writing is peppered with Christian religious euphemisms and often his religion causes him to rebel against the culture of his tribe. You can almost spot when Pascal is writing in the voice of his religious teachers; he uses words like \`ululation' \\"assiduous to novenas' \`impeccably' or he pokes fun at his own culture and animist religion. When speaking in the voice of his Cambridge dons, he misses no opportunity to demonize the \`regime' in Burma.When Pascal writes in his own voice he can be quite down-to-earth and when he writes of his time as a young rebel soldier, shooting and being shot at, he is quite believable. As a poetic lament the book seems to be coming from Pascal, but as a political statement it seems more to originate from his handlers.No good anti-Burmese government book would be complete without a mention of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, the wife of the late Michael Aris of Oxford. Pascal mentions her several times.\\"from the land of the green ghosts' is a fine book, if read with a good knowledge of the history of Burma. May I recommend readingThe River of Lost Footsteps: A Personal History of Burmaas a preliminary to this work."},{"Title":"From the Land of Green Ghosts : A Burmese Odyssey","review":"Extraordinary memoir by a gifted writer with an extremely unusual story to tell."},{"Title":"From the Land of Green Ghosts : A Burmese Odyssey","review":"Pascal Khoo Thwe has written a clear and sensitive story of how it feels to come from a rural small town in Burma and, overcoming initial loneliness and feelings of inferiority, go on to excell in scholarship. Growing up in a Karenni village, he masters Burmese and English, survives having a price put on his head, escapes to freedom through the jungle and overcomes tremendous obstacles to finally study successfully at Cambridge.I have lived in both Burma and Thailand, worked among the Karen and Shan people, but the author adds dimensions that I had only dimly been aware of.His accounts travel in rural Asia, the taunts of enemy soldiers in battle, the terror of flight through unknown territory, and many other vignettes make the reader feel like he is there.Khoo Thwe is a natural-born story teller. I hope he writes more."},{"Title":"From the Land of Green Ghosts : A Burmese Odyssey","review":"&#34;The author starts with his life in a tribal village of Burma and gives us a complete look as a happy child views it. We learn about the long-necked Padaung women and how the families survive in the jungle. The move to a monastery for education is his first time away from his beloved village and family. Deciding to change course and attend university in Mandalay shows his adaptability. Hardships sound unimaginable but he manages to maintain his desire for a life that may not be possible given the dire problems in the country run by oppression. Hunger. loss of his beloved friends and well-founded fear of the regime are no match for his desire to make things better. Returning to his village, he soon understands it's an unsafe haven. Against his Father's advice he leaves to fight. What happens next is the story more of novels. It is so beautifully written you'll be marking your book in order to re-read the eloquent passages. A mix of ancient cultures, hence the &#34;green ghosts&#34; in the title, pervades the book so well that the reader believes too. Remarkable is hardly enough praise.&#34;"},{"Title":"From the Land of Green Ghosts : A Burmese Odyssey","review":"If you love Burma and its numerous peoples, you would love Pascal Khoo Thwe's book. You might be fascinated to \\"see\\" rural Burma through the eyes of a young student - non Bamar but Padaung who are small minority in this overwhelmingly split country. the story takes place mainly, but not exclusively, during the years and months before and after the great uprisings of the year 1988.I must say I was exposed to the Burmese people plight after watching, earlier this year, a movie called \\"The Lady\\" which describes the story of Burmese pro-democracy leader, now MP, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi (by the way, I cannot help but recommending you to read her essays at \\"freedom from fear\\").Back to \\"From the Land of Green Ghosts\\", this work has a very different and unique voice. Because unlike justly admired Suu Kyi, here you get a chance to hear the voice of an \\"ordinary\\", intelligent and ambitious student, and also the voice of non-Bamar Burmese (who are the majority in Burma) and I found it highly refreshing.It should not considered to be a spoiler. Pascal happened, quite miraculously, to come upon both Suu Kyi's late husband Dr. Michal Aris and her son Alexander who I think live now in the United States."},{"Title":"From the Land of Green Ghosts : A Burmese Odyssey","review":"In a lifetime of reading, this memoir stands out as both strikingly unique and universal in its appeal. Pascal Khoo Thwe is the only Burmese hill tribesman to graduate from Cambridge, and the events and \\"coincidences\\" that drove his life defy belief.The book starts slowly, seeming to crawl, but the author takes such great pains to portray the world of his upbringing&#8212;where commerce between material and spiritual realms was taken for granted&#8212;that he gradually draws you out of your western, materialist worldview and into his: a world where his grandfather, just as he predicted, returns from the grave seven days after his death, clomps up the stairs, and listens to his wife's entreaties that he leave the living in peace.Any Cambridge graduate is entitled to a certain pride, but Khoo Thwe never succumbs to it, remaining humble and modest throughout: from his harrowing escape from murderous government soldiers, to being wracked by malaria, to his rescue by a Cambridge don, to his arrival in England, to graduating with honors.While the author is the only person ever to ride this life trajectory, his story hums with universal resonance; for who can't relate to a humble boy from the Padaung tribe, the scorn of majority Burmans, pursuing his love of literature all the way to the halls of Caius College? The yearning for a better life throbs in every human breast, and has rarely been so movingly rendered as here.Five stars? I'd give it fifty."},{"Title":"From the Land of Green Ghosts : A Burmese Odyssey","review":"Absolutely loved this book.

It's not as dramatic as I thought it'll be but then, I guess that's real life at times. It's definitely as honest as it can be. It does give a good account of what's going on in Burma, especially in the rural parts too. I'll recommend it for those interested in learning about Burma from a Burmese person, and from the native's perspective. Easy to read but by no means a simple writer. It's a literary piece for sure."},{"Title":"From the Land of Green Ghosts : A Burmese Odyssey","review":"This book converted me from a skeptic of opposition politics in Burma to an ardent believer in the democracy movement there. I grew up in the magnificent Shan State with bitter distrust of urban Burmese elites and their political dominance. I was persuaded to read this book after finding out that for the first time I had a chance to discover someone from a village close to my home town. His book swept me away and brought me to understand and sympathize with the central Burmese people's courage and devotion to democracy and freedom. They have taught me to love as a human being in Burma amidst the poverty and deprivation. I owe my soul to that land and grateful to Khoo Thwe for his gift of writing. May he be strong enough to write many more books for Burma and the Kaya State."},{"Title":"From the Land of Green Ghosts : A Burmese Odyssey","review":"Pascal Khoo Thwe is full of one liner's like the one that opens the book and throughout that poetically and vividly bring his Burma to life. It is a Burma that is deeply connected to nature and one that you can almost sense as you are reading this remarkable memoir. From his home in Phekon to Mandalay and through the jungles and mountains of the border to Thailand and then Cambridge, England Pascal Khoo Thwe's journey is every bit a modern Odyssey - but with no return. His story is a very personal account and full of tragedies. What the author has overcome and yet still able to produce this masterpiece is a gift to us all.As he weaves his tale of tragedy, love and everyday life on the edge of the jungle we are taken inside the culture and family life of the Padaung (related to the famous long neck of Thailand fame), the 1988 uprising, the jungle insurgencies and the university life in Mandalay during the 1980s. Lines like,\\".....reading English poetry in the Burmese jungle seemed as incongruous to me as reading the New Testament in a brothel,\\" engage us with his wit while prose such as,\\"The longer I stayed in the jungle, the more determined I became not to die of malaria or boredom. I began to think that hell must be an eternity of repetition,\\" bring us closer to his emotional depths.A virtual ethnography of the jungle diet is a running commentary all the way through. Some is rather macabre such as eating bats and monkeys. However, the diet is normalized all the way through and the section about eating \\"prized young wasps\\" with garlic, ginger and wild herbs certainly awakened my gastric desires. If one were to catalogue his diet from the book, it would offer a whole new menu for most Western diners. Included his culinary kaleidoscope are the smells and sights of the flora and fauna. Fragrant rice fields come to life and the sounds of jungle creatures are remembered.We learn about the ridiculous nature of the Burmese regime from the 60s until the early 90s, about deforestation on the Thai-Burmese border and about collusion between Thai and Burmese authorities. One section describing how soldiers of the Burmese army and the ethnic rebels hurl insults at each other is vivid.It is probably the best personal account of life in non-Burmese Myanmar that I have read. I hope that there will be more like it in the coming years. Pascal Khoo Thwe's book is a moving work of art that not only educates but inspires and awakens us."},{"Title":"From the Land of Green Ghosts : A Burmese Odyssey","review":"The situation in Burma is a sad, sad thing. Its rulers have guns and no compassion. There is one escalator in the whole country and no one knows how to fix it. These rulers refuse international help in a natural disaster to shield themselves not only from criticism of past atrocities but to further confiscate property. All wealth trickles up leaving the population total prey to its rulers.By the extraordinary actions of John Casey, Pascal Khoo Thwe \\"got out\\" and was put in a position where he could tell his story. Through this story we learn how land is taken in Burma, how the people are cowed into submission and about the life of a freedom fighter. In the odd circumstances of this civil war we see how one day the armies are shooting at each other, the next side by side in a hospital on neutral ground.This narrative shows how the Burma police state operates on a personal level. Joining the army to defend the regime is the only avenue for many to feed their families. For more on the collapse of Burmese society I recommendFinding George Orwell in Burma.There is a lot of eerie symmetry. The author sees the end of the man who told him his life was worth a bullet, he sees college friends on both sides of the freedom fight and when he is safely in England he sees a photo of his grandmother with her ringed neck as she was displayed in England, many years ago.The prose of this book is outstanding, vocabulary and nuance show English skills far beyond even native English speaking college graduates. No ghost writer is credited.The book starts you thinking about the lonely life of an exile, the plight of the Burmese people, the problems for Thailand this has created, and an international commuity that has been unable to act."},{"Title":"From the Land of Green Ghosts : A Burmese Odyssey","review":"I read this book while traveling in Burma late 2006. It's a powerful and informative book. I recommend it to anyone. In a remarkably enjoyable story, Mr. Thwe explains what it's like to live and struggle for survival under Burma's military dictatorship."},{"Title":"From the Land of Green Ghosts : A Burmese Odyssey","review":"A stunning tale of a man who dared to change. As a young boy he amazingly learned english with virtually no resources. He then became the first in his family to go to college. There he met a saint in Dr. Casey.

It is a true pleasure to read due to both the prose and the astounding life experiences the author has gone through. It gives one a fascinating glimpse into the life of the Padaung and Burmese in general, while detailing out the tumultuous political situation of that country. It is a lovely book and hard to put down. It is an immensely rewarding read."},{"Title":"From the Land of Green Ghosts : A Burmese Odyssey","review":"I just finished reading this book and I can't stop thinking about it, it is wonderful! It's beautifully written and reads like a novel. The only thing that I felt it was missing was some sort of follow up on the secondary characters. Since Burma is still struggling, I wasn't expecting a totally happy ending but I was curious if he knew what became of some of his friends. Other than that, this is a fantastic, beauuuutiful book!"},{"Title":"From the Land of Green Ghosts : A Burmese Odyssey","review":"I call this an \\"unbelievable\\" book and that's not a compliment. Frankly, I question the accuracy of some of the events that are described in this book. Not to belittle the ordeal that this young man suffered and the effort he made to escape his tormentors, but some of this stuff he writes about just borders on the fantastical. Too many amazing coincidences and superstitious/religious nonsense combine for lots of eyebrow raising. Yes, this book is well written, and most of us want to sympathize with the plight of people who are oppressed and live under cruel regimes, but I get the disturbing feeling that this writer was a bit too loose with the truth during many passages in this book."},{"Title":"From the Land of Green Ghosts : A Burmese Odyssey","review":"This book has quite deservedly collected very favorable reviews and I will not belabor the point. I would like to add that I read this book shortly before a visit to Burma nearly 2 years ago. The insights gained, both political and cultural, were extremely helpful to me during the visit.One of our guides, herself a Shan, was well educated but unaware of this book and expressed a great interest in reading it but I had not carried it with me. Any of you planning to visit might consider taking this along - less obvious than writings of Sang An Su Qui - and leaving it as a gift. I believe many in Burma would appreciate access to this book."},{"Title":"From the Land of Green Ghosts : A Burmese Odyssey","review":"Pascal Khoo Thwe was born in 1967, in a remote village in Burma. This memoir details his life from his childhood as a member of an extended family of a headman of the Kayan people in southern Shan State; his journey through conflict-ridden Burma; and finally his life in Britain.Pascal Khoo Thwe is a member of the Kayan Padaung tribe - best known for the brass neck rings worn by women which create the effect of an elongated neck. Pascal Khoo Thwe writes of village grandmothers who had been taken to England in 1936 to be exhibited in a circus. The women, when they returned to Burma, spoke about strange English tea-time rituals, and wondered about the absence of rice-wine. Pascal Khoo Thwe writes of a comfortable childhood in a small town with mixed ethnicity and multiple languages. Religiously, Roman Catholicism, Animism and Buddhism seem to co-exist together comfortably.\`I used to see people in a different light, depending on which language I spoke to them in.'Pascal Khoo Thwe leaves his village behind when he travels to Mandalay to study English literature at the University. Here he forms friendships with other students, falls in love with a Burman girl named Moe and adapts to a new way of life. Here, too, while working as a waiter in a Chinese restaurant, he meets Professor John Casey: a chance meeting which later has a huge impact on his life. Moe is murdered by the Tatmadaw (armed forces) and eventually Pascal Khoo Thwe, like so many others, flees into the hills away from the military crackdown of September 18, 1988. This is a Burma which he did not know: a jungle in both a literal and pejorative sense:\`The word \`jungle' still carried pejorative overtones in the speech of urban Burmese. Anyone taking refuge with the ethnic insurgents was called a \`jungle child,' which implied primitiveness, anarchy, violence and disease--as well as the unpleasant proximity of wild animals, which the Burmese detested. I had always been painfully sensitive about being regarded as part of a primitive tribe, ..'Pascal Khoo Thwe's journey, learning about the devastation of this war specifically on the rural people of Burma, while coming to appreciate the country itself was for me the most powerful part of this memoir. It's a view of Burma which reflects some of the impacts of its turbulent history.\`Ours is a ghost and spirit culture, and for us the presence of ghosts is as natural as reincarnation is to the Buddhists.'Pascal Khoo Thwe survives this experience and, as a consequence of meeting John Casey in Mandalay, because of a shared interest in the works of James Joyce, he is able to escape from Burma and eventually to study at Cambridge. The final part of this memoir is about Pascal Khoo Thwe's experiences in Britain, of the challenges faced as he studies for (and attains) his degree in English from Cambridge.There are a number of ways to read Pascal Khoo Thwe's story. An interest in James Joyce led to his meeting with Professor John Casey and finally to Cambridge and the polished English with which he tells his story. But while it's interesting to read the story of the first Burmese tribesman to attend Cambridge University, it's Pascal Khoo Thwe's story of life in Burma which haunts me. What does the future hold for Pascal Khoo Thwe, and for Burma? I can see why the story of \`Eveline' (in \`The Dubliners') moved Pascal Khoo Thwe: how circular will his own journey be. I wonder, though, what he thinks of \`Ulysses'?\`Remember what your grandfather said about the earth's being round at school and flat at home.'This is a thought-provoking memoir which I enjoyed reading, and am still thinking about.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"From the Land of Green Ghosts : A Burmese Odyssey","review":"I've read many books about Burma and travel to the country frequently.From the Land of Green Ghosts: A Burmese Odysseyis simply one of the best. Unlike a lot of memoirs, it is both poetic and passionate at the same time. Pascal Khoo Thwe, who struggled with English when he fled the country, has produced an English-langauge masterpiece. From his retelling of his role as a student activist in the prodemocracy protests of 1988 to the helping hand of a Cambridge professor, the book is filled with the mix of sadness and serendipity usually found only in fairy tales. After his escape from Burma, Pascal Khoo Thwe beautifully explains his dilemma as he is caught between the world of his village and trauma in Burma versus life in England. Pascal Khoo Thwe never recites a history of his country's problems, but rather blends them in seamlessly with his own life, providing a much more textured picture of the struggles people did (and still) face under the military dictatorship.From the Land of Green Ghosts: A Burmese Odysseywould make an excellent movie and I hope one day somebody makes one.

Atkinson begins Hannah's story by describing her happy life before anti-Semitism took hold in Hungary. She uses Hannah's own words to describe her need to make something of her life. Hannah's decision to immigrate to Palestine shows that she clearly appreciated the potential for danger in remaining in Hungary too long. The reader quickly comes to admire Hannah, for she is described as a flesh-and-blood creature. She is forceful, determined, and youthful, but not without self-doubt. It is her self-doubt that makes her want to &quot;do something&quot; by returning to Hungary from the relative security of Palestine to help Jews escape to freedom. Although Hannah's mission was not successful, her willingness to act decisively makes her a symbol of her adopted homeland. By reading the story of Hannah Senesh, young readers will gain a clearer understanding into the national character of Israel."},{"Title":"In Kindling Flame: the story of Hannah Senesh 1921-1944","review":"When I first read this book, I had just finished touring the Holocaust Museum in Wash. D.C and I picked this out at the bookstore. I am amazed by this book. The reader immediatly falls in love with Hannah, for her strength and courage. The reader finds themselves reading on wanting to know if she succeeds the Nazis or not. If you enjoy reading about the Holocaust, you will love this book! Thank You for reading my review."},{"Title":"In Kindling Flame: the story of Hannah Senesh 1921-1944","review":"When I read this book, I had no idea what to expect. The assidnment was to read a book from the WWII/Holocaust period. There were shelves full, but this one caught my attention. I took it home and started to read, but was so sucked in I didn't want to stop! Hannah Senesh had such a wonderful story, and I could easily compare her to Anne Frank. She had such a wonderful personality; she was poetic, determined, and courageous. Unlike Anne, Hannah didn't go into hiding. She escaped to Palestine and trained for a parachuting mission back to her homeland of Hungary. She was captured and beaten, and eventually killed, but remained a beacon to her fellow women in jail, making dolls for children and teaching Hebrew to the adults. Hannah was such an inspiration, I think everyone should read her story."},{"Title":"In Kindling Flame: the story of Hannah Senesh 1921-1944","review":"I read this book in the 6th grade and it was very heavy, but it is my favorite book. I did a project on Hanna Senesh and I learned so much about the Holocaust. I would recomend this book to anyone who needs to be inspired. Hanna Senesh was a brave young lady."},{"Title":"In Kindling Flame: the story of Hannah Senesh 1921-1944","review":"I just received this today and skimmed over the pages. There is close to nothing about why the British flew these Jews from Palestine into Europe. There is a vauge reference to intelligence work, but even the young girls' book on Hannah Senesh put out by Scholastic Books states on the back cover that she was sent by the British to set up an escape network for Allied airmen shot down in the region. The group was also sent to help repatriate Russian soldiers from the nearby (to Roumania) Soviet border. The VHS movie \\"Hannah's War\\" from the 1980s makes that also very clear and plain.I felt I was reading a good general history of WW II, with Jewish partisan movement included and major battles, but not a book about why Hannah Senesh voluteered to go to Europe on a dangerous mission, other than to see her mother. As if this was \\"tourist season\\" in WW II.The need for Hannah's mission (it included 30 men and another woman) stems originally from the Allies repeated air attacks on the Ploesti oilfields in Roumania which supplied the Germans 60% of their oil. The first attack in 1943 lead to 200 shot down Allied fliers captured. This lead to two other major attacks on the oilfields because the were put back in production quickly. Flack damaged airplanes can go hundreds of miles before a need for the crew to parachute out. The border distances between Roumania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia (the return route to an Allied airbase in Italy) are small, even for a World War II bomber. In fact, Hannah's group did rescue some Allied airmen. And there was a major secondary reason the British knew about but would not endorse: setting up escape networks for fleeing Jewish refugees AFTER WW II to get to Palestine (Israel) by outfoxing the British blockade, a blockade in effect even before WW II.But reading this book, I got the impression that the author Linda Atkinson all but thought the British were running a travel agency or a \\"Make a Wish\\" Foundation to reunite Hannah with her mother. Despite the worthy inclusion of many biographical concerns of a Hannah as a young woman, including boyfriends, decisions about what she wanted to do with her life, her self-doubts and strengths, I found the extremely limited discussion of why Hannah was sent to Europe an insult to the military mission, the British and the Israelis who risked their lives to fly all 32 native European speakers in to set up escape networks. I thought, in the sections regarding Hannah, that I was reading \\"Hannah's (Not So) Excellent Adventure.\\" I would recommend the Scholastic book over this for teenage girls."},{"Title":"The Animal Hedge","review":"The Animal Hedge is a beautiful children's book with quietly amazing illustrations done in watercolor and gouache. The story tells of a farmer with three sons who endures the loss of his beloved animals and farm due to drought. He maintains himself as best he can, sharpening tools. He remembers the different dreams and abilities of his three sons when it comes time for them to choose their professions. When they each ask what trade they should choose, he tells them to watch the hedge that surrounds their tiny cottage, for its shape will give a powerful clue to the best vocation for each young man. Amazingly, wondrous shapes arise from the humble hedge to direct the sons in their vocations. The eldest sees a coach and becomes a coachman; the second sees a mystic ship and becomes a sailor, while the youngest sees a fiddler, always his dream, and he decides to become a fiddler. But most wonderful of all is the love and the vision of the farmer for his sons' futures. After they all leave and become successful in their chosen vocations, he is lonely and shapes his hedge in the forms of all the animals he had loved when he had his farm. Then all the sons come home and find that it was not nature alone , but their father's trimming of the hedge that had shown them the desires that lay in their hearts. Excited, they see the many animals he has shaped from the shrubs in his loneliness. They put their resources together and return to give their father the animals he has missed; chickens, pigs, and cows. Upon seeing this, \\"The farmer's heart glowed like a hot wood stove. And he made up his mind to let the hedge grow back just as it pleased.\\"This beautiful and healing tale of love between father and sons is further underscored by the muted colors and patchwork placements of the American folk art-influenced illustrations. Perhaps the most striking quality which might be encouraged by the telling of this story is faith in the dreams of youth, faith which endures and survives hardship and privation, faith which does not require youth to remold itself in the cast of the past, a faith which sets them free to follow their hearts, just as the father has done. This is a lovely children's book, very appropriate for preschool to kindergarten age levels. It is sure to be treasured by child and parent alike."},{"Title":"The Animal Hedge","review":"Readers will have a hard time believing Bagram Ibatoulline's folk art illustrations were recently done in watercolor and gouache and are not true 19th c. folk art paintings. With their aged look and timeless quality, these incredible illustrations alone would make The Animal Hedge worth its price.Fortunately, you will get even more than you bargained for since Paul Fleischman has written a wonderful and touching story. While the tale begins on a bit of a sad note when a farmer and his sons are forced from their land because of a drought, the tone is certainly changed when the rains begin to fall again and a magical hedge begins to show the three sons how to live happy and productive lives. The sweet ending will warm your heart.A wonderful father/son story with a fantastical touch."},{"Title":"The Animal Hedge","review":"We are big readers in this house, and we get a lot of books from the local library. It is rare, however, for me to enjoy one enough that I want it for our personal collection. This book is one of those. The illustrations are beautiful, and they fit the gentle story perfectly.

It was broken down, essentially, into four parts, one of which followed an alien force taking control of a Federation mining colony, one of which followed the Enterprise going to the colony's assistance, one of which followed Kirk and the landing party which had to be abandoned in the rush to aid the colony, and one of which followed former Captain Pike and Deena living on Talos IV. I knocked the rating down to four stars only because the entire section dealing with Pike and Deena was neither especially interesting, nor germane to the story (although it WAS still well-written). Otherwise, the book is virtually flawless."},{"Title":"Legacy (Star Trek, Book 56)","review":"I was really rather pleased with this book. The story line with Spock was very intricate and fascinating, especially towards the end where the real action is. Spock, in my mind, was pretty Spock-like.The Kirk story line was really sort of a tangent. Nothing really happens, other than the fact there's a chapter now and then describing the place they are stuck in. I felt it would have been a better story if the crew were united and Kirk was incapacitated some other way where he wouldn't be able to interfere with Spock's stubbornness.All in all, it was a pretty good read. Especially the animosity between Spock and his rival."},{"Title":"Fire and Ice : The Korean War, 1950-1953","review":"This book provides an excellent overview of the Korean War.

However, there is little information out there. After leaving the Army and starting college, I constantly looked for college courses which covered these topics. However, no such luck. I beleive this book provides a good solid time line of the events leading up the Conflict and through the cease fire in 1953. The book provides the reader with the facts and figures of just how much a sacrifice the United Nations forces and the Koreans (both North and South) made during the Conflict. Additionally, the books covers some other areas not typically found in history books such as sections on equipment, uniforms, the environment, etc. Overall, I believe this book provides an excellent foundation for an individual interested in beginning a serious study of the Korean Peninsula and the truely Forgotten War."},{"Title":"Fire and Ice : The Korean War, 1950-1953","review":"Michael J.

Don't let the scholarly foreword by Col. Jessup scare you away, author Michael Varhola's style is extremely easy and free-flowing.Varhola presents, in orderly fashion, clear descriptions of war on the ground, in the air, and at sea; battlefields; details of the military forces in the conflict; and weapons, vehicles, uniforms, insignia, and various equipment. All of the above includes black &amp; white photographs, maps, and diagrams. A chapter on &quot;Warlords and Statesmen&quot; gives miniature biographies and actions of the leaders involved. Chronologies of the war are given in both the chapter &quot;Armistice Negotiations&quot; and in an appendix covering the war as a whole. The grim chapter on POWs deals not only with the atrocities of the time but also follows the continuing governmental conflicts over war crimes to the present day. A final chapter covers the Korean War as presented in books, on film, and online.

Instead, for the most part, this book is a reference book. It's got tons of information in it, but it's organized into battles within time periods. It's hard to explain. I was looking for something that said we did x because of y which resulted in these battles. Then, we did x' which led to some other battles. Instead it said something like in year x we fought battles a, b, and c. In year y, we fought battles d, e, and f. All the information is there, but the \\"story\\" part of the \\"history\\" feels lacking.If you're studying the Korean War, I do agree that this is an excellent book.

Covering a period of time before, during and after the war, the book gives a very complete coverage of the events that occured.

What were the major battles of the war? Which country members supported the United Nations efforts -- and to what extent? Who were the key battlefield leaders for the United Nations? the Chinese forces? the North and South Korean forces? Michael Varhola provides all the answers - and more - in this outstanding reference work.Nearly 50 years ago as a U.S. Marine, I was medically evacuated from the small airstrip at Hagaru-ri in North Korea. The C-47 cargo plane that carried me out had Greek markings and a Greek air crew. I have always wondered about that plane and despite the numerous books that I have read on the Korean War, I have never seen a reference pertaining to Greece's air contribution to the war -- only their contribution of ground forces.But, on page 138 of &quot;Fire &amp; Ice,&quot; I learned that Greece provided an air transport squadron comprised of eight C-47 cargo planes. Obviously the plane that evacuated me was one of these eight. This bit of information is but one example of the many facts contained therein.There are many books written about the Korean War - each with many statistics and facts. However, Mr. Vahola is the first writer to put it all in one book. Whether the reader is a Korean War buff, a serious military history researcher, a student with an interest in the Korean War, a casual reader, or like myself, a Korean veteran, this book is too good to be dismissed. &quot;Fire &amp; Ice&quot; is reference material at its best."},{"Title":"Fire and Ice : The Korean War, 1950-1953","review":"This book is great for getting a little more than a &quot;once over lightly&quot; on the Korean War.

Indeed it covers some subjects, such as allied participation in the war, better than many indepth histories.I found the format of the book similar to man of James Dunnigan's Dirty Little Secrets Book, so it easy to read either cover to cover, or to look up a specific topic.I would recommend this book to a high school teacher as a reference for teaching the history of the Korean War. I would also recommend this book as first for anyone starting to study the Korean War. If your appetite is whetted, then I would next read &quot;This Kind of War&quot; by Fehrenbach, followed by &quot;The Forgotten War&quot; by Clay Blair.I gave this book only 4 stars because it is not very detailed, but it certainly does not miss anything important."},{"Title":"Fire and Ice : The Korean War, 1950-1953","review":"Fire &amp; Ice is, indubitably, one of the best books ever written about the 1950-53 conflict in Korea and definitely the best of the last 10 years.

Although written by an American, this comprehensive overview of the war avoids this pitfall and contains information on the Commonwealth forces and their role in the war (along with information about the South Korean and other Allied contingents that fought in the conflict).

It is the first book I have seen with somewhat detailed descriptions of non-US forces which served with the UN. While it doesn't really tell a story or elaborate on the personalities involved, it fills in a lot of the little details many books about this early Cold War conflict overlook or neglect.

This is one sequel that's better than the original."},{"Title":"Stay: A Novel","review":"In Aud Torvingen, Griffith has created a sort of superhero for our time -- impervious to pain, oblivious of broken bones, unstoppable by bullets, operating outside the law but tolerated by the police because of her effectiveness... There are tons of crime-novel characters in this Sly/Arnold/Bruce mold but what makes Griffith's Aud Torvingen relevant to today is that she is a woman ... and a lesbian.Not that these really have any effect on the story -- there are no sex scenes (and only one attempted seduction), and as mentioned by another reviewer below, ALL OF THE WOMEN in Griffith's novels have always been gay, or at least bi. So her sexuality is a non-issue, not affecting employment, enjoyment or denouement.In a way that's refreshing, as it assumes an attitude of total acceptance on the reader's part which should be the author's right.But we both know the world isn't like that, and it nags in the back of the reader's mind.Aud's character is nicely drawn, as her grieving over a dead lover colors most everything. She is strong and resourceful, working hard to get over the loss, so the reader definitely invests in her well-being. The trials and intrigues she endures keep the novel edgy and action-filled, and for the most part the secondary characters are sympathetically treated and believable. I especially commend Griffith for her portrait of a fundamentalist Christian couple in the story, which could have turned into a caricature but instead was treated with respect and dignity.Overall, this is a multi-faceted novel with a lot of heart, even if certain base assumptions require a suspension of disbelief."},{"Title":"Stay: A Novel","review":"This is a poor novel based on two dubious premises.The first is that grief should be overcome through extreme violence. Aud Torvingen doesn't appear to just murder an abuser, she tortures him to death.The second premise is that people involved in child abuse (and the foster family fit that category) can be left in charge of a child.An intriguing moral dilemma for the reader would be whether Aud is capable of making sound moral decisions by the end of the novel. Unfortunately Stay is not that kind of novel. Aud is always right, even when she's committing a murder. So in her universe there are no grey areas, only stark black and white divisions."},{"Title":"Stay: A Novel","review":"This is a decent story, and although it was nice to read about a lesbian heorine for a change, there is really no discussion or even mention of \\"being gay\\" in the entire book. The common complexities/difficulties that commonly surround this issue are completely ignored, making the story too unbelievable for my tastes.For example, didn't the fact that Aud prefers women have any effect on her career as a cop, her childhood, or her relationship with her mother? Evidently not, since I don't recall her mentioning \\"coming out\\" or any similar incidents when she talked about the past. Wasn't Aud initially curious about Julie's sexual perferences or relationship history? Oh I forgot, in the world of this book, like the others I've ready by this author (The Blue Place, Ammonnite), all the women seem to be lesbians, or at least bisexual, and all the men are completely understanding and supporting of the protoganist's same-sex relationships. This is a nice fantasy and I wish it were true, although it seems too fake for me to really relate to the characters."},{"Title":"Stay: A Novel","review":"I started reading Stay after having read some of Ms Griffith's previous work, including the brilliantly described Slow River and some of her short fiction.Stay is a novel struggling within confines. Ms Griffith has obviously listened to the widespread criticism of The Blue Place and has attempted to modify the brutal excesses of her macho protagonist. The Blue Place was a book that sat more easily among Men's Adventure texts such as James Axler than the winner of literary awards. Aud Torvingen seemed incapable of taking in any common place scene without delighting in inflicting violence on it. Such as fantasising in the breaking of a sleeping man's neck for no reason at all.Aud Torvingen in Stay is rehabilitated by grief. Or by the past critical backlash. This makes for an awkward setup where the protagonist is both violent and static.But there are other, more sensitive confines pressing on Stay. Aud Torvingen likes to travel out of the South. She went back to Norway in The Blue Place. Now she's in New York, a town she hates. The book was written before Sept 11th, but appears afterwards. So lines that depict New York and New Yorkers as \\"concrete and braying voices\\" resonate with a new tenor. Following the terrorist attack they have become, basically, rude.Yet there is only one concession to the changed world of today, a weak line that refers to the Twin Towers absence. I suspect that the author has not been to New York since Sept 11. On a recent visit I found continual references to the vanished trade towers, to the Fire Department and NYPD and to the pride that New Yorkers are taking in stating their Americanness. None of these things feature in Stay. What do are derogatory remarks about the intellect of the NYPD and about the manners of New Yorkers.I believe that there are more fundamental problems with this novel. Basically it suffers from laziness.Stay's plot is cobbled together from lifts from the thriller genre. Such as the use of Aud's dead girlfriend as a reappearing character. Julia appears and talks to Aud in identical fashion to Dave Robicheaux's dead wife in James Lee Burke's Black Cherry Blues. (This was an old idea when Burke did it a decade ago).\\"Stay\\" also relies on endless convenient devices. Aud manages to siphon an entire gas tank in broad daylight and no one sees - because this is essential to the plot. She follows the driver home and, of course, is the only vehicle on the road when he stops and needs help. During a showdown, she takes her eye off the villainness long enough to allow her to draw her own weapon. The child she rescues from child abusers can't stay with Aud, so what does Ms Griffith do? She rehabilitates the couple who collaborated with the abusers and leaves the child where she is.If these signposted and contrived devices were not enough, the book unfortunately suffers from lazy prose. \\"I kept my expression vaguely concerned\\" and \\"Tammy remained in teenage mode.\\" This is indifferent description and at the extreme end of telling rather than showing. Aud dresses in \\"boots, shorts and tank.\\" Perhaps in Book 3 she'll be wearing \\"sneaks\\" with Tammy the Teenager.In this vein, Ms Griffith charts the rehabilitation of her character by the use of a ridiculous rhyme. If we can guess the rhyme for Aud we'll know where she is in her nine point character arc. It's proud to begin with, when she's wailing on someone it's allowed, when she's cowardly, it's cowed, and when she's wholly rehabilitated she's part of a...crowd. This would be a simplistic thematic structure if it had gone unstated, but to state it transcends the farcical. It is surprisingly amateurish.Where are the lines like \\"moonlight lying like pools of mercury on leaves the colour of graphite\\" or \\"the water looked mysterious, unknowable, like an ancient harbour lit by naphtha flaming in a great bronze bowl\\"? Lines which are from Ms Griffith's own \\"Song of bullfrogs, cry of geese\\".If people do want to read rewarding prose and believable characters in a thriller setting they could try Burke's \\"The Neon Rain\\" or Mitchell Smith's \\"Stone City.\\" If they want hardened, ruthless characters embroiled in violence there is \\"Afterburn\\" by Colin Harrison. If they want vivid and wholly realised characters in a (mostly) effective narrative, they could try Griffith's own \\"Cold River.\\" It is a shame that this book didn't measure up to her own standard.I am surprised that Ms Griffith was happy to put her own name to this novel (she is a multiple award winning author) and also very surprised (and depressed) to find that this is a worse novel than \\"The Blue Place.\\" Ms Griffith has, I believe, defended the Blue Place by saying that some critics failed to understand that Aud Torvingen doesn't enjoy violence, she enjoys winning. Winning in combat is by definition about inflicting superior violence, a tautology that Ms Griffith avoids openly confronting. However, the toning down of violence in Stay, and the attempts to rehabilitate Aud as a less macho character indicate that she has tacitly accepted the comments of those critics she purports to dismiss. That's dishonest, isn't it?"},{"Title":"Stay: A Novel","review":"&quot;Stay&quot; is an awesome book. It's the perfect sequel to &quot;The Blue Place&quot; which is , without a doubt one of my favorite books. Nicola Griffith is an amazing author and her characters are very real.

I wasn't expecting this book after THE BLUE PLACE, but now that I've read it I can't imagine Aud doing anything differently. Emotion, quiet moments, excitement, violence and its consequences, hard choices--it's all here in STAY.

I will forgo plot summary here as it is available elsewhere on this page.Griffith writes a mesmerizing book that is hard to put down. I read the entire thing in one day. After I began reading, I had to find out how it ended.Griffith plays a nasty trick on the reader. The characters appear to be distinctly one-sided. The 'evil characters' that are harboring a young Mexican girl to be a wealthy New Yorker's child-bride are revealed to be fundamentalist Christians. When the protagonist visits their church, she hears the preacher trying hard to 'convince himself' of his sermon. The young Mexican girl is unnaturally intelligent for her age. The fundamentalists have a 'sinister' wall decoration. But then Griffith reveals that all is not as it appears. The fundamentalists appear to have genuine love for the girl. The priest is trying to protect his flock from the ravages of the world. The wall decoration is fully explained, and the young girl, though still precocious, is not the preternatural genius we originally thought she was.It shouldn't be surprising that Griffith managed to extricate herself from the type of characterizations normally found in shoddy bestsellers. After all, she's a multiple award winner who is routinely praised as one of the best contemporary novelists. _Stay_ is an engaging novel, and though it's not likely to win a Pulitzer, it's definitely worth a few hours of your life."},{"Title":"Stay: A Novel","review":"I picked STAY up in a bookstore and couldn't put it down. I had to buy it and finish reading it that day. Very compelling reading. Aud is a fascinating, well-drawn character, struggling with herself and her situation. Great reading."},{"Title":"Stay: A Novel","review":"OK, I was wrong. This is the sequel toThe Blue Place, and on finishing that, I was not expecting its successor to be particular good. In fact, in my opinion anyway, it's a lot better. The stylistic excesses that characterised the previous work are here more subdued, allowing the author's skills to evince themselves much more clearly.Among these are the abilities to produce an absolutely spine-chilling portrayal of grief; and to produce a villain who is utterly repulsive but still convincing. This last-named is a task that even as good a writer as Peter O'Donnell found -- as theModesty Blaisebooks progressed -- increasingly hard, and finally impossible.It seems I guessed wrong, too, about the author's influences (see her introduction toThe Blue Placeon its Amazon listing); although perhaps I may say that what led me to theTravis McGee bookswas someone describing them to me (I remember the event clearly) as \\"just as violent as Mickey Spillane, but more intelligent\\".To make your protagonist a homicidal lesbian lunatic*, and further, to write the story in the first person, is something not many authors would attempt; even fewer could bring it off.I'm now glad I read both these books. I await the next one with interest.You definitely do need to read the first one first.*If visual and auditory hallucinations are any indicators."},{"Title":"Stay: A Novel","review":"Niccola Griffith has written another wonderful novel. Perhaps her greatest strength as an author is her ability to delve so effectivly into the mind of her characters and make them fully developed without resorting to any cliche' or formula---and to do so in such different contexts. In this follow up to the Blue Place we get to see Aud's tranformation through grief and sadness--and it works. Keep it up Niccola!"},{"Title":"Stay: A Novel","review":"WOW! This novel hit me on a number of levels. Griffith knows how to draw the reader in and then POW! deliver the 'ol one/two sucker punch.Aud is a delightful character--multifaceted and real. Girffith develops the book in such a way that I can see the cabin surrounded by trees, feel the breeze, and smell the dirt while in the next instance I can feel the grit of New York City, hear the blaring noise, and feel the sun glaring off the asphalt--all within the space of a page.Although the premise of a hip know-it-all type like Tammy being sucked into a mindless slave may be hard for some to believe, it struck a real nerve with me. I faltered a little on the way Aud disabled the dirty rotten scoundrel, as details were sketchy, but for such a minor oversight, who cares.... The rest was brilliant!This book, on so many levels, is extemely well written and absorbing. It touches so many feelings from grief to brutality, yet expounds on each so that you won't feel cheated by any of the characters or emotions that will roil through you as you suck this novel down.Now, I guess I'll have to go back and read some of Giffith's earlier works. This is one talented lady!"},{"Title":"Stay: A Novel","review":"Overall I enjoyed reading this story with its reasonable effort to teach the principle of learning and growing through life experience, but I found things falling into place a bit too easily for Aud, a complex character who is struggling to find herself through grief and guilt over the tragic death of Julia, the person who meant the most to her of anyone in her life thus far. Aud's basic human good comes through in many places, especially with Tammy and Luz, but sometimes how she scraped through some very dangerous incidents in the story really stretched this reader's imagination. Also, I was a bit disappointed in the flat ending, with a simple telling instead of showing what happened between Dornan and Tammy after all of Aud's harrowing adventures on their behalf. Otherwise, I do admire Ms. Griffith's painstaking attention to detail and thoroughness in telling the story.I must admit that this is the first of the three books involving Aud that I have read, so for me, reading this book first was a bit like coming in in the middle of a movie. I thus really want to know in a bit more detail some of the events that led up to the current story, including how her relationship with Julia came about. I thus have started reading The Blue Place to learn a bit more about Aud's background and more about Julia."},{"Title":"Stay: A Novel","review":"One of the best books I've read in a long time. I attribute that to the vivid writing style, incredibly strong characters, and a plot that refuses to give away any secrets before it's ready. The other books in the series are just as good. Recommended."},{"Title":"Stay: A Novel","review":"The subtitle of Nicola Griffith's new book, Stay, is \\"a novel,\\" but the cover illustration and flap copy suggest the usual ho-hum noir tale: an ex-cop PI riddled with grief and guilt over the death of a lover hiding in the woods to avoid the world, who, big surprise, is called back by a friend to find his missing girlfriend. Been there, done that I thought. But by the end of the first paragraph (woods as waterfall? a quinquireme of Ninevah?!), the subtitle started to make sense. By the time I reached chapter two, I didn't have any doubts: Stay is a novel, and a superb one. It's subtle when you don't expect it, and brutal -- shockingly so in places -- when you've let down your guard. It's a powerful exploration of grief, loss of innocence, and rage. And its power comes from the narrator, Aud Torvingden.In an interview for Bold Type (yes, I googled her name), Griffith says that Aud (rhymes with shroud) \\"embodies the long journey toward reconciliation of all those parts of our culture that have been artificially levered apart: mind and body, nature and civilization, art and science, man and woman, tenderness and brutality.\\" It's an astonishing claim, but Aud is an astonishing character. She's larger than life -- insanely rich, and capable, and good-looking -- while being simultaneously, and believably, fragile, and vulnerable, and human.Because of a promise she made her dead lover (which sounds like a cliche, but Griffith makes it work), Aud agrees to track the missing girlfriend. To do that she has to leave the woods, which is where I started to understand that Aud's loss has pushed her over the edge. Or has it? The dead lover appears and disappears (which sounds like another cliche, but in Griffith's hands its not -- it reminded me of Toni Morrison's Beloved), and I alternated between heart-thumping tension and lump-in-throat empathy as Aud struggles with a decision. Can she keep the promise she made to her lover to \\"stay in the world, stay alive inside,\\" or will she turn her face from the painful vulnerability that is her only hope of redemption? The beauty and suspense lies in the way Griffith describes Aud's inner turmoil. She blends a kind of hard and fast noir technique (tracking the missing woman in SoHo; riffling through a sociopath's loft) with quiet, lyrical passages (showing a stranger around the woods). Some of the juxtapositions are shocking: a brutal beating is described in gorgeous prose. A violent fight is described as a kind of ballet. And quiet emotions are given a visceral edge. It's appalling and exhilarating and moving, and I've never read anything like it. My world looks different."},{"Title":"Stay: A Novel","review":"The spectacular imagery of the remote southern Appalachian mountains, with its buckeye, jewelweed, basswood, and pileated woodpeckers, comes sensuously to life as a lone woman hacks out shingles for a roof on her cabin and hides from visitors. Suddenly, the woman reacts to this quiet, pastoral scene: \\"An owl screamed in the wood and I wanted to ride behind its eyes when it plunged its talons into living flesh, wanted to tear something warm and soft to pieces while it squealed.\\" With this remarkable sentence, I was totally hooked--by the strong visual images, by the frightening responses of this damaged woman to the sights and sounds around her, and by the emotional desolation of her life.Aud Torvingen, a former police officer who has killed more than once in the line of duty, has withdrawn from the world to her isolated cabin, grieving and guilt-ridden about the loss of her lover in a shooting she believes to be her fault. When an old friend asks her to find his missing fiancee, Aud journeys to Greenwich Village and a scene of such brutality the reader will not soon forget it. Devastated by the events, Aud understands that she must rebuild her shattered self from the ground up if she ever hopes to recover her life.Griffith's imagery and psychological acuity are overwhelming. She sets up vivid, sensual contrasts between the pastoral life of Appalachia and the urban life of New York, provides total access to Aud's ravaged psyche, makes the reader truly care for this woman who has killed more than once, and encourages us to hope for her emotional rebirth. The book is stunning, and the writing is truly extraordinary! One caveat, however. While most of us willingly suspend disbelief when faced with excellent, compulsively readable fiction, this book, like some other recent books and films, also encourages us to suspend some of our long held values. Some readers may have trouble accepting the premise here that some people are above the law and that ad hoc, vigilante action is sometimes excusable. Mary Whipple"},{"Title":"Stay: A Novel","review":"I have followed Nicola Griffith since her earliest books (Ammonite and Slow River) and her short stories. I've always admired the beauty of her writing and the humanity of her characters, and Stay is a remarkable addition to her body of work.Stay continues the story of Aud Torvingen (the hero of The Blue Place) who has shut herself away in a cabin in the woods to mourn the death of her lover. Aud is grief-stricken and full of guilt because she believes she is responsible for Julia's death, and it seems she is determined to stay that way.Griffith has always made full use of environmental and physical details (Slow River has been noted for its use of water and light as metaphors, and in The Blue Place Aud is constantly aware of her own body moving in the world and the sensations and textures of the things around her). In Stay, the entire forest ecology becomes a metaphor for Aud's state of withdrawal and grief (\\"The birds were quiet, the sun streamed down, and for a moment the valley felt like a place out of time, secret and silent and still, where no one intruded and nothing ever happened. Then I saw that the gilding on the trees up the mountain wasn't just sun but the first tints of autumn which would seep downhill until all was copper and russet and gold and, not long after that, bare.\\")Change is coming to the land and to Aud. An old friend convinces her to leave her refuge and find his missing fianc&eacute;e. Aud wants to stay in the woods, but her lover made her promise to stay in the world, to stay connected in spite of her rage and her pain.This is the metaphor that structures and enriches the book: Aud learning that to 'stay,' she must change and become something else. In order to keep her promise to Julia, she has to grow beyond the person that Julia knew and leave Julia behind. Griffith is wonderful at weaving many layers of image and meaning into a narrative that moves quickly but always keeps us in Aud's head and heart as she navigates her way to New York and back again. I was impressed by the small, precise touches that Griffith uses to show us that Aud is really on the edge, not tracking well, and vulnerable: as one example, she reaches the city and opens her suitcase to find she's packed \\"three pairs of socks, two books, my phone, and a can of half-frozen concentrated orange juice.\\"I was also impressed by the development of Aud's relationship with Tammy, the missing fianc&eacute;e. They start out disliking and distrusting each other, and then begin to understand each other better as they spend time together on the mountain, healing. Again, the layers of metaphor abound: \\"When dirt is disturbed, it becomes unpredictable: perhaps when turned and tilled it grows fertile and lush; perhaps erosion sets in and the whole turns to sand. Some soil is never meant to be turned; it's best left frozen and hard-packed. Sometimes it can be hard to tell until you try.\\"Griffith has been widely praised for The Blue Place, and with Stay she makes Aud more complex, more compelling, and just as fascinating as ever. The writing is lush and lyrical whether Griffith is talking about violence or healing, and Aud's journey through grief is convincing. Stay took me through a spectrum of emotions on a journey that I won't soon forget. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of literary work that doesn't pull punches or simplify the human heart."},{"Title":"Stay: A Novel","review":"Many so-called \\"thrillers\\" achieve their effects by constant movement, often to no purpose other than causing a rise in adrenalin. If that's what you want, go rent a movie with a high body count. When you open \\"Stay\\" its achievement is that it drives the adrenalin by virtue of its examination of the limits of responsibility, the development and application of a moral consciousness, and the costs of engagement in life--and the costs of withdrawal.This is not to say that all the movement is internal. On the contrary, \\"Stay\\" is filled with compelling action.But action without purpose, heroism without conscience, intervention without cost is a waste of time and ultimately a lie to the soul, a trap too many books fall into because it's easy. Griffith avoids this trap by making every move, every action, every choice, decision, and judgement matter. Aud must decide and it hurts; Aud must act and it's impossible to be absolutely certain; Aud must choose and it's hard. But in the end she does what all of us must do if we're to live lives that matter, that count for something--she grows.\\"Stay\\" is superior on every level and lives up to its title--it stays with you, long after you finish reading."},{"Title":"Stay: A Novel","review":"This is the second in the author's Aud Torvingen series. It opens with Aud in North Carolina trying to recover from the death of her soulmate, Julia. An old friend invades her cocoon to ask her to find his girlfriend. While Aud doesn't think she's ready to return to the world, Julia's voice keeps telling her that she needs to stay in the world. She goes to New York and finds the woman. From that point on, her life careens along - seemingly out of control - and full of ephiphanies and unexpected twists.This series is dark - the protagonist is devastated with grief and guilt over her lover's death - and she is dangerous. The people she seeks are not always amongst the human race's finest specimans.Griffith is a talented author whose writing improves with each outing. Aud is finely drawn, as are the lesser characters. The descriptions of Aud's North Carolina hideaway are vividly written - so much so you can hear the birds calling to one another in your head and smell the wood smoke from her fire. Aud is damaged and struggling with the decision whether to remain alive.Griffith is an underappreciated author who deserves a much wider audience. If you decided to read this novel, read the first in the series. A Blue Place before starting this one. I think you'll be hooked and waiting for the third Aud Torvingen novel with Griffith's other fans."},{"Title":"Stay: A Novel","review":"I believe that anyone that has read this book before can vouch that the emotions so intimately and precisely described in this book are completely opposite of the ones featured in Nicola's first \\"Aud\\" novel \\"The Blue Place.\\" If you haven't read \\"The Blue Place\\" then I strongly advise reading it before you pick up this one.In this second installment Aud is grieving. She's grieving hard, so hard that she's moved out of the heated jungle of Atlanta to the peaceful and serene North Carolina woods! However, where there is a will there is a way, and although Aud is forced back into the world she's willing to stick it out. The complex emotions, the descriptions of them, and the characters are all 3 dimensional. You won't forget them nor how you met them. Mrs. Griffith beautifully wrote this novel. It sports grace, style, attitude, and emotion. You feel as if you've been in Aud shoes, or could be. You feel for Aud and some of the other characters and you find yourself wondering if you're capable of doing the same in some of the situations that arise.Once you finish this book, you will definitely be provoked to reanalyze yourself, your decisions and your outlook on life and people, whether they live with you or not."},{"Title":"Stay: A Novel","review":"I can't improve on what the chap says below. I admired her first heartshattering, atmospheric, and highly resonant tragic novel, \\"The Blue Place,\\" starring this same lead detective character. That novel has the palpable sense of impending doom and unavoidable, inevitable destiny from the very beginning and this wished-for follow-up of Aud's state of emotional and mental health is pure prose poetry of being in the state of grief. I could identify. The 'mystery' novel part of it is negligible, a McGuffin, it's not about that, just as the first novel really wasn't either. The dead lover is so present in her thoughts and heart that it almost reads like a ghost story at times. Aud is not a great detective by any means, but she is a woman of action."},{"Title":"Stay: A Novel","review":"this perfectly balanced novel is like the best dinner you ever had with a fascinating companion who excites you and listens to you and intrigues you all at the same time. it will make you listen intently; it will exhilarate you; it will make you nod and say &quot;yes, yes, that's it _exactly!_&quot; you will finish, and walk away satisfied, but long for more. you will lie awake in your bed and replay moments in your head, and you will dream differently.the physical world is the first thing you notice: the trees, the wind, the birds, the scents of dirt and leaves and mossy water. then the interior world of aud. then the story, which is aud's story of pain and love and joy and loss, of learning and hope and risk and reward and mistakes, and, at last, of pure and intensely satisfying action. you will pump your arm in victory, shout &quot;yes!&quot; loud enough to startle your honey, then startle him again when you reach the end and weep but smile.i was struck, over and over, by how absolutely true it all feels; the grief, the joy, the fight, the friendship, the lust, the blood, the child, the change. the story is a marvel of zest and rightness and realness: things go wrong, things evolve organically, things go according to plan but then end up meaning something different. and always, everywhere, infusing everything, is aud. you will be reminded of yourself. you will be glad sometimes that it's not you suffering and you will be sad sometimes that it's not you triumphing. your honey will read the book and be glad, and sad, and angry, and intrigued (and a little bit jealous I think).you will want to read _stay_ over and over and over again, and wish you'd read the first book first, and meantime gush uncharacteristically like this to anyone who will listen.savor this book because you can only read it for the first time once."},{"Title":"Stay: A Novel","review":"An astoundingly strong, rich, thoughtful and cleverly written novel.I have long been searching for a novel that would have at least the same power to completely rivet my attention, teach me how to see things that have been worked to death in so many other novels in a new, intelligent light, and make me really think - as much as \\"The Blue Place\\" did way back in 1999 - and this novel certainly has done that.Aud (as in proud, avowed, loud, and only very, very rarely cowed), is a very strong, intelligent, determined and fiercely loyal character, who, on losing her soulmate, Julia in an incident for which she completely blames herself, is on the borderline between acute grief and psychosis.But, she has avowed to \\"Stay\\" in the world, no matter what, a promise she made Julia before her death, and a promise she struggles valiantly to keep throughout the novel, no matter how tough and seeminly unreal things get; how torn her loyalties are between helping a friend find a girlfriend in trouble, and a brave little girl also in potential trouble because of it; and how, in doing all of this, she pushes her body, mind and will to the extreme, in such a way that one wonders if she will ever survive it all.Heroic, bleak, clever, but at all times refreshingly true to itself and the stark unflinching reality of life, grief and survival - \\"Stay\\" is one novel I definitely recommend you do not miss. Unputdownable noir at its very best.- Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Stay: A Novel","review":"Nicola Griffith breathes life onto paper once again. Stay does not disappoint. Stay is rich and deep.

Right now, thanks to the release of his COLLECTED POEMS, edited by Frank Bidart, he is experiencing another upswing.What has never suffered in esteem is this collection, IMITATIONS, the most influencial of its type since Ezra Pound's TRANSLATIONS. Lowell has, in his own words, \\"been reckless with literal meaning, and labored hard to get the tone.\\" As Pasternak said, in poetry, the tone is everything. Hence the title: imitations, not translations.Of course, I know many of the originals of these and Lowell has not been reckless, at least not by my standards. Instead he has (often, but not always) taken the translation one step beyond the normal conversion and internalized the poems to himself and his own experiences. A colossal trick of ego? Perhaps. \\"All my originals are important poems,\\" he claims in his introduction. As if to dance upon the grave of Western poetry, the first imitation condenses THE ILIAD into 46 lines. But Lowell is much more respectful from there, and earns his faithfulness to the original poets in his own unique way.I think he really has succeeded in making poems that equal the originals with a high percentage. He has also put his unmistakeable pissmark on them. George Steiner called them \\"creative echoes.\\" Whatever they are, love 'em or hate 'em, they are a must read for all poets and translators, a sort of gauntlet thrown down upon the heads of Homer, Sappho, Heine, Villon, Baudelaire, Rilke, Montale, Pasternak et al. How should one go about translating any literature? This is one of the best points of departure."},{"Title":"Algebra (Spanish Edition)","review":"All algebraic processes widely explained in a step by step reasoning method.

I didn't check the preview carefully - I notice with disappoint that the verbs are given in their \\"masdar\\" or \\"infinitive\\" form (it's not a real infinitive, but for sake of semplicity we can call it this way).This form given, it's often very hard to guess which is the exact present root. For instance: \\"laparakob\\" (to speak) is the present theme, the infinitive reported in the dictionary is \\"laparaki\\" (with no -ob suffix, indispensable for creating the present form). So, if you don't know the rules to get back from the infinitive to the present form, you will use just the infinitive, speaking \\"like Tarzan\\" (he to drive - I to want - she to drink). At least, this is the impression I have, since I'm an italian native speaker and we use 6 persons for the verbal conjugation. Using just the infinitive is perceived very \\"primitive\\" and basic. Anyway, it has to be said that the authors explicity - and honestly - declare that their principal aim is that the users of this book could be understood in some way (no matter the grammatical and morphological correctness).So, if you want to go to Georgia and just be understood, in a very basic way, this is your dictionary (four/five stars); if you want to talk a little or building simple sentences (I go there, they eat, we speak), this dictionary seems not to be the right - even if it's the only - choice."},{"Title":"Georgian-English/English-Georgian Dictionary and Phrasebook (Hippocrene Dictionary & Phrasebook)","review":"Here's a novel idea: publish a book that is romanized instead of using the script in the country.

Thus, in both the brief dictionary and the phrasebook, word and expression selection is geared to these people's specialized short-term needs at the expense of the general traveler's. Many common and useful words seem to have been sacrificed to those needs. \\"Uncle\\" is in the dictionary but not \\"aunt.\\" Five pages are devoted to \\"relief aid\\" phraseology, but in \\"food and drink\\" only five (!) vegetables make the cut. The staple Georgian cheesebread, khachapuri, is relegated to a footnote.The grammar section is very sketchy indeed.

The author overcame many obstacles (Personal and other which he writes about) to become an author. Extremely well written book.The author writes about his life in California raising sheep with his wife Louise. He he also writes about his loyal dog, Maxie, a border collie, who means the world to him. He writes about how the sheep have taught him about life, love, challenges and ultimately God. He also speaks of his faith in Jesus Christ, from the time he was a dyslexic school boy who could barely read or write to the author he has become.This story really will bring you to tears and make you ponder your own life.

Well worth reading."},{"Title":"Livestock, Ethics and Quality of Life (Cabi)","review":"Increasingly novel &amp; sophisticated applications of science &amp; technology to animal breeding and production are raising ethical concerns in many countries in an era when public caring and spiritual values are widely rising. Ethical, political and trade issues in how we treat farm animals have become headline news. To name but a few: quality of life in factory farming systems; cloning; genetic engineering; &quot;Mad Cow&quot; disease (BSE); transplantation of animal organs into humans; bovine &amp; porcine somatotrophin. Complex cultural, emotional, philosophical and spiritual reactions have emerged to the economic, scientific and technical developments in agriculture. At last an authoritative textbook has emerged to guide us through this tangled and growing web of concern, conflict and debate. This excellent new book &quot;Livestock, Ethics &amp; Quality of Life&quot; does not seek to thrust answers upon us but to clarify the arguments and issues for us so that we can review and understand the range of approaches available and make our own informed assessments. Our way is then cleared to choose a forward direction that is based on clarity, discernment and wisdom rather than fantasy, fear and muddled thinking. It originated in a special symposium held at the 1998 World Congress on Animal Production but additional chapters have been specially commissioned to provide a more comprehensive and balanced account."},{"Title":"Livestock, Ethics and Quality of Life (Cabi)","review":"Thought-provoking&quot; is probably the best way to describe this book. A series of papers, primarily those presented at a 1998 symposium as a part of a Congress on Animal Production, each of which present some of the questions raised by many of the new and newer methods of production of animal protein for food. Essentially the questions raised revolve about the axis of, &quot;What is it ethical to do in order to allow ten billion people to eat?&quot; Several different perspectives are used as starting points, though the primary basis is that of Religion (abstract or particular). Answers are not all provided; these are left as an exercise for the reader. Though the book and the papers contained therein have their origins with professional ethicists, geneticists, and Animal Scientists, the layman can read and enjoy at least parts ~ large parts, i believe ~ of it.

There is much beauty in his writing, but it's beautiful in the way a desert landscape is beautiful -- stark and haunting, but also full of life in unexpected places.Second, this book is NOT A MURDER MYSTERY! Some readers seem to be caught up in questions like \\"did Bill's wife poison him?\\" and the like. Those kinds of inquiries are not even remotely what this book is about. (It's like reading \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" and obsessing about Boo Radley's haircut.) Also, I seriously doubt that Alan Lightman is suggesting that Anytus and Chalmers are both responding irrationally toward the evolution of their culture's respective communication revolutions. If that were the case, he would be favorably comparing the Socratic method with the nightmarish, soul-destroying technocracy of our postmodern world, which he is most definitely not doing.There is, in fact, nothing in this book, not a single word, that praises or supports our sickeningly self-important, insanely paced postmodern lifestyle. \\"The Diagnosis\\" is filled to overflowing with disconnected people acting out in appalling ways we have come to view as normal. When you see yourself in the pages of this book, and realize how perverse \\"normal\\" has become, that's the diagnosis."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"Toni Morrison once said in an interview that she was amused by a reader's exclamation: &quot;Your books are very hard to read!&quot; Her classic response was, &quot;They should be; they are very hard to write!&quot;Likewise, Lightman does not serve up a story that is easy to digest. This book is neither a mere &quot;whodunit&quot; nor a polemic suggesting that one spirited interpretation can be taken from the book. The number of reviews that mistakenly see this as some simple mystery are allowing them to be distracted by the same yearning for easy-answers that afflicts Chalmers. The diagnosis of his disease, and that of the deeper meaning of the book, are both meant to be a challenge. If one looks for the answer just as one deciphers a simple mystery novel, then one is just as inattentionally blind as Chalmers' doctors."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"Having heard the review of Einstein's Dreams on NPR I went in search of the book (wanting immediate satisfaction or I would have gotten it off the web of course). Not being in stock, I picked up &quot;The Diagnosis&quot;. I almost put the book down at the first 100 pages, as it was so superficial and is written in this really annoying prose - which can best be described as \\"not beautiful\\". The parallel story of Socrates kept me going. In fact, I labored through the modern chapters really only to get to the next ancient story episode. Sadly, even that story ended with out satisfaction. The story only serves to show how amazing the writing of Camus' \\"The Stranger\\" is by comparison. Lightman gives his readers plenty of intellectual references - Spanning from Socrates, Chess, Law, &amp; Medicine - but no real belief that we will get what he his saying without a repetitive innuendo. I kept thinking he should end every sentence with, \\"if you know what I mean\\". By the way, I too picked up on Lightman's hint that his wife poisoned him. At the last chapter of this disjointed story, my only reaction was - \\"whatever\\"."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"anyone think the wife poisoned the main character? reread the email interlude after the &quot;First Tests&quot; chapter. no smoking gun, but that, combined with her &quot;it's all my fault&quot; at the end of the book and the anytus story makes me wonder. the parallel being, someone tried to kill someone else but it got botched, and now that person has to live with the aftermath.this expanation is certainly not water tight and i don't know even if it's the truth, why write such a story.i don't think this book is worth a lot of analysis. while there are interesting, resonant perspectives now and then, i don't know that there's enough to hold it together as a book. or maybe it's a funny joke, a book where everyone's trying to diagnose what's going on, and readers end up doing the same thing--both futilely..."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"The Diagnosis, while not on a par with &quot;Einstein's Dreams&quot; is an unnerving novel, frightening, perhaps, to those caught up in the &quot;rat race&quot; of today's business pressures.One may see too much of themselves in the protagonist, Bill Chalmers as he descends from corporate obsession into a purgatory of confusion and uncertainty. The irony of the &quot;diagnostic process&quot; will not be lost on anyone who has struggled with healthcare services in recent times."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"Did not enjoy or appreciate this book. Left me feeling antsy and irritated and furious, like its main character. Coulda done that on my own (in fact, it might have been inevitable). I suppose on some level the book connected with me, but it gave me little to work with beyond my own angst. Start again, and make your next book as unlike this one as possible. Please."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"Sorry, I appreciated this book because Chalmers was resonantly human and insightful into the human psyche. A moral and ethical being, he acquiesed to his position and upward mobility, but internally, he was a resonant human with needs for loved ones in his life, a sense of actuating himself, while still being appreciated by our society. These have become impossible goals: It's either go corporate or go dead for the contemporary &quot;Winston Smith's&quot; of our culture. Thus Chalmers began to deteriorate. It's scary, but totally plausible. All persons are, in fact, unique and watching others with the proper connections get ahead does not enhance. Sorry, but Lightman, a genius, gets many points in morality and ethics for promoting real people."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"Firstly, this novel has the seed of several provocative ideas- it was no surprise to see that it ws proofed by Don Delillo, from whom it borrows freely. But a gem here and there does not a novel make. The plot takes you from the stark epiphany of one grim realization to another but does not capitalize or build upon any relationship between chapters. An aimless subway ride, hordes of commuters drowning in information, a wanton medical intervention, a faceless company dedicated to the &quot;maximum information in the minimum time&quot;- these are the background events to the mysterious ailment which destroys the body. Lightman's tale of alienation and hopelessness has little comic relief (except the description of the doctors) or redeeming factors of any kind to justify faith in the future. The main character's loving son communicates to his Dad by email even when he is in the same house. The successful company man ages prematurely and works all night. The Bill GAtes figure seeks to buy the birth certificate (?birthright) of all americans- and he want to &quot;go global&quot;. The novel draws a parallel to the Death of Socrates which over reaches its metaphor and misses the opportunity for...irony. Irony is exactly what The Diagnosis lacks. It just succumbs."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"The set-up was wonderful but there was no resolution whatsoever. Socrates death excerpts? What was the point? How about some resolution with the wife's 'affair', the foreshadowing with the company and its work ethic was never resolved, nor was there any depth with the characters. It has been a long time since I was so dissapointed in a book."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"I was really torqued when I finished this book, but that was my own fault. I'd decided where I wanted the author to go and had a quiet tantrum when he didn't. I guess I've just got to grow up.The more I thought about this book, the more I liked it. The characters were rich, in the sort of intentionally caricaturish way of Sinclair's Babbitt. And although our lead character sometimes kicked on his line like a tuna at sea, the reel drew steadily in through his superficial, plastic world to a thought-provoking conclusion.I guess the author thought a few of the dangling things he opened the story with weren't necessary for the flavor of the finish. In retrospect, I guess he's right."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"After reading several reviews of what I believed was a thought-provoking and ultimately disturbing commentary on our times, I was forced to counter the reviews of those who found the book lacked meaning. In my view, Lightman is addressing the spiritual poverty of the business community, and in turn, millions of Americans who are part of that community, by way of his main character Bill Chalmers. The vaguely unhappy Bill is blindly chasing the American Dream working in a hyper-competitive, soul-deadening position, and bears some similarity to the Kevein Spacey character in American Beauty. The unique twist to Lightman's story is this spiritual unhappiness manifests itself in a physical way, causing Chalmers to grow increasingly ill and physically deteriorate over the course of the story. As doctor after doctor fails to find the cause of his illness, he slowly begins to sense the reason for his malady and lashes out at the people and institutions that caused it. But he can not find the way out, the solution that will enable him to escape the confines of his life which ultimately (and literally) paralyze him. This story may hit too close to home for some -- for others, it will be a cause for serious reflection on the spiritual ills of the business world today and on the changes we might make in our own lives to avoid or better cope with them."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"This is a book that is so easy to read and very hard to put down. Bill Chalmers, the main character, is an upcoming junior partner, in a very modern Boston technology company. Bill seemingly has it all, family, suburban house, money, career etc.Suddenly Bill Chalmers encounters progressively bad and mysterious health problems. A weird episode at the hospital emergency ward is the weakest part of the book. Two physicians, with no proper authority and without following any sort of a standard protocol, experiment on Chalmers. Many critics and reviewers have quite rightly, slammed this part as far-fetched and comically unrealistic. However, it does not really detract from the over all book and at times it may even add a little suspense as the search for a diagnosis moves on.E-mails and Instant Messages, and the way they have totally affected everyday life for a part of the American society is so well portrayed. In fact, after your read Lightman's Diagnosis, books that deal with the same type of people in 2001 USA seem to be missing out on parts of their lives. From their on line life, we get to know more about Bill's family. The closeness Bill and his son share in real life is also extended to their on line life,Melissa, who mostly stays by Bill through his illness, is full of the stereotypical affluent suburban wife contradictions. On line affair with a stranger, runs a business that has no hope of making money, yet annoys Bill with the constant change in his home furniture and a sense of climbing up the social ladder along with an on going tension with her Southern roots. Melissa's relationship with the son was practically non-existent in the book. In all, Lightman did not really want us to like her much.We also get to meet some of Bill's work colleagues neighbors, old school friend, his mother and sister in law. This all takes place as Bill's condition deteriorates. Lightman's portrayal's of Bill's doctor and shrink and Bill's dealings with the whole health care world were fascinating and well done. You do really get a very clear sense of the world Bill comes from and lives in.A major part of the book, perhaps over a quarter of it, is an ancient Greek story fictionalized by Lightman. This is so well written and gripping in its own right. It takes us to a whole different world with Socrates and his contemporaries. The symbolic link between the two stories is not immediately obvious; it does not jump out at you. The Greek tale can really provoke lots of thoughts, the self assured Athens of Socrates days does in ways compare with our own self assured society of 2001, or does it not? Is Chalmers more of Socrates rejecting the society by his body then by his brain too, or is he more the society itself. You can, if you wish, enjoy yourself seeking out the symbolism, or just ignore it and enjoy a short Greek tragedy within a contemporary \\"hub\\" tragedy!As Chalmers condition deteriorated, he spent more time reflecting on little things. A most beautiful, yet sad, part of the book is Chalmers getting obsessed with a leaf. Chalmers entertains himself for hours tracing leafs. Lightman does a very convincing job in presenting the mind of man gradually coming to terms with the hopelessness of his position, eventually losing hope.The quotes from Norman Mailer and Annie Proulx on the back cover of this book are so very accurate, enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"I listened to the audiobook, which was recommended by Audible from my previous Kafka/Camus/Sartre purchase history. For a brief flash on the train, and again in the doctor's office, we see what could have been a fine modern existentialist drama playing out. But, alas, there is too much going on here, in too much detail, to make the protagonist's plight interesting. Where Kafka and Camus draw us deeper into the subject's point of view, Lightman confuses us with a barrage of emails, rivalries with coworkers, a dysfunctional family, unnecessarily long passages from Greek drama, and then oh yeah there's that Chalmers guy in there somewhere too. Too much description; not enough action. If Audible is correct that he was attempting a modern tale of alienation and absurdity, then Lightman has failed miserably. And if they made an incorrect assumption, then Lightman has still failed to give us a story worth plodding through. No reason to spend your precious free time on this one."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"The author could claim I didn't get the point but, alas, he didn't guide me to it. The central character, a thirty or forty-something man employed by a modern organization becomes ill with a degenerative disease that confounds diagnosis. His first medical examination detects brain abnormality but subsequent examinations are inconclusive. Records of the first exam are apparently lost to him due to a complex of circumstances and disappear from the story. The description of that examination and events surrounding it are all credible but the examination's role in the story line is left unclear. We are left to think whatever we care to about this. Perhaps, \\"What a shame\\" would be the appropriate sympathetic response.The illness' impact on the protagonist's job, family, person and outlook forms the principal story line. A subordinate story line runs in parallel but it's connection to the main theme is difficult to perceive except at a trivial level. This subordinate line centers on the death of Socrates and events associated with it, as described in an online college level course taken by the protagonist's teenage son. The main theme benefits little from this parallel plot. Actually, I found it distracting.The protagonist is probably like many of us, somewhat self centered, angry at \\"who know's what?\\", somewhat paranoid, sometimes fragile, and sort of bland on the inside. His illness makes him sympathetic. Nothing else does. His wife is no more attractive although she seems to grow into her role as care giver. Their son is a modern teenager in a positive relationship with his father who is greatly threatened by the illness.As the illness progresses, the protagonist moves from a state of denial through anger to acceptance at the end. The illness progressively robs him of his sense of touch, numbness overtakes his body, and his sight deteriorates badly. He progresses from being independent to complete dependency on others. In parallel, his world shrinks. Despite the wealth of symptoms, no diagnosis emerges. Physicians speculate: maybe psychosomatic, maybe autoimmune, etc. without consensus.The physicians are as we know them, mostly conservative, sometimes oblique in their communications, each with an opinion centered on their various specialties. The best I could extract from their role in the story is that symptoms may be associated with a variety of causes and that differential diagnosis is a complex task. And that a syndrome may appear that defies diagnosis by existing tests. All of this is true, of course, and I did find in these characters, charateristics that I recognize from my own experience.Toward the very end, the protagonist wonders whether he could ever have made his wife happy. Is this what it's all about? A not too unhappy marriage from which the breadwinner withdraws so as to ultimately free his wife honorably but only after taxing her caregiving skills to the utmost? Regarding the wife, early in the story she is conducting a romantic liaison via the internet an aspect of the story that gradually disappears as the illness progresses and we are left to wonder what role the author intended the liaison to play other than to let us know that the wife is discontented. He lets us know that in enough other ways that the liaison seems to burden the story rather than to move it along.The book is filled with vignettes of modern life. Taken separately, they are quite engaging. The behavior of the medical residents in the hospital emergency room at the time of the first examination is humorous if ironically realistic. The use of e-mail is true to life but is so abundantly present that it simply becomes an overworked plot device. Interactions between colleagues in a partnership organization with too little \\"room at the top\\" are described well, if predictably. A church bingo game provides a surreal diversion. The wife's \\"hands off\\" cyber-liaison seems tailored to the modern age. Much else could be cited here were there room. But vignettes, however well constructed, do not guarantee a cohesive whole.From start to finish I kept asking myself why I was continuing with this book and kept telling myself that the author would draw it all together by the end and I would finally understand why I should care or whether the author had a takehome message to convey. I was wrong. This novel accurately describes aspects of contemporary society as experienced by well educated and well motivated people. In that sense, the story is easy to identify with. But, that isn't enough and I conclude that I spent my reading time poorly."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"EINSTEIN'S DREAMS so passionately involved me that I have read it over and over just to experience the flawless and beautifully lyrical prose, the wonderful images, the entire literary journey.THE DIAGNOSIS is a very different matter.

The opening chapter is fantastic but the book seems to stall after Chalmers is released from his job. I like the jabs at technology and society and the idea of the human machine failing while the electronic revolution keeps moving forward but I thought that the e-mail sections of the novel were a bit tedious and the internet affair of Bill's wife just disappears. I agree that not all questions should be resolved in a good novel but this one left too many. Buy the book if you don't need a feel good ending (sorry!) and enjoy reading Kafka."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"A profoundly beautiful book of masterful detail and nuance, &quot;The Diagnosis&quot; is nonethless painful and disturbing in its relentless candor about the absurdities of modern life. The mental and physical decline of Bill Chalmers and his world is haunting in its vivid sadness. Alan Lightman is a masterful writer of the greatest skill. This is a truly memorable book."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"This is a rare accomplishment indeed. A surreal, at times mystical, revelation of modern times. A man witnesses his growing helplessness within the framework of a society which not only fails to discover his &quot;illness,&quot; but is smug, self-satisfied, and all but divorced from their own humanity. Lightman's visual portrayals and his incredibly delicate imagery are profound indications of his sensitivity to the dehumanizing influences that surround us. He has no quick fixes, even though in one passage his character, Bill Chalmers, strikes out at the crass materialism which tempts his teen-age son. This is far from being an unrealized novel--it is most certainly one of the most honest and cogent portraits of our society that I have read."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"While I didn't enjoy this book as much as I did Lightman's earlier EINSTEIN'S DREAMS, I thought it was a very effective rendering of the terror that tension can inject into our lives. Many of us work at jobs that keeps us costantly on edge -- demands are made of our time and our intellect that, decades ago, would have seemed unthinkable.Lightman's prose and plot bring these tensions to life in a very real way. His frequent transcriptions of e-mails sent and received by the characters (even utilising, at times, the 'junk' e-mails with which all of us are plagued) can get a little annoying -- but I think that's the point. The lives of many in our modern society are seemingly spinning out of control -- and the toll this takes is a serious and frightening one.The malady suffered -- with increasingly restricting intensity -- by Bill Chalmers, the protagonist of Lightman's story, is a horrifying one. One day, on his way to work on the subway, he suddly forgets not only where he's going, but many of the details of his life. He sees the faces of those around him and wonders if he should recognize them. After a harrowing day of riding the subway and hoping to recognize his stop -- which never happens -- he winds up without his briefcase, without any ID, without much of his clothing, hospitalized as a street lunatic. He manages to escape the hospital, and, his lost memory returning slowly, makes his way home -- but he is plagued with a numbness in his hands and feet, a numbness that, over the course of the next few weeks and months, spreads througout his body and incapacitates him. His attempts, at first, to hide his condition from his family and coworkers are portrayed in such a way that we can feel his sense of helplessness and panic, his feeling of the 'unfairness' of being stricken in such a way.The novel deals in great detail with his struggle to understand what is happening to him, and with his infuriating dealings with the health-care systems, with doctors that are so afraid of making a wrong diagnosis -- or so greedy that they want to prolong the process as long as possible -- that he is subjected to test after test, specialist after specialist, in a seemingly endless road to a dignosis that MIGHT allow him to begin to actually receive treatment for his condition.Lightman intersperses his storyline with flashbacks to ancient Athens, to the time of Socrates -- we see the drama around the great thinker's 'trial' and execution unfold through an on-line educational program that Chalmers' son is taking. There are many parallels between the two stories -- both of them, obviously, fights against the hard wall of short-sighted bureacracy and mindless preservers of the status quo.My main complaint about the book was that, for all of its amazingly vivid depiction and re-creation of the tension in the lives of its characters, it was a bit tedious and a struggle to get through. I know this added to the effect somewhat, but it made it -- for me, at least -- a little less enjoyable a read than if it had been more succinct. Lightman is a talented writer, however -- and I certainly wouldn't dismiss this work for these reasons."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"Disturbing, unsettling, and unresolved---and that's the way it was meant to be! I disagree with other reviewers who found Chalmers' wife and son to be uncaring and shallow; I believe they were simply other symptoms of societal estrangement. Love seemed to be the sole redemptive option, and the final scenes between father and son were poignantly touching.I value this book because of the way it has influenced my thoughts over the past few weeks. I think of the man in the story who is panicked because he will be out of cell phone contact for two minutes while his subway passes through a tunnel---not so different from those who must talk while speeding down the highway between meetings. The Diagnosis? An unbearable sense of inflated being."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"I loved Alan Lightman's &quot;Einstein's Dreams&quot;. I thought it one of the most creative books I have read so I had high hopes for &quot;Diagnosis&quot;.Medical science at the beginning of the thrid millenieum is still in it's infancy. Any one who has witnessed a loved one slowly die from a cancer that cannot be found until it is too late or someone who slowly deteriorates from &quot;uknown&quot; causes can identify with the inaccuracy and undependability of the modern day doctoring profession.We watch too many miracle cures on television and hear too much hype from medical professionals. Our hopes are high that any malady can be cured. Doctors are very good at some things: setting broken bones, diagnosing common viruses, relieving pain from injuries. And doctors are well meaning and optomistic for the most part, perhaps too much so -- optimism that is galloping far ahead of the actual applied science. That is the theme of &quot;Diagnosis&quot;.My problem with the book is not in it's theme, I wholeheartedly agree with that. It is the progression of the book, very detailed in the beginning, then skipping fowrard faster and faster. Unfortunately, as the pace quickens nothing else changes. There is no progress to the theme, no progress for the character in the book, no advancement of a new thought or idea. Both character and reader are caught in a web. Perhaps the author himself could not figure out how to save his character, he would not be the first to fall into that trap. There is no resolution, no enlightened moment, no epiphany here.In the end I hoped Lightman would give us something: a fresh idea, a new approach, something to give us hope, something to grasp on to. Alas, he just sets us adrift with nothing."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"I was extremely bored by this book and had to make serious efforts to finish it.

But having said that, I can't say I understand what the book was trying to say. The inclusion of the fictional segment on the death of Socrates, while fascinating, seemed like a non-sequitor. Obviously, there was a father/son tension between the Athenian father and son, as in the main character's relationship with his son, but the pairs of relationships were not parallel, by any means. Also, I wanted to know what really happened to this contemporary character. And what would happen to him. Maybe I like &quot;happy&quot; endings, or just &quot;endings&quot;. This one left me troubled and uncertain about what the previous 3 hours of reading all boiled down to. As for humor,...well, I didn't find much humor in the tale. Just horror and tragedy for all the characters, except maybe for Socrates, who was the only serene character depicted."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"I have read &quot;Einstein's Dreams&quot; many times, often recommending it to friends with short attention spans. I read &quot;Good Benito&quot; more than once, also. Lightman struck me as a powerful storyteller; his colorful use of imagery, movement and time painted a nice, full picture. I was disappointed with &quot;The Dianosis&quot;. I never said Lightman had a way with character development, but in the other books there were ideas and philosophizing enough to entertain. This book was just boring--I think it could have been written 100 pages lighter."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"I guess I'm surprised if people don't understand the rampant symbolism of this book. Bombarded by the processing of information, Bill Chalmers shuts down. Granted, The Diagnosis is not nearly that simple, but Lightman's moralizing is pretty clear and direct. His use of e-mail, the Socrates sub-plot, and other device are fine with me. They add to the pacing of the story and don't necessarily detract from it unless you don't believe that people type poorly in e-mails. These aren't the things that made me give The Diagnosis only two stars. Instead, during the course of the book, I found I just wasn't moved by too much of it. The opening sequence is strong and engaging and there are other scenes -- when Chalmers' old friend comes to visit and describes photos he's brought -- that are emotionally engaging. Otherwise, I just wasn't compelled to care. The supporting characters -- his wife, the doctors, the attorneys, even his son -- were transparent and not only were they selfish and uncaring, but they were badly written as well.The conclusion -- or lack of -- is not surprising. By the time it comes along, the reader has a pretty good idea where it's going. The need for finality and closure is unnecessary.Overall, I don't have a lot of gripes with this book. I like the idea, I like the style, I even like a lot of the writing. I just don't like it the way Lightman put it all together. Maybe that was his intention -- to leave the reader with the same disquiet, unfulfilled feeling that Bill Chalmers experienced. Unfortunately, as the reader, I was never griped by the story and certainly never compelled by it."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book after reading a book review in a major newspaper. While originally taken with the story line, it degenerates into a story I couln't wait to be over. I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"Why anyone would rate this book as anything other than 5 stars is beyond my imagination. This book is a must-read for the soulful, thinking mind. What a talented and gifted author is Mr. Lightman, who wrote a book that reminded me of Rabbit Redux meets The Metamorphosis. The Diagnosis has everything necessary to make this a Classic to be taught in classrooms 100 years from now."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"This was a great book. It deals with modern mans adventures within the confines of a crazy world. It is about KNOWING THY SELF and leading a Good life. What is real and what is not. The effect of materialism on our lives. Sickness and decay. The link with Sokrates was excellent.Wonderful book, which I would recommend to a friend."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"The Diagnosis by Alan Lightman is a captivating book that I a perfect example of one of the best story-writing techniques; throughout the book, right up to the ultimate pages, the reader has no real idea what the main character is going to do, or what the author is going to make him do. A useful tool that keeps the reader hinged onto the book, riding the edge of their seat, until the end and only then will they feel satisfied.The opening portion of the book features the main character, Bill Chalmers, a successful businessman in a successful company (as to what the company does, this is never revealed but only hinted at, an interesting side point in this age where dotcom companies come and go like boy boys), taking the train to work. As he passes from station to station, amnesia begins to set, until he comes to a point where he does not know who he or why he is on the train.This is the onset of some sickness that cannot be diagnosed by any kind of doctor, be they medical doctor or psychiatrists, hence the title. Throughout the book this sickness worsens, reducing thee main character to a helpless man in wheelchair, his job now long gone, his family falling apart, his life a complete disaster for which there is little hope.Near the book's conclusion some sense of revenge for the great travesties and cruelties wreaked upon Bill Chalmers is repaid, with a final understanding of what it is that is wrong with him, and getting back at the people from his enigmatic business who fired him for below acceptable performance, even though they knew he was sick.Surrounding Chalmers are a handful of strong characters: family, doctors, friends, and a lawyer, each with their own unique intricacies that make the book on the whole a very entertaining reading.Originally published on February 12 2001 Alex C.

Lightman gets a one for characters and story, but a five for sheer writing prowess. This is a completely schizophrenic work. On one hand it is rivoting with his use of language and his ability to create mind bending visual images. This brilliance is juxtaposed to an inexcusible storyline and structure. None of the characters are sympathetic or likable, the direction is lamentably predictable, and there is no resolution. Cassandra was blessed with clear prophecy but cursed in that no one would believe her. Similarly Lightman has the writing skills of a Steven Crane but the story development of a made-for-TV screen writer. I realize that redemption is not the goal of all novels, but some crumb must be thrown to the patient reader. A morose story can have it's place, but I don't see that to be the case here. There is no larger lesson or deeper insight to be had between the covers. I would recommend this book for anyone who loves great writing while warning off those in search of a page-turning plot or a uplifting moral."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"I didn't like this book on several levels: the texture of the prose, the tactics of storytelling, the dropping of threads of character and incident, and the final failure of resolution.If the reader is not in a great hurry, the first sentence will start an itch that subsequent ones never do scratch: \\"People must have been in a great hurry, for no one noticed anything wrong with Bill Chalmers as he dashed from his automobile one fine summer morning.\\" Well, the fact is, there was nothing to notice. Bill Chalmers looked and acted as normal as all the other cell-phoning and stressed-out commuters. The fact that he subsequently lost his mind is not forshadowed in his appearance or behavior.This would be an ungenerous quibble if it were not lamentably representative of failures throughout the book-local non-starters like the first sentence, or larger problems like characters with incomprehensible motives or with no particular relation to what seems to be the story, up to such overarching issues as the whole point of the thing.Now, I'm not one of those practical souls who insists that fiction must teach or warn. By the point of the story, I guess I mean the arc of drama and character that the reader comes to care about and wants to follow. I recognize that a legitimate aim of fiction these days is to experiment with the form by dashing certain of the reader's expectations. Could this novel be one of those experimental works? Could it be that what looks like poor technique here is actually supreme control in the service of ironical meta-fiction?Not.I must say, though, that certain sections were much more compelling than others. In particular, the Greek \\"lessons\\", which formed a story-within-a-story, invoked atmosphere and summoned character noticeably better than did the writing in the main story. (Though there were scenes in the main story that were well-drawn, too, such as the Bingo game, or Petrov's waiting room.) But even here, in this smaller, simpler tale, the point of the action got lost. (Why did the assassin look into the third cell on the right? Who killed him in Socrates' cell? Why was the Megarian around at all?) More disturbing than that, though, was that the point of the whole Greek side of the narrative never became clear.Anyway, I read the book aloud, in concert with my wife, over a period of two weeks or so. Perhaps it has a better narrative flow at a faster pace, and so I'm being unfair and picky. And perhaps I'm missing clear clues that bring the narrative into focus. Perhaps."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"Let me admit a few things up front. First, I have enjoyed all of Mr. Lightman's fiction. Second, I was prepared to love this book - I was waiting to savor every page. Third, when I did read this for the first time, I was disappointed. But, the book wouldn't leave me alone.Months after reading it, I found it would slowly surface in my mind, when I was listening to music or riding on a train. Characters and phrases kept spinning around me without any perceivable reason. I decided to read it again. This book needs, and deserves, to be read more than once.It is funny, and frightening. It is insightful, and sarcastic. I think that there are good reasons I did not enjoy it the first time through - chief among those being that I was too much like Bill Chalmers. I was clueless and scared, and wanted someone to connect the dots for me.I could give you some reasons and answers for this book. I could tell you why I think the various stories and characters relate to each other. But I don't want to - it would be cheating.Bottom line: this book is pretty cheap... Buy it. Read it now, then put it back on your shelf and try not to think about it. When it comes back to get you, read it again. I am glad this book wouldn't leave me alone."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"After a long absence, Alan Lightman returns with a new novel. Unfortunately, the two novels since the undeniably brilliant Einstein's Dreams have been stories of diminishing returns.This is a wonderful concept for a novel. Anyone who has ever felt very ill and not known the cause will sympathize with Bill Chalmers. Lightman does a credible job of conveying Chalmers' fear, especially during the initial attack of amnesia. After awhile, though, the story seems to go off track, offering a rather bland descent into job loss, lawsuit, and paralysis.I was also disappointed by two things in particular. The first I will frame as a question: Do real, educated people really misspell so obviously and often in their e-mails? If I received e-mails from my business associates and, particularly, my doctor with the number of typos that Lightman provides, I would find myself new associates.Secondly, I was disappointed in the presence of this &quot;dialogue of Plato&quot; in pieces recurring throughout the novel. This trend of telling a parallel story intertwined in the body of the main novel is one that I have seen a lot lately (Richard Powers' and Margaret Atwood's most recent novels spring to mind) and, generally, it has not been used very effectively, in my opinion. Certainly, the story of Anytus offers almost nothing to the story of Chalmers. I don't understand its presence here.Despite this, the novel is a quick read and not an unpleasant way to spend an afternoon; however, there are many other novels I'd choose before this one."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"As is often the case with writers of the magnitude of Alan Lightman who set a benchmark such as his &quot;Einstein's Dreams&quot; early in their writing career, subsequent novels are placed under such intense dissection that they can fall by the wayside, establishing the author as a &quot;one note song&quot; man. Reviews that disparage &quot;The Diagnosis&quot; can prevent many readers from the pleasures (?) to be found in this book.Lightman has chosen a theme that is terrifyingly real in 2001: what happens to the cloned automatons that have been produced by this age of information? The main character starts out as being very familiar to us all - a man driven by exacting time frames, scheduled advances in a competitive career involving computer inormation, depersonalization to the point of communicating with his son by email, subject to his wife's infidelity via an online romance. In his highspeed race to continue competing he suddenly confronts nature in the form of a mugging with resultant amnesia and deterioration of his nervous system (his prior overactive network of neurotic adaptation) and gradually the complete deterioration of his physical body. Forced to confront all the demons created by his parental Information Age Wizardry (organized Healthplans, physicians who realte to computer screens rather than the patient, colleagues who are quick to point out his diminished productivity, etc.), he liquifies into an angry helpless drooling and empty man. His only real conection to the son he &quot;loves&quot; is via an email pirating of a Plato Online course.This is a sad but too true evaluation of where we happen to find ourselves in this cold, distant world of instant information and gratification. Lightman writes beautifully and many pages of this novel read with fine poetic perception. But the main reason to read this excellent book is to become aware of just how much damage we have done to our spiritual life - before we each step into the shoes of Lightman's characters. Sobering and insightful."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"Mr. Lightman has created an amazing portrait of modern day life. How many numbers, statistics, details does Bill Chalmers have to deal with on the first two pages of the book alone? If you haven't realized it yet, there is something wonderful in this book that people react to. Bill Chalmers is Martin Dressler in the information age. He is me (you?) on every bad day in the office. He's everyone on a cellphone on the 7:49 am train. Did you ever feel like a 60 watt lightbulb being fed 120 watts of power all day every day? If you've ever wondered about what the consequences of that could be, buy and read this book.I left off the 5th star because of the vagueness of detail that sometimes got in my way. As some have mentioned, sometimes I just wasn't getting the reason for the Greek storyline. I think I do now, but still I'm not completely convinced. And I really still don't understand what it is Plymouth (Bill's company) does. And well, yes, frankly, it's a bit too much like American Beauty. Granted, that doesn't mean this is less of a work on its own merits, but that is something off with regard to uniqueness.Buy this book, and buy Einstein's Dreams, too."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"&quot;Einstein's Dreams&quot; counts as my most beloved and cherished work of modern literature. But Lightman really let me down with this last book. The charm and joy in his previous conceptual and intellectual play is completely lacking. The joyful scientist has become a modern cynic and this I could have certainly lived without. There is no joy in &quot;The Diagnosis&quot; and if Lightman's statement in this work has any accuracy on the current state of the modern world, then by his own premise the book should have remained unwritten. I did not throw my copy out the car window when I completed reading it, but I was sorely tempted and truly very angry that I had spend the time reading it. Spend a &quot;Tuesday with Morey,&quot; it is a much more fulfilling prescription than anything offered by &quot;Diagnois.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"You all know what The Diagnosis is about, so I'll keep myself from summarizing and cut right to the point: The Diagnosis, while (in my mind) certainly entertaining and involving enough to prompt the reader to finish, does not find its footing in being a good page-turner or thriller-style novel.The reason it is important, then, is its overall message, which I believe most of us are aware of already. However, Lightman's writing style so uniquely conveys the sense of chaos and meaninglessness, the \\"spiritual poverty\\", that confronts our society that I would recommend it to anyone who considers themselves humanistic or \\"spiritual\\", as well as aspiring professionals. This book forces you to consider where you stand in your own life and re-think your priorities. As a student halfway through college, it only helped to harden my resolve to do everything in my power not to end up the \\"Bill Chalmers\\" type, idly pursuing the so-called American Dream, and to search for more than mere money and material comfort in my life.I've noted on some of the other reviews posted here that a lot of my fellow readers didn't understand the point of the Socrates/Anytus interludes. While I agree that the life of Bill Chalmers somewhat paralleled the life of Anytus in terms of his relationship with his son, I think it is also crucial to realize the significance of the fact that Anytus was the person primarily responsible for the death of Socrates. Socrates, for those who don't know, was the \\"gadfly\\" of his city, and had the ability to prove to people that they had no real rational basis for their beliefs and values. He made people reconsider their priorities and examine themselves on a much deeper level, a talent which eventually made him a threat to his society. He had a real passion for people, it seems, which overrode all desires for fame, fortune, etc., and he did not fear death.So then, what is the point of these interludes? I believe that the execution of Socrates by Anytus' efforts mirrors that of Bill Chalmers' true \\"self\\" by his daily life in a society with little regard for people as human beings. I think this is what Lightman was really getting at...perhaps he should have devoted more time to Socrates and his teachings instead of simply focusing on his death. I am reminded of Mel Gibson's treatment of Jesus in The Passion."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"I agree with another reviewer who says this book started strong but then lost momentum. I finished it to keep my word, having told someone I would read it and share what I think ... which is the following: there is no resolution to the conflict (it is left hanging, abandoned); characters are not fully developed; and the juxtaposiiton of Anytus's story is more irritating than illuminating.The story could have been rendered more effectively as a novella. The theme, though compelling certainly in this information and computer age, becomes cloying by the end of the book. We get it, Mr. Lightman. Human health and personal interactions are more fragile, indeed, than man's creations to improve both. They flourish while we founder.What we don't get is the engaging storyline, the simple &quot;what's-going-to-happen-next&quot; delight in reading a story that entertains as it instructs, and reassures as it reveals. On this count, the novel fails committed readers who read on, faithfully, watching Bill Chalmers' mysterious condition deteriorate, undiagnosed. Then the book ends."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"I don't know about you, but I am often very concerned about the rapid technological progress taking place. It often seems that the technology is controlling us, rather than we who have control over it. Lightman's novel The Diagnosis deals with the effect of technology on modern man. He has created a frightening vision of a world that is more than slightly out of control and where humanity is being replaced with consumerism and a greedy, unsatiable need to devour ever more information. The novel begins with the protagonist, Bill Chalmers, taking the subway to work just as he does everyday. On his way to work, Bill (who works for an information processing company whose motto is, &quot;the most information in the least amount of time,&quot;) loses his memory. After riding back and forth through the entire subway route he takes off his clothes and lies naked in the fetal position on the subway car floor. The police arrive and lead him away. Bill then has some minor adventures in a hospital before escaping and finding himself in a church inhabited by bingo players. Within a short amount of time, he finds himself on the church stage, enclosed within a glass telephone-booth called 'the money box,' wherein winners of the bingo games go to try and collect as many falling $20 bills as they can before they are vacuumed out. While grabbing at the money, Bill has an epiphany and regains his memory. That, in a nutshell, is approximately the first third of the book. It is Kafka-esque in its brilliant and horrifying depiction of an aspect of modern society. Every page had me on the edge and put into characters and situations what I could only express through philosophy. It was very exciting. The latter two thirds, unfortunately, never moved me as forcefully as that first part. But, perhaps this is because of the power of the story itself. You see, during the rest of the book Bill becomes physically numb - he loses all sensation in his body. He is able to walk, to pick things up, even to type (albeit at a slower pace) but he can't feel anything. But, as this condition deteriorates, he begins to emotionally feel more. He becomes a metaphor for modern man's perpetually numb, spiritually vacuous internal condition and he is only able to recognize this condition when he loses bodily sensation. The irony is that as he becomes more reliant on his mind, he becomes less abstract and more desirous of feelings. Now, if the book was only about Bill Chalmers and his trials and tribulations it would be a very good and meaningful book. But it is much more than that. The subsidiary characters are his wife (who carries on an email affair while Bill is at work), his son (who locks himself in his room while hacking away at his computer or fantasizing about being a medieval knight), and a bevy of doctors who are unwilling to confirm any type of diagnosis on Bill's condition because there remain a litany of tests they can continue to perform. These characters add a dimension to the book which fleshes out a richer and, in many ways, more frightening picture of modern life than if Lightman had only stuck with Bill and the corporate world. But Lightman goes even a step further than this by including a third story within the novel - a fictionalized account of Socrates' death. This third part is perhaps the most intriguing part of the novel. What makes it interesting, and in many ways refreshingly novel, is that it is told from the perspective of Anytus, Socrates' chief persecutor in Plato's The Trial and Death of Socrates. Rather than giving away the sub-plot, I just pose the question - &quot;Is Bill Chalmers, the hyper-efficient modern man always in search of, and continually processing, new information, who loses his mind and then his body the equivalent of Socrates? Or, is Bill Chalmers the modern Anytus who has killed Socrates and is now suffering for this sin?&quot; I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a serious and well-written read. For those of you, like Mr. Chalmers, who are concerned with time, it took me about 10 hours or so to read this book."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"I'm sorry, but when I got to the last page, I closed the book and said outloud &quot;What a stupid book.&quot;The *only* reason I kept reading after the first chapter was to see if *something* --*anything* would happen. It just kept getting worse.I &quot;got it&quot; about today's society's information overload. But I guess I'm more optimistic than the author with the belief that very few people are as clueless and hopeless as the main character Chalmers.THe email typo swere excuruciatnigly annoyingand oh-so-unbelievable.And I, too, am completely at a loss as to the inclusion of the Anytus/Socrates storyline.I had absolutely no empathy or sympathy for any of the characters.What a waste of reading time."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"I have just copied and pasted another reviewer's comments word-for-word as they reflect most concisely exactly how I felt about this book: \\"After reading the book, I was left with a puzzled, confused emptiness. The theme and the meaning of the book were baffling. I finished reading the book only because I hoped to have resolution.but was disappointed.\\"That being said I found the initial chapters very absorbing, even so far as to recommend the book to a friend before I had gotten halfway through. As things progressed however, I found myself skimming (!) over complete pages of seemingly trite dialogue, feeling those pages were pointless and/or secure in the knowledge that I was missing absolutely nothing by doing so!I had never read Lightman before. Having 'discovered' him a decade or more after the rest of the world, I may work backwards and read 'Einstein,' but not before I've perused others' reviews.Meanwhile I may refresh my coffee and blow a few minutes exploring other readers' opinions (if any) on the book's mysterious outcome."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"The premise of the book sounded cool but I was disappointed overall. Technology is suffocating society ... the point was made but I found myself lacking much compassion for Bill. The book left me feeling, well, numb (and I suppose that was the whole point)."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"Listen to me carefully - this is nothing more than a piece of fiction. It isn't meant to be a chronicle of a real person. Don't become attached to the main character; he acts irrationally, and no matter how many times you yell at him throughout your reading, his fate is pre-determined.I'm still not sure if Lightman was trying to goof with us all, or if he was trying to provide more insight into the social anachronism that has become &quot;Angry White Guy.&quot; The story revolves around a lead character who, in the first ten pages, completely loses track of who he is, where he is going, and why he was going there. He experiences what is known as &quot;an episode&quot; to the psychological community - it passes after a truly horrific series of catastrophes that has the reader riveted to the book.By the time the reader gets to the subsequent chapters, you realize that our hero is not going to tell anyone the truth - the series of events is written off as a mugging - and as he continues (hopefully) back on his usual routine, subtle changes occur to his body. First, he loses feeling in his arm, then both arms, then his legs. He bounces like a pinball from physician to physician, psychiatrist to psychiatrist. And he never admits to anyone (perhaps even to himself?) the reality of the situation, the origins of the malady. As a result, he dodges a diagnosis of his problem.His long-suffering (some would argue further that she is also insufferable) wife and tragically affected son try to deal with the affliction as best they can. The wife's character can be dismissed as so much literary pocket lint - you know she's there, but you can easily ignore her with the rest of the story line. But the son is the sole figure with whom I found any empathy - he strives so hard to reach out to his father, to be off-handedly refused time and again. It's at these moments that you find yourself finding it more and more difficult to sympathize with Chalmers, the lead character. Yeah, I put the book down, shaking my head, wondering why I felt the need to continue reading.Lightman is a masterful puppetteer - yup, we're the puppets. By never revealign the diagnosis, and allowing the lead character to succumb to his own impotence with his family, we are trapped into reading the book through to the end. We hope for a satisfactory method in which our dear friend, the author, wraps it all up neatly, finds a cure, and saves the world, all in one punch. It just doesn't happen that way, though.I've seen this book compared to Kafka, but I would argue that it is more like a book by Kafka's contemporary, Thomas Mann. Take a look at the poetically written &quot;Magic Mountain&quot; - you'll see a lot of the same elements and frustration. If Lightman didn't write so well,I really would have let him have it on this review - particularly in his incessant demand in presenting atrocious mis-spellings throughout the many e-mails that haunt the book. I believe his intention was to show that everyone around us (as well as ourselves) are so rushed, we don't pay attention to even the ritualistcally simple task of spelling correctly (or proofing our work)."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"I too wish you could rate a book as 0.The plot was slow, boring, and never seemed to go anywhere but downhill.

And I suppose it would be wrong to say it's not.More accurately though, it is an indictment of people who use technology as a crutch to navigate the travails of everyday life, at the expense of interpersonal relationships. It is an indictment of people who believed that have only one course of action, when the fact is, they are too blind to see the other paths they might take.This is an amazing, moving novel, that offers great insight into our collective (flawed) state of mind at the dawn of the 21st century."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"In response to Tim Appelo's review. - Great Review, just to add:Bill's paralysis: (caused by) (smymptom?)His innability to do anything about his situation, his life, the speed car that got him to where is today.Also: Both Socrates and Bill were put in a &quot;Cage&quot;...(but an individual's mind can never be caged..)"},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"I fell in love with the writing of Alan Lightman upon reading A Modern Day Yankee in Connecticut Court.The Diagnosis is a delicious, darkly comedic, satire.You will find it easy to enjoy this book if...- you believe your worth as a person does not relate to your perceived corporate and/or financial worth- you are comfortable with your ability to feel and express emotion, particularly with your spouse/partner- you have ever waited in a doctor's office for over an hour- you enjoy metaphor (the numbness) and allegory (the story of Anytus)You may find it difficult to enjoy this book if...- your sense of self is dependent on your status within your corporation- the majority of your communication with your spouse/partner and offspring is done through e-mail- you frequently remodel your suburban home or otherwise usurp your spouse/partner's income for selfish pleasure- you are a medical professional without a sense of humor- you are looking for a light story with a happy ending"},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"&quot;SAY WHAT&quot;,I'm 58 years old and read one book a week.

Mr. Lightman is the exception. His characters in this book are unsympathetic and undeveloped.Yes, it's possible to conclude that Bill's decline is due to technological overload. It's also possible to conclude that it's due to just about anything else in the world.Lightman's premise that technology is dehumanizing us has merit. However, take the first step in asserting your humanity by not reading this book."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"This book and my comments may be a bit contradictory, however this book was strange as well. The novel had portions that were extremely clever, the majority of the work was well written, however taken in its entirety was pretty bland. There was enough to keep me reading but when finished I wished I had read something else. There were just enough interesting bits to string together the weaker portions, and that is what kept me plodding forward.I enjoyed the methods the Author employed to show the absurd results that come from the ability to communicate faster, and the exponentially expanding ability we have to create more information. We generate more answers, which increases the time to arrive at a result and delays conclusions, however if the pace is rapid enough and the data that is moved is massive enough, those involved feel it's justified. What it truly is, is absurd. The writer chose the practice of cutting edge medical diagnostics to take the idea of gathering information for its own sake to the ridiculous extreme. While in this book we never learn the fate of the primary character, the idea is implied that while the patient is waiting for the latest results from Star Wars technology, when they finally arrive the patient will be dead.I also enjoyed the implication that the more amazing the technology becomes, the more dependent its users are with the result their competence decreases, and their willingness to make a decision ends in paralysis. If a machine cannot give an answer then the answer does not exist. Specialists carry their own databases, and if there is no match, they exit with dispatch.I did not like the characters in this novel, as most were too pathetic. Even the character that should easily cultivate our sympathy is difficult to care for, as he is already a mess prior to encountering his true challenge. I also felt the link between the effects of drinking Hemlock for Socrates, as a counterpoint to Bill's illness was a stretch that did not work. Trying to rationalize a link between the sons through a similar method lacked any credibility.Some parts were good, but the premise being explored was a variation on a theme and not a new one. That perhaps is what kept this from being a terrific story."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"I must say that this is one of the most unentertaining books I have ever read. If you are looking for a good summer read, this is NOT it. While the author's observations regarding today's fast-paced, technology dependant society are amusing at first, they quickly grow tiresome and boring. How sad it is to read an entire novel and not care one iota about any of the characters. I kept waiting for the storyline to get interesting, for the plot to evolve, but nothing. This is one book which I was happy to finish and get on to something better."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"I love Alan Lightman. I thought that Einstein's Dreams was one of the great books of the last 25 years. I am unable to resist a writer who combines insight into science with charm and wit and grace in his writing.But why, o why, do great writers in one genre feel compelled to slip into another? It rarely works, and it doesn't work here.This is a well-written book, if good use of language is to be your guide. The words flow. But it doesn't hold together. Everyone is a caricature. The underlying theme is clear within a few pages after his episode, whatever it is, and the rest of the book belabors it, over and over and over. Yes, life is unfair. Yes, companies in business for profit won't tolerate non-performers. Yes, superficial spouses cannot be depended upon. Thank you. Message received. A short story about it would have been enough.Mr. Lightman, I will buy everything you write, forever, for I know what you can do. I jumped for joy when I saw a new book over your name. But please, please, go back to what you do best. Do not become a Tom Clancy."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"I received this book as a Christmas present and thoroughly enjoyed it. If you like Don DeLillo (White Noise), you'll love Lightman's new style. In contrast to the rarefied atmosphere of his highly successful Einstein's Dreams, Lightman's Diagnosis is pulsing with blood, sweat, tears and laughter. Long story short, this is a darkly humorous look at our modern predicament, a view that reminds us of the wisdom of that ancient philosopher, Socrates, who warned us that the unexamined life is hardly worth living. And so it is with the main character of the story, Bill Chalmers, whose desperate need for a proper diagnosis is thwarted by modern forces so common in our lives - office politics, urban inhumanity, suburban paranoia, and at every turn a technology that precludes with ubiquitous urgency any chance of our snatching a single moment for much needed contemplation. Overwhelmed by an environment of cell phones and the complex systems that make our modern lives possible, the main character temporarily loses his mind. By itself, the early scene of his going insane in the Boston subway is well worth the price of admission. The main character's own failings resonate with the failings of the very institutions that are in place, theoretically, to save his sanity - his doctors, his therapist, even man's best friend, his family's pedigree dog, nothing seems to provide much help. Only his young son seems to be reaching out with any real line back to life. By reading to his (by now) crippled father some scenes from the death of Socrates, the son provides the only clue to the source of his father's bizarre deterioration. Yet, despite his son's (unconscious?) efforts to impart some ancient wisdom, Bill Chalmers asymptotically approaches a platonic pinpoint in the backwater of his brain, a sense-less isolation, confinement to a bedroom bedazzled with strange artwork, shadowy images on the walls and floor. Can such a collapse lead to revelation, a look beyond the shadows of our modern cave? Can a paralysis of this sort lead to the self examination necessary for psychological salvation? Read Lightman's Diagnosis of our society and decide for yourself."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"Great book, belonging on your bookshelf between Saramago's &quot;Blindness&quot; and Kafka's &quot;The Trial&quot;; Camus and Kazantzakis should be close by. In Bill Chalmers'frenetic life -- and perplexing and progressively debilitating malady -- Lightman exquisitely captures the angst and paradoxical &quot;helplessness&quot; of modern society &quot;trapped&quot; in the Information Age. Those time-and-laborsaving techno-gizmos intended to liberate us have instead become our masters; plugged-in everywhere at all times, we're now on call 25 hours a day. And that's a problem. Nathaniel Arata's review above is dead-on. Don't read this book if you expect Lightman to answer every question or to spoon-feed you the answers. But that should come as no surprise to any reader. The book's title says it all. To &quot;diagnose,&quot; from the Greek, literally means &quot;to know apart&quot;, that is, to identify a problem, to name the nature or cause of a thing; it does not mean in any sense to identify a solution to the problem. Lightman, like his stand-in Socrates, continually probes and challenges, requiring the reader to re-think his or her answer time and again. He renders one zinger of a diagnosis along the way, in sharp, witty prose. For those wanting definitive resolution, maybe Lightman's next book will be entitled &quot;The Cure&quot;."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"This novel enlightened me, woke me up, and perplexed me. The title of the story apparently refers to Lightman's emotionally supressed and depressive &quot;diagnosis&quot; of our times. &quot;The Diagnosis&quot; is the &quot;modern&quot; story of an organization man suddenly confronted with humility, frailty and the truth of his world. The story is linear; the author sparkles with obviously clear insights into the feelings and attitudes of someone once in charge, who becomes dependent on others for his physical and spiritual well-being. What perplexed me was the interposed fictionalized story of Anytus, apparently one of the important, but deeply troubled, characters instrumental in Socrates' death sentence, and the death itself. While the Anytus story line paralleled the modern story, I didn't understand its purpose. Was it to show that life and lives haven't really changed? Was it to show what can happen when one makes a Faustian pact? The characters are well-drawn, particularly the protagonist. While the author's intention is an important one, I felt it to be too vague in the telling, especially because of the secondary story line."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"A busy junior executive first suffers flash amnesia and then progressively loses feeling in his body. While waiting for a diagnosis of his illness, his son reads Plato to him.This book is extremely uneven; very little \\"plot\\" actually happens, and the Plato \\"subplot\\" felt forced, contrived, and a bit pretentious. Curiously, that was the part of the book that held my interest the most! I didn't like the author's prose, but that's just me.Although another reviewer compares this book to Kafka's \\"The Metamorphosis\\", I think an equally apt analogy is \\"The Trial\\"... just substitute Joseph K's \\"crime\\" with this protagonist's \\"illness.\\" There is no real resolution in this novel, but I suspect there's not supposed to be; either way, I suspect a lot of readers will feel let down by the end... if they even stick it out to that point.Early on, I debated whether I wanted to keep reading this, but plowed through it due to a lack of anything else handy. Half way through, I was conscious I was reading this just to read it, which is NEVER a good sign."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"This is no trifle of a beach read -- it is a book with accessible language and a fairly enjoyable plot. However, though it has been well reviewed by critics, it has also confounded them. The book is about a man who has his nose to the grindstone at work. He faces pressures both from competitive workmates and the fast pace of technology including cell phones, e-mails, texts, etc. While on his way to work on the subway one morning, he forgets who he is and where he is going. After a surrealistic journey of sorts, he regains his memory only to lose his neurological faculties. The medical system is no help either. Rather than give a diagnosis or offer any real help, the doctors follow their own agendas. They show very little regard for his true needs; they make him jump through the hoops of the medical system offering no human connection or plausible help. He becomes paralyzed and eventually finds his only connection with the outside world is tracing the shadow a leaf throws on the floor. His friends and family are unsupportive, with the exception of his son. His son is a computer geek, a champion of his father's quest for a diagnosis, and a child ignored by both his parents.The reader is also shown the e-mails from an online philosophy course on Sokrates (sic) that his son takes. In this story, Sokrates is betrayed a jealous man who fears Sokrates is blaspheming the democratic ideas of the state by stirring up questioning of accepted principles. This man helps prosecute Sokrates leading to his death sentence. While Sokrates swallows his poison with grace, the betrayor's son tells his father that Sokrates has been drawing all over his prison cell, telling the story of the human soul. This man's son is disgusted by his father's disregard for the great philosopher -- and one gets the idea the man betrays Sokrates in great part out of jealousy (since his son has much more admiration for Sokrates than his own father).The big question that has been stumping most people is why the Sokrates story line fills up so much of the book. My best guess is that Lightman may be trying to draw a connection about man's lust for power and his love/hate relationship with progress. How can we move forward if it means we might be left behind? Will the process of keeping up destroy us in the end? In the main story line, our protagonist is a weak man who allows himself to be crushed by the fast pace world around him, preferring to miserably try to move up the office food chain than to find peace. In the end, he allows himself to weaken to the point of being paralyzed, blind, and near death. In Sokrates' case, though he is not weak himself, others around him are threatened by his potential power over the masses and make sure he is crushed. The father /son relationships in both story lines are complex. However, the juxtaposition may be Lightman's offering of hope for the futility otherwise demonstrated in this book. The way to address the pains of progress experienced by us or those around us, we would best be served in nurturing our relationship with our parents. Social progression will not come easily and we will easily be crushed unless we understand the handing of the torch from one generation to the next. If either father truly listened to or understood his son in these stories that make up the book, a great philosopher would have lived a lengthier life, and our protagonist may have been able to find enough light in human connection to understand how to maneuver around the suffocating information highway.There are some interesting allusions to Plato's Myth of the Cave. Both our undiagnosed protagonist and Sokrates are imprisoned, either by a neurologically void body or in a prison cell. They draw shadows of a leaf and shadows of the human soul. Our protagnoist holds on to his last true connection with the outside world -- nature. Sokrates expresses his connection to humanity by telling the story of its soul. I'm not sure if I can flesh out the whole Platonic Idea connection. Unfortunately, I'm not sure I want to work this hard.I would recommend this book to those interested in philosophy and those who are interested in books with big themes such as power and the human soul. It is not recommended for those who like clean, resolved endings.I found this book intriguing; it is probably an important book. It flows well and is fairly entertaining. Read it if you like a true mystery. I am mostly left scratching my head. It sort of reminds me of Cloud Atlas in that way."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"While this tale of a man reduced to minimal functioning by the meaninglessness of modern life is very well written, it leaves you wondering where redemption of any meaningful kind can be found. The net result is a sense of victimization and depression. Not sure why you'd want to read it. Knowing what I know now, I wouldn't."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"If you're having a really bad day and feel like kicking the dog when you get home, read this book instead. It will either make you realize how good your life is, or possibly depress you thoroughly. I haven't read Lightman's other books, but I doubt I'll give him another chance. Life is too short and there are too many other great books out there.The story can only be described as bleak. The only color in it is found in the mall (not one of the places in life that lifts my spirits). The only emotions that our character can mount are fear and anger. Actually, he does feel love on brief occasions, almost desperate love, for his son whom he cannot relate to. Bill, who narrates the story, is an executive in a consultating firm. He lives and breathes the electronic life. His colleagues and his wife are in a perpetual hurry, to be on their e-mails or to shop, almost reminiscent of the purposeless motion and lack of emotion of Dante's characters assigned to Purgatory. Bill's world is in constant motion, robotic and dispassionate. As Bill descends into his own purgatory, becoming more paralysed and always undiagnosed, he concludes that &quot;the perfect modern man was also a mall man.&quot; Yikes, get out the hemlock.Which brings us to the writing style. Lightman's character development has alot to say by its quick portrayal of two-dimensional (the third dimension being emotion and depth) men and women. I think he writes well, but I disliked his people so much as to be unable to praise his style. He also interjects the Greek story (less tragic than Bill's story) that Bill's son downloads in order to study the classics. I had trouble finding the contrasts or parallels I hoped would help me to like the book.As I mentioned before, there are way too many great books out there to spend time reading this one. If you're an optimist, you will probably be disappointed. Good luck."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"I gave up in the middle of this book. I'm oddly reluctant to do that with a book, but slogging through this one just wasn't worth it. No, people don't make that many typos in their emails, and even if they did, the typos here are a distracting device that misses its mark. It's true that Einstein's Dreams is exquisite, and that maybe people are harder on his lesser works. But acknowledging that doesn't make this a better book, nor does it dispel the downward trend in quality in Mr Lightman's novels."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"I didn't like this book at all. It didn't seem to go anywhere. I felt I was always on the verge of something that never arrived. And the whole greek part. Completely boring. And then the book just ends.Terrible."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"Like many of the reviewers, I was drawn to &quot;Diagnosis&quot; by my absolute enjoyment of the author's &quot;Einstein's Dreams.&quot; The latter was a philosophical tone poem or haiku; elegant in its simplicity and highly thought provoking. In fact, it is one of the few books that I spent considerably more time thinking about that I did reading. It read like condensed Calvino with a scientific twist.&quot;Diagnosis&quot; is an entirely different animal altogether. Bill Chalmers'world of &quot;maximum information in the minimum time&quot; is all too familiar to many of us who are trying to remain productive in a world in which we are drowning in the undifferentiated babble of information produced with the help of supposed productivity tools (laptop, cell phone, PDA, and who can tell the differences among any of them this week anyway?)Bill's life is a mess, with work, family and health deteriorating around him outside his plane of vision. And as he spirals downward, he is bombarded with useless, crippling information while the one piece of information he craves eludes him. A host of malignantly obfuscating characters lead Bill through his own circles of hell as he recedes farther and farther from the &quot;normal&quot; guy he once was.The reader does have to wade through some deep metaphoric mud at times. The Antyus/Socrates subplot seems to revolve around the theme that society destroys those who ask penetrating questions about its philosophical underpinnings. There are physical metaphors in the effects of the poison used for execution in ancient Athens and Bill's condition, but the links between the subplots could have been less obtuse.This is not a novel for those who seek happy endings or tidy summations. But one of the best things I can ever say about any work of art is that I found it emotionally engaging and intellectually stimulating. &quot;Diagnosis&quot; fit that bill."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"A poorly argued and heavy handed polemic in novel's clothing, with wooden characters and an obvious, plodding plot. It's clear that Lightman is trying to say something &quot;significant&quot; about the dehumanizating impact of technology, but it's all been said before, and better, by more talented writers and deeper thinkers. One expects more from this author, though there were in fact signs of decline in his second effort, the barely noticed &quot;Good Benito&quot;."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"Dedicated in memory of Bob Z, an Amazon reviewer.Bill Chalmers, a junior executive with a large firm in downtown Boston, jumps on the \\"T\\" at Alewife Station on his way to... Well, there you are, here he is on the MTA and can't remember where he is going and all he has memory of is the first 3 numbers of a telephone. Help......Bill finds himself going through extreme testing at the hands of physicians who will tell him a little bit of this and a little bit of that. What they are trying to find out is \\"The Diagnosis\\", \\"the determination of the existence of a disease or condition. Diagnosis generally involves the evaluation of a patient's medical history, clinical symptoms and laboratory test results.\\" Well, ok, the emergence of high technology and the multitude of tests that accompany any diagnosis. First, there was numbness and then the numbness turned suddenly to complete paralysis. What has happened? \\"I am not completely sure, what is going on here.\\" says one of the dcotors, \\"we need more tests\\". Test after Test reveals, well, a little bit but not enough to put any REAL diagnosis together. But, there are always more tests, and the granddaddy of them all the PET Scan. Whoopee!And what about Bill's life during all of these tests? What happens to his job? Well, it appears pretty obvious that Bill will never be able to return so there is a fast competition to see who will secure Bill's job! And, the wife, why she is involved in an internet romance with a professor she has never met. But it keeps her occupied and she needs a diversion. After all taking care of Bill is a lot of work. And, Alex, the son? Ales is busy emailing the various doctors involved in the case to try and figure out just what is going on with his dad. Friends, family, pop in from time to time and it becomes pretty obvious that Bill isn't going to be able to remain at home- why he is paralyzed and that kind of condition tends to wear you down and the family needs to move on. Another type of hospital would be recommended for Bill- the family would visit as would all the friends, and as soon as the doctors are finished all the tests and can come up with a diagnosis well, then everyone can move on.In the midst of this novel, Bill's son, Alex, starts reading to him galleys of a book about Sokrates and Anytus. Father and son. And how does this Greek story interplay with the Alex and Bill real life mystery? Aha, the brilliance of the writer Alan Lightman and his sometimes comic and tragic sequences of life will introduce a semblance of an answer.This novel was at once disturbing and fascinating. The emergence of high tech in medicine and the Diagnosis of a man and his disease. What hath we wrought?Highly recommended. prisrob"},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"This is a very important book. When 2100 comes along and people want to know what the turn of the century was like, this is the book that people will recommend. This book is at once funny, insightful and deeply moving. While a wonderful novel, it is essentailly a meditation on our obsession with knowing and the limits of knowing. While the characters are bombarded with information and information devices what is most important escapes them all. To underscore the tension between knowing and not knowing is the story of Anytus the Athenian general who desperately wants to kill Socrates, and succeeds. Socrates whose claim to wisdom was that he knew he did not know,was too dangerous to the youth of Athens and had to be destroyed. Anytus and his son were estranged. The characters in the main story are as well, yet they clumsily seem to love each other. I'm not sure they know this either. This book will make you think and think again."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"This book was extremely boring.

The theme and the meaning of the book were baffling.

From the main characters initial breakdown of forgetting who he is and where he's going, to his final drooling wheelchair-bound self, nothing escapes him as he's forced to watch the rest of the world go about it's daily routine and forsake taking part.Alan Lightman's ability to bring into sharp focus all of things we are required to remember, all the things we are supposed to do, and all the things that others consider a part of us. You're even given the idea that the main character's problem may all \\"be in his head.\\"When the wife asks \\"Why is this happening to me?\\" it's almost eerie in it's realism. It wasn't about his body failing him. It was the impact on her life.While the middle of the book does get a little overly long, I wouldn't trade it for anything. It makes the conclusion all the more fitting."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"Having read Lightman's &quot;Einstein's Dreams&quot; first and felt it was, perhaps, the best book I had ever read and then read Lightman's &quot;Good Benito&quot; and concluded it was among one of the worst books I ever read, I both expected and hoped that &quot;Diagnosis&quot; would be somewhere in the middle.This book does take its share of risks (as reflected by the wide array of reviews). For example, there is a parallel plot to the main plot that takes place in Ancient Greece (or, possibly, the main plot IS in Ancient Greece and the contemporary story is merely the parallel plot). In many analogous ways, this is like a sophisticated joke (or, perhaps, analogous to watching Dennis Miller commentary on Monday Night Football) in that if you get the whole parallel plot, you see that it is indeed a nice stroke of literature and quite well-done. However, if you do not get the parallel plot, it is like missing the punchline to a joke in that everything that preceeded doesn't make any sense and seems (as well as amounts) to a waste of time.However, &quot;Diagnosis&quot; is also a book with flaws. Perhaps the most glaring is that the character of Bill Chalmers' wife (whose name is prtected to protect the innocent) is woefully developed. Lightman suffered similar difficulty developing the main female character in &quot;Good Benito.&quot;As a book, I would rate &quot;Diagnosis&quot; as a qualified success. Its strengths lie with the parallel plot and it wonderful depiction of Diagnosis-mania in this country. Its weaknesses are poorly developed characters and its stoggy plot development.I must also reaffirm a view expressed by a previous reviewer of this book that stated that the &quot;Kafka-esque&quot; First Chapter is perhaps one of the best chapters written this year."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"It could happen to anybody, anytime, anywhere. You take the same train to the office as you have done every working day for the past nine years. Then suddenly you lose it.Your mind becomes a blank. You cannot remember which stop to get off at, or even where you work. Then the panic attack starts. You begin to sweat, imagining all the other commuters are looking at you. Finally reduced to a gibbering, naked wreck crouched on the floor of the train carriage, you are escorted by police out of the station to the nearest psychiatric hospital.What happens next to Bill Chalmers, the protagonist of Alan Lightman's brilliant new novel, is even more frightening. Mistaken for a worthless vagrant headcase, he is subjected to illegal, invasive experiments, from which his brain emerges irreparably altered. He escapes, only to be mugged.Somehow he finds his way back home and picks up the pieces of his life, his experiences a fractured, elusive memory. Like Lester Burnham in the film American Beauty, Chalmers goes into free fall from society as he knows it. Unlike Burnham, he is not given a chance to re-invent himself.He has it all, or so he thinks: nice house in an affluent area of Boston, swish car, good job, loving family. But the price of his success means communicating with his son via e-mail - even when they are both home. It also means long hours at the office, which pushes his wife into a cyber love affair.The similarities to American Beauty don't end there, though Lightman adds an unusual twist by cleverly working into the story the fate of Greek philosopher Socrates, a paragon of virtue in a corrupt society. Chalmers loses his job as he degenerates physically and mentally, but comes to realise there is more to life than trying to live the dream.This is a dark story about the erosion of moral values and the high cost individuals pay for information overload in the workplace today. Erudite and philosophical, Lightman is also a skilful storyteller who captures the reader's attention from the opening paragraph. Provocative and challenging, The Diagnosis shows the fallibility of humans in the pursuit of greed and ambition.Socrates reasoned that to &quot;know thyself&quot; was the key to existence in society. For Bill Chalmers, it's a voyage of discovery that proves to be a tragedy waiting to happen."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"Lightman has been praised for using this novel to take a hard look at the technological dystopia that our world seems to increasingly resemble. Unfortunately, the look amounts to little more than a glance: Lightman doesn't make much of an effort to explore the ramifications of such a world. Rather, he presents a fairly straightforward narrative which is initially absorbing but eventually frustrating. It's like Kafka without heft, Orwell sans allegory.As for the fictionalized Dialogue by Plato, I think the Amazon.com reviewer had it right: &quot;I never did fully figure out exactly what the Socrates story and Bill's decline have to say about each other...&quot; That's because Lightman provides no real thread between the stories, leaving a rather large metaphoric gap for the reader to bridge. It's as if the author has excused himself from his *own* Dialogue in the face of truly difficult questions -- leaving both his characters and us none the wiser for it.According to Lightman, _The Diagnosis_ is: figure it out for yourself."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"I want to begin on a note of cynicism -- if, in fact, we live in a morally bankrupt society that becomes less intelligent each year, why is the market for highly-literate novels, plays and films about our corporate dystopia so sizeable? &quot;American Beauty&quot; was a surprise hit and it seems that every young novelist in America has been influenced by Don DeLillo. For all the talk about our smothering popular culture, we seem to have ample wriggle room to escape into intelligent critiques of that culture. Is it that we cultural elitists just want to tut-tut those who can't see through the most shallow features of our culture?I hold none of this against Alan Lightman or his fine book. &quot;The Diagnosis&quot; begins with, in my opinion, the best first chapter of the year, a Kafka-esque nightmare of lost identity amid technological chaos. From there, the book deftly changes tone several times, alternating between medical drama, corporate satire, domestic soap opera and philosophical treatise.&quot;The Diagnosis&quot; lives in the same moral universe as Don DeLillo's &quot;White Noise&quot; and even includes two veiled references (one would have been sufficient) to that book. It falls short of DeLillo's greatness because it lacks his humor and keen social insight. Lightman's anger at contemporary America is sometimes suffocating -- every character in the book becomes a victim of his wrath.But taken as a work of philosophy and a snapshot of our times, &quot;The Diagnosis&quot; is effective and (in a strange way) entertaining. Lightman gives no easy payoffs and is completely willing to leave his reader on a down note. But somewhere in this jungle of despair is a glimmer of hope ... if we can just see, feel and hear the real world beneath our virtual creation, there is salvation.Maybe we, the great anti-consumer consumers, are the hope. Even if we aren't, thinking so makes us feel good."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"Clearly, it is currently chic to &quot;like&quot; this book. The National Book Foundation had Lightman's latest up as a nominee for the 2000 National Book Award for fiction. I eagerly read THE DIAGNOSIS with great anticipation. I was again disappointed with the &quot;literary&quot; reviews from &quot;serious&quot; reviewers. This book is awful. Is there a kind way to put it?I am at a loss to find the &quot;brilliance&quot; in this novel. There are moments of intense description that show flashes of real talent. Maybe even a remarkable talent. But not near enough of them to salvage the plot, the characters - the book. E-mails (complete with headers) are used throughout the novel, this is an okay device, but the messages which (I guess) were to be more realistic with misspellings and typos were so ridiculous as to be obnoxious. If I received e-mails with typos like those depicted as &quot;normal&quot; in this book from MY attorney, MY physician, etc... I would clearly look elsewhere. Hasn't Mr. Lightman heard of spell check? Does he really think NOBODY uses it? I found this very distracting and it actually achieved the opposite by making the e-mails almost parodies and very unrealistic.The story rises and falls, rises and falls, ultimately going - nowhere. THE DIAGNOSIS is actually a collection of paragraphs, some of which were actually penned with great skill. However, this book goes nowhere. Literally, nowhere. I am trying to write this ever so carefully as to not give anything away but I am now thinking, what could I possibly give away? There's certainly no suspense, no characters that you invest your emotions in, and in the end, you'll be glad you didn't try to get too close. It is one thing for a novel to not have a resolution, I can accept that (and do all the time). What I cannot understand from a book nominated for a National Book Award is a story with not only no resolution, but one with no resolutions of its dozen or more sub-plots. None of which ever really developed and of those that kept me mildly curious - no resolution! What was the purpose?I think about having read some truly great novels (Of Human Bondage, Look Homeward Angel, even On The Road!) and then think back on this book and wonder what Somerset Maugham, especially, would have said about such a novel being recognized as a National Book Award nominee. I can only imagine. It is a bit frightning to me actually to think this is being considered great fiction by some. Are we entering another one of those periods where writers have to write something off-the-wall, breaking all the rules, using cheap device tricks to get noticed, while writing truly poor stories? And then have the publishing house hype it so that reviewers are afraid to be considered fogeys if they don't at least *pretend* they loved it?Summed up: This book belongs on remainder tables, not in lights as a National Book Award nominee. Harsh? I know. But my gosh, THE DIAGNOSIS is awful."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"The reviews of this novel have seemed mixed, and that caused me to re-analyze the book prior to writing a review. My initial reaction to The Diagnosis was very positive -- I found the characters were very realistic depictions of the classes of people we see every day. The fictional dialogue of Plato, evidently causes most readers to search for some connection to Bill and his story. I think the connection is there (esp. in the relationships between fathers and sons), but the more important point seems to be the very ambition of Lightman to attempt a connection.In rethinking the book, I began to imagine that this novel was being read by someone in the year 2020. From that perspective, how would it be viewed? It seems that as an allegorical tale that ties the problems of the present to the lessons of the past, there is some significant substance here. The reader of 20 years from now would probably wonder why so much time was spent on useless email (since they will only have useful email in the future, I am sure) and why no accurate diagnosis could ever be found. Surely, then, it is all metaphor and there is no diagnosis for what afflicts us as a society now -- for we are in the middle of it and don't have the perspective of time or distance yet.My bottom line is that The Diagnosis is worth reading now, and may be worth even more to your children."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"It's amusing to see so many reviewers harping on the lack of resolution in Lightman's new novel as well as the author's ample use of misspelled e-mails and the Socrates/Anytus sub-plot. &quot;The Diagnosis&quot; is not a conventional novel (i.e. one in which all things culminate in a Aesop-like moral). Nor is Lightman's style meant to sketch a literal picture of our times. The details are there, to be sure, but they are laid out as impressions, not clinical descriptions. Thus, the horribly misspelled e-mails symbolize (a key word here) the rushed and reckless nature of modern communication, the Anytus sub-plot functions to propose questions, not answer them (a successful embodiment of the Socratic method), and the non-resolutions are meant to provoke further thought. Some readers seem to completely by-pass the novel's intention in a frantic search for the information buried in Lightman's novel. In a very real sense, they are committing the same crime as the protagonist himself. The Socrates of Plato's &quot;Republic&quot; rarely supplies answers. Instead, he poses penetrating questions that are meant to arouse further contemplation. Lightman does the same here. His book is one long (but entertaining) Socratic question: &quot;If a man is stripped of all his external points of reference, than what is left?&quot; It is a question we Bill Chalmers of the world would be well served by pondering."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"I had the same feelings reading the Diagnosis that I had reading Alice in Wonderland...wonderful, scary, funny, improbabale...but at the same time totally possible. Bill Chalmers gets on the commuter train in Boston and soon finds he doesn't know his destination or the seventh digit of his phone number. Horrible things happen as he falls down his rabbit hole. I was swept up in this novel and kept thinking about how fried my own brain becomes from information overload, and trying to do too many things at once. Bill's son's addiction to the internet is something I see in me and most of my friends. Alan Lightman is a Kafka for 2000. When you finish reading the Diagnosis, and you should read the Diagnosis, read or re-read, Thoreau...we all need to relax."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"This is a novel about the numbing our of lives. What is our disease? We don't know. What is the cure? There is no cure.Is this the price we pay for the guilt we feel for never being man enough? How is it that we fail in the midst of success? We are sick, but what is the disease? What is the diagnosis? Where is the pain? It is not physical. We feel it in our minds and in our souls. We are tired, weary. We know the prognosis--it is death, of course--but what is the cause?In this tortured com&eacute;die noire, Professsor Alan Lightman gives us his vision of the materialistic horror that is our lives, the information and subsistence overload that is suffocating us to death. Bill Chalmers, second level management cog, begins to unravel. First his memory goes, and then is recovered, but then the numbness sets in, in his fingers, his legs. And it advances. We watch as he fills up with bile, bile, everything is bile.We are angry, but like Bill Chalmers we cannot lash out. We are married to the corporation, as Chalmers is to Plymouth where he &quot;processes information.&quot; We do not learn that he does anything more specific. It doesn't matter what the information is. He processes it. The company's motto is &quot;The maximum information in the minimum time.&quot; The vagueness of the content of their information mirrors the emptiness of our lives. More information for what? Faster for what? To what end? We do not know.The doctors, who would diagnosis us, Lightman assures us, are like gleeful clowns in their vast ignorance, playing with their high tech toys, a cyclotron for PET scans, a &quot;cell separator...like a portable washing machine...,&quot; spinning dials and writing articles for the Annals of Psychosomatic Disease, comparing notes with colleagues over the Internet, by cell phone. Meanwhile the patient is but a curiosity, a subject for examination and study.Lightman uses the empty dialogue of our lives for comedic effect. We say nothing to one another and we answer with nothing, although sometimes we cry out, and life goes on. Chalmers's wife is numbing herself with alcohol while she conducts a bloodless affair by e-mail. Like Chalmers and his wife, we are estranged from life itself. &quot;He hated the mall the same way he hated himself, except that he hated himself more because he was a part of the mall and he knew it&quot; (pp. 343-344). Yes, the mall and our vast hunger to consume are symptoms of our disease.Chalmers is angry (as his shrink Dr. Kripke so astutely discerns, although that is all he discerns). Chalmers cries out in his mind: &quot;I'm going to break every machine on this planet...I'm going to rip the phones out of the wall&quot; (p. 303, no exclamation marks). But he never has and he never will, and that is &quot;the problem&quot; that has become &quot;an illness.&quot;How real is Lightman's &quot;diagnosis&quot; of our society? Consider this, the fastest growing class of disease in this country is autoimmune disease, e.g., rheumatoid arthritis, chronic fatigue syndrome, fibromyalgia, etc., diseases of unclear cause in which the body is apparently assaulting itself. (Compare Lightman's delineation on p. 274).Juxtaposed among the pages is a tale of the last days of Socrates and of one of the men who condemned him. Somehow Anytus, the ancient Greek, and Chalmers, the American, are brothers in their strange failure amid the trappings of worldly success. Anytus killed Socrates, the flower of Grecian civilization. Chalmers is killing himself. Why? Again, they do not know. We have a stupendous wealth of information, but all of it is useless, as Mrs. Stumm, the wife of one of the information executives, tells Chalmers as she waves a hand at a stack of papers, &quot;What is this crap?...Useless. This stuff is useless.&quot; (p. 255). She speaks the truth, but they cannot hear it.Lightman's art owes something to the imagination of Dalton Trumbo's Johnny Got His Gun, in the latter chapters, and something to the spirit of Joseph Heller's Catch-22 throughout. There are shades and echos of the black humor of Evelyn Waugh and Nathanael West. This is a fine novel with a strong sense of the spiritual emptiness of our corporate existence. One senses that Lightman feels that in love there is a flicker of hope, but that is all. The mind goes, like the mind of Chalmers's mother, and with it, the possibility of love. Or perhaps there is a moment of redemption in the intense experience of the minutia of our lives, as when Chalmers studies and lovingly draws the leaf he sees outside his bedroom window.Only this and nothing more interrupts the bleak and lonely landscape of Lightman's vision."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"The opening chapter is frightening and compelling, but beyond that it was, for me, a tough read. The author doesn't seem to have much sympathy for any of his characters. I didn't either. The wife, Melissa, seems real if not appealing and the son is appealing but not very real. Bill seems to have no personality, no inner drive except to keep going, no moral center, no core of any sort. Is that the point? In my experience most victims of modern society, business, technology, whatever, have a stronger core (often badly flawed) than Bill. Bill doesn't seem to like his meaningless job, but that hardly differentiates him from millions of others and hardly makes him sympathetic. I felt as if I were watching a robot melt down -- fascinating in its way but hardly the subject of great fiction. My curiosity in finding out Bill's ultimate fate was more idle than fueled by any interest in Bill. I really don't think you need to suffer a debilitating illness to figure out that your life is dull and silly.I got tired of reading his e-mails long before he did, and I guess his high-powered business colleagues had not discovered spell checking -- the misspellings were irritating and a stupid device (to indicate what?).I actually found the Plato material far more interesting than Bill's story but found only superficial parallels with the main story. It's a relatively short book, but it took me forever to get through it.Maybe it's time to call a halt to fiction based on &quot;life in modern society is hell and technology rules.&quot; It is and it does, but been there, read that.Well written, I must say."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"I was very disappointed by this novel. While the concept behind it is important and timely, Mr. Lightman's writing is uneven and careless - something I would never have expected from the author of the beautifully written \\"Einstein's Dreams.\\"The effort required to stay with this story of a man being compressed out of existence by materialistic, yuppie values was almost too much. A major source of irritation was the 50+ emails Lightman has used. Why he includes the full text of every email, including all the extraneous header information, is a bit of a puzzle. It strikes me as the type of thing a student would do when trying to pump up the word count in an essay they don't want to write. Worse, perhaps, the emails are full of typos and misspellings regardless of whether they are from the main character's young son, a company CEO or a specialist in neurological disorders. If this was meant as a sarcastic commentary on the absence of quality in our modern, interpersonal skills, 2 or 3 examples would have sufficed. By the 10th (or 50th) example, it is the quality of the book itself that becomes questionable.As for the overall quality of the book, Lightman's writing displays a surprising lack of care from the very first page. No matter where you are in the book, you're never more than a page or two away from some indication of Lightman's inability to identify with his characters or the situations he places them in. Lightman's description of how the main character is affected by the mysterious ailment afflicting him (going completely numb, beginning with the hands and feet) constantly stretches credibility. There are too many points in the story in which you've just been told that the main character has lost all feeling in some extremity only to find him using it a few pages later. Can you imagine using a computer keyboard if you had no feeling in your hands? Or walking around on completely numb feet?Of course, this is fiction, and you expect there might be moments where \\"realism\\" will be stretched to accommodate the story. So, maybe you can forgive walking on numb feet..., but the manner in which Lightman dispenses with realism does nothing for this story and, in the end, it leads me to conclude that he never really cared about any of it. How else can you explain things like a passage (one of many examples) in which the protagonist is driving in very slow, bumper-to-bumper traffic, has to slam on the brakes and is thrown against the dashboard? That he would be \\"thrown\\" at all is stretching things, but even so, how could Lightman have imagined this without realizing that the character wouldn't hit the dashboard but the steering wheel?In a rather ironic sense, buying and reading this book will make you guilty of perpetuating the social illness Mr. Lightman is attempting to expose: spending time and money on things that lack true quality and satisfy no needs of the human heart."},{"Title":"The Diagnosis","review":"I wish I could rate this with ZERO stars! What a waste of paper! To say nothing of what a waste of my time. Why did I read all the way thru?

Ronnie is an awesome individual and if you want a chance to get away from all the \\"[stuff]\\" on television these days, this is a book for you. The man born blind in poverty in the mountains of N. Carolina, disowned by his mother because she thought his blindness was a curse from God, raised by poor but loving grandparents, sent to the State School for the Blind on welfare, turned out to have the IQ on the genius level. Ronnie tells of how fascinated he was the first time he experienced a commode when he was about 6 years old. Now his home probably not only has 7 or 8 of them but probably has heated seats as well.

His prosperous life proves in America that any dream is achievable. But his Cinderella-caliber transformation was not merely professional. Dismayed that her baby was blind, Ronnie's disturbed mother abandoned him. He was raised primarily by his loving paternal grandparents although his well-intentioned yet somewhat hapless father was a constant presence in his life. Today he has been happily married for well over 30 years and is a doting grandfather when not out on tour entertaining his legions of fans.Attending a state-run high school for the blind, the talented youngster gained independence but was subjected to the unchecked discipline of certain thuggish teachers. In college he considered a career as an attorney, but wisely determined music was more his speed.In addition to the typical biographical data, Ronnie expounds on numerous subjects. Politically speaking, he expresses outrage over the Supreme Court decision (recent when this work was first published) legalizing flag burning. The conservative patriotic principles he advocates are a welcome change from the usual show biz liberal diatribes. That's just one of many stereotypes Ronnie Milsap's life has shattered."},{"Title":"Almost Like a Song","review":"This is the best biography I have ever read. What a hard life this man had.

It's amazing to me the lack of attention wonderful artists such as Ronnie Milsap and Johnny Cash, etc. are getting. If you can get your hands on a copy of this book, it is a MUST READ.

I loved the song Any day now\\" and it made me a fan. But when I heard that Marie Osmond was putting out a country record I started lisening to country. Born in Houston Texas. And my beloved grandmother always loved country I remember some song like snowbird and I was 5 and 6 years old. And loving Lynn Anderson and Donna Fargo. Were great memories for me. We left Houston in 71. I was going on 7 that year we moved to California where most of my memories as a chid I remember more. But in Texas I would lay on the floor buy the speakers. And sing along to the Country songs. I love pop and all diffent kinds of music my parents liked to listen to the 50's music because that was there era. But I liked rock and the blues and soul music and pop. I am glad she did not get stuck in one decade even if it was great. I liked it too and learned many 50's song's. Then Donny & Marie came on with there Varity show. And at my age alittle younger I fell in love with Marie Osmond. And heared her song \\"paper roses\\" I liked it but when I saw her that was it! And the Osmond Family with there great harmonies! When I heard Marie's \\"There's no stopping your heart\\" I fell for her again. But mister Milsap he has been my favorite male country singer. And he still is and he can do anything. I saw him in concert here in Vegas. It was only me who asked his son if he would autograph my 40 #1s cd.It was like I forgot he was blind I felt terrible but he is so talented. I didn't want the show to end his son was very nice and I was standing in front of my idol. Talk about nevous almost as bad as Marie but not quiet. But he signed it and it was like a line but I said Jerry he's blind! But boy I was happy! nobody else got Ronnie to sign there's. I was very lucky and of course I have almost all of his cd's I never get tired of listening to Mr Milsap. He is so great! love the way he blends his country with a flare of soul blues he truly to me is very talented more so than people who can see. and I admire him as well and always will. Your the the best Ronnie I always wanted to be a singer but to sing differnt types of music. And Ronnie Milsaps very rare to me the stevie wonder of country pop soul blues gospel ect... I have never written this much on anyone. Not even My Marie. But Ronnie is the best. He is diffent from all the rest and that's a great and rare thing. Ronnie I love your music and I just sent for your book \\"almost like a song\\" Great title for you. I heard of it awhile ago but thanks to the internet and reading about you in Ronnie Milsap 3.0. Reminded me again you are what I call a true legend in your own time! And always for me. Thank you for such great songs. And classics. Sure would love to meet you and talk for awhile and hear you sing. That voice it's gold what a talent you are. The music today it has changed to where anyone can sing. And they can't not to me!I hope we get back to more really good and greats like you. I hope. I can hardly find anything I like today before I could leave the music store with lots not any more. Keep singing for us and recording I pick your cd's up with out even looking at the songs or anything. And it used to be certain of other's. Stay healhty and take care of that voice! I wish radio would not discremnate beause people get older. It's crazy they don't think 40's, 50's, 60's ect. Don't by records! Or should I say cd's that because they don't give them any radio air play. It sad and needs to be changed we are missing out on a lot of great music. That's why today music is not good you hear the young only and that's fine. But give all ages a chance we are missing out. That's why mature people dont buy as many we need to hear all ages. You hear that radio dics jockeys we need better radio stations! Take care Ronnie and keep puttin out great music like you always have! Thank you your a treasure! Jerry Fuller....."},{"Title":"The Reproduction of Colour","review":"The author has an impressive array of initials after his name; he is, amongst other things, a Doctor of Science, a Member of the Imperial College, an Associate of the Royal College of Science, and a Fellow of the Royal Photographic Society as well as a Visiting Professor of Physiological Optics and of Colour Science, and a former Assistant Director of Research at Kodak. He has also been Chairman of the Colorimetry Committee of the International Commision on Illumination, and Chairman of the International Colour Association.First published in 1957 and now in its much enhanced 5th edition, The Reproduction of Colour is the most comprehensive single resource available. Two quotes from the preface to the 5th edition describe what it is about:&quot;The object (is to present) the fundamental principles of colour reproduction, whether by photography, television, or printing in the hopes that all those engaged in producing, selling, buying, or using colour pictures will be able to see the nature of the problems they encounter. Those who want a general statement on colour reproduction will find it in the first part, and those who want a more detailed discussion of any one application in which they are particularly interested (will find it) in the later parts.&quot;and&quot;The reproduction of colour involves physiology, psychology, physics, chemistry, and technology. presents complexities, (and) involves a wide variety of enterprises&quot;.Even though there are individuals skilled in processing and printing their own color film, and DTP bureaux had taken over some of the work of traditional printing houses, color reproduction was, until not so long ago, the province of technicians in the photographic, printing, and television industries, Now we have crossed the threshold of a new era in which a massive technology transfer is taking place, putting effective control over color into the hands of a much wider range of users. Even home users now have available to them very powerful tools that enable production of images that are, to the ordinary eye, indistinguishable from quality photographic prints.That brings with it a need to understand the technology of color reproduction, and the definitive text is Dr Hunt's book. I have rated it 10/10 because of the remarkably wide range of disciplines covered and its astounding technical depth.Without it most of the information presented would have to be gleaned from numerous other books, professional journals, and published papers. Further, one does not have to have a scientific background to gain some understanding of what is involved in the reproduction of color. The fields covered television, photography, and printing are becoming less discrete with the application of digital technology; those who use computerized systems for the reproduction of color images will find relevant information spread throughout most parts of this book.It is not a popular account, a color-for-cretins guide, or a how-to manual. This is a technical resource written in a style that makes it readable without diluting its professional integrity. Not all readers will need, or even want, to know the chemical structure of cyclic methylene magneta couplers, but may want information about the effects of signal processing on color reproduction. In what other recently published text would one find a comparison table of film speeds that includes the Weston system?The Reproduction of Colour should be in any library with holdings on technical subjects; professionals in DTP, printing, photolabs, television, and digital imaging should have it; and anyone teaching or studying graphic arts, computer science, photography, printing, or subjects related to television technology should be aware of this edition. A check of some large libraries suggests that librarians may think earlier editions are good enough, but new developments demand this latest edition. Teachers of science in sub-tertiary institutions may well find this a useful text for its practical application of science to topical real-life problems.The book is divided into parts: Fundamentals, Color Photography, Color Television, Color Printing, and Evaluating Color Appearance. Each chapter opens with an introduction that provides a succinct overview of the topic.Reviewed by Major Keary [majkeary@netspace.net.au]"},{"Title":"The Reproduction of Colour","review":"In my opinion, this is the best book on color photography that I have read. Of course, it covers other topics, but it devotes a substantial amount of text, graphs and formulas to that topic. In recent months, I have acquired a fair number of books on the subject of photography and color theory, some of them very formula-intensive and some descriptive and math-primitive; but this one stands head and shoulder above the rest in its effort to describe the fundamental principles.I bought this book primarily because I wanted to learn whether it is possible, and if it is, how to predict the RGB density values of negative film versus the CYM density of the photo enlarging filter. I believe that I have found my answers in this book. Yet I was also quite pleasantly surprised to learn a lot more about color photography and reproduction. As I was reading this book, many things to which I had had unanswered questions from reading those other books have fallen in their logical place.I would highly recommend this book for anyone interested in color photography and who wants to learn not only the practical aspects of it (i.e. the result and the practice) but also the \\"why\\" of it (i.e. its scientific and experimental fundamentals). You do, though, have to have some knowledge of linear algebra and chemistry, although I would not call this book math-intensive."},{"Title":"The Reproduction of Colour","review":"I purchased this book believing it was the definitive reference for understanding colour. Twenty years ago it might have been. But time has marched on, and this book is in danger of being left behind. Its treatment of colour technology prior to 1980 is superb, and since I wanted a good understanding of Kodachrome and its characteristics, I came away satisfied in that regard. However, parts of the book go into too much detail about technology that has passed its use-by-date, at the expense of incoming technologies.POOR EDITINGThe author is obviously an expert in film technology, having been the Assistant Director of Research with Kodak. Being an expert though, doesn't necessarily translate into being a good teacher - and poor editing doesn't help the situation. I came unstuck on page 6 and had to turn to Wikipedia before I could understand the Lippman Method. This is not an isolated example. Here are two others among many:P204: \\"If the maximum density of a slide is about 3.0, a fairly typical figure, and the luminance caused by ambient light is 3.0 log units less than the open-gate screen luminance at the same point (a figure representative of good projection conditions), then the minimum luminance for a black would be equal to twice that of the ambient luminance, or 0.3 log units above that corresponding to the maximum density of the film.\\" What Hunt is trying to say is something like this:\\"Assuming that the luminance of the deepest black on screen (in the absence of ambient light) is the same as the luminance at the same point caused by ambient light in the projection room, then the combined luminance will be doubled - an increase of 0.3 log units.\\"P300: \\"Assuming a visual resolution of 20 cycles per degree (objects of 1.5 minutes of arc in diameter visible), the eye cannot see detail finer than about 5 cycles per mm, so that the smallest object visible would be about 0.1 mm in diameter.\\" What he is trying to say is:\\"Assuming a visual resolution of 5 cycles per mm, the smallest object visible would be about 0.1 mm in diameter (half a cycle).\\"The latter example is one of many in the book that shows poor editing, in this case using two different units when one would suffice. Poor editing again shows its hand when \\"micro-meter\\" and \\"m\\" occur in the same sentence (p301), when \\"m\\" has already been introduced as a shorthand for \\"micro-meter\\". It looks clumsy and it is clumsy.MEDIOCRE PHOTOS & DIAGRAMSSome of the figures and photos require updating. Fig. 4.2 (p28) is poorly hand-drawn, and the photo on p38 has the look of a 1960's photo in a women's magazine. Poor-quality photos should not appear in a modern book on colour reproduction. They need updating. I wouldn't be surprised if the majority of the photos have been retained over several editions.TOO MUCH OF THE PAST; TOO LITTLE OF THE MODERNSections of the book are devoted to technology that is antiquated. It is, of course, important that such technology be documented, but how much space should be devoted to descriptions of old equipment when there is a dearth of explanation of modern equipment? As each new edition appears, it is probably desirable that some sections be retired, to be replaced by their modern equivalents. Here are some examples where there is too much emphasis on old equipment and not enough on the new:Pages 219-221: Densitometers (latest reference 1956). Included is this inaccuracy: \\"...the photocell produces an ac signal which is easier to amplify than a dc signal.\\" That may have been the case in the 1950s; it hasn't been the case since the 1970s when IC op amps were introduced.Pages 264-270: A detailed description of 1950s equipment used for printing photos from colour negatives. In this chapter (\\"Printing Colour Negatives\\"), less than one page is devoted to digital printers (p274) and even that is woefully outdated. A reference to a LaserColor printer, for example, is dated 1979. No mention of mini-labs.Pages 450-453: Kodak's Photo CD receives more than three pages of detailed analysis. Unfortunately, Photo CD has gone the way of the dodo, replaced by Picture CD. I may be wrong, but aren't both now technological relics?Chapter 25 (\\"Pictures from Computers\\") can be summed up by noting that the latest reference in that chapter is 1985, with most dating from the 1960s and 70s. The numerous images in this chapter may have induced a \\"wow\\" factor in the mind of a mid-1980s reader, but in 2011 the images and descriptions are outdated.Similarly, Chapter 29 (\\"Colour Scanners\\") is at least 20 years out of date. What may have been modern-sounding in the 1980s (\\"The facility with which electrical signals can be manipulated to correspond to a wide variety of algebraic equations has led to the use, in graphic arts processes, of a number of devices known as scanners\\") comes across now as antiquated. The chapter gives a good rundown of scanners from the 1950s. Fine, if you want history, but of little use for a user in 2011 who wants to learn about colour theory as applied in modern devices. The images on p528 and 538-39, clearly show the age of this chapter; the latter showing as much good taste as a novice let loose with corny Photoshop filters.Talking about Photoshop: not one mention. I'm not suggesting that this book become a tutorial on Photoshop, but given that every organisation involved in colour reproduction now uses Photoshop to some degree, its non-appearance is further indication of how this book is becoming outdated. I was looking forward to reading the history behind Photoshop's \\"Unsharp Mask\\" (a sharpening tool). Unsharp Masks are explained (p247), but not how they relate to their digital equivalents. In a similar vein, I was fascinated by the technique used to obtain reasonable colour balance in the early photo-printing machines, a technique called \\"integrating to gray\\" (p265). No mention that a similar technique is available in digital image editors. Photoshop calls it \\"Auto Colour\\". History, in a book such as this, should be related to the present wherever possible.Chapter 10 (\\"Light Sources\\") has a healthy stack of information on the technicalities of light sources: their colour temperature and spectral response. However, the section on LEDs is inadequate. LEDs are likely to become the dominant form of lighting, and are increasingly used in photography and movies. This section should have contained a detailed examination of their strong and weak points. All Hunt offers is one paragraph, ending with this unhelpful comment in which he compares LEDs with traditional light sources: \\"even when red, green and blue LEDs... are used to produce white light, the spectral power is still markedly different.\\" No further explanation, no spectral response graphs. Disappointing, really.ON A POSITIVE NOTETo counter the above negative impressions, there is one overriding positive impression: Hunt is an acknowledged expert on film and colour. Those chapters where he deals primarily with the theory of colour and it's practical application in film are definitive. Problems arise when he strays from this area into other specialised fields such as television, modern scanners, digital cameras, and large digital printers. Two examples. First, the HP Indigo digital printer, which is making inroads into the offset printing business, receives a mention by name but with no detail. The Xerox iGen is not mentioned at all. A whole chapter is required to explain how these innovative printing solutions, and others like them, handle colour. Second, the very basis of digital cameras - the Bayer filter - although shown in a diagram (p368), is not mentioned by name. Which is surprising, given that the inventor, Bryce Bayer, worked for Kodak. Hunt surely must have known of him.SUMMARYThe Reproduction of Colour, first published in 1957 and now into its sixth edition, is in danger of becoming a dinosaur. Hunt may have to relinquish his sole authorship role and bring on board specialist writers to handle topics that are barely covered in this book: digital cameras and scanners; large digital printers that are competing with offset; LEDs for photographic lighting; flat-screen TVs that have now replaced CRT screens; DVD and Blu-Ray -- each of which has a serious role to play in our modern colourful lives, but which receive scant treatment here. Some of these technologies have matured since the book was printed, and this could be put forward as an argument in the book's defence. The malaise goes deeper than that - the evidence from the book itself points to a lack of skilled editing (making explanations clear, and knowing when to toss certain topics), a preponderance of explanations of technologies past their prime, and insufficient attention paid to emerging technologies. After six editions, the book is showing its age. It needs a major revamp and the input of new authors.Around 15% of this book covers either dead technology (those pages should be removed or significantly reduced in content, and replaced with sections on modern technology), or it covers its subject at a superficial level. If you want to learn about colour as it applies to film, there is probably not a finer book. However, if you come to this book (as I did) thinking you have purchased the definitive book about the reproduction of colour in a wide variety of modern devices, you will be disappointed."},{"Title":"A catalogue of sins: A contemporary examination of christian conscience,","review":"I loved this book so much. The most amazing part about this read was that it was written in the 1960s and the same truths were still the same today. I think this is a must read for anyone who calls themself a Christiain. It was excellent and calls all of us to be responsible for the good, bad, and ugly of who we are.

What is refreshing, along with his basic candor, is that despite his enormous success he retains a humble and highly humane touch.Some of the most humorous anecdotes of &quot;Name Above the Title&quot; involve madcap, always colorful Columbia boss Harry Cohn, who took his Gower Street studio from the ranks of &quot;Poverty Row&quot; to the that of a giant. Capra helped significantly with box office smashes such as &quot;It Happened One Night&quot;, &quot;Mr. Smith Goes to Washington&quot;,&quot;Lost Horizon&quot; and &quot;Meet John Doe.&quot; It took awhile, but the Capra film which has soared to top spot in the hearts and minds of the public was the 1946 release starring Jimmy Stewart, &quot;It's a Wonderful Life.&quot; The star was so enthused about the story that he pitched it personally to Capra after driving over to his house. Capra relates the time that he begged Cohn not to drop a struggling young cartoonist from the Columbia payroll, predicting that he would be sorry. Capra was right as the cartoonist was a young, meek Iowa farm boy named Walt Disney.One of Capra's great contributions was directing and producing the excellent World War Two documentary series &quot;Why We Fight.&quot; He tells about being called into the office of Army Chief of Staff, General George C. Marshall, who asked him to undertake the project. &quot;But I've never done a documentary!&quot; a surprised Capra replied. Marshall pointed out that he had never run an army before either, and that the American way during the critical war period was for citizens to learn jobs with which they were previously unfamiliar. Capra saw Marshall's logic and the rest is history.This autobiography is fascinating enough for the interesting information about Capra's life. What makes it even better is that you are reading the revelations of a good man who did his best to instill positive values into his films, and to help in his distinctive way to make America a better country."},{"Title":"The name above the title;: An autobiography","review":"I have never read such a fascinating auto-biogrophy. Frank Capra is not just a brillent directer, but a surprisingly good writer. Though it took him more then three years to write, THE NAME ABOVE THE TITLE was sure worth his time, and yours.The around six-hundred page book covers Capra's life from his childhood as a Sicilian imagrent living in Los Angles to his retirement from film in the early 1970's. Early on you discover how important family was to Mr.Capra, and the impact that his father, mother, and dozen brothers and sisters had on him. I was also surprised to learn that as a youth Frank loathed this country. The book goes on to tell about Franks work as a gage writer for silent films, and how when he first signed-on with Columbia, the studio was considerd a joke.There a number of major themes throughout the book, among them the importance of family and friends, patriotism, the changes in the Hollywood system, and the importance of a good storie. One thing I particularly enjoyed was to learn about the many diverse friends that Capra had, among them Russian-born composer Dimitri Tiomkin, space-telescope name-sack Erwin Hubble, and even Ted Gusile (better knowen as DR. Suess).This wonderful book is so many things, it is the storie of Capra's life, it is fifty years of Hollywood history, and the bible of Frank Capras philosophy on life. If you are interested in any of these things, then read this book."},{"Title":"The name above the title;: An autobiography","review":"This is not a Hollywood confession, it is not a self serving ego trip, it is solid autobiography. Frank Capra made it by himself, he endured poverty, humiliation, and disappointment. He had brains, artistic sensitivity, and a boundless store of energy. As the son of immigrants he was given nothing except a work ethic. He worked his way through Cal Tech and got an engineering degree. With little job opportunity after graduation, he bummed it for a while over the southwest. Then he landed a job writing gags for Mack Sennett. He grew from there by writing screenplay. Capra was at his creative best when portraying realistic themes. The next step was directing, where he carried his realism to the top. Early in his career, Capra saw the Academy Award as the sign of artistic excellence,and set out to win one. He poured every ounce of his creative energies into his films. On several occasions he knew he deserved an Oscar, only to be disappointed again. Then he made it with &quot;It Happened One Night.&quot; Yet to Capra everything went wrong in making the movie: the wrong leading man, the rewrites, the arguments, the mistakes, the frustrations, the last minute changes. Your first Oscar is your toughest. After that Oscars came naturally to Capra, and he won a bundle of them. Now his &quot;name was above the movie title&quot; on the marquee. The book chronicles the making of his best films, each more interesting than the last. But Capra was more than Holloywood. He stood for artistic integrity and decency. He was generous and willing to help others; he also had his ememies, and was large of ego. He gave unsparingly of himself during WWII as the officer in charge of making Allied training and propaganda films. There's more about this man, much more. Its worth every moment of your reading time. Next Christmas, when they run &quot;Its A Wonderful Life&quot; on TV again, I guarantee you will appreciate the film more than ever. I would recommend this book to film buffs, and lovers of history or biography."},{"Title":"The name above the title;: An autobiography","review":"To begin with, several adjectives to describe this wonderful book: 1.) candid, 2.) inspiring, 3.) poetic, 4.) instructional, 5.) spiritual, 6.) humanitarian, 7.) humorous, 8.) compassionate, 9.) courageous. From what I gather, it took Capra approximately three years to write this book, and what book it is. To be honest, this book is perhaps one of the best pieces of work we might ever have about the legendary director, the course of the twentieth century, and the people who have helped shape the film industry. This book demystifies the often deified directors, actors, moguls that ruled Hollywood during the golden age, reminding us of the universal bonds of humanity that link us all to each other. In many ways, it reads like a Frank Capra movie -- life-affirming to the end. For the younger generation (X'ers and Y'ers) who might question the values of their fathers' generation, this book is a must read. Underline this fact several times because when Capra takes you into his fold and shares his world, it is an experience you won't likely forget. Most history books seem to be written with a detached sense of objectivity from an supposedly impartial historian. The results of such labor is often an uninspiring book that keeps the reader at arm's length from the fascinating history, often boring the reader to no end. No so with Capra's autobiography. Capra reminds the reader that people are still simply people, no matter what generation, no matter which occupation. There are always going to be saints, martyrs, bullies, intellectuals, clowns, idiots in every walk of life. Such an example can be seen when Capra served in World War II and was privy to a touching moment with the great Admiral Nimitz. The old war hero had just come back from seeing three thousand men he had sent off to war -- some of them now without limbs, others without faces, yet all of them saluting him and thanking him from the bottom of their hearts. Nimitz broke down and wept, his shoulders so burdened by the sadness of his men's suffering. Hitting his desk over and over again the Admiral cursed the war with ever fiber in his being. After a brief moment to recompose himself Nimitz thanked Capra for being in the same room... allowing one tortured soul to connect and draw strength from another. Personally, it is easy to find yourself laughing when he laughs and crying when he cries. Like all classic works of literature, this book is so fresh in content, that it inspires the reader to look into his/her own heart and find the beating pulse of humanity and to take pride in the fact that one such as Capra was able to do so much through his films. I look forward to reading this book again and again. And perhaps, others will agree and do likewise."},{"Title":"The name above the title;: An autobiography","review":"I cannot figure out which is more amazing and inspiring: the man, his films, his life or his autobiography.Every autobiography will pale in comparison after you read this one.

Very entertaining but I have a hard time believing all of it. It reads just a bit too much like a Frank Capra film: all the characters are overly colorful and they all speak like...well, Frank Capra characters. I get a little wary when an author can recall complete conversations he had--fifty years prior--almost to the point where a person stuttered or mispronounced a word. He doesn't simply recount conversations, he actually quotes them all, in depth, with all added nuances, and seemingly verbatim. Really?"},{"Title":"The name above the title;: An autobiography","review":"I began reading this book almost by accident at a friend's house while I was house sitting and I haven't been able to put it down. Great book about the beginning of movies and all the changes that it went through. Focuses, obviously, on Frank Capra's career but since he knew so many people from the early days of movies I always find myself wondering who he is going to meet and talk about next. He is currently discussing the making of Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and Jimmy Stewart."},{"Title":"The name above the title;: An autobiography","review":"Frank Capra is an American icon. And so I devoured this book because I wanted to believe the man who made all those warm idealistic holiday movies was a softy at heart. But like many complex contradictory movieland success stories, his is the tale of a would be chemist who traveled to Northern CA and basically conned his way into a director's chair, parlayed it into comedy serial shorts and later stole the hearts of millions as the chief filmmaking brain trust behind Columbia Pictures.Moreover, while his cinema of the everyman celebrated the man in the street and the underdog, his elitist right wingnut politics betrayed his conscience and made him a sell out to the very same system he satirized in his early films. The best parts of the book reveal how he disproved \\"Capracorn\\" schmaltz-labeling critics, outlived rogue Columbia studio head Harry Cohn and retained his epic status in the pantheon of American cinema despite losing his family box office mojo by the early 1960s.This autobio reads like a behind the curtain confession of a classic film Wizard of Oz. Fame and fortune changed him and at least a third of the book is devoted to his political leanings and events and actions therein that helped him transition from directorial saint to Hollywood conservative snob. The irony of his controversial persona is that his body of work does not lessen his historical relevancy as the lensman who sold us good will each holiday season. If he never bought it, we did."},{"Title":"Seeds! Seeds! Seeds!

For those of us who knew him, Larry was anything but antisocial. He tried hard to please. I think the book depicted the case in very factual details. It's difficult to read even now many years after the incident."},{"Title":"Sudden Fury","review":"Not your typical whodunnit, Sudden Fury is one of the better true crime books I've read. It's an emotional whodunnit of sorts, a chilling account of a boy abandoned into the foster care system who grew up to be violent. I especially liked the alternating story lines--the present-tense crime investigation alternating with the child's upbringing. I found the writing style objective in a way that made it compelling. The tragedy, I felt, was heightened by the fact the adoptive parents were so well meaning, however misguided they may have been. I felt the author struck a delicate balance between blaming the adoptive parents, the boy and the social welfare system for the horrible outcome. While depressing, I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the psychology of violence."},{"Title":"Sudden Fury","review":"As is typical of many of the current trough of poorly written &quot;true crime&quot; books, Sudden Fury begins by almost immediately letting you know &quot;who done it&quot;. After that, it becomes just a dry recitation of the facts, including the background of the &quot;abused&quot; murderer. It leaves the reader wondering why she would bother writing a book when a simple magazine article could give almost as much factual information.Of course, in the author's view, the victims' requiring their adopted sons to make decent grades, not steal, and obey society's rules is &quot;abuse&quot;. The constant whining theme of &quot;he just needs love&quot; conveniently whitewashes the fact that the parents, though flawed themselves, adopted the children with the idea of doing just that, and the boys continually and willfully did wrong, often for no purpose other than to just show they could. Although it sounds like the father had a bad temper, even a patient parent would eventually get sick and tired of the antisocial behavior they were dealing with from two kids who, typical of adopted children, wanted &quot;unconditional love&quot; and continually pushed the limits to make their adoptive parents &quot;prove&quot; their love. (If you believe in &quot;unconditional love&quot;, try cheating on or stealing from your spouse repeatedly, and then demand it.) These kids had free will, a great 2nd chance in life, and they stupidly threw it away with their selfish and sociopathic behavior. Not once does the author bring up the topic of &quot;evil&quot; or even mention in passing that perhaps if the young lad were so unhappy, he should have asked someone at his school to get him removed from that house.Other incidents of &quot;abuse&quot; the author describes are: 1. not paying for his drivers ed class, and not letting him drive unless he passed all his courses. (Oh the horror!) 2. discouraging him from dating any girl more than once at 15-16 years of age to avoid problems with sex. (with over 60% of births now out of wedlock, not such an unwise idea at his age, and certainly not &quot;abuse&quot;) 3. The father getting angry the night of the murder because the boy and his friends had ruined a computer disk containing countless hours of his father's accounting work and programming. I wonder what the author would say to her 16 y/o child if he had trashed her only copy of this book's manuscript after months of work. I'm sure she'd just smile and buy him an ice cream cone.This &quot;boy&quot; will be getting out of jail before he's 30, probably, and god help the people who come accross him then. Unlike the theory of one person in the book, his problem wasn't his adoptive parents, it was his inability to understand that being adopted and having a tough childhood isn't carte blanche to vicimize the rest of us. If you want to prevent tradgedies like this, start making people who recklessly have children out of wedlock pay the price.The victims' families should sue the author for libel, if they already haven't. Though perhaps overly rigid and imperfect, they were trying to help these kids, and the author used primarly the MURDERER'S point of view and that of their INSTITUTIONALIZED CRIMINAL older son to assasinate their character.The final fact is, this &quot;boy&quot; CHOSE to murder two people because he didn't like their rules and &quot;felt bad&quot;. Society is better off without such people and their excuse mongers as well."},{"Title":"Canadian Poetry (New Press Canadian Classics)","review":"Covers Contemporary Canadian poets from Margaret Atwood to Michael Ondaatje and Dennis Lee.

For me, this book is a reference only. The format is similar to Thomas Weiss' Cellular Biophysics 2 Volume Set.

However, the Rall model (Sec. 3.5) should have been approached in analogy with impedance matching.

In a Clancy novel there is never any doubt who wears the white hat; it is this distinction that separates Deighton from Clancy. A generation back the comparison between Deighton and Clancy would have been Graham Greene and Ian Fleming. Which you choose says more about the types of novels you read than which story you preferred.MAMista is a story written by an author quite comfortable examining the moral ambiguities presented, with good detail to his fictional surroundings, direct in his presentation, and very agile in his story-telling abilities. The characters always come alive with the story, including some minor ones you'd rather not have done so. The only complaint; in setting the mood so well, Deighton can go on a bit more than necessary. This is a minor flaw in an otherwise graceful novel."},{"Title":"MAMISTA","review":"Nothing ends well in this story. One might almost say \\"the path to hell is paved with good intentions\\" except that not all the intentions are that good anyway.Deighton displays his usual skill at creating background and characters, but the book is infused with tremendous cynicism about the ethics and competence of those who pull the strings from above. After all the disastrous events that have occurred in Spanish Guiana (by the way, I take this as being next door to one of the real Guianas rather than Columbia or Peru) the U.S. President and his most trusted advisor remain sublimely ignorant and uncaring about the events they set in motion.I think he is conveying a message that in situations where you have a corrupt government and a mix of insurgencies, no matter who has the better intentions, the likelihood of a good outcome is slim. Unfortunately, the story is in service of the message, rather than the other way around as in the so much better books like the Samson trilogies."},{"Title":"MAMISTA","review":"The book has several nicely built-up and interesting characters, spectacular descriptions of the countryside in \\"Spanish\\" Guiana (which, one assumes ia a loosely disguised version of Colombia or Peru), and an interesting (if Machiavellian) plot, which all dissipates into ... something, but I'm not sure what.Len Deighton loves to display the cynical humanism that believes that there should be a pox on both houses in most conflicts, since neither's objectives are pure. As such, his distaste at the moral ambiguity of the Cold War and post-Cold War conflicts comes through in his novels, as it does in Mamista.

But lest you think this book is just another pretty face, Spieler, author of over 30 cookbooks, includes informative chapters on the history of Jewish cuisine, the holidays and kashrut as well as general guides to the preparation of all foods Jewish, everything from grilling mamaliga to pounding hawaij and berbere (spice mixtures).\\"This is my first Jewish cookbook,\\" said the California native on a recent visit to San Francisco from her home in London. \\"I've done theme books, like Mediterranean and olive oil and mushrooms, but I've always had a Jewish touch somewhere, including dishes either from Israel or my travels or my Jewish family and friends.\\"Spieler fondly remembers Sundays in her grandmother's kitchen, her early inspiration. \\"My grandmother ran a law firm and worked until a few days before she died at 93. Well, she had to cut back a little -- she only worked from 9 to 5 then. But on Sunday morning, people would start coming, and she would start cooking. I couldn't say they'd come for breakfast, lunch or dinner, because it was all one meal.\\"We would smell the chicken soup as we went off to synagogue school, and by the time we got home she'd have matzah brei and kasha varnishkes and meat patties with onions. This went on until late evening. Bachi really gave me the love of cooking.\\"Spieler traveled widely as a young adult, even lived in Israel for a year, and was working as an artist in Greece when she started including recipes with her drawings of food. A publisher offered to publish the recipes (minus the drawings) launching her career as a food writer, broadcaster and columnist.These days, Spieler divides her time between San Francisco and London, where she is a frequent guest on the BBC. Her column \\"The Roving Feast\\" is carried by the New York Times Syndicate and the San Francisco Chronicle.\\"The Jewish Heritage Cookbook\\" is a truly international celebration of Spieler's curiosity about Jewish people and Jewish food. \\"I love meeting Jews from different cultures, because they have different dishes on the table,\\" she said. \\"I love to cook and hear their stories and find it really exciting that people with such different cultures share the same heritage and holidays.\\"The book's section on the festival of Shavuot (literally \\"weeks,\\" because it occurs seven weeks after Pesach) is accompanied by a magnificent illustration from a 13th century manuscript of the Book of Ruth, the portion read on this holiday.Shavuot, which began at sundown on Thursday, May 16, commemorates the giving of the Torah as well as the offering of the first fruits of the season. Spieler notes that although Shavuot meals are based on dairy products, \\"there are no rules that say this must be done.\\"Why dairy? Scholars differ, she says. Perhaps the tradition evolved because spring grazing produces more milk at this time. Also, in \\"Song of Songs,\\" the Torah is associated with milk and honey. Some suggest that while the Israelites were receiving the Ten Commandments, they were gone so long their milk turned to cheese; others contend that upon their return they were too hungry for anything but milk to sustain them.Whatever the explanation, for Ashkenazim it's bring on the blintzes, while Sephardim enjoy cheese filled borekas.A typical Shavuot starter in central Europe is Hungarian cherry soup perfumed with cinnamon and almond flavor. \\"The nice thing about this soup,\\" Spieler noted, \\"is at Shavuot the days are beginning to get warm, and it is really refreshing. I eat it as often as a dessert as with a meal.\\"Summer squash and baby new potatoes in warm dill sour cream is a festive Israeli celebration of spring and perfect for Shavuot with its fragrant dill and sour cream or yogurt topping.While cheesecake is traditional fare for Shavuot, we opted for cheese-filled Jerusalem kodafa drenched with syrup, an unusual dessert popular throughout the Middle East, where it is commonly made with a shredded wheat-like ingredient called kadaif. Spieler substitutes couscous as it is prepared in Jerusalem.\\"In the Old City, when things were good and people were more friendly, they would make it in these big metal trays that they'd carry on their heads,\\" she noted. \\"I've had it in the Lebanese community of London as well, but in Jerusalem, all the little tea and coffee shops serve it.\\""},{"Title":"The Jewish Heritage Cookbook","review":"What a beautiful book both visually and for the taste of the recipes!

As an example, please pay attention to his demonstration of relativity of simultaneity. He mixed up [seeing by the observer] with [occurrence at the origin]. Therefore Einstein had no right to say that the two events did not occur simultaneously when the observer did not [see] them simultaneously. Let us say, we saw an explosion(A) of a star in 1998, and it was recorded that there was another explosion (B) many years ealier. An observer on earth could only say that he saw B earlier and A later; he could not say B exploded earlier and A later; nor could he say B and A did not explode simultaneously. Einstein's demonstration of his relativity of simultaneity was therefore neither convincing nor fundimentally sound. Einstein's language problem could also be seen in his free switch between the words [clock] and [time]. A clock may and can slow down, but can time slow down? Unless we get this language problem cleared up I believe Einstein's theory will remain controversial."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"His friend Bertrand Russell was too!"},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"This objection comes, not from challenging any of Einstein's assumptions, but rather, from the history of mathematics, which has undergone a renaissance during the past twenty years.Among the most interesting studies are those which have examined the history of Cantorian set theory and the response to it. The response is what is relevant here.\\"Natural\\" mathematics developed in response to the supposed \\"paradoxes\\" of set theory. Regardless of whether those are paradoxes or not (see A. Garciadiego, BERTRAND RUSSELL AND THE ORIGINS OF THE SET-THEORETIC 'PARADOXES'), \\"natural\\" mathematics claimed that, in response, a new doctrine had to be developed. The new doctrine (best explained in P. Maddy, NATURALISM IN MATHEMATICS) said that mathematics inherently generated paradoxes, which could only be avoided or solved by the insertion into arguments the idea that mathematics is inherent in human beings, even though the idea does not play any internally consistent role in the arguments into which it is inserted.Poincare was an ardent advocate of \\"natural\\" mathematics (along with Hilbert and Russell) and he set it out in SCIENCE AND HYPOTHESIS. Einstein was an ardent advocate of this position, based on his reading of the Poincare book (see Stachel and Howard, EINSTEIN THE FORMATIVE YEARS).Since it does not play an internally consistent role in any argument in which it is inserted, if \\"natural\\" mathematics is found in relativity, it will constitute a contradiction in the argument.Here is the \\"train\\" experiment as given by Einstein in RELATIVITY:Are two events (e.g. the two strokes of lightning A and B) which are simultaneous with reference to the railway embankment also simultaneous relatively to the train? We shall show directly that the answer must be in the negative. When we say that the lightning strokes A and B are simultaneous with respect to be embankment, we mean: the rays of light emitted at the places A and B, where the lightning occurs, meet each other at the mid-point M of the length AB of the embankment. But the events A and B also correspond to positions A and B on the train. Let M1 be the mid-point of the distance AB on the traveling train. Just when the flashes (as judged from the embankment) of lightning occur, this point M1 naturally coincides with the point M but it moves...with the velocity...of the train.The objection is \\"naturally coincides\\" (fallt zwar...zusammen). This is a pure expression of \\"natural\\" mathematics. Poincare said that \\"the mind has a direct intuition of this power [\\"proof by recurrence\\" or \\"mathematical induction\\"], and experiment can only be for [the mind] an opportunity of using it, and thereby of becoming conscious of it.\\" In geometry \\"we are brought to [the concept of space] solely by studying the laws by which...[muscular] sensations succeed one another.\\" \\"Natural\\" coincidence \\"allows\\" one point to \\"succeed\\" another, in conformity with the demands of \\"natural\\" mathematics.Einstein never justifies the term. Neither can it be dispensed with. If it is eliminated, the geometrical contradiction emerges automatically. If two Cartesian parallel coordinate systems coincide at one point, they coincide at all points and are one such system. This contradicts the assumption of two such systems.This is the objection--from WITHIN the relativity of simultaneity and NOT by challenging or changing any of Einstein's assumptions--which brings relativity to an end. This is because we cannot get to special or general relativity or QED if there is a flaw in the relativity of simultaneity.This is not the first occasion on which Einstein incorporated \\"natural\\" mathematics in his arguments, and in which \\"natural\\" mathematics caused problems for the argument. He used it in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion. As S. Sarkar of the University of Texas says in the Stachel and Howard book: \\"Einstein begins with an assumption whose status is still problematic and troubled his contemporaries: that there exists \`a time interval , which shall be very small compared with observable time intervals but still so large that all motions performed by a particle during two consecutive time intervals may be considered as mutually independent events....This is essentially a very strong Markov postulate. Einstein makes no attempt to justify it....[W]here mathematics ends and physics begins is far from clear....\\"It is, I think, sobering to realize that this objection existed for 100 years without ever being noticed--sobering because it shows how pervasive a prejudice can be. It is doubly interesting that even critics of relativity shared the prejudice--they too bought into \\"natural\\" mathematics. But I didn't.That's the end of relativity. Where to next:1. \\"Natural\\" mathematics provided very facile arguments. It was immediately taken up in all the disciplines. It was used by Godel, Sraffa, Kimura--everywhere. Where do the flaws appear in arguments in other disciplines?2. It is likely that \\"natural\\" mathematics was only given its name in the twentieth century, when there was an intense interest in paradoxes. However, supposed \\"paradoxes,\\" such as Zeno's, have been around for a long time. It is likely that \\"natural\\" mathematics is the immemorial effort to \\"avoid\\" or \\"solve\\" these paradoxes. For example, where does Darwin use \\"natural\\" mathematics?3. The status of the Pythagorean theorem is in question again. Under general relativity it is invalid. However, \\"natural\\" coincidence does not permit us to reach general relativity. So the question arises once again: is the Pythagorean theorem internally consistent? If not, why not?So research goes beyond and before relativity. But relativity itself is over.The discussion in this post was first published as follows:Ryskamp, John Henry, \\"Paradox, Natural Mathematics and Twentieth-Century Ideas\\" (April 14, 2006).[...]"},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"Lawson's translation of Einstein's description of his theory of relativity is still the primary translation as far as this reviewer is concerned.

When Einstein won the Nobel prize for his work on the photoelectric effect, his certificate unequivocally stated that the award was NOT given for his theory of relativity.

This book was written in 1916, in German and then translated into English. The book being reviewed here uses a 1920 edition, but it is far from being the newest one that Einstein wrote. The newest, the 15th edition, was written in 1952, and it is the most complete, as it contains several appendices that are not in earlier editions, as well as some corrections of errors that appeared in earlier editions. I have read both the 15th edition and this one, and if you want the best version of Einstein's text I would definitely get the 15th edition, as opposed to the one being reviewed here. However, the edition being reviewed here has been augmented with new material, and I think that this makes it a better choice than the 15th edition.This book contains an interesting introduction by Roger Penrose, which provides some insights concerning Relativity Theory and the cosmological advances that have grown out of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. The book contains lengthy commentaries by Robert Geroch that clarify many of Einstein's chapters. Finally, there is an essay by David Cassidy on the \\"Cultural Legacy of Relativity Theory\\". In my opinion these additions more than make up for the appendices that are provided in the more complete 15th edition of Einstein's book.I liked this book and recommend it over the 15th edition, but I cannot give it 5 stars. I found Einstein's prose to be typical of 19th century scientific prose, that is to say somewhat tedious and less than clear. This is especially true of the latter half of the book, which is devoted to the General Theory. To make matters worse, it was originally written in German and may have lost some clarity in the translation. There is a final chapter on cosmology that because of the rapid advances in this field make this section largely only of historical interest.I recommend this book if you really want to read Einstein, albeit in translation, but there are better choices if you want an introduction to Relativity Theory.

SR is surprisingly more simplistic and more readily understandable than GR.Most importantly this work has helped me to overcome thinking about mechanics in a few very specific ways, and what I took away from reading this was: \\"...there's no such thing as an independently existing trajectory...\\" and \\"...there's no rectilinear motion.\\""},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"Even if you only wanted to know more about Einstein, this is an excellent read.

I purchased this after several CBC broadcast (Ideas) of Albert Einstein and found him so interesting that I wanted to learn more about his theories and what led him to his conclusions."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"This was really great reading. I explained the theory in layman's terms. I highly recommend it for students and adults alike."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"I am far from being an expert in physics (philosophy is my field) but I have a layman's interest in developments in modern science and have done a little light reading on relativity on my own. I still found this book to be quite accessible as long as you are not afraid of a few algebraic equations. The section on general relativity is a little challenging in places but I actually thought Einstein's discussion of Gaussian coordinates (to take one example) was clearer than other presentations I have tried to read.What I truly appreciated about this book was the logical order of Einstein's presentation. Einstein begins by laying out two principles: a restricted principle of relativity and the law of the propagation of light in vacuo and then shows how the two principles seem to contradict each other. Rather than discarding either principle, however, Einstein explains that we need to rethink our conceptions of time and space in a way that makes them compatible. Einstein then goes on to explain precisely how our notions of time and space need to be modified according to the special theory of relativity (basically space and time measurements will not be equal for bodies of reference moving relatively to each other but will be related through the Lorenz transformations).Einstein then goes onto explain why the special theory of relativity needs to be replaced with a general theory which will take into account reference bodies that are accelerating in relation to each other. He explains how acceleration can be considered equivalent to being at rest in a gravitational field, and why the general theory cannot be based on a Euclidean continuum, as well as how to conceive a Non-Euclidean continuum using Gaussian coordinates all in a very logical manner. In other words, Einstein does not simply explain the theory but he explains why the theory needs to be formulated (why previous theories are inadequate) and why the theory needs to be formulated in the form it is actually formulated in.The book is terse so you probably should not begin with this book if you have not read anything else on relativity theory. If you are looking for a good first book I would recommendInside Relativityby Delo Mook and Thomas Vargish.ADDENDUM: I noticed when browsing through reviews today that certain editions of this book have received negative reviews from a lot of customers. Unfortunately, amazon continues to lump all the editions together on a single page. The edition I read, and reviewed, was the edition published by Broadway (with the black and white horizontal stripes on the lower half). I definitely recommend anyone interested in the book pick up the Broadway edition. The print is clear, the equations are clear, and it is very reasonably priced."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"Professor Einstein wrote this book for the general audience who had an education \\"comparable to that of a university matriculation examination\\", as he felt there was a great need of introducing the idea to the public; however, the original papers were too technical. He did warn that reading the book would require the reader to exert some effort, and I certainly did. However, I derived some solace from the fact that out of all the books on relativity in the (university) library, this book is one of the few that is comprehensible to me!He first sets out conventional thinking of the day on relative motion and invites us to consider the \\"truth\\" carefully. He reviewed the concept of reference frame (i.e. coordinate system) and the use of Euclidean geometry to describe relative motion, including the 'intuitive' addition of velocity. Then he reveals that this line of thought is problematic.At this point it is worth digressing into the means which he presents the theory of relativity. His presentation is elegant - not in the linguistic sense, but in the structure of his argument. Normally, one can start with a set of empirical data and try to work out a pattern, from there on, a theory. One can also formulate questions, let imagination and reasoning suggest a hypothesis, then find experimental data to test the hypothesis.Einstein did it another way still, at least in this book. His general pattern is to explore some thought experiments and to see their implications. From there, he formulates the postulates and work out a coherent theory from the postulates. Experiments only come much later in his style of presentation. In particular, he postulates that (i) the speed of light is constant for all observers and (ii) physical laws are the same for observers in all reference frames. He then conducts a thought experiment, the now-famous train/lightning experiment. The two lightning bolts appear to reach the stationary observer \\"at the same time\\", but not so for the observer on the train - the notion of \\"simultaneity\\" is in doubt.He gives credit to Lorentz - for his work of Lorentz Transformation - and incorporates it into his Special Theory of Relativity. Relative motion is no longer a simple additive relation but a more complicated one - though still manageable.Only then he mentions the Michelson-Morley experiment but in a way that makes it appear to be peripheral to the development of his theory. He also introduces Minkowski's (his teacher) spacetime quite late, in spite of the fact that the idea is central to Special Theory of Relativity from a physics and mathematics point of view. To put it simply, it is the Pythagorean Theorem with an additional dimension of time (albeit with a form much more complicated than the 3D theorem).He introduces the General Theory of Relativity by highlighting that the conditions which the Special Theory is valid - i.e. constant velocities - severely restrict its descriptive power. Mathematically, Euclidean geometry does not work when a given region of space is not \\"equally dense,\\" as in the case above. He introduces Gaussian Coordinates, which is the generalization of geometrical continua, with Euclidean geometry being a special case.Special Relativity and General Relativity are different because spacetime is \\"equally dense\\" (i.e. flat) in Special Relativity, since only constant velocity cases are considered; but this is not so in General Relativity. The Gaussian coordinate system is necessary to describe them. GR can then be formulated as \\"All Gaussian coordinate systems are essentially equivalent for the formulation of the general laws of nature.\\" He concluded by considering the application of GR in cosmology, with such implications as perihelion of Mercury and unbounded yet finite universe.By this point (that is, if you had patiently read this far), you might question my addition of the precis of the book here. \\"Couldn't I just google it?\\" But chances are that introductions to Special and General Relativity are similar elsewhere, and this is how Professor Einstein did it. If you had read Walter Issacson'sEinstein: His Life and Universeor Abraham Pais'sSubtle Is the Lord: The Science and the Life of Albert Einstein(the latter is even more technical), this book should also demonstrate how Einstein thinks - idea first, mathematics second!True, the theories are not something simple to grasp; but I am doing economics yet enjoy reading it - not to mention I am able to get the idea! The style of English is admittedly a little archaic but that is a relatively (no pun intended) small impediment of appreciating this great work. I would recommend that you set apart some moments in a quiet surrounding so that you could concentrate on following his arguments - that's the best way of reading the book IMHO!"},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"After reading books by Hawking, Kaku, Greene, and others on the topic, none are more lucid as Einstein himself in describing relativity to the non-physicist."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"This is a good, concise exposition of general and special relativity from the man who wrote the book. However, it will be above the heads of some... If you're interested in reading this book, I'd suggest looking for it in the library to see if it's really the book for you. Or even browse the text in a bookstore before you buy. If you think you'll need a course in Calculus, find a review of the theories that you can follow."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"The first edition of this book was published just after the original paper on the general theory of relativity. In the ensuing ninety years, no one has produced a better layman's introduction to the special and general theories.The alert reader will achieve not only a clear intuitive understanding of the important physics but will learn much about the awesome intellect that produced it.In the centenary of Einstein's annus mirabilis, a number of reprints of this classic have appeared, some adorned with introductions by such luminaries as Roger Penrose or with additional appendices added in later editions. I have a personal preference for the Dover version because it reproduces the type face of the orginal 1916 translation that was the first science text I read at age seven. And the cover phtograph alone is worth the price of the book.Enthusiastically recommended."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"Albert Einstein is the eidos of the Smart Guy. I chose to read Robert W. Lawson's authorized translation of Einstein's popular exposition of the topic of Relativity because I didn't think I knew anything about it. Well, that isn't true. That was why I chose to buy it; I have a whole special collection of uncracked literature in my library relating to my personal ignorance. I chose to read it because of both the above stated reason and because it was small enough to tote with me on the train to and from work. I enjoyed it thoroughly.Although I got a big fat B in my undergraduate physics course, all I understood about Relativity was 1) it has something to do with Energy being equal to the product of Mass and the speed of light squared, and 2) there is something wrong with Newtonian mechanics when one is trying to explain the orbit of Mercury. Relativity turns out to be a good chunk more interesting than that. By spelling it out using simple examples like trains, Euclidian geometry and math no fancier than algebra, Einstein seemed to make a pretty good case for the over-simplicity of the good old laws of inertia and momentum. Sure, my clock is at rest with respect to me and will remain so until something moves it, but observed from a distant star, it is accelerating through four-dimensional space-time quite rapidly. Moreover, the perception of my clock (and time) from that remote reference point is influenced by the finite yet constant speed of light. That guy was really thinking.In summation, spending 20 minutes in the morning and 20 minutes in the evening with this book made me feel like I had the gist of Relativity. Now back to my stack of ignorance."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"No, Einstein's Relativity IS amazingly brilliant and eloquent, I assure you of this. My review, although, is a buyer beware scenario. I ordered this exact copy of the text and the one that arrived had all sorts of horrendous typos. One? Two? No, more like...a ton. In an example of this, the 'aether' where the character 'ae' is a single one, somehow in the process of printing it, the character got repaced by a space and question mark! So when Einstein talks about the 'process by which the? ther happens...' or some such example, I translate it as 'bad' and not 'aether'.By all means, buy Einstein's copy of Relativity, but please be cautious when ordering from this particular publisher. I'm unaware of whether or not this problem is widespread, but to those who get the one with the maddening typos riddled all over it, just bear through it and appreciate Einstein's eloquence and not the translator or publisher's, in my own personal opinion, bad spellchecking."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"This book, written by Albert Einstein, is about the concept that changed our approach to physics and to the universe.

The math isn't difficult, it's understanding how it leads to the theory that requires a lot of thinking.

That's what Einstein brilliantly helps you to do here."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"This is an update of the review below, posted anonymously June 20, 1999. People seem to have found it useful and I thought I would add what I consider to be important information about different editions of this book.Various editions of this book differ in an important respect. Some of them are more complete than others! The reason is that Einstein wrote the first edition over 80 years ago, and it is in the public domain; I believe later additions to the book are still under copyright, which is under the control of Einstein's heirs and whomever the heirs have given publishing rights. In the 2005 celebration of Einstein's \\"miracle year\\", lots of publishers cashed in, but not all of the editions, including some of the more expensive ones, have the complete deal.The very critical thing to look for in the various editions is the Appendices, in particular the piece \\"Relativity and the Problem of Space\\" which Einstein wrote near the end of his life. This is an extremely serious and profound meditation on the subject matter, whether written for a \\"popular\\" audience or not. Part of the essay is a brief discussion of something whose significance is still very actively debated, usually under the rubrics of \\"background independence\\" and \\"diffeomorphism invariance\\". You will not find these words in Einstein's essay, but these notions are at the heart of the sometimes bitter disagreements about various approaches to quantum gravity, e.g. loop quantum gravity (which takes an Einsteinian view) and string theory (which takes a view based on particle physics and quantum field theory). Einstein did not enter into these contemporary debates about quantum gravity, but his meditations in the essay in this book are very much at the source of the current controversies.A leading quantum gravity person of the Einsteinian-based persuasion told me several years ago that he had been a professional practitioner in relativity and quantum gravity for years before he really appreciated what Einstein was getting at here.Another person, of the string persuasion, told me that he was \\"deeply shaken\\" from reading a Scientific American critique of the string theory program by a person of the loop quantum gravity school, who stressed the lack of \\"background independence\\" in the string program.So, by all means, check the table of contents of different editions to make sure the appendices are all there, make sure the \\"Relativity and the Problem of Space\\" essay is there. You will find much to ponder and mystify you there, and much that can be related to contemporary debates at the frontiers of quantum theories of space and time!mastermind at work, June 20, 1999Reviewer: A readerThe reviewer of April 13 from Moscow, Idaho says this is not the book to read unless you already understand the theory. Maybe fair enough. It was written when Einstein had achieved youthful fame, though, not in his dotage, if he had such a thing. It may be a little more difficult for the translation, but not much. Contrary to some reviewers, it is not that easy to follow, and if it seems like an easy read, you probably haven't understood it. There are many books written since where it is probably easier to learn about special relativity, to say nothing of the basic ideas of general relativity. But once you have started to get the hang of things, this book is a masterpiece of exposition! It allows one to follow Einstein's actual thought process in arriving at these theories -- pretty much by a process of pure thought -- more or less in the steps he probably took himself. There is not a word in the exposition that was not carefully thought out. So, learn the theory somewhere else and then read this book -- you'll understand the theory better for reading Einstein's book -- or read this book first, keep going back to it 'til it starts to make sense, and maybe consult some other, more \\"user-friendly\\" textbook at the same time. Einstein claims his book allows a lay reader with only high school math to understand relativity. To which a friend of mine replied \\"Yeah, if you have an IQ of 800\\". To which I say, have patience, keep thinking about it and going back to it."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"In Relativity, Einstein trys to bring his theory of relativity to the masses. When the special and general theorys of relativity were concieved of by Einstein, they revolutionized our perception of space and time. This revolution was so complete that many of the most significant physicists of the time believed that it was nonsense. When Einstein won the Nobel prize for his work on the photoelectric effect, his certificate unequivocally stated that the award was NOT given for his theory of relativity. For much of his life, even Einstein was unwilling to accept some of the predictions of his own work such as black holes.This is all very good, interesting science and history which should be read and understood by everyone. The problem is, though, that Einstein was not a particularly good writer. Einstein is too brilliant for his own good and it shows through frequently in this attempt to stoop to our level. His explanations are usually hard to follow and unintuitive(and I study physics even!). This book exists on an uncomfortable middle ground between rigor and easy reading.If you would like to read this book simply because of its (and its author's) historical significance then I couldn't discourage that. If you know little physics and want to try to understand relativity, read Kip Thorne's Black Holes and Time Warps or the first few chapters of Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"I've used this book with my high school students - very slow going. You can definitely understand the issues involved in relativity, even as a layman, from reading this book, but THIS IS NOT AN EASY READ! A mature, dedicated reader will get through this book. I'm proud of my high school students for struggling through this book, but readers at that age mostly do not have the intensity to really appreciate it."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"This book is truly a scientific gem. Not only did the brilliant Einstein envision the theory of relativity, but he also felt compelled to inform non-scientists by writing this &quot;less&quot; technical explanation of his theory. The book's section on Special Relativity is not too difficult to grasp. However, having some basic understanding of algebra and classical mechanics is helpful. On the other hand, the section on General Relativity is quite profound, requiring the reader to imagine new concepts of space and time that are alien to one's sense of reality. Indeed, I had to read this section several times and I'm still not sure if I completely understand it. However, this is more of a function of my imagination skills rather than Einstein's literary abilities. For he uses an abundance of familiar terms and analogies to simplify the understanding of some of the more &quot;unusual&quot; implications of General Relativity. I would not recommend this book to someone averse to technical subjects. However, I do recommend it to those wishing to learn the basics of relativity theory."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"Einstein's theory of relativity is still about the only advanced science theory that I am able to fully understand. His book is the Bible of Relativity, unfortunately like the Bible it is a bit difficult to understand because he is not very fluent in English and although correct he uses words which we modern English speaking people are not familiar with. He is so long and drawn out that one often loses concentration and forgets the start of a topic before getting to the end. This is why I took off one star.

I found that Albert Einstein has a hunger for understanding ideas that most people never dreamed of contemplating. Einstein uses simple examples to allow the reader to follow his train of thought.I take exception to his changing factors and concepts (of Newton and others) in order to obtain the results that he finds satisfactory. Forcing people to view an 'Event' from a controled, single point of reference and limiting the co-ordinate system in order to arrive at his conclusions was disheartening.Albert Einstein was a genius with prejudices like 'ordinary' people. Still I think this work is a valuable tool for the anyone wishing to broaden their horizons."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"I won't lie to you, the theory of relativity is not simple. The special relativty is easily understood, yet it is a topic covered in university as an speciality in majors more involved with physics, and general relativity is coverd in masters. Both topics can be quite esoteric, and the mathematical explanation for the relativistic deformation of the time-space due to speed uses Fourier's transforms, so most people will have to just have faith in what Einstein is trying to explain. However, he does simplify the subject enough, so anyone with a basis of physics could grasp some of the most important ideas behind his theory.Furthermore, this book is important in the fact that by proving that relativity was a real fact in physics, the shape of the world in the twentieth century took a great change. I believe that without Einstein's work, the nihilism porfethized by Nietzsche, toghether with the despotic regimes that the will of power would create guided by deviations of the &quot;&uuml;bermensch&quot; might not have com in such strenght as it did."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"Attempting to understand this book, (Which Einstein claims he wrote in a way people can understand...) makes me wonder what the value of knowledge is if you can't explain it to anyone. The concepts I can understand, ONLY because I had other sources to explain them to me before buying this book. The problem is that he uses excessively long sentences which frequently jump around. More often than not, I get completely lost before the end of the sentence. Another problem is the fact that the language is somewhat flowery. (**Imagine for a second, trying to understand the topic of relativity with the indirect, flowery language that Shakespeare used---this book is not that poetic, but it's just as indirect. Physics, in general is simply not the place to be indirect, especially when attempting to explain a complicated subject in a way that's comprehensible.) He doesn't seem to make even remotely simple statements. Instead, the meanings of the sentences are watered down, and because of their excessive length (*I read a single sentence that was 6 lines in length), I get lost. I would not recommend this book to anyone other than Einstein himself, and if it is necessary for you to read this book (for school or personal accomplishment), for your own sake, keep a LARGE bottle of Asprin, and one of those ten-pound unabridged dictionaries near-by. >>Instead of this book, I would recommend \\"Black Holes, Wormholes, and Time Machines\\" by Jim Al-Khalili (It's very easy to understand, though covers complex topics...and I, personally, could not put it down.)"},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"This is still an excellent intro to the subject, though some of the material is obsolete, of course.

I'll be the first to admit that a failure of information flow from Einstein to me is most likely a problem on the receiving end. However, in this case, Einstein completely left out important parts of the theory. It was as if he tried to explain a bicycle by describing the front wheel. Perhaps he felt that explaining the whole bicycle without leveraging concepts from elsewhere in physics and math was not possible. That may be true, but it doesn't change the fact that reading this book isn't going to give you a very clear understanding of the general theory of relativity."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"I would like to take a minute to thank Audio Scholar for abridging Relativity to audio.

The writing process is not made clear in the book itself (whether it was dictated or co-authored, and the extent of changes by editors or translators). New editions could stand to have a forward that provides a little more context.There are better books around for a beginner to understand relativity, but this is certainly not the worst. There is always something to be said for reading primary sources, and the book is fairly short and can be read quickly. Students may want to stick to Part I (Special Relativity) and consult more contemporary books for General Relativity.The language is understandable for the most part. It is not as clean and simple a writing style as is common today -- in some places it is fairly elegant but in a few it is pointlessly baroque and awkward (perhaps a problem in the translation from German). Chapter 8 is an especially bad example: it could easily be written more clearly with about half the verbiage. In the older editions the translation is credited to Robert Lawson (apparently British) but this credit disappears in other versions.For people already familiar with the history of science, there are a lot of interesting little details, such as seeing how Einstein originally presents the description of the moving train, and seeing all the people that Einstein credits as having made an important impression on him and contributions to the theory and experiments.

In my opinion, that is also what Einstein would have had in mind when he wrote that book.If you are serious about relavity, read his original papers. They are not as difficult as they say they are.

Maybe something is just lost in the translation, I don't know..."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"Even though this book is marketed (and meant) as an accessible exposition of relativity theory, with the considerable advantage of being by Einstein himself, it is not as easy to read as the presentation may imply. Einstein says in his introduction that his reasoning will demand no more than high-school knowledge of the relevant subjects. Maybe this was true in his time, but nowadays the book demands way more than that. I'm myself a grad student in the field of literature and I simply couldn't follow the presumably basic mathematical demonstrations Einstein relies upon to make his points. Some concepts are also less than obvious for the non-specialist ('galilean coordinates'?). This is not to say that the book itself is not good, but that it is targeted at a readership which is not necessarily trained enough to benefit from it."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"Long on my list of must-reads, I finally got this for myself. After hearing a lifetime of comments and reviews about these theories, it is a good thing to go straight to the source.

Experiments performed with atomic clocks; one being on earth and the other flown on a rocket ship show that. Each clock uses the same radiactive element that has a known decay rate.

I counted 25 serious errors in the formulas in the first two-thirds of the book. Most of them come from the substitution of a I for a 1, which is this context is confusing. Subscripts which I cannot illustrate here, move up to get mixed with exponents and \\"minuses\\" are indistinguishable and mixed up with \\"dots\\" meaning multiply. The spelling is atrocious with multiple misspelling but when a mathematical \\"shell\\" gets translated as a \\"mollusc\\"....yes, literally, really and repetitively, then it is time to get a translator that has some idea of what he is translating.

The book was a fairly quick read, about 4 commuter train rides. He was able to introduce Special Relativity without the use of math; although I'm glad he does shows the Lorentz transformation and has an appendix to hint at the derivation.On the other hand I was disappointed with the material on General Relativity and had hoped to see more depth of discussion. The GR is the barest of an introduction."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"This is relativity explained by Einstein himself, without using math. There might have been a plain English explanation that is slightly more crisp, however, would you not want to read it from the master himself? The special relativity section is especially clear, and detailed. Almost all the important ideas were explained well there. The section on general relativity is rather brief, and gives you the sense that it is just a flavor, not the full story. Yet it gives you enough to be very interested. The English translation from German could be better, but it really does not make it inexplicable. Those who complain that the translation could not be understood probably would not understand the book even if it is translated better. All in all, I would recommend reading it after some other exposition on the subject.

I would reccomend this book to anyone interested in relativity. Now, this book is a lot easier to understand than many other books on this same subject, but this book is difficult and does require some patience and concentration. Einstein writes this with a voice that entices the reader. This book is an absolute must have for anyone even remotely curious about relativity."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"I own this book and have read it a few times and each time I am impressed by the clarity with which it is written. It explains the concepts of relativity in words only. It avoids (technical) calculations and formulas, not for the usual 'commercial' reasons, but because the author shows he can do without. And ask yourself: how many authors are capable of doing that?The strength of the book is its conciseness: the author forces you to think things through, before moving on to the next chapter. I think this little book is great to own next to a more advanced textbook because it really adds value, for a small price.Buy this book for its content only: it contains no fancy graphics or other 'eye catchers'. Because the author (obviously) knows what he is talking about, he was able to keep the book thin without making compromises. Again an achievement."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"This book is probably the best place to start in understanding the theory that revolutionized science. It is lucid enough for practically anyone to understand. I should know, I'm still in junior high school and I understand it. Einstein conveyed the nature of his own genius into a prose that clearly explained nearly all there is to know on the basis of modern physics. The Cosmological Supplement was, in my opinion, the most interesting part. Natural science is an amazing branch of knowledge and some even say that physics is defined as the only true science. I reccommend this book to all readers who are interested in Einstein's work and even those who don't have a clue. It is all just basic science."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"Written by Einstein himself, this book gives excellent insight into special relativity.

If you want to do the math its in the back in appendicxes (there are some awful typos in the Lorentz transform appendix but not so bad you can't work out where the missing x is and that the gamma is really lambda).But don't be put off by that. This is the best book to start with. By far."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"This book is very interesting glimpse of where einstein was coming from. this is a book that is still interesting if you understand relativity, because einsein gives a very thorough look at the circumstances surrounding the development of the theory. Including a delineation of the specific problems with newtonian mechanics which neccesitated development of the special and general theories of relativity, which I have never found in any other book on the subject.He also does a wonderful job of explaining why the special theory was insufficient, and the steps with which he developed the general theory of relativity.This book is a look at the most wildly hyped theory of the twentieth century, and explains it so that almost anyone should be able to understand it and also undestand why Einstein once said he spent the vast majority of his life trying to understand quantum mechanics, and not relativity."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"In Relativity, Einstein trys to bring his theory of relativity to the masses. When the special and general theorys of relativity were concieved of by Einstein, they revolutionized our perception of space and time. This revolution was so complete that many of the most significant physicists of the time believed that it was nonsense. When Einstein won the Nobel prize for his work on the photoelectric effect, his certificate unequivocally stated that the award was NOT given for his theory of relativity. For much of his life, even Einstein was unwilling to accept some of the predictions of his own work such as black holes.This is all very good, interesting science and history which should be read and understood by everyone. The problem is, though, that Einstein was not a particularly good writer. Einstein is too brilliant for his own good and it shows through frequently in this attempt to stoop to our level. His explanations are usually hard to follow and unintuitive(and I study physics even!). This book exists on an uncomfortable middle ground between rigor and easy reading.If you would like to read this book simply because of its (and its author's) historical significance then I couldn't discourage that. If you know little physics and want to try to understand relativity, read Kip Thorne's Black Holes and Time Warps or the first few chapters of Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"I have an old copy of this book with different publisher and would like to buy a new copy as a gift for my brother.

Instead of giving my brother the new book, I would rather giving my copy even though I has already written all over it."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"I believe in reading primary source material. You can't get much closer to the source of the theory of relativity! My high school math and science classes did help me through this book.I like it because it's not my normal subject matter. Einstein helped me think out of the box in terms of how things in the world (and universe) relate. Even though I won't remember all (or any) of the equations, I'll definitely remember his wonderful word pictures."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"Einstein himself wrote a 1918 paper which is not generally discussed, and which basically agreed that parts of the special theory were contradicted by the 'twin paradox'. The theory is pushed so hard in some quarters that any contrary thoughts are simply quashed. The special theory, especially the thought that their is no such thing as absolute space, is, in my view, simply wrong. Many have written on this subject, for instance the Australian, Builder, but they are ignored by establishment science, which is not science at all but rather politics, and dirty politics at that. That is not to say the Einstein was like that, but rather those who support his theory for political reasons."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"Maybe I'm a retard but I just don't get the whole Quantum Physics thing.

Einstein might be the greatest scientist of the 20th century, but he is not the greatest writer.Forgive me, Einstein, but your book is boring. I had to force myself to finish reading it. It does not begin to convey the excitement and strangeness of the discovery. It only gives a few brief examples of thought experiments illustrating the point of relativity. Also, beware that this is a translation of Einstein's German. The translation could stand to be updated into less cumbersome prose.In his wonderful biography, Isaacson writes, \\"To make sure that the average person would fathom [his book Relativity], he read every page out loud to Elsa's daughter Margot, pausing frequently to ask whether she indeed got it. \`Yes, Albert,' she invariably replied, even though (as she confided to others) she found the whole thing totally baffling.\\" (p. 232)The book's main selling point is reading about the thought experiments from the horse's mouth --- the train thought experiment illustrating the impossibility of simultaneity (Ch 9), the chest in space thought experiment demonstrating the equivalence between gravity and acceleration (Ch 10), and the disc thought experiment illustrating that accelerated motion takes place in a non-Euclidean warped space (Ch 23). He also says he is trying to write about the concepts \\"in the sequence and connection in which they actually originated,\\" so there is some value in that.There are a couple really good quotes:\\"...we entirely shun the vague word \`space,' of which, we must honestly acknowledge, we cannot form the slightest conception....\\" - Einstein p. 9\\"Every reference body (co-ordinate system) has its own particular time; unless we are told the reference-body to which the statement of time refers, there is no meaning in a statement of the time of an event.\\" - Einstein p. 26If you want to see how Einstein explained relativity, then read this book. But if you want to understand relativity, look elsewhere.For the layperson interested in a good non-mathematical introduction to relativity, I recommendRelativity Simply Explainedby Martin Gardner. Chapters 2 and 3 ofThe Elegant Universeby Brian Greene also present a brief, lucid explanation; and Chapters 2 and 3 ofThe Fabric of the Cosmosgo more in-depth into general relativity and the spacetime. For more historical information as well as a lucid explanation, I recommend Chapter 6 (Special) and Chapter 9 (General) of Isaacson'sEinstein.If you want to read Einstein's book on relativity, you might as well buyA Stubbornly Persistent Illusion: The Essential Scientific Works of Albert Einstein, which includes the entire text of Relativity in addition to numerous other books and original papers.Enjoy studying this fascinating subject!cheers:)"},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"I had some difficulty understanding this book but finished it in awe of the man.

(This exact edition is also available in paperback.) Definitely get this one (or another 15th edition) because it is the 1952, fifteenth edition, which is the last one that Einstein prepared and is the one that contains all five of his appendices. My local bookstore has several editions put out by different publishers. Side by side were two, one was a 1916, third edition, that contained only three appendices and the other was the complete 1952, fifteenth edition, which actually cost a dollar LESS than the incomplete version. The 1916 version is in public domain, so the publisher does not have to pay anything to the Einstein estate. Thus, the publisher makes more money from purchasers who are not savvy enough to realize that they are getting an inferior edition for the same or even a higher price than a complete one. Caveat emptor.The four stars do not in any way refer to my view of Einstein or his work. Were they the basis of the review I would have given it five stars. I am qualifying my recommendation because I believe that only some readers will find the book to be suitable for their needs. Thus, I am giving it only four stars because this book is too elementary for someone studying relativity in a graduate course but too complex for someone with little or no physics background. Thus, the readership is somewhat limited.Pros:1) This book is Einstein's classic presentation of his special and general theories of relativity, prepared for a general audience. As such, it has interesting historical value as well as being illuminating for some readers. The fifteenth edition contains all of Einstein's corrections and all of his appendices.2) A reasonably good presentation of the special theory.3) Good for someone with a physics background (engineers, physicists at the BS or MS level, chemists, etc.) It is, however, too elementary for someone studying relativity at a graduate level. For them, it is primarily useful as a historical document. They would probably get more from Einstein's papers than from this book, which was written for the general public.Cons:1) The bulk of this book was written in 1916, in German, and then translated into English. As such, it is somewhat convoluted in places and generally has the typical flavor of 19th century prose.2) I feel that while the special theory is presented in a reasonably straightforward manner the general theory is not. Einstein uses a little math here, but it is insufficient for a physicist and is probably incomprehensible for someone with little or no math or physics background. I believe that Martin Gardner's book \\"Relativity Simply Explained\\" is a better choice for someone with little or no science background. It does a very much better job of explaining the general theory for a general audience.3) While Einstein explains how the basic assumptions of his theories differ from those of classical physics, these differences are not, in my opinion, highlighted sufficiently. I recommend Isaacson's recent biography of Einstein for those who want these differences more clearly delineated. Isaacson clearly shows why Einstein's theories were so radical a departure from those of Newton.All in all, this is a good book for the right audience."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"There is no doubt that Albert Einstein has been one of the most brilliant minds of the past century. His major contribution to science was the special and the general theory of relativity, which gave a new dimension to that we call today \\"Modern Physics\\". Many people feel frustrated because when they try to understand relativity, they find some authors that expound in their books a complex arrangement of equations referring to the mathematical part of the theory, namely, the books are accessible for people with certain levels of knowledge (that is the case of engineers, physicists, mathematicians, among others). Nevertheless, perceiving and anticipating this situation, Albert Einstein wrote this book (more than fifty years ago) whit the purpose of exposing the special and the general theory of relativity in such a way that anyone can understand it. I this sense, I think, Einstein succeeded because despite the shortness of the book, the same covers the most important aspects of relativity in a clear and concise form. Moreover, the book has appendixes where the author makes reference to some interesting subjects like the problem of space and relativity, the experimental confirmation of the theory, to name a few. If you have decided to learn something about relativity, and you do not have vast knowledge in physics and mathematics, I sincerely recommend you this book. On the other hand, if you were a reader looking for more technical information (mathematical foundation of general relativity), I would choose the book \\"Gravitation\\" written by Misner, Wheeler y Thorne. This text represents an encyclopedia about general relativity."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"This is the introduction to relativity written by Einstein. It is NOT the book which contains the original works, which is a very difficult book (just think that Planck had to ask for several clarifications before he understood Einstein's breakthrough paper). Here the great scientist set to himself the goal of explaining to the educated, but not specialized, man.Einstein was, of course, very deep. When he talked about any topic in physics, chances are that he went deeper than anyone else who thought about the same theme, for a comparable time span. Now, imagine relativity. When he wrote this book he had thought about this matter for several decades. Nobody reached this depth, then and afterwards. The fruits of his thought, like black-holes, are being proved true now, after so much time!So, the difference between this book and all other introductory books on relativity is proportional to the difference between Einstein himself and the other authors. You don't have to believe me: just read the excerpts! You'll not remain indifferent to the majesty of his ideas. Put yourself in the right mood: Einstein was a very simple man who was, in writing this book, sincerely interested in explaining his creation to you. Follow his path, read attentively, and, above all, think!The reward will be great."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"Before buying have read reviews.

Maybe fair enough. It was written when Einstein had achieved youthful fame, though, not in his dotage, if he had such a thing. It may be a little more difficult for the translation, but not much. Contrary to some reviewers, it is not that easy to follow, and if it seems like an easy read, you probably haven't understood it. There are many books written since where it is probably easier to learn about special relativity, to say nothing of the basic ideas of general relativity. But once you have started to get the hang of things, this book is a masterpiece of exposition! It allows one to follow Einstein's actual thought process in arriving at these theories -- pretty much by a process of pure thought -- more or less in the steps he probably took himself. There is not a word in the exposition that was not carefully thought out. So, learn the theory somewhere else and then read this book -- you'll understand the theory better for reading Einstein's book -- or read this book first, keep going back to it 'til it starts to make sense, and maybe consult some other, more &quot;user-friendly&quot; textbook at the same time.

So it's not surprising that he could explain both the concepts of special relativity and those of general relativity in clear, simple language suitable for the non-technical reader. The result is a masterpiece, especially the discussion of general relativity.The mathematics of general relativity in its applications is esoteric, to say the least; any reader who wishes to glimpse this can take a look at Robert M. Wald's book &quot;General Relativity.&quot; But the underlying ideas are very simple, simple enough to be easily grasped by any 11th or 12th grade student in an &quot;academic&quot; curriculum. The problem with them is that for most people the ideas are counterintuitive. The other books for laypeople that I've looked at go through all sorts of contortions to make the ideas plausible. Einstein doesn't. He proceeds steadily, simply and logically to show how special relativity follows from direct observation. Then he points out that special relativity is only useful in certain exceptional cases, and asks himself (and us) what properties a more general physical theory must have to be consistent both with observation and with special relativity. General relativity just lands in our laps as a result of this simple train of thought.I treasure this book."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"Do not buy the copy of this book with ISBN 978-1452841212 !!! You have been warned! The equations which are set out as images (ie any that require more than simple typesetting) have not been printed, and the text just shows the file name instead eg. eq1.gif. I can't believe that they're selling this book! The other copies are ok from what I have seen on the preview pages."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"This is a superb introduction to Special Relativity, which this writer, who is certainly no genius, was able to work through at age 18 (not without effort). The material on General Relativity (GR) is no harder, but much less detailed, so that one cannot hope to get a realistic idea of what GR is really about from this book alone. In fact, one needs considerable preparation in Physics and Math to even begin to understand the nature of GR.Unfortunately, the quality of American education has deteriorated enormously over the past three decades, so that even the typical senior Physics major at all but a dozen or so American universities can no longer be expected to cope with this book. This book is a serious introduction and not meant for the present American high school graduate with A's in English but typically eighth-grade reading skills, and whose Math skills consist only of a few faint memories. Nor does the American university, which has responded to the lowering of standards in the high schools by continually lowering its own standards, prepare the student for books like this. Customers who whine that this book shows that Einstein couldn't write English betray not only their own very low reading level and poor preparation (the book requires nothing more than non-AP high-school Math and Physics), but also their foolishness in believing that Einstein, rather than a native speaker of English, prepared the translation into English.For the dedicated reader, for whom learning is a mission, and who has learned his high school Math and Physics, this is an excellent book. It gives the dedicated and prepared reader the chance to interact with one of the greatest minds of all time. Einstein himself believed that any high-school student would be able to read this book with understanding, a belief was shown to be wrong even in 1917. (A reporter in Berlin asked Einstein's niece, then a high-school student if she had read and understood the book. &quot;Oh yes,&quot; she replied happily, &quot;everything but the part about coordinate systems!&quot;)That this book has endured so long (more than eight decades) in popularity is a testament to the genius of its author and his ability to explain Physics clearly. This is a book which richly repays the effort taken to read it."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"In his effort to create a &quot;simple explanation [of relativity] that anyone can understand&quot; Einstein comes close to perfection.His language is clear and lucid, and the thought problems he suggests in order to prompt his reader into understanding the faults of classical theory vs. the extraordinary coherence and power of the theory of relativity are downright fun. But make no mistake--this book is not easy.The concepts behind relativity are difficult to understand and require some patience on the part of the reader. At times, this difficulty is exasperated by Einstein's desire to keep his explanations succinct.I would start with Einstein's &quot;The Evolution of Physics&quot; in order to get a feeling for the general concepts behind relativity and behind physics in general before attacking this excellent but challenging book.That having been said, I LOVED every minute I spent reading this book and happily recommend it to anyone interested in twisting their brain around some wild problems with wilder solutions."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"While reading the reviews I noticed something. The special case was considered well written, while the general theory was considered difficult to follow. There is a simple explanation to this, Leopold Infeld (protege of Einstein's) helped in the rewriting of the Special Case, his English was much more fluent than that of Einstein. Infeld was also a superb teacher, as such he had a fluency and a rhythm with words that is easy to follow. I highly recommend any of Einstein's writings but also caution you as to his readability... On the other hand Einstein recognized this and coauthored with Infeld, (or rewrote with him previous writings), as such I highly recommend that you get those books coauthored or written by Leopold Infeld."},{"Title":"Relativity;: The special and general theory,","review":"Great for the young student of Physics!This is an excellent book, written in the \\"Master's\\" own style and faithfully translated from the German by Robert Lawson. The translation dates to 1920 and new readers may find the English a little quaint, but for all that, it is a great effort at presenting in \\"plain speak\\", the concepts of Relativity.The book starts with a lucid explanation of the Train and Platform example of Galelian Relativity and then proceeds to highlight the incompatibility between the principle of relativity and the constancy of the speed of light. Without encumbering the reader with the Maths (found in the appendices) the ideas of time dilation and length contraction are discussed. The General Theory is developed via a fine example: that of an observer on a rotating disk.This is a good complement to the overtly scientific/mathmatical books on the subject. Unfortunately,, despite its many qualities, just like many of the alternatives of this genre, Einstein's book does not fully succeed in explaining the complex concepts to the lay reader. Rather, this is a nice little book that will be suitable for a good calibre Maths/Physics student in the sixth form/high school."},{"Title":"Gardens for small country houses,","review":"This is a very good reference for all aspects of gardening, on a smaller scale than Biltmore! With only 3 acres, I can't use many of the large-scale garden features I see in most books. This is much more to my scale. I particularly loved the pergola and hedge sections. The planted-paving concept is referred to throughout, but the old Sussex church brick paving was another revelation--not in any other garden books I have seen, and I read a lot of them! This will be in my garden this year, planted with lawn chamomile.As another reviewer said, the photos are in black and white. The pergola sections don't need color to show the remarkable variation in structure. In fact, black-and-white serve better for all structural features. But if you desperately want to see color while you are reading this remarkable text, try \\"Arts and Crafts Gardens,\\" by Gertrude Jekyll and Lawrence Weaver. It's a newer 1981 edition of this book, with color watercolors, paintings, and drawings of the period to reflect the garden styles discussed in the text. There are a few photos of Munstead and other similar gardens, too. As far as I can tell without comparing the books side-by-side, all the text and the black and white photos and drawings from the original remain in the new edition, too, so you won't miss too much by going with the newer version. But I do like this original version better. I find myself going back to it over and over, and I learn something new each time. No wonder it's a classic!"},{"Title":"Gardens for small country houses,","review":"photographs are in black and white and thus of inferior help in planning a garden"},{"Title":"Pop Goes the Weasel: A Silly Song Book with Other","review":"This is a very fun book to read with the kids.

Don't get confused by the word 'theory.' There's as much math in here as Born and Wolf's P of O. The only diffenrence is Wilson's is much more algebra-based. The mathematics (i.e. isomorphs) is 'taught', without breaking the flow, and is not assumed that you know the stuff already--- or can find it somewhere else. This book stands out because there is more science in here than names of scientists, and his references are for real. I would also say it was unique because books with titles like 'Molecular Vibrations' are usually skipped over for titles like 'mechanics' or 'quantum theory.' Spectroscopy was a major advancement in science, and it is good to see it skillfully treated with enlightening clarity."},{"Title":"Molecular Vibrations: The Theory of Infrared and Raman Vibrational Spectra","review":"Reissue of original, which was published in 1955, in the pre-computer age.

You ask, \\"Gee Bob, how do you stay in such great shape and in the zone like you do?\\" Then Bob expains in a casual way his kung-fu yoga system. That would summarize my take on the book. It's easy to follow because he doesn't try to baffle you with...hype. The book could use a few figures to describe the poses/postures, and he sometimes uses the phrase, \\"hit the pose/stance/position described above\\" and there is no 'above'. But these are all minor techical details. He really comes across as someone who has had practical success at this type of thing and is passing his expeience along.WARNING: There is one paragraph where he asks the reader to imagine the best orgasm they have ever had, and implies this was acheived in cooperation with another person, persons, or ANIMAL (see page 74)!

I don't know if he was always so entertaining, but this is one book that is not dry on the subject of chakras, meditation, kundalini energy or personal transformation. With his awakened perceptions, well, you have to love it.....excerpt- \\"This awakening will cause you to deal with every aspect of your life, and how many people do you know who do all they can to avoid just that? My experience has shown that you can take the time to cleanse and balance your life on your own terms, or this energy awakening will force you to do it. Your physical/mental/spiritual self is like an onion. You can peel it back, clean it up and balance it one layer at a time or this energy cleansing will do it all at once, like smashing the onion with a sledge hammer. The exercises and principles in this book are designed to help you make gradual, incremental changes to your life rather than a shocking spiritual awakening that completely changes who you think you are.\\"\\"The Universe functions, in many ways, like a vast computer. Like any computer it gives you what you ask for, or what you've programmed it for, rather than what you want.\\"\\"Those who dance are often thought insane by those who can't hear the music\\" - George CarlinMorgen talks about the magic of life. That magic is what the normal people (gotta love them too) just don't get because they are not supposed to get it right now anyway. Since the Universe is perfect then Life is perfect and those who do not get that are perfect too. The magic is the Siddhi. This is an ancient Sanskrit word that means magic.Morgen writes, \\"One of the funny (and sometimes annoying) side effects to Inner Power is that you can develop abilities others don't have and probably don't believe in as the average Westerner doesn't have much first-hand experience with this stuff...... siddhis may touch on the spiritual or psychic realms. Many Meditation adepts report an increase in psychic abilities and the tendency to just know things (usually seen by non-adepts as being a smart-ass). In some cases you may find that you channel spirit guides (or ancient wisdom, or whatever you want to call it). One of the first things that a good meditation teacher should tell a student about the siddhis is; DON'T TALK ABOUT IT!' Rule #1 - You don't talk about Inner Power. Rule #2 - You don't talk about Inner Power. The reason is simple. As you get deeper into your self-awareness and deeper into the awareness of your interconnectivity, you're going to see, feel and experience things most people don't. If you talk about it, people will think you're seeing and hearing things that they don't and, of course, that's true. The usual response is to give you mind altering drugs and electro-shock therapy to make you \`normal' again.\\"Reviewer writes - Well, as you can see, I did not go numb reading Awaken Your Inner Power! because one never knows what is going to come out of Morgen's mouth.

For that, I think this book reads very as approachable.However, The content in it does not appear to have the level of self-restraint of a teacher, but more the awkward forced conversation of a salesman. The first half of the book is dotted with self-promotions for his other books and his website, not to mention grammatical errors that are more common within self-published books. The second half includes very understated descriptions of each chakra (we're talking 2 pages at most for each one), and then 'chapters' that span 3~5 pages on meditations, insights, etc. that are so underwhelming that it leaves me feeling more frustrated than not.I think he has a good start, but this book could use the aid of an editor, chapters that are way more fleshed out than they currently stand, and a lot less personal grand-standing about his other products -- I didn't buy this book so that every 5 pages I could find out about all the other stuff you wrote, I bought it in hopes of learning something."},{"Title":"Kundalini Awakening for Personal Mastery","review":"The author explains the raising of Kundalini in laymans terms.

Molly was given away for adoption as an infant, and has only known her adoptive parents. However, sheer chance brings her into contact with the man who is about to marry her twin sister, whom she never knew to exist. Filled with doubt, Molly follows Charles Landry to South Carolina to meet the family she never knew.As the story progresses, Molly learns about her biological family, and finds that there are some deep secrets that may have eventually led to her adoption years ago. The big shocking secret is that her adoption may have been a result of a kidnapping, and for some reason the family seems to know about the crime but refuses to shed light on it.As she learns about these family secrets, her life starts to take a turn for the worse, as she finds herself in danger and a target for murder.I really enjoyed this novel by Phyllis Whitney. I've been a fan of hers for over 20 years now, and her novels still have the same impact they had on me way back when. She hasn't lost her touch. Ms Whitney knows how to write a good romance mystery and is probably the best in the genre."},{"Title":"Woman Without a Past","review":"A review by HeatherThis story is about a woman named Molly who writes woman's mysteries. Her parents told her when she was young that she was adopted, and that they didn't know who her parents were. So Molly always accepted this and went on with life, when one day a man named Charles shows up at her work and says that she is identical to the woman that he was engaged to who lives down in Charleston, south Carolina on a huge plantation. So Molly goes with him and meets her twin sister Amelia and some other interesting characters who seem to not want her their. Then Molly finds out about a family murder, and about her dad that had a heart attack, and about her being stolen as a baby, and she is intrigued to figure out all of it.Molly in this story is very curios, and very trusting. Molly would always believe what everyone else would say. When her crazy mother took her in the middle of the night Molly believed that she was going to take her somewhere nice, but she didn't. And even after that Molly trusted her when she took her backstage of an old theatre. This book is a good mystery, but Molly didn't really know what was going on so the reader doesn't know either. Most of the excitement happened when she was in the theatre at the end of the book. But the book isn't very exciting in the middle and beginning. The author doesn't give you that much information about the deaths, so it can be boring.I would recommend this book for people who like mysteries without a lot of action. This is mostly a mystery book that makes you think about what happened and you have to examine the events in the book carefully to completely understand it."},{"Title":"Woman Without a Past","review":"I discovered Phyllis A. Whitney's books when I was a teenager. In a way, they were like an older version of Nancy Drew: mystery stories that add murder and a bit of romance (while still staying PG-13!). When I recently stumbled across WOMAN WITHOUT A PAST at a used book sale, nostalgia compelled me to pick it up.This book features Molly Hunt, an author of mystery novels herself. During her most recent trip to meet with her publisher in New York City, Molly is shocked when a visitor from the south claims that she looks exactly like the woman he is engaged to marry back home! This man, Charles, insists to Molly that she is Cecelia Mountfort, twin sister of Amelia Mountfort, and that she was kidnapped as a baby. Molly, who was adopted when only a year old and who knows nothing of her birth family, agrees to follow Charles back to Charleston, SC to meet the Mountfort family for herself.As is typical for a Whitney mystery, the plot gradually thickens; secrets are uncovered, and at least one murder is committed prior to the end of the book. These days, I don't usually read mysteries or romances, but Whitney does a nice job blending the two styles (with more of an emphasis on the former). For me, reading this book was a blast from the past that I thoroughly enjoyed."},{"Title":"Woman Without a Past","review":"Absolutely a delicious read! From beginning to end, Woman Without A Past grabbed the reader into a suspense filled, mystery personified read that could not be put down. From adoption to murder, this novel portrayed the feeling of needing to connect to the biological past that anyone that was adopted would feel, and intertwined between all the chaotic emotions associated with that quest alone, were unsolved murders and mayhem, a little madness, and a touch of romance.Romantic Suspense at its best!"},{"Title":"Woman Without a Past","review":"Lots of people have fantasies about discovering that they're the lost child of a wealthy, sometimes odd family. But that fantasy turns out to be overrated in Molly Hunt's case, in the soaked-in-Southern thriller \\"Woman Without A Past.\\" It's a pretty standard Phyllis A. Whitney tale -- smoldering PG-rated suspense, a memorable setting, and a plucky heroine.Molly Hunt has always known she was adopted, and she had no interest in knowing her biological family. But then she met Charles Landry, a man who claims to know everythng about her past -- she was abducted from the wealthy Mountforts of Charleston as a baby. What's more, he's engaged to her identical twin Amelia.So after some soul-searching, Molly goes to Charleston. But while Amelia is overjoyed to meet her long-lost sister, the rest of the family is not so happy to see her. Her stuffy uncle Porter openly believes her to be an imposter, her mother is mentally unstable, and her eccentric aunt Honoria claims that the spirit of her dead boyfriend is warning her of impending murder.As Molly is drawn deeper into the mysteries and secrets of the Mountforts, she realizes that her arrival has stirred up a bunch of old ghosts. Her father's death, an orphaned earring, and a man drowned under mysterious circumstances are all somehow entwined in her kidnapping -- and someone is willing to commit murder to make sure that everything stays secret.It's pretty obvious that Phyllis A. Whitney had immense affection for Charleston. \\"Woman Without A Past\\" is soaked in the atmosphere and history of the city, whether it's the luxuriant old plantation houses or the shadowy ghosts of past wars. The story drips with mossy, humid atmosphere, and it echoes with soap-opera skeletons in the closet.And the style is typical Whitney -- a PG-rated romance interwoven with lots of suspense and a murder mystery. She weaves in some elegant, poetic moments when she describes the beauty of Charleston, but the real draw here is in a fairly solid murder mystery, with many clues and almost as many suspects, but a genuinely surprising ending... although a few things, like Valerie's abrupt transition, are rather headscratchy.The most disconcerting part of the story is perhaps Molly herself. She's a fairly likable character, but she doesn't develop a lot. Also, the fact that she's a writer of romantic suspense novels called things like \\"Crystal Fire\\" feels a little... Mary Suey.Fortunately, the other characters are better-rounded -- eccentric psychic Honoria, the stuffy yet tormented Porter, the dignified servant Orva, semi-deranged girl-woman Valerie, arrogant golden-boy Charles and the gentle, girlish Amelia. Whitney even paints delicate, detailed portraits of the dead characters, so that they almost seem alive.Despite a self-insertish heroine, \\"Woman Without A Past\\" is a solid romantic thriller drenched in Deep Southern charm.

That's what this book focuses on. The book should be called \\"Mathematics Meets Mechanical Technology\\" since it focuses on solving mechanical problems involving gears, levers, pulleys, linkages, movement and mechanical transmission of power. This book was one of many on a graduate mathematics reading list which is why I chose it. It uses math but is not mathematical. Nothing beyond high school math (algebra, geometry (not the proofs), and trigonometry) is required. If you are a hobbyist, like to build mechanical devices, want to supplement a kinematics discussion in physics or applied math, or studying engineering then this book is useful. I don't think this is useful for someone who is only interested in \\"pure\\" math.

I was looking for a book that outlined Nixon as \\"depicted\\" in Films, etc. Monsell unfortunately considers Nixon's own personal appearances in TV and films as \\"depictions\\", which they are not. For example, he includes the infamous Checkers Speech. These are not \\"depictions\\"- which would be portrayals of Nixon by others. There are 4 basic schools of thought re: RN- the \\"Tricky Dick\\" school - the man who could say with a straight heavy jowled face that \\"If the President does it, it's not illegal\\", the \\"He was hounded out of office\\" school (which conveniently overlooks the fact that it was a bi-partisan effort that dislodged him), the grudging admiration group (who don't exonerate him, but found that they have to admit they like the man) and the \\"Everybody does it\\" apologists-defenders school (which overlooks the fact that while lies and manipulation come with politics, nobody before Nixon had ever gone so far as to sanction breaking and entering, or illegal wiretaps, or using the IRS to punish enemies, or obstruction of justice). Monsell falls between the second and the last groups. He comes across as an unabashed supporter and far from impartial reviewer not only of Nixon in Film, etc, but Nixon the man. It's easy to see that he's willing to gloss over Nixon's crimes by the way he reviews the different \\"depictions\\" of Nixon. This book was a disappointment.

Kasdorf has captured the experience of woman who have grown up, and asserted their person-hood in a world where they are viewed as sexual objects; and where the church has rarely been a help, and often a hinderance. Not for the faint -hearted or those looking for 'inspriational poetry' this collection of poems speakes deeply to me as a woman, and as someone who is strongly religious."},{"Title":"Eve's Striptease (Pitt Poetry)","review":"This is a wonderful book of poetry that inspires much reflection. Each poem somehow transforms itself into a fragment of my own life's story. The body becomes a main element of Kasdorf's work; religion is also a strong theme, addressing the bubble that tradition can form around believers."},{"Title":"Eve's Striptease (Pitt Poetry)","review":"A few months ago I wrote a review that started with the following sentence: \\"Bram Stoker had an awesome Dickensian name, awesome enough, in fact, that he should have written himself into the novel, perhaps as the villain or as the ridiculous character who clenched his eyelids shut, punched his fist in the air, and shouted \\"I'm BRAM!\\" each time the vampire hunting gang destroyed a coffin or accomplished something heroic.\\" My point there was that DRACULA was boring. It needed some extra flare, some action, something sexy and awesome.However, after I published that review on Goodreads, a friend noted that the ittsy-bittsy preview that appears on Facebook only read \\"Bram Stoker had an awesome Dick...\\" Not quite the sexy I intended.Then, a few weeks later, I downloaded and started reading the following three books: REAL SEX, PORNOGRAFIA, and EVE'S STRIPTEASE. I didn't think about it at the time, but it was starting to sound like I was on an erotica kick--literary erotica, of course.But all of those books were recommended by friends who, as far as I know, aren't keen on the sex (as the primary plot point) scene. And if that's your scene, your genre of choice, then I'm afraid you'll find these books a bit too abstinent. REAL SEX, by Lauren Winner of GIRL MEETS GOD fame, talks somewhat candidly about sex, but really it's a dry treatise on why Christians should only have sex within marriage. I got it for free (I would never pay for REAL SEX. Ha ha errrr...), and I haven't finished it yet. PORNOGRAFIA is more about weird old guys getting titillated through social engineering than about what we today think of as pornography, and while there may be some indecent touching, there's not a single sex scene in the whole book, or at least not in my translation.And that brings me to EVE'S STRIPTEASE. I suppose there are some sexy lines in this collection--it's a poetry collection; did I forget to mention that?--and a subset of the poems speak openly about the feminine body, but again, there was more sex in A PRAYER FOR OWEN MEANY, with its persistently virgin narrator, than in EVE'S STRIPTEASE.No, world, I am not exploring a new genre. Or at least not THAT new genre.In some respects, however, poetry IS a new genre for me. Yes, I occasionally edit poetry. Yes, I've read hundreds of poems in high school and college and at coffee shops and late at night on couches at friends' houses, but the idea of purchasing a poetry collection by someone I don't know and reading all of the poems therein is a relatively new one.Perhaps this means I'm a poor judge of poetry. Perhaps this means I lack a spectrum for knowing where a collection falls in comparison to other comparable books. Or perhaps it means I see poems with fresh eyes or that I bring a prose reader's sensitivities to the poesy project.Whatever the case, I can say that I liked EVE'S STRIPTEASE. I found my interest momentarily waning with the aforementioned feminine-focused poems (boo on me for being a prototypical male reader, I know), but Kasdorf quickly reeled me back in with her beautiful lines about family and city and universal longings. I don't know that I can describe what separates a good poem from a dazzling one, but I can say that this collection has an approachable blend of simplicity and image and experience and readaloudability that make it score well in the Andrew spectra of poetry analysis. And this collection includes lines like this \\"Every window in this apartment has bars, / and the door has a lock for each day / the Savior lay in the grave, / as though it's that easy to know / what we're supposed to keep out / and what we should try to keep in,\\" or in an earlier poem, \\"If I forget thee / let my tongue forget the songs / it sang in this strange land / and my heart forget the secrets / only a stranger can learn.\\"So if you're looking for a lay, go elsewhere, but if you're looking to get your hands dirty with some good poetry check this one out."},{"Title":"The eagle's shadow","review":"Reprint of the 1904 first edition with black and white illustrations by Will Grefe.

It opened up again for the first time in early 2005 as a venue for an art show, but no longer functions as a Lenin showcase.Yes, there are some interesting historical details in the book - but there are plenty of questionable claims too - example - Russian soldiers in WWII used their daily 100ml vodka rations to make Molotov cocktails to throw at the enemy.

Elora Danan takes the center stage literally and figuratively; she is the main character of Shadow Dawn instead of Thorn Drumheller, appropriate enough since it is obvious that this trilogy is her story.

That combined with a surprise ending no one would have suspected made this book a pure winner."},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"And I thought the Redwall series was good. This book was not only well written but it had an plot as well. i enjoyed the fact that nobody was as they seemed. It keeps you on your toes. Sort of like an X-Files episode."},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"In Shadow Moon, we are brought to Thorn years after the movie &quot;Willow&quot; took place and at first was a little slow, but once you're brought up to date, it flows along easily. With Shadow Dawn, it's three years later and you can see Elora has grown and continues to grow throughout the book. She learns the things she should of been taught all along. It's fast paced non stop all the way. I couldn't put it down. And when I did, it was reluctantly. I'm going to have a hard time waiting for the next book, wanting to learn how the deceiver came to be, which was very surprising who it is. I really enjoyed this book and highly recomend it."},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"I love &quot;Shadow Dawn&quot;. &quot;Willow&quot; is one of my favorite movies. When I found out there were books to follow I admediatly went out to my them. Now I'm waiting for the third and can't wait!! I still haven't been able to find a screenplay of &quot;Willow&quot; which I will continue to look for. &quot;Shadow Moon&quot; was good but I think that &quot;Shadow Dawn&quot; kept me slightly more captivated. But I still don't understand why they killed of two of my favorite characters, Sorsha, and Madmartigan. They gave the movie the flare, which I sorely miss. Perhaps Lucas and Claremont will find some interesting way to bring them back into the next book!!!! We can only hope."},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"Having picked up this book, with no notion that it was descended from the movie Willow or that is was a sequel to Shadow Moon, I found it perfectly capable of standing on its own. One does not need to have read the first book or seen the movie to enjoy it.Together, George Lucas and Chris Claremont have written a tangible piece of fantasy fiction. The story has believable characters, is descriptive and the reader empathises with the journey. The silver skinned Sacred Princess, Elora Danan stirs the imagination. The young heroine's impulsive and inquisitive nature drives the story and with a few very colourful characters to assist her along the way, it is a delight to be pulled into the pages.A beautifully composed, structurally comprehensive piece of work for all ages."},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"Things began to get confusing following the myriad trails of all the principal characters. It seemed repetitive and unnecessary. I wanted to resolve the confusion by going to Book III. Some of the writing resembles a script rather than a story with particulars that help the reader grasp the action."},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"A good book for more mature audiences, it's world is a little confusing to understand at first but as you read more you understand more. The magic and various other myth type ideas make it a very good book for those seeking adventure and even science fiction readers will like it."},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"This is the second book in the CHRONICLES OF THE SHADOW WAR (after SHADOW MOON), the sequel trilogy to the movie WILLOW. Being the second book in the series, I was expecting a lot less action and a lot more character development than in the first book. While the character development was definitely there, I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of action and tension that it contained. Chris Claremont takes his 17 years of writing X-MEN and developing those characters and applies that experience here with an expansive brush and colorful palette. Two years have passed since the end of SHADOW MOON and, although we missed out on the maturation of Elora Danan in those two years, this book gives the reader a vivid picture of how she begins to come into her own as a person and begins to discover what it means to be the Sacred Princess. As she and her companions begin to puzzle out who the Deceiver is and what his goals are, we see the little girl we knew in the first book start to become a young woman. By the end of the book, Mr. Claremont has turned her into this fiercely passionate woman who knows what must be done, if not how to accomplish it. Throughout this journey, the author populates the book with vivid and engaging characters. Each one is unique in their personality and in their relationship with Elora. We especially get a good look at Rool and how he relates to Elora without the smothering presence of Franjean. The characters are what drive this portion of the story, although the tension and action is there as well.The battle scenes in this book aren't as grand as in the first book, but they are just as compelling. The sacrifice of friends, the fight against all odds, and the trust shown for those guarding your back, Claremont ties all of these themes into each of the fights that our protagonists encounter. While the majority of the book was character and plot development filled with beautiful and compelling prose, the action scenes in between were gripping and had me turning pages at a hectic rate. Heart pounding action that left you wondering who would live and who would die.My one major problem with this book was the fact that one of the songs that Elora sang was a blatant ripoff of BRAVEHEART.......the film preceded the book by two years.Despite this bit of plagiarism, this was a compelling book. Almost better than the first one in terms of readability and reader involvement. I truly cared about the characters in this novel and wanted to see them succeed. A definite must read for any fantasy fan."},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"This is like getting dropped into a fantasy world, an instruction manual on their magic or an encyclopedia on their culture or maybe a museum display of their creatures-Fun and Fantasies. George Lucas must have realized, though, that this would eventually bore many people, so he nicely wove it together with a lot of wild action and really dramatic magic; the outcome was a quite wonderful book, and a great chance to slip into another world."},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"&quot;Shadow Dawn&quot; continues the new &quot;Willow&quot; saga fairly effectively, but the major problems in the book lie in the abilities of the writer. Overall, the story could've used a bit more polish and a pinch more originality; an entire scene in the book is blatantly stolen from the film &quot;Braveheart,&quot; while clumsily palliated in a story-within-the-story. While &quot;Shadow Moon&quot; gave us the future of the Willow saga so many of us had grown to love, &quot;Shadow Dawn&quot; stumbles along until finally reaching a morass of odd story twists and dragged-out characterization."},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"Better than Shadow Moon, but not by too much. The writing has improved, the characters are slightly more believable. But I still get the impression that I've missed something. The ideas flow from the authors faster than they can absorbed by the reader. It's like watching the T.V. with the sound off, you are only getting a portion of what is meant. I commented that the first book, Shadow Moon needed an impartial, unfamiliar editor to ask questions and to fill in the blanks for us. The same goes for Shadow Dawn. I finished the book as unsatisfied as if it had been put down in the middle. Again I ask &quot;What was that all about? What happened?&quot; Maybe part 3 will be better?"},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"I had just finishing reading Shadow Moon about a month before and was thrilled to find out that the sequel was due out anytime! No having to wait a year or two between stories, though I don't see how I missed it so long! Both books I could not stop reading. I know the characters are different from the movie &quot;Willow&quot;, but they are more captivating. I eagerly followed Elora through all her ups and downs, and was sorry the book came to end (though maybe now I will get some work done without the book in my hands!). I hope that there is a 3rd book, I do so want to read more about the characters I have come to love and I guess I will have to wait the traditional year or two this time. Oh, well...should be worth the wait"},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"I've heard and read quite a few reviews saying that these books were not good. It's a lie! Sure I'm only 11, but I personally think that these books are a wonderful challenge. The way they are written is good, and Elora is a great heroin. I'm almost done with the second book, and by now I fully think that it's a wonderful story line.Now true, I've never seen the movie, Willow, and perhaps it makes people expectant for a certain quality, but honestly, I find the story to be very good. Perhaps it's a good thing I didn't see the movie first. Anyway, I think the books are good, no matter if others don't."},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"Alright, credit where credit is due, Claremont has improved some from the frightful start of this trilogy- 'Shadow Moon'- but only just enough so that by the time you realize the novel is going nowhere you've wasted too much time to back out now.The chapters are still far too dense- a chapter of twenty pages takes nearly three times to wade through what those of a decent book would- most of the new characters introduced are one-dimensional bores and Claremont seems to make it a habit of killing off the few that aren't. On the plus side, Elora has become much more interesting and the few chapters where she's allowed to adventure across the land on her own are by far the best bit of the book. The underlying problem is that this is absolute middle of a storyarc so nothing much happens except what is needed to reenforce what happened in 'Moon' and pave the way to the inevitable showdown in 'Star'. Expect lots of pointless wandering and expository dialogue.Which brings me to the biggest problem of all: an Epic fantasy requires an Epic villain because, lets face it, Good vs. evil is nowhere near as exciting as Good vs. EVIL, and the story just does not deliver. Instead we are treated to baddies like The Deceiver, who is little more than a glorified zombie, and...wait for it...The Lord Of The Dance. That's right, gasp in shock and awe at the might of a guy who will literally two-step you to your doom. It's books like these that make me sincerely wish there was an emoticon for a smiley repeatedly banging their head against something hard an unyielding- perhaps the skull of whichever of the two collaborative 'geniuses' thought any of this would be a good idea.Cheer up, there's only one volume to go!"},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"I loved the movie, so when I heard about the book, I rushed to find it. I am absolutly obssessed with the movie and probably the reason I loved it so much was the humor between Sorsha and Madmartigan. I really liked Willow too. The book was good, I'll give it that, but I will always love the movie more. Why did the writers and George Lucas turn Willow into a cold, killing sorcerer, not the kind, self-concious farmer I fell in love with? I was so sad when I found out they killed off my two favorite characters! Why get rid of 3/4 of the reason I wanted to read the book? I thought the beginnig was hilarious because in my mind I could see Sorsha and Madmartigan (Joanne Whalley/Val Kilmer) fighting and making up. I was terribly disappointed that in this book they disposed of two of the greatest characters and substitued others that did not have that special quality"},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"A much better follow up to the first book, Shadow Star. It seems that Claremont and Lucas now had their bearings and had managed to get their thoughts organized into a comprehensible world where characters we have know since the movie have grown and changed (yet, as the saying goes, still stayed the same), characters we have known since the first book who are now familiar and much clearer in our minds, and new characters who add color to the world.Thorn (Willow) takes a smaller part than he did in the film and the first book, but that is only because the authors have discovered Elora. She has grown into a fully fledged character and not just the cute baby and bratty child we have known. This is her story and she is conflicted, flawed, carring, and a fully fledged character.There are people who have disappeared and never reappear, but you almost don't care, as the mystery of the world keeps you wondering and questioning with the rest of the characters as they try to prevent the many worlds from ripping themselves apart, not only internally, but from each other. This makes sense now that the mythology hinted at in the movie and established, however shakily, in the first book is now complete and alive.Reading it was a joy. There were moments where you will laugh out loud and rip through others as you race from the start of a fight or a chase till its end. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who plays Dungeons and Dragons, as some of the sequences just reek of being played out on a table with a twenty-sider and a character sheet.The ending manages to answer all of the questions critical to this book, while still leaving the more critical ones that hang over the trilogy only partially answered. You will be reaching for the final book the minute you end this one."},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"Love the cover art. It all started with loving the movie of course. I read book 1 while I was deployed. Book 2 was so exciting, I finished it in 32hrs."},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"Latest from book store is that &quot;Shadow Star&quot;, the third book in the series, is now scheduled to be in book stores on November 2nd, 1999."},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"This book is great can't wait for the third book since this one left you hanging at the end.Hopefully there is a third book to this series that explores a George Lucas property that didn't do very well. Chris Claremont shows he and Peter David are great Writers njo matter the meduim from book to comic book."},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"I enjoyed the movie &quot;Willow&quot; and the follow-up book &quot;Shadow Moon,&quot; so I eagerly bought &quot;Shadow Dawn&quot; when it came out. It wasn't so much a bad book as it was horribly derivative. A major speech late in the book mimics the main speech from &quot;Braveheart&quot; nearly point for point. Another character featured in the book - I kid you not - is revealed to be the Lord of the Dance. THE LORD OF THE DANCE. The book came out a bit after the big Michael Flatley/Riverdance craze, so I hardly think it was a coincidence. This uninspired, unoriginal book was a sore disappointment for me after the beginnings of the series.All the same, if you're a fan of Willow and want to find out what happens to Willow/Thorn, Elora and the rest, go ahead and buy it. Just don't say I didn't warn you."},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"The prospect of a book series expanding the world of Willow, and seeing the rest of the story develop convinced me to buy this book without a second thought. I should have had a second thought.The beginning had some potential, and familiar characters were making appearances, and I felt like the world was coming back. Then it felt to me like the author just gave up. A lot of characters die for no apparent reason, the world changes without explaination, and I couldn't figure out why characters were doing what they were doing now.This aside, the writing did nothing to fill in the blanks for me. Flashbacks, spirit traveling, story lines, and dialogue all mashed together into a tangled mess. It felt like the author knew what was going on and expected the reader to make due with vague discriptions, and random encounters. I felt like I was reading an idea for a book, not the finished product.My hopes, expectations, and excitement for this series have been chopped down like so many spotted owls. Disappointing would have been too kind a word to describe my feelings toward this series.To anyone currious about this book series, I offer this advice. Leave this one on the shelf. Don't be the next victom of cruel inadequecy."},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"I love to read and I've read some of the best books by the best authors and Im telling you the honest truth when I say that Shawdow Dawn is the BEST!

If you like to read, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"I loved Willow and I enjoyed this series especially once I got to book 3 but it is a hard sequel to the delightful original movie.However it is closer, but still darker than the original book written by Lucas for Willow.Another point I need to make. I previous reviwer complains about the character of The Lord of the Dance that appears. What this woman does not relize is that the Lord of the Dance is an old celtic song about celtic/christian mythos and was meerly used by Mr Flatley as his center piece of music for his show. The character has nothing to do with Flatley or his show but I can understand why people not into celtic music or tradition may assume it is from Flatley's show.Try these books they are quite good but do not look for a repeat of the movie!"},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"If you love fantasy and have yet to discover the amazing world of Willow, begun in the classic film by George Lucas and Ron Howard, then order these three volumes now and revel in the beauty of brilliant fantasy!Shadow Dawn continues the saga begun in Shadow Moon, itself a continuation of the film Willow. Here is all the action, warmth, colorful creatures and characters one expects from George Lucas at his finest, along with the dark fantasy action of Chris Claremont of &quot;X-Men&quot; fame.If this new world leaves you a little confused, jus go over to Lucasfan.com and log onto the Willow.com site - you will find all the info you will need to plunge into this all-enveloping world. &quot;Forget all you know...or think you you!&quot;"},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"The way I see it, George Lucas wrote a nifty script and Chris Claremont tried to turn it into a novel, but gave up after his first draft. There are so many disjunct segments that don't flow into the next segment. Lots of nice descriptions, but the plot isn't carried along well. There's even a cut-and-paste paragraph 3/4 through the book that was used 1/4 of the way into the book. And the Braveheart reference brought me right out of the book to roll my eyes. I just couldn't get into a book that uses another story from a totally different genre and can't carry the plot along. I faithfully read the whole thing, complaining all the while... my husband tore up the book when I finished it and threw it in the recycling box. I wasn't heart broken at all. I wouldn't want others to waste their time."},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"This book was a little slow to start as the character analysis draged on for about half the book but once you pass the mid point the adventure really takes off.

I picked Shadow Moon up because I'm an avid Star Wars fan, then couldn't put it down! So of course I wanted the second-which was even better!

For if she were to fufill her role as Sacred Princess, they really deeded to develop the character quite a bit more. as you read each of the main dream sequences Elora had with Kieron ( the first one a lot more than the rest ) you get this urge to go back to the front to look at the illustration of the Great Realms and how Elora is connected to each of the circles..Suffice to say..I eagerly await Shadow Star, and the eventual movies..(you dont think Mr. Lucas took the time to develop the story and put his name on it if he didnt plan to make them into movies eventually, did you??)"},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"First one was so bad I couldn't make it far into this one without giving up on the whole story.

Love the set!!!"},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"I just re-read this for the first time in a long time and was pleased to discover that it not only holds up but improves with time! The prose (which is very energetic and colorful) is no clunkier than that of GRRM, Robert Jordan, Brandon Sanderson or any of the other big fantasy authors; I doubt most fantasy buffs would even recognize bad prose anyway. But what separates this trilogy out and makes it (in my opinion) so engrossing is the wildly original world it is set in. There's no falling back on the tropes of Tolkien, Howard or the other classic authors of \\"epic fantasy\\" here: Lucas and Claremont create a completely new environment, this is \\"world building\\" of the highest order. Of course there's medievalism and magic, but the structure and details of this world are both admirably complex and refreshingly different from the norm (even now, fourteen years after its first publication). The characters are likable and their journey is big enough to justify three volumes.The basic story revolves around the machinations of a mysterious power called the Deceiver who is instigating the realms of man and faerie to war. The primary characters are a dwarf sorcerer who has left behind his wife and children to wander the earth in search of answers, a thirteen year old girl born to save the world who has been raised as a spoiled brat, and a female warrior who was killed long ago and has been resurrected but has no memory of her previous life.This is the second volume of the trilogy and much of it revolves around the involvement of the inscrutable Dragons in the \\"Shadow War.\\" These are some of the best and most mysterious dragons to ever appear in a fantasy novel. There's a bit too much detail and the descriptions fail here and there, but overall it is much better than the average sword & sorcery novel."},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"this is a book in a set of three that is based on the movie willow.if you lkie the movie you will love the books."},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"I read Shadow Moon back in high school, after reading and really enjoying the first few chapters of Shadow Dawn. Shadow moon seemed rushed and generally gave me the impression Chris Claremont's idea of plot was moving things forward so fast that the reader doesn't care about the questions raised earlier by the time their answers are revealed.He did this much less in Shadow Dawn, and in general it was a slower book which took its time with the characters and the setting. Yet what I was looking for was plot, and what plot it had still played his game of rushing everything together, namely in the last few pages.Enough about that. What I wanted to mention was that water boils easier, not harder at the top of mountains. This is a dumb little factual error towards the beginning. It almost seems as if Chris Claremont deliberately includes some middle-school or high-school level science in the story, but then occasionally gets it wrong! My other examples of this are much more nitpicky though.Another interesting thing he does is put the fictional culture pretty close to our own; they have chess and poker and Spice Islands, they make references to our literature when they speak. \\"Unfortunately, politics, like nature, abhors a vacuum.\\" In reference to Aristotle. Or is it Spinoza? I'm finding contradictory attributions. Oh well.Overall, I enjoyed the book but kept laughing at its flaws."},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"I read this without having read Shadow Moon or Willow and I thought it was great. I am an advid fan of fantasy and the D&amp;D genre. I found the book easy to follow with very few exceptions in the less eventful areas. After talking to friends we have come to the conclusion this book is easier to follow if you already have a strong fantasy &amp; folk lore understanding. The charcters were very vivid with the exception of Duguay which was done on purpose. I found myself never needing to stuggle to visualize the scenery or scenerio. This is a very good read."},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"I have to admit I was a bit disappointed in the first book, Shadow Moon, it started off with so much darkness. I remembered Willow's world as being full of humor and banter and now he's lost his family, his two best friends, and even his identity. And Elora was not turning into a heroine one could cheer for. I couldn't seem to shake this sadness for most of the book. This and the writing seemed a bit over done. But I still looked forward to the next installment and when it showed up I was very pleased. Elora's transformation is a welcome storyline and very believable. I love the personality they have created for her she's worth reading about. I love her affinity for dancing and her decision to cut her hair. I still miss the original characters I fell in love with and Willow is still sorrow incarnate (when he's around) but they have got me intrigued in a new group of characters and I am anxiously awaiting the next book. I know George Lucas won't let me down."},{"Title":"Shadow Dawn (Second In The Chronicles Of The Shadow War)","review":"It was all I had hoped for after reading the first one, Shadow Moon.

Too much description, not much action. I kept reading, though, hoping the next book in the series would be better, only to be disappointed. I skipped pages at a time just to get to some sort of dialog or action. The brownies supposedly had a great wit, but there was no evidence of it in the books. Too bad, they could've been a great plus, like Tas the kender in the Chronicles series. As far as the Elora, the wittiest she ever got was by sticking her tongue out in response to any lame jokes the brownies made.

They ride on a track fashioned of screwdrivers and TV antenna. The decorative details prove equally delightful. The engine's wheels are made of cap guns, rolls of film, batteries, ballpoint pen tops, toy handcuffs and wristwatch and compass faces. The train chugs forward with cotton steam pouring from a thread spool smokestack, and its toy truck, harmonica and nail clipper cowcatcher at the fore.A train station (the next stop) is built of fever thermometers, disposable razors, paint brushes, measuring tape, tennis rackets, silverware holders, an egg slicer and a vegetable steamer. The other scenes include a city-scape, general store, park and zoo, amusement park, sweet shop, hotel and circus.You get the picture.For anyone who can't figure out what's what, the author includes a seven-page appendix describing the type and number of trinkets with which she filled each scene.This book provides endless fun.--- Alyssa A.

I agree with the review and hope for a sequel, which would make a great series!"},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"This book is full of clever ideas on how to trick the eye into thinking things are not what they seem.

Hope the receiver enjoys it!"},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"My daughter especially likes the &#34;find the differences&#34; aspect of this book, but also identifying the look alike items. She's 4 and loves I Spy, so I thought she might enjoy this too."},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"I've actually bought this book three times; it magically disappears from my classroom each year. The visuals make it a perfect picture book for all ages."},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"This book is an extension to the books my two children had as youngsters. Great family simple entertainment, not a video game!"},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"Joan Steiner's \\"Lookalikes\\" books are nothing short of ingenious. She assembles diverse everyday objects such as pencils, dog biscuits, thermos bottles, batteries, pasta, spools of thread, and an endless number of other items, and with them she creates trains and movie theaters, farms and corner stores. Her scenes are full of wonder; the quest to identify all the objects is amazingly great fun both for children and adults. At the end she provides a list of items used in each scenario, proving the subtitle correct: \\"The More You Look, the More You See\\"! A truly remarkable series of books by an endlessly inventive creator."},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"Bought this as a present for my nieces from Amazon.com after reading (or should I say \\"finding\\")it with my grandkids. Kids love it, and so will adults."},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"\\"Look-Alikes\\" is a compulsively fun book for both kids and grownups. Big colorful pages tell a simple narrative of travel and city life through huge static phenomenally detailed photos of dioramas that a chock-a-block with fascinating detail and hidden visual jokes. For example, a concession stand at a train station is made out of a funnel; the 40s retro lighting fixtures at an old style deli are actually white rubber drain plugs. The central activity is to locate and identify these visual tricks. There's a snippet of text on each page that list some of them for you to find - some easy and some devilishly hard.Beyond the \\"Where's Waldo\\" type gameplay, these images succeed on a several other levels as well. They are big and colorful and a visual feast of detail and happy narrative content. They are superb dioramas which fascinate the modeling monkey bone. They are full of trains and people and buildings and scenes. The whole assemblage conveys happiness and order while simultaneously conveying zaniness and wild abandon. It's totally great! I'd put the age range from 5 to 95."},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"My Grandson had checked out a couple of the Look-Alike books from the Library. He really liked them, so I decided to get him one for his 5TH birthday. He really enjoys finding the look alike objects in the pictures, and spends a long time for a five year old doing so."},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"My twin 5 yr old boys love these books. It has become a night time ritual with them. There are so many cool things to spot. I would recommend this book for anyone looking for something to do during quiet time."},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"We found this book to be fascinating. The whole family (including children ages 5 and 10) could not put it down. Even though the children could not specifically identify all of the objects, they recognized many of the household items. The book provided us the opportunity to point out objects the kids may not have seen before and discuss their names and many uses. This book proved to be very educational and we plan to purchase another for our school library."},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"I have not seen this book yet, but I saw one of the pictures from it in Nickelodeon Magazine's August issue, and was very impressed.A miniature park and zoo were constructed in painstaking detail, and incorporated into the three-dimensional scene were over 100 different everyday objects, such as hairpins, food, game pieces, matches, and jewelry, all used in the cleverest ways so that one really has to study the picture to notice them all.I enjoyed searching for the items so much that I can't wait to get the whole book! If the book is full of such pictures, I am sure it will appeal to adults and children not only for the fun of picking out the items, but as an art book as well."},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"Initially, my 7-year old Grandson picked out this book at the library. He reads well, but he's not a book person. He's a boy. However, this book so captured his imagination that I had to run right out and buy it. It fascinates me too. This is one of our favorite \\"look at together\\" books, and probably will be until he's quite a bit older. You'll be asking yourself \\"Did someone really make these?\\" This is a great bargain."},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"My mom, sister, and I all read this book at once and by the time we were bored our eyes hurt. Its amazing how the longer you look at the pictures you see more and more objects that you never suspeced were there. This is a great book for detailed oriented peeps."},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"I bought this book for my nephews and niece (ages 11, 9 and 4) who came to visit this summer. I was so excited at purchase! The incredibly clever scenes take hours to comb through, and you really view a lot of these objects differently after seeing the book. (Buildings made of fig newtons; thumbtack glassware at the soda fountain; an upside-down iron as a boat.)However the actual children were a bit blown away. They looked at it and were interested, however many of the objects used were things they'd simply never seen and so couldn't pick out. What 4-year-old can tell that a bunch of tulips is really pistachios on sticks? Even the 11-year-old had never seen a flour sifter and therefore wasn't impressed by the sifter/water tower.On the other hand, their mother (age 34) and my boyfriend (age 33) spent as many hours as I did on this book and are still delighted with it.I personally collect beautiful children's books as a cost-effective alternative to coffee-table books. For my purposes, Look-Alikes is absolutely perfect."},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"Look-Alikes and Look-Alikes Jr. were show-stoppers at my house this Christmas. Poring over the pictures is an absolutely great activity that everyone, all ages, can join. The only problem we had is that there wasn't room for everyone to look at the book at the same time.Something she doesn't say in the book but does reveal on the CD-Rom: these are photographs of actual dioramas, not photo- or Photoshop-collages. Amazing!!"},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"The pictures in this book are just stunning, and so clever. I've had this book for a year now (we keep it in our bathroom) and I've still not found everything!Each photograph is magnificent, and well taken, while the collages - for want of a better name - are really ingenious. Some objects take forever to find - the peanut pony tail, the mushroom car tires, and some are perfectly obvious, though you'd never have considered that a disposable razor could look like a vacuum cleaner. It's beautiful to look at and fun to explore. If only Steiner had left it at that and not tried to write poetry to go with it. The rhymes are unbelievably inane and stilted and take away from rather than add to the book.This edition may actually be too difficult for children, as many adults seem to have trouble finding all the objects. \\"Look-Alikes Jr.\\" came out soon afterwards and is much simpler, though just as much fun; much more suited to the under 12's and the less patient!This book will last so long and provide so much enjoyment that it's well worth buying for the whole family."},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"This is a book that has been entertaining to all family members from the age of 9 to 78 years of age. Each person who picks it up cannot bear to part with it. The colors and photo layouts of each page are filled with warmth and depth. Even without close scrutiny the immediate &quot;feel&quot; of the photos is that you are glimpsing into a moment of time long gone. There is an &quot;old world&quot; feel to the pictures. Upon closer review you are repeatedly amazed at how your eye first deceived you. Absolute creative genius is what makes this book one to purchase-for any age. Especially wonderful for those who love puzzles and DETAIL. No detail is left out and no detail is left to its own nature. A twist on reality that delights you with every turn of every page. A must buy for sure."},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"This is a wonderful book. My ten year old son loved it! He spent hours looking at all the pictures and trying to figure out how they were made. You can see something new in each incredible picture every time you look at it! Our school library has ordered several copies. The creativity in this book is just too much fun."},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"Welcome to a land where the more you look, the more you see. Teddy bears made from peanuts, chairs from pretzels, dresses from balloons. Entire scenes like a coffee pot train, a station roofed by badminton raquets, a harbor made from...everything! This artist's imagination gives your eyes &amp; your ability to discern what it is you are seeing a real, awesome workout. What a gift this book will make!"},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"I purchased this book 4 days ago and my 3 children (5, 9 and 11) haven't put it down. They keep finding more and more look a likes everytime they open the book. It's brought them closer together also by sharing with eachother what they found. I'm hoping Joan Steiner will write a sequel."},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"Joan Steiner's \\"Look-Alikes\\" is endlessly interesting for kids and adults alike. This self-taught artist employs everyday items--tea bags, Fig Newtons, miniature hair combs, matches, tissues, strips of licorice, graham crackers, torn-up sponges, pencils, and so much more--to create the most astonishingly lifelike scenes.You can see everything from a port city with boats arriving to a soda shop to a candy store to a classroom, each filled to brimming with trinkets and everyday articles of every kind, each employed as something other than what it really is (Fig Newtons as seat cushions, for example). The result is utterly fascinating. You will spend hours looking through the book--you may even, as I have, try to hide it from your kids so YOU can finish looking at it! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"All three of my children love this book. It's fun to sit with your child and look at the creative way things around your house are used to make a picture. This is one of the most creative books I've seen for children!"},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"Beware, all the pictures in this book have already been published in different cover, an earlier edition. If you think it is a new book of Steiner's work, it isn't, so don't get suckered."},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"My 3yo son and 37yo husband both love this book (as do I). We can easily spend half an hour or more every evening playing a modified I-spy game - and it's no easy feat keeping a 3 yo entertained that long. I would highly recommend it for travel, except that it's a large size book which makes it a bit unweildy to carry."},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"This is a another book filled with fascinating ways the author puts together pictures using common everyday items. You'll never look at ordinary items the same way again once you see how she creatively puts together her pictures. Children and adults alike will be fascinated by this book. If you want to give a child a book he or she will look at over and over again, this is a good choice."},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"My kids love these books. My son checked one out at the school library. My husband and I were amazed at the detail these pictures have. It puts I spy to shame. My kids look at these books all the time. Great for the car, or restaurants, they keep my seven and four year old happy, and I also enjoy looking at all of the cool pictures. They use everyday items and combine them into ordinary things. For example a chair might be made up of pretzel sticks for the legs, a ritz cracker for the seat, and something else for the back. There are hundreds on each page! Amazing!"},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"Joan Steiner is amazing. I saw some of the dioramas pictured in this book at the New York State Museum recently and was amused and delighted at her ability to trick us. Appearances can really be deceiving! I bought my copies for those who are convalescing no matter their age."},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"We gave this to my nephew for his 8th birthday. He and 3 other kids ages 2 to 4 were mesmerized, even during the party, and grownups were fascinated. I can only speculate as to the kind of stuff that goes through this author's mind! The patience and attention to detail that went into these elaborate scenes are very impressive."},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"Everytime I look at the pictures in this book I see something I didn't see before. This is a book that you will enjoy as much as your kids enjoy. The creativity and imagination in these books are inspiring and motivational. Now when I look at a thimble, a button, a matchstick, or any other everyday object around my house, I don't just see the object, I see many other possibilities. Thank you Joan Steiner for making 4 generations in our family laugh and smile!"},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"Everyone in our family loves this book. I was so pleased with the book that I ordered more to give to families as a Christmas gift. This creative book will keep you picking it up again and again. I can hardly wait for Volume 2..."},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"I purchased this book on a friends recommendation. My family enjoys looking at the pictures together - always finding something new."},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"What a fun and wonderful book. I bought it for my 4 yr. old son and we are often discovering new things everytime we read the book. I think the author has a winner."},{"Title":"Look-alikes","review":"My mother, father and I spent an hour trying to name all the objects on each page. Every time we came back to a page there was a new item to discover. This is great for inquisitive minds whether they be young or old. My neice (age 5) adores this book and is always searching for specific items as suggested in the back. A great gift for the Holiday season or a birthday!"},{"Title":"A Trim & Terrific Louisiana Kitchen: Southern Favorites","review":"This cookbook has been our favorite for the last couple of years. At first glance, the recipes appear to be too simple to be exciting, but somehow they pack a lot of complexity and flavor into a few ingredients. It is the PERFECT cookbook for everyday after work cooking, but there are also plenty of recipes that you will want to serve your guests too.

I find myself reaching for this one over and over again. The stuffed artichoke tastes just like you get in New Orleans!"},{"Title":"Civil Procedure (Hornbook Series)","review":"The &quot;book description&quot; above belongs to a different book: this hornbook is not part of the &quot;Black Letter Series,&quot; its author is not Professor Clermont, and it doesn't come with a handy computer disk.It is, however, an extremely helpful hornbook to have and use during your first-year course on Civil Procedure. If you're a One-L, buy this early and use it often; it'll go with pretty much whatever casebook you happen to be using (mine was Yeazell). It's extremely well-designed and its discussions are clear and sound.If you're looking around in order to decide whether you need a hornbook at all, the answer is: yes, you probably do. There may be students who can squeeze a profitable education out of the &quot;casebook&quot; approach, but I'm not one of them and you probably aren't either.During your first semester, it will be tempting to spend a lot of time briefing cases. Don't let me talk you out of doing so, or you'll be really mad at me the first time you get called on unprepared. But you'll probably be better off spending a little less time briefing and a little more time reading this hornbook first."},{"Title":"Civil Procedure (Hornbook Series)","review":"This is the most helpful study aid available for Civil Procedure! The text is very easy to understand and it is orgainized to follow the progression of the law school course. The authors do an excellent job of explaining the development of personal jurisdiction and subject matter jurisdiction to the present day. It also does a fine job of explaining the federal rules (and includes an index of each FRCP and where it is cited)."},{"Title":"Civil Procedure (Hornbook Series)","review":"This is another in the long line of hornbooks from West publishing. It is an excellent source to supplement and even embellish the law of Civil Procedure contained in whichever casebook you are using. Since most Civil Procedure courses are a year long, I would strongly recommend investing in this hornbook, it is very handy to have when outlining and preparing for finals."},{"Title":"Civil Procedure (Hornbook Series)","review":"I used these tapes as a supplement to class work and found them very helpful. In my Civil Procedure II class I ended up with an A."},{"Title":"Time Capsule 1956 - A History of The Year Condensed From The Pages Of Time","review":"Eisenhower crushed Stevenson in November, after Stevenson defeated Kefauver in the Democratic primaries. The Eisenhower Administration halted the invasion of Egypt and the Russians reached the suburbs of Budapest, Hungary. The New York Giants won their first National Football Championship since 1938 defeating their arch-rival, the Chicago Bears. Floyd Patterson became the youngest undisputed heavyweight champion of the world halting Archie Moore's title dreams. There is so much more and if I tell you anymore, you won't buy the book. Of course, you will buy it, because I just gave you the taste from my salad, not my dinner."},{"Title":"Joseph Knight","review":"When a friend of mine pointed to several paintings of sailing ships on his dinning-room wall and asked what type of ships they were, I replied \\"Clippers.\\" He replied \\"Slavers\\". His family had made their fortune in the 18th century in the triangular trade from Scotland to Africa and then to the West Indies. I had not been aware of the involvement of Scots in the slave trade until then. Having just finished Robertson's book, I now feel I have a good grasp of not only the extent of the involvement of Scots with slavery, but also a feel for the nature of their involvement. As advertised, this book is everything historical fiction should be -- a great read and highly informative (obviously well-researched).I particularly enjoyed the use of dialect and the wit of 18th century Edinburgh at the height of the Scottish Enlightenment. That section felt so authentic that I imagined sitting at the table enjoyng a glass or two of Claret with Boswell and company. The only part of the book that did not work too well, I think, was the use of a long letter (from Paisely)that described a meeting with Joseph Knight.But the book is more than just an historical novel -- it explored the meaning of slavery and of freedom: not something I had ever pondered about before.A great and satisfying read."},{"Title":"3ds Max 6 Animation and Visual Effects Techniques (Graphics Series) (Graphics Series)","review":"I love this book! It makes sense of things in 3ds Max that I couldn't quite grasp before. I'm finally getting over the learning curve for lots of stuff in Max! Ya, this book is was made for more experienced people but I'm mostly a novice and it all seems to make perfect sense for me. I would have to recommend this book for anyone who likes animation and modeling."},{"Title":"3ds Max 6 Animation and Visual Effects Techniques (Graphics Series) (Graphics Series)","review":"Up-to-date sprung to my mind when I skipped through this book. It follows the paradigm of building a short animated film from scratch using all the latest features of 3ds Max 5.1 and Character Studio 4. It even has a chapter devoted to Combustion 2.1. Some of the chapters I was most impressed with were the human body modelling chapters. Finally someone has added a FULL tutorial on how to model a human body from scratch! The effects chapters are amazing too, thick, hollywood explosion techniques! Woohoo! I would say this book is aimed for someone who has used Max for quite sometime and knows a little about modelling. But I recommend this book to anyone that has Max!"},{"Title":"3ds Max 6 Animation and Visual Effects Techniques (Graphics Series) (Graphics Series)","review":"This book presents a good overview of the CG industry, with a few topics I've not found elsewhere. However, it is discouraging to work through a book that is filled with cheesey looking renderings. That's right, horrible. I don't mean to flame or be destructive in my criticism, but if you could only see the color plates contained in this book, you would treat the author with skepticism at best. I still can't understand how someone who obviously knows the tools he uses very well, i.e. MAX and Combustion, can turn out such B-rated models and renderings. This book is a good example that no matter how much technical knowledge you have, computer software, no matter how advanced, will never make up for an utter lack of artistic talent. Sanford Kennedy is very technically knowledgeable but his artistic skills are virtually noexistant. Try checking his website for an example of the 'great' renderings you can aspire to if you buy this book. 90% of the pages aren't even up, or have been under construction since 2001. www.sanfordkennedy.com"},{"Title":"3ds Max 6 Animation and Visual Effects Techniques (Graphics Series) (Graphics Series)","review":"This is appalling, the models are terrible, the animation amateurish, and the texturing ugly (horrible misuse of procedural textures). Avoid if you can, there are many fine books on Max, this is NOT one of them."},{"Title":"3ds Max 6 Animation and Visual Effects Techniques (Graphics Series) (Graphics Series)","review":"This book leads me to believe that: a)I will NEVER be able to animate ANYTHING with a bone structure; b)I will NEVER understand the skin modifier; c)I must be a complete dolt.I know for a fact that I am not a dolt, having worked in the animation industry for some time now, and being an intermediate 3ds Max user. A lot can be said for Max, pro's and con's, but possibly the hardest thing (for me) is animating the human body. We spent about 10 minutes in college learning this, and all the notes I have and Max Bibles and everything else do NOT teach (in layman's terms) HOW TO ANIMATE A HUMAN BODY.This book was intended as a resource to learn how to animate a completed human model; I am not interested in learning the dreaded techniques of modeling a human just now, as this expansive learning curve is too detailed and time-consuming for me at the moment. Rather I was hoping to modify an existing model (free domain, of course!) and learn to animate it.The models on the cd which accompanies the book are okay; they're not top of the line, and quite frankly, the nipples on the female body are a bit over the top (its really cold in virtual reality!!), but they are workable. The bone structure is fine. The textures are horrible, and the animation itself is cheeeeeeeesy, but for a learning tool its not that bad. Beware any positive sentiment you may have derived from that last comment, as the book and tutorial in general is horrible.I have tried and tried and tried to skin this model over and over and over again, only to find the exasperating and frustrating errors of 'envelopes' associated with the model which, I assume, the author purposely created for 'teaching' the correct way to utilize the skin modifier. However, the instructions for troubleshooting this UNFATHOMABLY FRUSTRATING problem leave far too much to be desired; in essence, the instructions do not explain enough. My model is naked, and the skin on his hands is like a rubberband being stretched to its fullest capability. And no matter how many times I try to figure out how to fix this, I am left without a working answer. The book does not cover the troubleshooting of this error more than a line or two aimed for the expressly expert 3d Max user.For instance, \\"....this indicates that the skin envelope needs to be adjusted.... Select one of the envelope adjustment handles...\\" ENVELOPE ADJUSTMENT HANDLES?! WTF ARE THOSE? IS ANYTHING LABLED 'ENVELOPE ADJUSTMENT HANDLE?' NO!! The book continues, \\"...move it to enlarge it...\\" MOVE IT? WHERE? HOW? THE ENVELOPE IS UNEFFECTED BY MY ATTEMPTS TO 'MOVE IT.' \\"... Part of the skin that is sticking up should move down to the hand. Repeat this process for both ends of the skin envelope....\\" !!!!!!!There are TWO parts of the skin envelope? WHAT?! WHERE?!!This is what I mean - no explanation. Nothing is labled properly. When I attempted to assign all the bones in the skin modifier, I noticed over HALF of the bones ARE NOT LABLED AS BONES! WTF?!Believe the criticisms already posted: this book is horrible, it will leave you feeling uninspired to animate humans and frustrated, and is a real waste of time and money."},{"Title":"3ds Max 6 Animation and Visual Effects Techniques (Graphics Series) (Graphics Series)","review":"Kennedy's book teaches some basics but the quality of his results leaves alot to be desired. It makes you wonder why he would slam the incredible 3D done in Final Fantasy when he isn't even in the same league and probably never will be. The illustrations and textual layout are not as clear as they should be. If you want to learn the basics, you can get something from this book. However, a good book shows you how to get good results. The results he achieves in this book are subpar.Many other books do far better.Not recommended."},{"Title":"3ds Max 6 Animation and Visual Effects Techniques (Graphics Series) (Graphics Series)","review":"I'm stunned that the author claims to have success in this industry given the absolutely horrible work he passes off as being professional in quality. I'm very serious that I have not seen such poor quality in ANY other book. I teach 3D and have seen much better work from novice students. My only conclusion is that the author completely lacks the capacity to be self-critical of his own work given that he obviously believes his film-in-progress merits serious consideration. Do not be misled into thinking that any of the work shown in this book would be acceptable commercially."},{"Title":"3ds Max 6 Animation and Visual Effects Techniques (Graphics Series) (Graphics Series)","review":"When i saw the firt pictures of this book, I was totaly chocked..

Now, as my Shogakukan Dictionary rests on the bookshelf under a thick film of dust, I could not possibly be any happier with this book. To begin with, it contains enough information to be useful to an advanced student of Japanese such as myself, but is still easy enough for a beginner to use. The text is all in romaji and English, making it remarkably easy to find what you're looking for. The definitions contain verb conjugations and references to both synonyms and antonyms, making it easy for a beginner to compensate for a limited vocabulary base. Additionally, the book contains appendices which cover basic concepts of Japanese grammar and culture. From Kana charts to verb conjugations to a list of festivals, these reference sections give you convenient access to information that can be a pain to find when deeply entrenched in your work. They are unbelievably useful for solving the problems that arise in completing such difficult tasks as writing compositions and doing lengthy translations. They also prove useful to the beginner who is struggling with conjugating verbs and/or modifying adjectives. The extras don't stop there, however. The back of the book contains a small English-Japanese Dictionary that is so incredibly efficient that a separate English-Japanese Dictionary is often not necessary. As a result, the stack of Japanese dictionaries that I used to find it necessary to use on difficult projects has been replaced by this book alone. In fact, couple the Merriam-Webster's Japanese-English Dictionary with a decent kanji dictionary and you're set! If you are a student of the Japanese Language or are looking for a quick reference guide for translating to and from Japanese, then this is the one book you simply cannot work without."},{"Title":"Merriam-Webster's Japanese-English Dictionary","review":"I've been studying the Japanese language on my own for six years now. Of all the Japanese-English dictionaries I laid my hands on, this one has been the most helpful and the one I take anywhere.This compact version of my favorite M/W Japanese Learner's Dictionary has every word listed explained sufficiently, and differences in usage are shown in the examples.

Words with same kana writing but different kanji are written in separate entries as well.A quick reference for translating from English to Japanese is also included in the back, but since it's only the dictionary form, you'll have to conjugate it before using it.Grammar notes, counting suffixes, era tables in Japanese history are also included.You'll need a separate reference for kanji, by the way."},{"Title":"Merriam-Webster's Japanese-English Dictionary","review":"Like many students of Japanese I have several dictionaries, but this is the one I keep coming back to.

(Maxwell Macmillan Chess Series)","review":"Intended for less-experienced players, this book covers about 24 major openings and their major variations. This is a great book for anyone with limited time and experience but who doesn't want an encyclopedia or some Grandmaster deciding for him what his opening &quot;repertoire&quot; should be. When I was under 1700 I loved this book because I could get a general understanding of several main openings and get a taste of what seemed interesting. If you're a relatively lower-rated player, you'd probably be better off investing most of your time on tactics, and leaving those 20 move variations to the masters. This is a good way to start towards mastery (from a 2087 player). Why isn't this book 20% off?"},{"Title":"Chess Openings--Your Choice!

Did not play him but will, one of these days. It's a good modern over view, similar in style to Reuben Fine's &quot;Ideas behind the openings book&quot;. Its excellent as your first opening book, gives a great overview in a compact size. I would recommend for anyone under 1600. However what spoilt it was one of the IMs mentioning that Stewart was not that strong a player which is a fact, he'd just below 2200. That's 600 points above a 1600 player so do not be too concerned. What redeemed the book for me was his clear lay out and style. As the years have gone by I have returned and looked at the variations, they have all proved solid. Some of his pet lines are there (He tells you that!). There are words of wisdom spread out through the book, including choice of repertoire, further reading and an over view of pawn positions. My guess is that Stewart was an IM once upon a time. My only wish was that this had been my first opening book I think my opening knowledge would have progressed faster and further. In my opinion this is the closest natural successor to Fine's classic. And Stewart if you one day need a hand to revise this one email me!

The section of the book that discusses the tax system's effect on labor supply, saving &amp; investment, incentive to work, international competiveness, and other economic 'macro' effects, is especially insightful. The authors conclude (probably correctly) that the tax system's effect on these things is probably marginal, and, in any event, difficult to measure empirically. Therefore, any tax reform that promises 'economic nirvana' should be taken with a grain of salt. The authors suggest, without endorsement, that the hallmarks of any new (or improved) tax system should be simplicity, enforcability, and revenue- raising efficiency; the last denotes the absence of 'social tinkering' through the tax system. Unfortunately, the authors note that all of the various tax reform proposals being floated by politicians suffer severe political defects. A national sales tax would be difficult to enforce (that's probably correct); a broad-based value added tax (VAT) would be highly regressive; the 'flat tax' (wage tax) would be less progressive than the current income tax; and the consumed income tax (consumption tax) would be more complicated than the current income tax (that's probably not correct, and the authors do not explain this assertion well). These are principally political impediments to reform- the authors suggest that it will take an act of political courage by Congress or the president to make any progress on the tax reform front. That's clearly correct, but don't hold your breath."},{"Title":"Taxing Ourselves: A Citizen's Guide to the Great Debate over Tax Reform","review":"Tax reform isn't usually one of those topics that gets people excited -- most people view it the same way George Bush looks at broccoli.

So much of what we take for granted was denied to many, many women in history, as the story of Margaret Newcastle makes abundantly clear.17th century women were supposed to be self-effacing and obedient to the males in their family --- fathers and brothers while unmarried, husbands after marriage, male children in widowhood. Any attempts at intellectual pursuits ---or any kind of personal achievement or merit outside the domestic sphere--- stood a serious risk of being ridiculed or scorned. Interestingly, it was other females who were sometimes the harshest critics of those who dared to flout convention.But Margaret Cavendish, Duchess of Newcastle, was not an ordinary woman. She was fascinated by the world around her --- colours, shapes, sounds, textures, human beings and animals, celestial bodies... she hungered for knowledge and information. By her own admission, she also yearned for approval and recognition. And, despite her poor education (common to most women of her time) and possible dyslexia or some similar problem, she was a prolific writer. She wrote plays, physics and philosophy tracts, memoirs, poetry, a biography of her husband. And, far from modestly circulating these works among friends, as other women writers did, she actively sought publication and recognition, sending her books to scholars and universities and debating with learned men about current discoveries and issues. Some considered her a wonder, some thought her an eccentric --- but there can be no doubt that she made an impression on many of her contemporaries.In choosing the life of a 'learned woman' and deliberately turning her back on traditional female roles and activities, Margaret was lucky to have the continued encouragement and support of her much older husband, a royalist nobleman with similar intellectual interests. Indeed, like a previous reviewer said, her high social status and her husband's continued support ensured that opposition was never too outspoken or vocal.The merit of her works is rather questionable --- I adhere to the opinion that, had it not been for William's endorsement of her books, she would have undergone humiliations much worse than the mild mockery and skepticism she sometimes encountered. One of the flaws of Katie Whitaker's otherwise painstaking essay is that it curiously omits any clear or balanced assessment of the value of Margaret's output. Margaret, who confessed that she (at least in the early years of her writing career) could not be bothered to read much, and whose scientific training was reduced to conversations with her husband and other noblemen who dabbled in physics and chemistry, did not think it arrogant to write lengthy books expounding on her opinions, or to debate with scientists and philosophers. One gets the definite feeling that she enjoyed writing more than she did studying. Certainly she is not taken seriously, either as a scientific or philosophical writer, by anyone today --- and her plays and stories don't seem to have made it across the centuries either.Whitaker also chooses not to dwell on her greed and the avid and unkindly way in which she sought to deprive her husband's children of their rightful inheritance --- or on her harsh treatment of her husband's impoverished tenants, for that matter. These are barely mentioned, with no critical judgment. Yet I felt that, as the less appealing traits of an otherwise commendable woman, they should have been analyzed.Another problem I had with this book (admittedly not the author's fault) was the extremely small and cramped print, which made it very difficult to read. It's a pity that such an interesting story should be disseminated in such a cheap, sloppy edition.But my overall assessment of the book is positive. The story is well told --- and, whether or not her works had any real merit, or at least serious study behind them, the woman herself was no doubt fascinating. No less fascinating is the extraordinary husband who defied ridicule and contempt by his constant encouragement of her. The story of Margaret Cavendish is, in that sense, a moving story, and one that should make every woman grateful for equality and other things we take for granted. Especially since there are still, in our 'modern' world, millions of women who don't enjoy them."},{"Title":"Mad Madge","review":"Is the previous reviewer talking about the writing or the subject of the book? Hello! If you don't like the person you're reading about, then stop reading, yes she was pretty awful, but what about how it was written, what about the research, what about the author?Great book, great subject! Read it, really!"},{"Title":"Mad Madge","review":"Having just finished reading the epilogue at the end of \`Mad Madge' I must confess that Katie Whitaker's intentions were entirely lost upon me for I agree wholeheartedly with Samuel Pepys who is credited as describing Margaret Cavendish as \\"a mad, conceited, ridiculous woman\\". I believe that Whitaker's purpose was to portray Margaret as being a woman to be admired and so forth as her hordes of flatterers in the seventeenth century had for reasons that I still do not understand. Of all the women in history to research so avidly and thoroughly as Whitaker obviously researched Margaret, I have no idea why she would choose to write a biography about a woman who considered herself inferior to not only her husband and male relatives (both blood-related and related by marriage) but all men with the exclusion of those she loathed for political reasons. Margaret not only supposedly thought of herself as not as consequential as those men she held in high esteem but she was basically a naive child given a woman's place in the world. She was described as being generous many times over, kind even, yet when in exile her husband, servants and she all lived in splendour receiving numerous loans that varied in amounts from 300 pounds into the thousands. All of this money was of course used to supply her with the finest clothing, silks and rugs to decorate her bedchamber in, and grand coaches in which to travel everywhere she went whenever she deemed it necessary to leave her home. Not once did I read of her giving to anyone who was left penniless even a breadcrumb. For someone who was said to be so outstanding she held her tongue an awful lot. If she was someone so great then why did she never protest, why remain silent and only create fictional works about the realities of the political situation if she cared so much about what was going on? If she were so generous why not give to those who were much less fortunate than her? I speak, of course, of those who were not lucky enough to live in a home of grandeur and receive fantastic entertainments. The evidence suggests that Margaret Cavendish was truly a very good little actress. After making her success by producing several supposedly original works of fiction and otherwise she began to throw more lavish get-togethers with various personages of the seventeenth century such as philosophers and poets whom if she were to be seen in the company of would greatly improve her own social status, even in exile. She claimed to be obsessed with originality, yet she was not original in the slightest. She followed the ideas that were popular during the times. She herself admits numerous times to only gaining knowledge of the topics on which she wrote by listening to the conversation between her husband and his visitors, who she later used to her advantage. All she had to do to leave her mark on the world, which she too was obsessed with, was take her husband's opinions, put them into her own words and publish the work. Fairly simple, not to mention manipulative. All she cared about, and she made this abundantly clear too many times to begin to count, was being known. She wanted to be a celebrity and she used her husband to become one. She was nothing but a scheming, hypocritical, self-important, and untalented fraud. To quote from the epilogue \`Louisa Costello's Memoirs of Eminent Englishwomen charged Margaret with self-sufficiency, presumption, and arrogance. She was \\"a kind of overgrown, spoilt girl,\\" added Eric Robertson.' I could not agree more.The only reason I read this book was because it was recommended to me in a magazine called Victoria. I had not read any book reviews written on it so I had no way of knowing that that review was extremely biased. I realise now that the only reason this book was reviewed and suggested to the readers of the magazine was because of Whitaker's writing and the fact that it was written about a supposed \\"heroic feminine\\" who lived and wrote poetry and such in seventeenth century Europe. I do not disagree that this book was written and researched very well. In fact, I found the wording to be very inspiring. However, the subject on which the book was written, Margaret Cavendish's life, of course, was not extraordinary and therefore very dull. The only time I ever found myself growing passionate during the course of reading this biography was at the end when, finally arriving at the conclusion, I was able to begin to gather my thoughts in preparation to write this very book review. Needless to say, I feel as if I wasted my time. I do not wish for anyone else to make the same mistake that I did. I highly recommend that you do not read this book for any reason. I would not even recommend this book to an enemy or friend as a practical joke. No one should be submitted to the foolishness and lack of intellect that Margaret embodied. She fancied herself as a witty, unique person. I assure you that she proved multiple times that that was all a facade to conceal the fact that she was merely looking to make her mark on the world in anyway possible. I pity those that were forced to flatter her so excessively simply because her social status called for it. I doubt that any of them truly believed a word they offered her, but if any did they were as simple-minded and mad as Margaret."},{"Title":"Theosophy: A Modern Expression of the Wisdom of the Ages","review":"I had Dr. Ellwood as a professor last quarter.

Its Contents include 7 main Chapters, an important short \\"Note on sources\\" and a short Forward by the author. There is an instructive 15 page Introduction and an Index as well.In the Introduction the first sentence is a question: \\"What is your life really about?\\" Being, as I AM, among many things in this world, a Theosophist, We answer the question much differently from the average Pilgrim. All answers are representative of the State of Consciousness within the One Life. My answer: My life is really about the \\"fullness\\". As a Theosophist, I answer this question by saying that My life is really about my relationship to the One Life. Theosophy is but one of a myriad of interpretations of this One Fact.Here is the author in the Forward:\\"This book offers the treasures of that tradition of wisdom known as theosophy, as given in the writings of Helena P. Blavatsky and others, to the spiritual seekers of today's generation. It does not pretend to unveil all of those treasures, but it is hoped that enough is shown to encourage the reader to mine further the veins wherein they are to be found. Theosophy is, in the current phrase, \`open-ended'; for every satisfaction it gives to spiritual or intellectual need, new vistas of wonder and new areas for inquiry open up behind that perception. A basic theosophical teaching is that we are perennially on pilgrimage; this is as true in the realms of intellectual quest and spiritual adventure as any other. For the true theosophist, it is in these realms that we are most truly human and at home. As the Upanishads of ancient India tell us, \`Only in the Infinite is there joy.' If this book can convey something of the wonder of such a vision of human reality, it will have achieved its greatest objective.\\"Chapter 1 covers some of Theosophy's foundations. It mentions, right away, the 3 propositions found in H.P. Blavatsky's \\"The Secret Doctrine\\":\\"1. An Omnipresent, Eternal, Boundless and Immutable PRINCIPLE, on which all speculation is impossible, since it transcends the power of human conception and could only be dwarfed by any human expression or similitude. It is beyond the range and reach of thought-in the words of the Mandukya [Upanishad), \`unthinkable and unspeakable.'\\"2. The Eternity of the Universe in toto is a boundless plane, periodically \`the playground of numberless Universes incessantly manifesting and disappearing,' called \`the manifesting stars\\" and the \\"sparks of Eternity.\\" \\"The Eternity of the Pilgrim\\" is like a wink of the Eye of Self Existence ... \` \`The appearance and disappearance of Worlds is like a regular tidal ebb of flux and reflux.\\"\\"3. The fundamental identity of all Souls with the Universal Oversoul, the latter being itself an aspect of the Unknown Root; and the obligatory pilgrimage for every Soul-a spark of the former-through the Cycle of Incarnation (or \`Necessity') in accordance with cyclic and karmic law, during the whole term. (Summarized from 1:79-8211:14-17.)\\"It immediately then mentions the 5 ideas central to the Theosophical point of view:\\"A. One infinite and incomprehensible Reality underlies and unites all that is or can ever be. It expresses itself through consciousness and matter, so that all phenomena represent the complex interaction of these two.\\"B. Universes, solar systems, and worlds develop through immense cycles in accordance with the dynamics of this interaction.\\"C. The individual human being, sometimes called \\"The Pilgrim,\\" moves through these universes and worlds lifetime after lifetime in response to karma and the necessity of experiencing many kinds of being, before returning to the Source, the One.\\"D. There is a reservoir of wisdom in our world, known to those well advanced on the path but accessible to all earnest seekers, that can help us to understand and grow in these truths.\\"E. Growth is not only a matter of intellectual learning but involves also initiation or inward transformation and living in accordance with the spirit of openness and the oneness of all being that the truth implies.\\"Next, it gives us the 3 \\"consensus\\" teachings or objectives of the Society:\\"1. To form a nucleus of the Universal Brotherhood of Humanity, without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste, or color.\\"2. To encourage the study of Comparative Religion, Philosophy, and Science.\\"3. To investigate unexplained laws of Nature and andthe powers latent in man.\\"Something Theosophy does better than many other philosophical groups is handling the relationship between man and the universe. Theosophy handles the \\"kingdoms of God\\" in a Hierarchy of Consciousness, from the electron on up to the Universe itself. Speaking of which, our Universe (one of an infinity of universes) is said in this work, much to my surprise and delight, to be a \\"hologram\\" based upon \\"the holographic model of the universe proposed by Karl Pribram.\\" The author goes on to say the following on page 24-25:\\"Eternal Duration, we are told, is not time as we think of it, but a process in which everreal idea-forms pass through a \`mathematical line' known as the present, into the \`region of memories that we name the Past.' Only a kind of blurring in the mind gives us the sensation of temporal duration. (1:110/1:37)\\"It may be pointed out that this picture of the universe and mind converges remarkably with the holographic model of the universe proposed by Karl Pribram of Stanford in the 1970s. A holograph is a three-dimensional representation or picture made by reflecting light off a photographic plate which has been imprinted with the holograph, or code, by a laser beam together with light bounced off the object to the pictured. A key characteristic of a hologram is that all parts of it contain the whole; if broken, the entire picture can be reproduced in less detail from any fragment.\\"Pribram concluded that the brain operates by a sort of holographic process; it constructs reality by creating holographic images within itself from frequencies (ideal forms?) that have no time or space reality of their own. The primary order of the universe, then, is not actual space, time, or substance, but nondimensional waves prior to these, which the mind interprets holographically as material reality.\\"Ultimately, then, the universe would not be made up of entities localized in space and time, this star here and that one there, an event now and another a million years in past or future. As in Blavatsky's Eternal Duration, all possibilities are present all the time, latent in every part of the universe as in a holo-graphic code, ready to be reproduced from any fragment of it-including the fragment which is a human brain.\\"The universe and its history, and our own lifestories, then, are simply images we are creating and stories we are telling ourselves from out of the holographic frequencies in our minds, in accordance with our particular principle of selectivity from the infinite array of images available. For the mind, in Henri Bergson's term, works as a reducing valve, ordinarily able to channel only a tiny bit of the endless sensory and other sensations available.\\"From the theosophical point of view, the particular world each of us creates from out of the unimaginable range of holographic codes available is based on affinity, or (in the theosophical term we shall soon discuss more fully) karma.\\"As for the Hierarchy of Nature in Theosophy, we begin with the subatomic kingdom, the mineral kingdom, the vegetable kingdom, the animal kingdom and then the human kingdom. Modern science recognizes kingdoms 3-5 as part of \\"living organisms\\". It is at this point that Theosophy continues to teach us of the hierarchy above us where modern science stays mute on these points letting religion do the talking about \\"things above the matter planes\\".Theosophy sees \\"life\\" down to the electron. It also posits life-forms at the planetary level, the solar level and on up to the universal level itself. For example, each sun is an esoteric \\"Being\\" with physical attributes as we see in our physical sun. Each Solar Being lives \\"behind\\" its physical form. In fact, Theosophy teaches that the Being behind our physical sun was once a in a state \\"comparable to ours;\\" this Being evolved through higher and higher stages of Consciousness in the One Life to become \\"solar\\".Here is the author, page 138, in his own words:\\"First there is the Solar Logos, ruler of our solar system whose outward expression is the physical orb of the sun. This Being is far greater than the Masters associated with Earth and the history of the Theosophical Society; he is more like a divine entity who is the spiritual impulse behind our star and its far-flung family of planets. Yet his position is one to which he evolved over unimaginable aeons from a condition comparable to ours.\\"A Theosophical book would not be complete without mentioning the hierarchy of \\"Masters\\" and the \\"Seven Rays\\". There are 7 main Masters each manifesting the Primary attribute of a Ray. These are the Rays and Masters recognized in the second generation of Theosophy:\\"1. The First Ray is the Ray of leadership and pertains to strength, and so controls wise government and social organization.... Finally, the Master Morya works on this Ray.\\"2. The Second Ray is devoted to wisdom and teaching. As the First governs the social organization of the world, so the Second is especially attuned to its inner religious and spiritual development, expressing the second corner of the divine Trinity, wisdom and intellect, as the First Ray expresses being or will. The Second Ray is manifested on a high level by the Buddha and below him by the World Teacher and future Buddha, the exalted being known as the Christ. Just as each Root Race is founded by a Manu, so each culminates spiritually in the appearance of a Buddha and at the same time bears in its bosom a bodhisattva or coming Buddha, who will be the Buddha of the next race. On a lower level the Master Kuthumi works on this Ray.\\"3. Of this set, the Third Ray is under the Master called the Venetian. Its keynotes are adaptability, and a subtle sense of timing and of interrelationships. Astrology rightly understood-as the science of the interconnectedness of all things in the universe, the movement of the stars in their courses and in the affairs of men-is under this Ray, as is theright understanding of history and its great cycles.\\"4. The Fourth Ray is under the Master Serapis, a Coptic or Egyptian Greek. It is concerned with beauty and harmony, which express themselves in art; many artists are pursuing spiritual development through their work along the path of which it is the guiding light.\\"5. The Fifth Ray, guided by the Master Hilarion, a Neo-Platonist, is concerned with accuracy of observation and so with science; it is the path of those whom science leads to ultimate truth.\\"6. The Sixth Ray is guided by the Master Jesus. In theosophical accounts a distinction is made between Jesus and the Christ, the initiate Jesus having been overshadowed in his last years by a greater being, the Christ who is World Teacher on the Second Ray.The Sixth Ray rules the devotional path, the path of saints, mystics, and devotees of all faiths. We have already looked at Jesus' sublime exemplification of the spiritual way.\\"7. The Seventh Ray is headed by the Comte de St Germain, a celebrated and mysterious eighteenth-century French occultist. He is also known as the Master Rakoczy, who is the aforementioned Hungarian adept, and is said to have appeared as a number of famous earlier savants, including Francis and Roger Bacon. This Ray governs the role of ceremony in human life. All ritual, whether Confucian in the East, Vedic in India, or ecclesiastical or magical in the West, reminds us that such stylized behavior can transform the participant, enabling him or her to lose the ego-self and become something greater, an ideal whose role is being acted out as by a performer in a great dance. In the experience of many, ritual can also of itself release extraordinary energies. All this is under the Seventh Ray, and to augment its force for good some theosophists have engaged in benign ritual activity, such as that of Co-Masonry or the Liberal Catholic Church.\\"Some final comments: This book is full of little known gems I wasn't aware of. I've been at this search for my whole life and have a background exposed to many esoteric schools of thought, including Theosophy. I've heard that some considered the Old Testament god as Satan, but didn't know Theosophy supports this teaching. On page 160, the author points out that \\"the Secret Doctrine devotes much attention to a complex argument that Jehovah and Satan are one and the same.\\" The author handles the problem of Evil very well. I agree with much of his theosophical points regarding how to interpret \\"evil\\". His final chapter, \\"Theosophical Living\\" is a great testament to the author and to theosophy as a way of life.Finally, to close, on page 56-57 we find,\\"Theosophy can supplement science though, when it postulates Consciousness as present right from the beginning along with matter.\\" On page 57 he concludes, \\"amid such speculation, we must never forget that all we really need to know is the next step on our own path.\\"I hope I have peaked your interest enough to make a purchase today."},{"Title":"Theosophy: A Modern Expression of the Wisdom of the Ages","review":"Ellwood writes clearly and to the point.

Highly recommended to anyone with a serious interest in the root texts of the Mahayana tradition."},{"Title":"The awakening of faith, attributed to Asvaghosha","review":"For me, the highlight of this text is its depiction of faith, not as a blind grasping towards the truth, but as trust with conviction. The difference is important in today's world where the meaning of faith has been eviscerated of its positive affirmation of a path - conviction arising from a sure understanding, rather than just an adopted belief - to become more a label of anti-experiential assertion. Thus in today's world to have faith is to believe in the absence of evidence, while in this context to have faith is to have become permeated with the enlightened aspect of Suchness. The value of a text such as this is not the programmatic ideas that it presents, but the underlying understanding that these ideas point to. If one merely forms an attachment to the conceptual ideas, one is not developing faith.The translator's introduction and commentary, much of which is taken from a few Chinese and Korean scholars, but especially that of Fazang, is generally excellent. One caveat is that there are a few places within the text where the typographic style of setting off the commentary from the base text is not adhered to (ex. top of pg 65 of reprint edition), potentially confusing the reader.The introduction to the reprint edition by Ab&eacute; is suspect. He starts with a whopper of a misunderstanding when he states: \\"... the Awakening of Faith boldly posits as the ultimate reality the minds of sentient beings in their everyday existence.\\" The \\"minds\\" (plural and individuated) are presented as the permeation of ignorance and not the \\"ultimate reality\\". So I recommend caution in reading these remarks.James CorriganAn Introduction to Awareness"},{"Title":"The awakening of faith, attributed to Asvaghosha","review":"This book was a great read, and I think an important one for anyone interested in looking into mahanaya buddhism, or buddhism in general.

The first Chapter on interpretation of the \\"Principle of Mahayana\\" contains the meat of the matter. The second two chapters are not-so-good. Here is a small summary of the 4 stages of enlightenment (suchness) posited in the first chapter.The first three are collected as \\"nonfinal enlightenment\\" covering states said \\"not to be enlightened to the fountainhead of the mind\\". These states of comprehension are:1) the ability to prevent incorrect (wrong) thought from arising2) enlightenment in appearance: aware of the changing nature of thought but free from thoughts subject to change (ie those having foresaken rudimentry attachments thereto.3) approximate enlightenment: those aware of the temporary abiding state of thoughts, who are not arrested by them and therefore are free from thought suggesting that the components of the world (their experience) is \\"real\\"4) final enlightenment: to be fully enlightened to have reached the fountainhead of the mind - ie those free from deluded thought, able to percieve that which is beyond thought, and to have thus awakened to the perception that ALL THOUGHT can be likened to \\"dream only\\".There is a concise discussion on emptiness therein including enlightenment and non-enlightenment.

It is good for the totally unfamiliar reader of Buddhism.The Author criticizes, incorrectly and unjustly, twoprevious translators. The charge against DT Suzuki is due to him using the later manuscript; even though this author says the difference is insignificant.He also lumps Goddard in with Richards, and says Goddard's translation 'is too free', not literal enough. Hakeda's interpretation was influenced by many commentaries, Gone over, read, and edited by 5 Western College Instructors, as noted in the original Preface. The translation has a wealth of footnotes to explain to the beginner or student many details. But the interpretation is dry, exoteric, dogmatic, Orthodox, and lifeless IMHO.I have the Taipei version that has both Suzuki's andGoddard's editions, I have read them both in succession and they are not significantly different.

And so for me this was the perfect book. I love China history and culture. I have friends from China, and am aware of the political realities (and changes, with modest recent improvement) there now. This book is written by Shaolin Ch'an exiles from China - due to persecution by Chinese governments, including the PRC and previous governments. And so there is some controversy as a result.That is context - but the important point of the book is the history, philosophy and culture of Shaolin Ch'an, as well as a summary review of its fighting arts (gung fu). I find it to be excellent and true in every way. As a newer student of Wing Tzun kung-fu in a lay school (EBMAS), I especially enjoyed the greater context and history provided about Wing Tzun as a style developed by Shaolin. As a Ch'an Buddhist, I enjoyed learning about the Ch'an philosophy and practices that went along with Wing Tzun as developed by Shaolin. This is the best book, linking these two important subjects for me. Another interesting aspect is its report on the important role of women in Shaolin Ch'an Buddhism and Gung Fu. In fact, Wing Tzun is a Shaolin martial art style developed by a female Shaolin monk. It is well written, and includes references to modern American culture, as well as other published works. All of this enhances understanding. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Shaolin Grandmasters' Text: History, Philosophy, and Gung Fu of Shaolin Ch'an (Order of Shaolin Ch'an)","review":"To the comment about negative aspects of shaolin, yeah, they're not perfect. The Shaolin wanted to write a book about what they thought was the true in a pure attempt to dismiss falsifications about their order. They are a group of guys in Oregon the ARE the real shaolin. If you'd like a book by the REAL Shaolin in China, perhaps you'd also like to buy an authentic bottle of Shaolin Coca-Cola the Chinese government has right outside the REAL temple. I realize it's hard for people to imagine that The Order has relocated to Oregon, but that's just the way it is. It's not quite as romantic to us as if it were in the back country of China, but that's just the way it worked out.The Wheel of Life IS a demonstration, but it's performed by government employees (not the Order). They make specific note of this in the book and the fact that it doesn't really matter what anyone calls themselves as long as they are doing something good.Remember, the Order was specifically trying to dismiss falsifications about their Order. It probably wasn't a very easy task, but I think they did very well without stepping on anyone's toes (if you don't think they did, read more carefully! They are constantly apologizing for their own ignorance!)In short, this book is fantastic. Anyone studying a shaolin based style (or probably any martial art) should be able to gain a lot from this book. It is one of my favorites."},{"Title":"The Shaolin Grandmasters' Text: History, Philosophy, and Gung Fu of Shaolin Ch'an (Order of Shaolin Ch'an)","review":"I received the book very quickly and it is in great condition, Thanks.I have started to read it, and it is very nicely laid out and very easy to understand.

Huss \\"Subotai\\"'s review. \\"The Order\\" states that they are the true Shaolin. They make a lot of pompous statements on why a \\"true\\" Shaolin would never do demonstrations or wear robes in public (but keep in mind, lots of Buddhist monks wear robes in public). They say that other Shaolin schools THINK they are true Shaolin, but you shouldn't blame the Sifu's because they were mislead early on... but who's to say \\"The Order\\" and the people who wrote this book were not mislead themselves by the \\"Grandmasters\\" who came to America from China?I really don't think this book says much for their Buddhism. They're trying to take the credit for being the true Shaolin, which is totally hypcritical when they say a true Shaolin school should be secretive.Granted, they did not give names of the authors, but they reveal themselves and their location in Oregon.And finally, the thing that really bothered me, is at first glance the book looks like it was written by current Shaolin Grandmasters in the real Shaolin temple (http://www.shaolin.org.cn) but in fact it's written by a bunch of guys in Oregon. I bought the book because I wanted a good book on history and philosophy of Shaolin written by the current Grandmasters of Shaolin in Henan province.But it's an interesting book if you want to read the point of view of one group. I personally believe anyone in any where can be Shaolin, but when it comes to history, I prefer to read it or hear it from the source on location.One last thing: Shaolin temple let a group of monks tour to do \\"Wheel Of Life\\", which in a sense, is a demonstration. Does that make Shaolin not authentic? In this book, they actually say they sent a disciple to Shaolin to check for authenticity and they found none. Now THAT'S a bold statement!After reading this book, I honestly don't care any more. I can still train hard, care about Shaolin, and try to live my life better with or without this, or any other book. This book made me realize that all I need is what's inside of myself and what I know I can achieve."},{"Title":"The Shaolin Grandmasters' Text: History, Philosophy, and Gung Fu of Shaolin Ch'an (Order of Shaolin Ch'an)","review":"Great book. It is an easy to read text that reveals the true nature of the Shaolin Order. A great mix of philosophy and martial arts."},{"Title":"The Shaolin Grandmasters' Text: History, Philosophy, and Gung Fu of Shaolin Ch'an (Order of Shaolin Ch'an)","review":"Let me start by saying that some of the Kung Fu information in this book is decent.Unfortunately for me, that information is hard to digest given the preamble and premise of the book. This book is published by a small offshoot of imperial China established in the US in 1900. The authors of the book go to great pains to say that Buddhism is about lack of ego yet then follow this up by saying that only they are the real Shaolin, not the monks in China. If they are true Buddhists they should have said that Shaolin exists in the heart and that anyone from anywhere, including monks from the main temple in China are as legitimate as anyone from an offshoot order in Oregon.In addition, to this happening outright in the beginning, subtle jabs lay throughout this book that when taken as a whole make it apparent that they have no room in their heart for mainland China. The romanization system they have chosen is Wade Giles. A system used primarily in Taiwan and taught in few schools where students learn Mandarin (Pinyin is the dominant method). They make no mention of developments in Kung Fu since 1900. They constantly talk about the superiority of what their version of Shaolin means.This book may be about Kung Fu. But its a poor example of Buddhism and the lack of ego and compassion Buddhism has for others and other schools of thought."},{"Title":"The Shaolin Grandmasters' Text: History, Philosophy, and Gung Fu of Shaolin Ch'an (Order of Shaolin Ch'an)","review":"I am a contributor to The Shaolin Grandmasters' Test, and would like to make some comments about the book. I will do my best to represent other contributors, both living and deceased. Complaints that we fail to shower compliments upon the People's Republic of China (in general) and the resurrected Shaolin Temple in Honan Province (specifically) are not without substance. Many reviewers who are affiliated with the new Shaolin Temple may be offended by our book because we have tried to be truthful. Our perhaps it is simply the blunt presentation.The PRC today employs tens of thousands of human and computerized monitors to censor the information accessible by the Chinese people. Internet sites with the word \\"freedom\\" typically do not make it onto the computers of Chinese citizens. The PRC continues to imprison Tibetan Buddhists who so much as say something positive about the Dalai Lama. The Shaolin Temple is the nucleus of a massive tourist industry, and has given rise to kung fu schools nearby for 10,000+ Chinese boys - keeping many young men \\"occupied\\" in a nation where the ratio of men:women is horribly skewed. Shaolin kung fu schools in Europe have been sued for using the \\"Shaolin\\" name - by an entity intimately connected with the Shaolin Temple. Stating these sorts of facts earn us the distinction of \\"having no room in our heart[s] for mainland China\\".Our book is far from perfect. Many of our now-deceased priests were old enough to feel some personal bitterness over the incompetence of the Ch'ing dynasty, and many of our senior members had negative personal experiences with \\"Red China\\". In some places in the book, this bitterness shows. Deciding to leave some of these sentiments in the book was not a simple decision, but perhaps it was a wrong one. Buddhism does indeed reside in the heart. Anyone can choose this path. The Buddha even made provision for self-ordination, for those spiritual seekers who could not find a Sangha. I do not doubt that the Shaolin Temple in Honan houses some devout Buddhists, and human beings deserve compassion and fairness regardless of spiritual persuasion. But being a Buddhist and practicing martial arts are not sufficient conditions for being Shaolin. Shaolin is a sect of Buddhism, comparable to how the Jesuits are a specific order of the Catholic Church. One might say, \\"Being a Jesuit is all in the heart - just don a collar, study theology and logic, and believe in your own Jesuit-ness.\\" It isn't that simple. The presence of martial arts in Shaolin is what makes it distinctive to most people. But what makes Shaolin _Shaolin_ is its underlying interpretation of Buddhism - an interpretation which allows for these martial, moving meditations. There is also the matter of a historical tradition. Although we have not personally witnessed these elements with respect to the Shaolin Temple in the PRC, that isn't to say they aren't there. If anything, we will strive to better reflect our own ignorance of such matters in future editions.On a less serious note, OF COURSE our book doesn't reflect many developments in martial arts post-1900! Ours is a meditative discipline that came out of imperial China. This book is an attempt to explain our own tradition. If we were elitists of some kind who only felt scorn for those in China today, why would we have published a book detailing much of the philosophy that makes Shaolin Buddhism unique? Our goal in making the book available was to allow anyone at all to BE as Shaolin as possible (if that's what they want) with respect to the practice of Buddhism.I believe that The Shaolin Grandmasters' Text, despite its flaws, will prove an invaluable resource for people interested in Shaolin, martial arts, Buddhism, or any combination thereof. The book details Shaolin oral history - and even though oral history is sometimes inaccurate, much can be learned from it. Some of the oral history is surely allegorical, but still has something to teach about Shaolin. There are also large sections on the traditional animal styles of Shaolin and various training methods. But the most important part of the book is the presentation of Shaolin's take on Buddhism, which we have tried to make as straightforward and clear as possible.Finally, throughout the work, we have tried to balance fairness with truthfulness. The foundation of Buddhism is the conquering of ignorance (in Tibetan sutras, the Buddha is often referred to as \\"The Conqueror\\"). How can one begin to develop compassion and wisdom if she does not know what those things are?Edit: Alright, I've reflected and returned. These comments are my best effort at making an official statement to represent a variety of different people. Some of what I wrote seems a little goofy to me, but I'm leaving it as is. Speaking strictly for myself, I take no issue with there being many \\"brands\\" of Shaolin in the world. It is simply a name. And if a person goes searching for a spiritual path that calls itself \\"Shaolin\\", and that person finds fulfillment - well, that is all that really matters, isn't it? I believe that if you dig deep into The Shaolin Grandmasters' Text, this is the message which will emerge. Be responsible for your own spiritual development, and judge everything for yourself."},{"Title":"The Shaolin Grandmasters' Text: History, Philosophy, and Gung Fu of Shaolin Ch'an (Order of Shaolin Ch'an)","review":"I have studied many types of \\"Shaolin Kung Fu\\" - and let's get one thing clear from the beginning: There are many, many incorrect views out there about what \\"Shaolin\\" really is. This book, in my opinion, comes the closest to a genuinely authentic version of \\"Shaolin.\\"After studying for over two years as a lay-monk (i.e., taking Bodhisattva vows, studying Sutras, and doing 'kung-fu') under the current Temple's \\"official\\" US representative monk in Flushing, NYC, I learned only ONE martial move. That monk is himself an accomplished iron-body master. Yet he did not do any iron body training during my stay. (Nor did any of his students - it was ALL modern wushu for us). Nor was there any type of meditation practice. There was a strong sense of community, which was appealing.I moved on to study Jin-Woo, which incorporated many authentic Shaolin forms before Mao took over China. Unfortunately, many Jin-Woo schools are continuing this impulse, and are \\"incorporating\\" modern wushu as well, to the point where many no longer teach any authentic, traditional Kung-Fu. I am much happier knowing three authentic Shaolin forms, instead of knowing 20 modern wushu forms that are Shaolin in name-only.Where is Shaolin? Well, we all romanticize the \\"warrior-monks\\" of legend. But adhering to the philosophy of Shaolin requires taking the Bodhisattva vow, abiding by the rules of a monastery, and practicing Kung-Fu as an augmentation to sitting meditation. The closest thing that comes to Shaolin, nowadays, is Integral Institute's \\"Integral Life Practice\\".I have only two small problems with this book:1) It is not nearly polemical enough in deriding the ridiculous charlatans that perform flashy wushu with bald heads and saffron robes. The Chinese government oppresses Tibetan Buddhism and regularly engages in human rights violations against peaceful Falun Gong public-meditators, but \\"Shaolin\\" flourishes in mainland China?? WAKE UP PEOPLE....2) The emphasis on differentiated \\"animal styles.\\" Animal-specific forms are a product of importing forms into the West. Chinese history and culture has always been one that revealed a group-mind where things merged together. The Western mind finds the one-animal to one-form ratio appealing. In traditional Kung-Fu forms (with the exception of Southern and Hun-Gar), each form had many \\"fists\\" embedded within it.Some \\"Shaolin Monks\\" that teach in the US will make you a \\"monk\\" with no Bodhisattva vow, no reading of sutras, and no true practice other than your continued monthly wushu training fees. This is not the \\"way of no way\\" that Zen speaks to so well, and which many have attempted to invoke in defense of this unconscienable and false practice. Make no mistake about it - any authentically spiritual practice that incorporates Kung-Fu will require \\"Hard Work\\" as much as it requires actual vows and spiritual practices such as sitting meditation.So sure, Shaolin can be in your heart. But your heart is not truly OF Shaolin unless you use the sword of Manjusri to cleave your implusive and ego driven romanticism away from your real practice. (Your \\"real practice\\" = transcending ego). For all of its necessarily limited oral history (there were, after all, a great many monks), this book goes a long way in balancing the many ignorant and authentic voices in this underground debate about the true soul of Shaolin."},{"Title":"The Shaolin Grandmasters' Text: History, Philosophy, and Gung Fu of Shaolin Ch'an (Order of Shaolin Ch'an)","review":"The Shaolin Grandmasters' Text: History, Philosophy, And Gung Fu Of Shaolin Ch'an is a richly informative and very strongly recommended survey of Shaolin history, Buddhism, and the martial arts associated with Shaolin practitioners.

The book covers, as it's title implies, the history and philosophy of both the Buddhist practices and the Gung-fu practices as well as how they are interrelated. The dharma lessons are intriguing as there are a number of lessons from texts dating back to Tamo (Bodhidharma) and his direct disciples. The information on the Gung-fu is very fundamental and explains the history, traditions and philosophy of the arts.

The book describes what Shaolin is all about in details. It refers to Shaolin history from the ancient times till date, explains basic philosopy and gives overall picture of Shaolin way of thinking and Shaolin way of life. The book gives a general information on Shaolin Kung Fu - a sort of overview of Kung Fu and what it really means and how it has developed and evolved.The book clearly states why almost all the original and authentic Shaolin Masters and Grand Masters fled war torn communist China to settle in U.S.A. The war torn China at the beginning of the last century was way too hostile for sustaining traditional Shaolin styles and values.The book clearly explains why TODAY Shaolin temples of China have got fake Kung Fu instructors implanted and supported by the present Communist government to deceive foreign tourists into believing that these clowns or dancers are knowledgeable about Shaolin Kung Fu. It also explains that these representatives of government of China are put there to promote tourism and for other reasons but they know nothing from Original Shaoling Knowledge Bank. Today, what they teach at temples in China has absolutely nothig to do with the original and traditional Shaolin Kung Fu since all the authentic Shaolin Masters and Grand Masters have fled from China decades ago due to hostilities of Communists and the Communist Government.

Good pictures (diagrams) are given in the book to illustrate some of the concepts. It is a well written book in good English. The book is comprehensive for its subject and the presentation of the articles is excellent.It is a good resouce book on original Shaolin in general and Shaolin Kung Fu (Gung Fu) in particular. It is a good resouce book for anyone interested in the original Shaolin Kung Fu which has evolved for more than 1400 years. It is a good resource book for those who want to know about Shaolin or Gung Fu. It is a good resource for any serious Martial Artist. It is a good resource for anyone who wants to know about Shaolin and Kung Fu (Gung Fu)."},{"Title":"The Shaolin Grandmasters' Text: History, Philosophy, and Gung Fu of Shaolin Ch'an (Order of Shaolin Ch'an)","review":"This is a book I've been looking for for a long time. It is a book that give answer the questions: What is Shaolin? What's their story? How did the differnt styles of kung fu develop? and so on. It also gives a good insight in the Shaolin Buddhism. I think it is one of the best overviews you can get today on the subject in english.It is written by different writers, and, in a very ambitious sense, try to cover all important facts of the history of Shaolin up until today.In their own humbleness they also says that they mayby don't cover everything and it its possible errors, because there is always another story to be telled, and the order today is spread around the world and much knowledge and history is also lost.One thing though is that these authors lives today in the USA, with roots from the Shaolin grandmasters who came there in 1927; In the 80-ies they claim to have been in the Shaolin Monastery in Henan and \\"found no Bhuddist or traditional gung fu practice...\\"This is a little odd, because I happen to know that from the beginning of 80-ies they officially opened up the Shaolin activities in the Temple again, after it was shut down at 1949 during the cultural revolution of Mao.In the meanwhile the martial arts training by the monks was done in secret, and when it was \\"legal\\" again the monks counld start up all over again (even though some of them fled the country).Today it is a lot of \\"profane\\" martial art centers outside the Temple at Henan, where it's a lot of wushu and similar modern martial arts training, but inside the monastery there is still \\"ortodox\\" martial art training and typical Shaolin Bhuddist activity.Over all, for anyone with genuine interest of the story and real nature behind the myths of Shaolin, this book is a goldmine."},{"Title":"The Shaolin Grandmasters' Text: History, Philosophy, and Gung Fu of Shaolin Ch'an (Order of Shaolin Ch'an)","review":"Without repeating the comments in the reviews above, I will further support them by saying that this is perhaps the single best treatment on the history, philosophy, and practice of Shaolin Chan I've seen. I would highly recommend this book for anyone seeking an insider's, \\"one-stop shopping\\" treatment of the subject. While I do not want to give any criticism inappropriate weight, I must say that I do agree with their own disclaimer that the read is somewhat disjointed, given that several different author's sections were put together to form the whole volume. As a result, it's almost a literary collage rather than a smooth end-to-end read. Additionally, given the heavy use of American vernacular at times, I am sure that some of it at least had to have been written by Occidentals...nonetheless, I do highly prize this read and I enthusiastically recommend it to any serious student of Shaolin Chan."},{"Title":"The Shaolin Grandmasters' Text: History, Philosophy, and Gung Fu of Shaolin Ch'an (Order of Shaolin Ch'an)","review":"For anyone seriously interested in learning about the history and philosophy of Shaolin, this text is a must have.

This was in good condition, with an added benefit not advertised; signed by the author!"},{"Title":"Last Ditch","review":"This is an Inspector Roderick Alleyn/Detective Fox entry. It's very late in Alleyn's career because he and his renowned artist wife, Agatha Troy, have a grown son, Ricky, who has traveled to an artist's retreat of sorts to write.Ricky mixes with the locals which include a family of equestrians. The daughter, a concupiscent gal of local popularity with all the young men, is killed in a horse-riding episode. Ricky suspects that her death may not have been an accident based upon feedback from local residents.Ricky also gets involved with a sarcastic aspiring young artist who appears to be involved in the drug trade. Subsequent to Rickey being involved in a near drowning, Alleyn and Fox show up to look into the drug allegations and the possible murder of the girl... then Rickey goes missing!The scenario here is not the most believable cozy murder that Marsh ever wrote. Still I enjoyed it and can recommend it to fans."},{"Title":"Last Ditch","review":"This is one of the very latest Marsh books, written in 1977. (43 years after her first book!)The story centers around Ricky Alleyn, the son of Roderick and Agatha Troy. In this book, he is twenty-one and striking out on his own for the very first time. Despite the best effort of both parents to keep him away from the world of crime, Ricky gets drawn into a local murder. Although Roderick is eventually sent to help his son out, Ricky remains at the center of the piece.I actually did not mind Ricky as the central character. He has some interesting tensions and I could have seen him go on in later works to follow in his father's footsteps despite the wishes of his parents. That said, these tensions are not well developed in Last Ditch and Ricky remains betwixt and between with Roderick still shouldering most of the responsibility for the crime.It would also have been interesting to see an aging Roderick less able to cope with the modern world of drugs and promiscuity. But Alleyn seems surprisingly unchanged, despite having a 21 year old son. He adjusts to the junkies and smuggling with ease.Unfortunately, the world of drugs and junkies described here fails to ring true. It reads like second-hand stereotype rather than something from reality.All this makes it sound like a bad book. It is not. Particularly for Marsh fans, there are still those moments of brilliance that characterize so much of her work. Julia Pharamond is a brilliant character, for instance. Her dizzy complexity and cold kindness makes her a classic Marsh character. I would not begin here if you haven't read any other Marsh, but if you are already a fan I would not be afraid to pick it up either."},{"Title":"Last Ditch","review":"I'm a big fan of cozy mysteries and I picked this novel up because I thought that it would be similar to Agatha Christie's work. I'm in my mid-40's now, but I can remember my mom reading Ngaio Marsh novels as a kid in the '70's. This is the 1st Marsh novel I've ever read and, based on what others have stated, perhaps it shouldn't have been. The characters are very simple and 2-dimensional. Inspector Alleyn and his wife Troy are like Ozzie & Harriet (Nelson). Their son, Ricky, is like...well Ricky Nelson. The characters are so predictable that there is never any mystery as to what they're up to (drug smuggling). I kept waiting for plot twists and turns that never came. In the end, the murderer revealed himself to the police out of guilt. As a reader I felt gypped that he wasn't found out due to clever sleuthing."},{"Title":"Last Ditch","review":"I am an avid Marsh reader. I truly think she's one of the all-time greats. Her characters are delicately and consistently portrayed. Roderick Alleyn, his wife Troy, his sidekick Inspector Fox---sublime. I really love her books because each one stands alone as a sort of mini-novel: a member of the mystery genre, but with creative detail and insights that you're not usually going to find outside serious novels.Having said that: this book sucks. Ricky Alleyn is one of the most annoying and deadly stupid characters ever depicted anywhere. And since the book revolves around him, it's hard to skim the bits he's in.Skip this one and read Overture to Death instead."},{"Title":"Last Ditch","review":"Pretty good book.Marsh usually starts us off with characters who are not Alleyn, but here we have his son Ricky, on a writing holiday. As Alleyn's progeny, Ricky is rather tiresome in his endlessly correct behavior. He falls for a local married woman several years his senior. Meanwhile, there's a murder!I like how the author is ambitious in changing scenery between books, and here she gives us a coastal village with a French-speaking populace.She is fairly successful with the villains in this novel, but there are not too many surprises. I don't read Marsh for the \\"denouement\\" - I read for the story itself and her amazing writing and dialogue."},{"Title":"Last Ditch","review":"As of this date, the previous (three) reviews of the book seem to have been for one of the printed copies, not the audio copy which I heard. I have not read the book and cannot comment on how it reads. As an audio book, excising the technical problems I had, which have nothing to do with the reader (Nadia May, one of the names taken for audio work by British actress and TV personality,Nadia Sawalha), was a good mystery with an interesting cast of characters, given distinct voices and considerable appeal by the Reader. The details of the action have already been spelled out by Amazon and previous reviewers, but their reception to the book's content is difficult for me to reconcile with what I heard. To what extent this is a personal matter not a difference between reading a text and hearing a text performed, even though word for word a duplication of the text, I cannot say. There is probably research on this intriguing problem in the literature but I have no inclination to seek it out. Suffice it to say, that my recommendation, that it will probably be enjoyed by any Marsh fan and most detective story readers, is based on the audio edition alone.I refrain from comment on various points made by reviews of the \\"reading\\" group except to suggest that placing the work of Dame Ngaio in the recently devised \\"cozy\\" category doesn't fit in with my conception of \\"cozy\\" (many series within which group I enjoy) or my conception of Marsh's books."},{"Title":"Looking for Orthon","review":"I was disappointed in this book.Perhaps I was wrong in expecting something more akin to a biography of Adamsky rather thenan overly long social essay.The author carries his coy andbemused portrayal of Adamsky onfar too long--what at most shouldhave been a brief essay grew tobook length. After a while theone-dimensional semi-joke he attempts to make Adamsky out to be--something akin to how onewho is a little fond of a pet with an entertaining foible mightportray the animal--chasing itstail, for example, grows very, very thin."},{"Title":"Looking for Orthon","review":"The typical pseudoscience book has the characteristic that each chapter deals with a different topic and is completely unconnected to previous and subsequent chapters, and to the book's supposed title or theme. Colin Bennett has found a new paradigm! Each of the 17 chapters in this book, supposedly about 1950s \\"contactee\\" George Adamski, is THE SAME! Each chapter starts with a bit of completely unreliable \\"information\\" about Adamski, and then veers into precisely the same diatribe, reworded only slightly from chapter to chapter. The word \\"pandimensional,\\" as a result, occurs on just about every page in the book. Invariably, we hear about the irredeemable and total evil of science, scientists and indeed scholarship or scholarly integrity of any kind in any context. Then we hear about Lee Harvey Oswald, JFK and Marilyn Monroe. Then we hear about Uri Geller, the long forgotten Ted Serios the bellhop and \\"thoughtographer,\\" Pacific Cargo Cults, and the same few Adamski followers. And then we get an incoherently presented Fortean account of a saucer sighting or a haunting or whatever pops into the author's mind at that particular moment. Then we are told Adamski was unintelligent and an obvious liar, but really, really charming. Then we are told that everything Adamski said was true, because there is no difference between lies and the truth, between fact and fiction. [In fact the author repeatedly uses the undefined, ambiguous and confusing noun \\"faction,\\" by which he appears to want to imply that fiction and fact are never distinguishable. I have the strong suspicion that if a neighbor ran up to him on the street and blurted out that Bennett's home had just burned down, and that he had lost his entire family, pets and possessions, he would be able fairly directly to determine whether the report was true or false, and that the truth or falsity of the claim would be of deep significance to him.] Then on to the next chapter where the same themes and rants are repeated with only slight variation.As it turned out, just before reading this volume I had researched Adamski to write a brief profile of him. There is pretty much nothing in the 224 pages here that is either (1) reliable, or (2) different from what is fairly readily available on the Internet. The only \\"new\\" aspect to Adamski to be found in LOOKING FOR ORTHON is the claim that he was a homosexual who frequently seduced or tried to seduce handsome young followers (see for example p. 42), but no reason is presented within the text to take the claim seriously. I was reminded by the present book that there is a rich and detailed word-portrait of Adamski in a second printing of a book by Edward J. Ruppelt, a printing available only through the Doubleday Science Fiction Book Club back in 1960. I'm impressed that Bennett has even seen a copy. I myself treasure the one I bought in 1960.Adamski is a very important and very typical character in the history of 20th Century pseudoscience. He deserves a good, detailed, researched biography in english. This is not it, and I do not know of any."},{"Title":"Looking for Orthon","review":"Plainly stated, &quot;Looking for Orthon&quot; is one of the most compelling treatments of the UFO phenomenon I've read in years. Superficially, &quot;Looking for Orthon&quot; can be read as a biography of the late flying saucer contactee George Adamski, but it's much more; Bennett probes the innards of 20th century society with an intellectual and literary dexterity seldom encountered in popular works on UFOs. Bennett treats Adamski's bizarre story as the multilayered mythological enigma that it is, recreating the circumstances in which Adamski, good-natured opportunist and hobbyist astronomer, supposedly met a man from Venus. Bennett argues that Adamdki's claimed contact rattled Western society's ontological bedrock, regardless if it actually happened. There aren't very many books that address reality-challenging issues as ably or as wittily as Bennett's. &quot;Looking for Orthon&quot; is a must for anyone seeking the roots of the postmodern condition, and destined to be a classic."},{"Title":"Looking for Orthon","review":"Colin Bennett summarises this book when he says that \\"the problem here is that in the 20th century we have lost the relationship between imagination and fact\\".Bennet will be viewed as either an apologist for [George Adamski], or as having the insight to see beyond the superficial straw that Adamski worked with to perceive the small but priceless quantity of gold produced. In fact both views are correct and at the same time. In other words we are in contradictory territory here and Bennett is a wise guide.In discussing the power of metaphor (central to his thesis) Bennett says attempts to alter meaning will cause \\"forces beyond all belief to be summoned\\". This is truly stated and can be easily inverted to produce an equal truth. Such is the nature of this perplexing book - all is ambiguity.The old showman that was George Adamski deserves this book. It offers a wonderful, rich, rewarding and finally fabulous journey to the dream/reality factory. Go visit."},{"Title":"Looking for Orthon","review":"George Adamski, the subject of Colin Bennett's \`Looking for Orthon,' was not simply a flying saucer \\"nut.\\" Adamski, probably the world's most famous UFO Contactee, was both a complex individual, and a simple, at times naive, man. This naivet&eacute; does not mean that Adamski's experiences were hoaxes or delusions. It might surprise some readers to know that Adamski's saucers were witnessed by many people. Adamski \`s experiences did not exist in a vacuum. Adamski's story is exciting, certainly interesting and strange, and at times, including towards the end, poignant.Bennett not only writes about Adamski's experiences, but puts Adamski, and the Contactee movement, into a wonderful, dizzying context of American culture, of world culture at that time, making often times surprising (yet, upon reflection, perfectly sensible) connections.Colin Bennett goes deeper than this however, for he also addresses the phenomeana itself. Bennett is no true believer, but he is also vehemently anti \\"chronic, or cultural, skeptic\\" (his terms) and tells us exactly why. It is not Adamski that is up for critique, even while addressing his faults, it is everything else as well; culture, skeptics, politics, true believers, military, classism, history, and more.Bennett's writing style is not only knowledgeable, but extremely funny much of the time, and always insightful. His wit and humor should not be mistaken for shallowness or mere facetiousness.If you are new to the Contactees of the 1950s and 1960s or to George Adamski's story, this book will reveal not only the basic facts, but a rich backdrop that creates understanding and insight into not only Adamski, but UFOlogy, American culture, and history as well."},{"Title":"Looking for Orthon","review":"This is an interesting book about the Adamski case: not a believer, nor a skeptic but a balanced research into his life and his words.

Although he would become a leading diplomat in later years, he first turned to literary activities, of which The Rise of the Dutch Republic played a major role. Published in 1856 it became very popular among European and American readers and was translated in many languages,including Dutch and Russian.This work not only describes the history of Holland in colorful and eloquent terms and with a sense of sympathy for the Dutch, but also instructs in well documented ways how the Dutch built their Republic and a political system which still today influences Dutch society. Moreover it offers lessons to a modernday world which continues to grapple with dictatorships, disfunctional governments and failed states. This book is clearly a landmark in literary and historical terms, and a delight to read for those interested in Dutch history as well as readers more generally interested in history and its links to today's societies."},{"Title":"Business France: A Practical Guide to Understanding French Business Culture","review":"This book provides information essential to anyone hoping to conduct business in France.

If you truly love baseball, you want to read it.Why? Easy enough--Bill loved baseball, so much so that he never sat in fancy box seats at games but preferred to join the fans in the bleachers. He is hilarious, as in sidesplitting; he has many stories to tell about the funnier incidents he's been involved in. And when you run a team Veeck style, you have a lot of funny incidents.But the book is not just a compilation of Veeck buffoonery; he has strong feelings on many topics and expresses them with clarity and frankness. There are tributes to magnificent performances and courageous actions throughout the book. When you finish it, if you love the game, you wish only that you could have been an office staff person or groundskeeper following Bill through his career. You could never possibly have been bored (or made much money).This book is in the class of _Ball Four_--a defining work that gives real insight into real baseball. To read it is to delight in the game.As a partner, enough credit is not given Ed Linn. I don't know how Ed does it, but any book written with him will be entertaining, well written, and will above all preserve the main figure's personal style. I believe it is Ed's talent that takes the reminisces of sports figures and makes them a good read, and this deserves your appreciation and respect."},{"Title":"Veeck-- as in wreck: The autobiography of Bill Veeck (Sports library)","review":"The two things you need to know before you buy &quot;Veeck -- As In Wreck&quot; -- and you will buy this book, you must, if you've ever bought any professional sports bio before -- are the names Veeck and Linn.Bill Veeck you know from reputation -- the wacky promoter who invented everything from Ladies' Day to Disco Demolition Night. The man owned several baseball franchises (including the Chicago White Sox twice, for some reason), and was known as a both a promotional genius and a shrewd financier.As for Ed Linn... well, Linn was also the ghostwriter for another fantastic, edgy, opinionated baseball book, Leo Durocher's &quot;Nice Guys Finish Last&quot;. Not surprisingly, &quot;Veeck&quot; reads a lot like the Durocher tome (and it came first, too!). On every page here you'll find a funny anecdote, a scary bit of prescience, and a unique look at an otherwise-beloved icon. With Veeck's memory and Linn's acid pen, this book is quite hard to put down. Or to pick up, for that matter.Sports bios tend to hold back these days, let's face it. They're not as long and not as insightful as the Linn books. And the gift of time has helped ripen these pages. When Veeck talks about baseball's financial need to institute interleague play -- writing from 1961 -- you know this man saw around a few decades' worth of corners. When he takes the Yankees to task for failing to capitalize on Roger Maris's pursuit of the Babe Ruth home run record, and notes that it was a once-in-a-lifetime event, he's right -- so baseball got it right in '98, when McGwire came to town, and when the record fell yet again in '01, hardly anyone noticed.In the meantime you'll laugh at the sad fates of Bobo Holloman and Frank Saucier, the latter being the only ballplayer ever to be removed from a game for a midget. You'll be intrigued by Veeck's take on Larry Doby, and by his bitter retorts at Del Webb, then-owner of the hated behemoth Yankees. And you'll marvel at just how little has really changed in baseball since Veeck was retired. Owners plotting franchise shifts in shady back-room deals (Montreal, Florida. Florida, Boston). Owners doing everything to baseball except what really benefits the sport (It's a tie in Milwaukee!). Veeck lamenting not the high price of talent but rather the high price of mediocrity (how much is Colorado paying for Denny Neagle and Mike Hampton?)...Just about the only highlight not covered is the sight of White Sox outfielder Chet Lemon wearing shorts. One of the few Bill Veeck innovations that did not catch on, and aren't we all better off..."},{"Title":"Veeck-- as in wreck: The autobiography of Bill Veeck (Sports library)","review":"A wonderful slice of baseball history as seen from the consumate maverick of baseball. Veeck takes you on a journey from his beginnings listenning to John McGraw and his dad William Veeck Sr. shoot the breeze about baseball up until his purchase of the White Sox for the second time in 1975. Along the way you are introduced to those you may have never knew (Gene Bearden and Harry Grabiner), those you always knew (Eddie Gaedel, Satchel Paige and Lou Boudreau) and those you though you knew (Ford Frick, Del Webb and Charles Comiskey). The chapters about Veeck's ownership of the St. Louis Browns and baseball's fight about its disposition are alone worth the price of the book. I'd give the book five stars because it is well written and entertaining, but I suspect some of his stories are embellished in his favor. But you have to expect that in any autobiography. So many of today's ideas have Veeck written all over them, most notably interleague play and exploding scoreboards. One final note: keep a baseball encyclodedia next to you when you read this one. It comes in handy when the obscure names come flying, and if you feel &quot;ole Willie&quot; is telling a tall one."},{"Title":"Veeck-- as in wreck: The autobiography of Bill Veeck (Sports library)","review":"This book is considered a classic because of the great inside information and the &quot;smack 'em in the face&quot; comments from Bill Veeck, the one-time owner of the Cleveland Indians and St. Louis Browns and the two-time owner of the Chicago White Sox.

Mr. Veeck, who has been enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame, was of a rare breed: a baseball owner who actually had a clue. Of course, that meant that during his life he was a pariah among owners. The book covers his life from childhood to the first time he sold the Chicago White Sox, in the early 1960s. It's loaded with screamingly funny anecdotes. And although the book was co-authored with Ed Linn, Veeck could have written the book by himself: he was quite literate, and the book is strewn with literary and cultural references.

Veeck did it with a cheerful outlook, without rancor or bitterness, and with an impish sense of humor. He was truly a man of the people.I remember Veeck as a White Sox in the late 1970's, when he bought the team, and against all odds, fielded the South Side Hitmen and made a run for the pennant with no defense or pitching. Veeck brought innovation and fun to Comiskey Park, and was no newcomer to baseball by then. Had he been a racecar driver, he would have been on the 480th lap of the Indy 500. Veeck, who lost a leg due to a combat wound, who was a four pack a day smoker, who rarely slept more than three hours a night had a curious, intelligent and unstoppable mind.In reading his thoughts, I was struck by the prescient content of his thoughts on baseball. In 1962, he proposed revenue sharing for visiting teams on television revenues, predicting that small market teams would not be able to compete in the future. He was the first owner who believed expansion would bestow increased popularity on baseball. And, in immortal words, said that it was not the price of superstardom that would haunt payrolls, but the price of mediocrity.His energy was astounding. He turned a profit in Milwaukee (pre-Braves and Brewers) by sheer hustle, promotion, and horse trademanship. He brought a world Series to Cleveland by know how, and made himself a beloved figure in that great town.But through it all, there is his prevailing love for baseball, and the loyalty, admiration and love for his second wife. This is an inspiring story about an original man."},{"Title":"Veeck-- as in wreck: The autobiography of Bill Veeck (Sports library)","review":"They just don't make baseball owners like Bill Veeck anymore, and it is our loss. Maverick, visionary, and showman extraordinaire; Bill had a ball setting baseball's staid establishment on its ear with his unorthodox tactics, mischievous spirit, and wild promotions. He was an every-man who never lost the common touch, and believed that to be the secret of his success. His promotions and gimmicks bedeviled and enraged his fellow owners and the purists within the mort bound baseball establishment while they delighted the fans who Bill had a knack for attracting anywhere he went.In this fascinating, fun, romp of an autobiography, Veeck showed that his knack for telling stories was as well honed as his knack for whacky promotions. Working with the outstanding Ed Linn (who also co-wrote Leo Duroucher's autobiography \`Nice Guys Finish Last') Veeck served up his life's tale one entertaining story after another. Whether writing about sending a midget to pinch hit in a ball game, planting the ivy in Wrigley Field as a young man, creating the first exploding scoreboard, creatively financing and finagling ownership deals, or feuding with fellow owners, Veeck's stories are hits, every one.If you love baseball, mavericks, or showmen, you can't go wrong with this one - highly recommended.Theo Logos"},{"Title":"Veeck-- as in wreck: The autobiography of Bill Veeck (Sports library)","review":"Bill Veeck was a true maverick before that term got tossed around by crazed hockey moms/ vp wannabee's.

Bill Veeck (1914-1986) was an innovative baseball owner who bucked the establishment, disdained stuffed shirts, and was full of ideas and enthusiasm. Here he tells his story, from a Chicago boyhood (his father ran the Cubs), to ownership of the then minor-league Milwaukee Brewers in the early 1940's. From there he describes running the Cleveland Indians (including their 1948 championship), the old St. Louis Browns and the Chicago White Sox (a team he owned twice). Readers get a sense of the baseball controversies that existed a few decades ago, and see what it was like to run a sports franchise in the days before free agency drove up player salaries. Veeck had his faults, but he loved baseball, disdained arrogance, opposed racism, and strived to give his fans their money's worth. Among his innovations are exploding scoreboards, player names on the uniforms, fireworks, and of course, sending a midget up to bat (he walked on four pitches).VEECK AS IN WRECK is a bit dated since it was first published in the early 1960's, but Veeck's enthusiasm and collaborator Ed Linn's prose makes for a fun and entertaining read."},{"Title":"Veeck-- as in wreck: The autobiography of Bill Veeck (Sports library)","review":"I knew Bill.

He rightly points out that it will be what he is remembered for most.That is true but it's only part of the story. Veeck is a storyteller and a fun person. He thinks baseball should be fun and thinks fans should have fun watching it. His statement that fan will enjoy a 7th place team with bread and circus' more than a 7th place team without one is about as true as it gets.He demonstrates his storytelling ability over and over again. His tales from Rogers Hornsby and his mom; (&quot;What makes you think you're smarter than your father?&quot;) To Satchel Page and his ultimate dream; (&quot;I dream of starting a team of 9 midgets endlessly wallking, then I dream os Satchel pitching against them and striking them out endlessly,&quot;) to his added on chapter on his re-purchase of the White Sox in the mid 70's and his great love for Gene Autry; (&quot;Back in Seattle again.&quot;) keep you reading through the book.There is venom here and it is directed at people and it's not painted with a happy face. That is one of the charmes of the book. He tells it the way he tells it. He doesn't expect to be loved and doesn't care if he is, but he will have his say.I'm sure he would be proud of his son who has done a fine job keeping the tradition going with the very fun Northern League. He would be prouder of the smiles his book produces on the faces of baseball fans. If you are one and even if you aren't this book will put a smile on you too."},{"Title":"Veeck-- as in wreck: The autobiography of Bill Veeck (Sports library)","review":"If you are at all interested in the history of major league baseball, then \\"Veeck - As in Wreck\\" belongs on your top ten list of must-read books about the game.For those who don't know Bill Veeck, he is a man the likes of whom we probably will never see again in the sport: a baseball man from birth, who grew up at Wrigley Field and later fronted management groups which owned four teams: the Milwaukee Brewers (when they were a minor league franchise), the Cleveland Indians, the St. Louis Browns (the current Baltimore Orioles), and the Chicago White Sox. Unlike today's owners, Veeck did not come into wealth through a non-baseball business; in fact, he didn't really come into wealth at all. He was a classic hustler (in the good sense of the term), who put together club buyout deals consisting of mostly of hope, promises and borrowed money.Once Veeck owned a franchise, he ran it in the most fan-friendly way possible: he spruced up the ballpark, put his deal making skills to work assembling a team of the best players he could afford, and tried every promotion and attraction he and his cohorts could think of (including, most famously, a midget at bat) to fill the stands. Given that all the other major league teams at the time were owned by bluebood families who valued tradition and the status quo, Veeck was of necessity cast in the role of maverick. While he often had to battle the powers that be that ran baseball and the other teams, he found his rewards in the stands among the people whom he loved and who, for the most part, loved him back, especially when he brought the World Series to Cleveland and the south side of Chicago.\\"Veeck - As in Wreck\\" has multiple qualities that make it a must-read for baseball fans. First and foremost it is the autobiography of a very interesting man who accomplished much and overcame some serious adversity (health problems and lack of money) to do so. Veeck shows how much can be accomplished if you keep a positive attitude and keep thinking and trying. His love for the common folk and people comes through strong, and not only contributed to his business success but also made him a genuinely happy person.But baseball fans will most relish the inside look Veeck provides of the baseball world in the mid 20th century. Veeck was an innovator, a visionary, and an instigator of change, whom history has proven to be right on many issues: westward expansion and major league expansion, interleague play, the loss of independence of the minor leagues, the oversized influence wielded by the Yankees because of their immense bankroll, and various changes to the fan experience, many of which were pioneered by Veeck. Major league baseball often resisted Veeck and conspired against him, but in the end usually did what he was advocating (such as putting a major league team in Milwaukee, moving the St. Louis Browns to Baltimore, and putting a team in Los Angeles to name just a few).\\"Veeck - As in Wreck\\" is written in an easy-to-read conversational style. Veeck loved talking with people, and the book reads as if Veeck is telling stories to his friends and admirers over a beer or two. Because of the impact that Bill Veeck had on the game of baseball and because of the insightful stories he tells, \\"Veeck - As in Wreck\\" is still a must-read for amateur baseball historians today, almost fifty years after it was first published."},{"Title":"Veeck-- as in wreck: The autobiography of Bill Veeck (Sports library)","review":"They don't make 'em like Bill Veeck (as in wreck) anymore. Today's baseball executives are generally very conservative business people with little or no flair. They're about as colorful as your accountant, and about as creative as your financial advisor. Check that; my financial advisor is so creative, he's able to perform magic tricks with my portfolio. Poof; now you see it, now you don't.That's the kind of creativity we can do without. The world of baseball was blessed many years ago when a free-wheeling guy by the name of Bill Veeck provided the industry with a great deal of fun-filled, off the wall, and generally zany antics as a front office executive for teams such as the Cleveland Indians, St Louis Browns (just before they headed to Baltimore), and Chicago White Sox. His promotional stunts were legendarily insane, but with flashes of genius. Who else but Veeck would have the audacity to sign a midget for one at bat (he walked on four pitches), wearing the number 1/8? Before the little guy stepped into the batter's box, Veeck threatened him with bodily harm if he dared to swing his little bat at any of the offerings. The stunt proved successful; the Browns drew their largest crowd in four seasons (18,000 or so), and Veeck became a national celebrity; at least throughout the world of baseball.Veeck's autobiography, which was co-authored with Ed Linn, provides the reader with large doses of zany promotional stunts over the years, along with his commentary on the events that helped shape his wild and wooly ride through baseball's executive hierarchy. It's a story that can't be missed for any true fan of the game."},{"Title":"Veeck-- as in wreck: The autobiography of Bill Veeck (Sports library)","review":"This is one of the single funniest books that I have ever read. Moreover, it is a book that you can reread again and again and still find amusing years after your initial reading. It is that good.Bill Veeck was the son of a sportswriter (William Veeck, Sr.) who later became a top executive with the Chicago Cubs and helped rebuild the organization. As a young man, Veeck, himself, worked for the Cubs and played an important role in remodeling the bleachers and adding many of the signature features to Wrigley Field. Later, he owned and operated a successful minor league team (the Milwaukee Brewers), a World Series Championship team (the Cleveland Indians), and he presided over the demise of the poorest team in baseball (the St. Louis Browns) before putting in two stints as the head owner of the Chicago White Sox (including the 1959 pennant winning club).From this unique perspective, Veeck takes the reader on a wild booze fueled ride that explores the joys, the sorrows and hypocrisies of professional baseball. During the Fifties, Veeck was essentially blackballed by his fellow American League owners and compelled to sell his stock in the struggling St. Louis club. As soon as Veeck was out of the picture, the new owner was permitted to move the team to a greener ballfield in Baltimore. The other owners resented Veeck's flair for showmanship. Today, virtually all baseball clubs imitate the promotions that Veeck pioneered.Someday, I can only hope that Bill Murray succeeds in his ambition to adapt this marvelously humorous book into a motion picture."},{"Title":"Veeck-- as in wreck: The autobiography of Bill Veeck (Sports library)","review":"I read this book when I was thirteen, and read it again twenty years later.

Like what he did to try to rid Saint-Louis of the Cardinals. That alone is worth many times the price of the book.The only regret I had reading the book is about the opportunity he missed with the Philadelphia Phillies. Veeck was too honest and straight foward for his own good and should have kept Mountain Landis \\"in the dark\\" about packing the Phillies with Negro League Stars.In my honest opinion, Bill Veeck remains the Babe Ruth of executives.While he made people attend games and having fun, he transformed dismal Indians and White Sox organisations into 1st class franchise.Like Babe Ruth, baseball had one Bill Veeck. Sadly, there's never gonna be another."},{"Title":"Veeck-- as in wreck: The autobiography of Bill Veeck (Sports library)","review":"Fans are what really makes baseball popular; and Bill Veek describes his life and how he influenced very much the game of baseball. After reading this book; the reader will understand the business side of baseball, and will appreciate how much good Mr. Veek did for baseball. Bill writes in this book using his own personal style; therefore sometimes you get the feeling he is speaking in front of you. Veek, was indeed a Marketing genius and great baseball fan. He knew so much about baseball; he was very good in every department of operating a baseball club. The book is also fun to read; it makes you laugh many times. In my personal opinion, now I know, after reading this book, the difference between baseball owners that are in the business only to make money, and the ones who care about both the business side and the person who goes to a baseball game to enjoy the experience. Every sport or field of business has it\`s long time legends and heroes; Bill Veek is a baseball hero. The business of baseball owes him very much. You will see the reasons why after reading this book."},{"Title":"Veeck-- as in wreck: The autobiography of Bill Veeck (Sports library)","review":"This is the best sports book I have read.

On one hand it's a fascinating autobiography of a colorful character, as he lived (barely) through an extraordinary era in our history. But it's also a amazing inside view of our national pastime, the best game in the world. I learned so much that was new and eye-opening, even though this book runs from the 30's to the early 70's. The stories are wonderful; sometimes hysterical, sometimes heartfelt, but always engrossing. Bill Veeck's voice was always ahead of his time, but always rooted in a love of the game, the sheer fun of it all."},{"Title":"Veeck-- as in wreck: The autobiography of Bill Veeck (Sports library)","review":"Bill Veeck gives you an inside on the greatest time of life. Back before all the politics and contract negotiations and agents and BS, when baseball was FUN and honest and a game.Mr. Veeck did more for the game than anyone ever has. He is somewhat being copied now but noone is having the fun he did.I promise you will LOVE this book so much you will do as I did and buy \\"The Hustler's Handbook\\" and \\"Thirty Tons a Day\\".

In these times of high ticket prices and salaries, it is fasciniating to read about how Veeck bought and sold major league franchises, sometimes with little to no capital or cash to start with.Veeck is also the pioneer of the idea of going to a baseball game and being entertained. He came up with some of the wackiest and funniest promotions and ideas ever and they are all contained in this book. On top of that, he was a genuinely funny guy, which also comes across throughout the course of the book.Every baseball fan should read this book to realize exactly how much Veeck shaped the experience of going to a baseball game like we know it today."},{"Title":"Veeck-- as in wreck: The autobiography of Bill Veeck (Sports library)","review":"My thanks goes out to Bill Veeck for being one of the men that saved baseball on the South Side of Chicago. Even though it is not all included in his autobiography, he worked to keep the White Sox in Chicago multiple times. This is one of the reasons many people closely associate Veeck with the White Sox.On page 352, Veeck writes, \\"To the White Sox rooter, there is nothing casual about baseball. Wake him up in the middle of the night, ask him who he is and he will say, 'I am a carpenter and a White Sox fan.' He may or may not have inherited his trade from his father, but chances are that he inherited his rooting interest in the Sox. This kind of family solidarity can only come out of adversity and trial by fire.\\" This is the blue collar attitude he brought to baseball ownership. He was also an entertainer and promoter the likes of which baseball will never see again.\\"Veeck as in Wreck\\" is a wildly entertaining ride. While Veeck occasionally gets bogged down in mathematics and finances, his baseball stories compensate. The midget that Veeck sent to bat in St. Louis is discussed. The wild promotions that attracted record crowds are included, though he could not possibly include them all. The book only omits his second tenure in Chicago which included the dubious Disco Demolition Night. Veeck started in the early 1900's when his father owned the Cubs. While his heart may have been with the Cubs, his best work came with the White Sox.Including his riffs with the owners who included current commissioner Bud Selig, Veeck was a fan's owner. Although long, this is a great read for baseball fans. White Sox fans should find it extra sweet."},{"Title":"Veeck-- as in wreck: The autobiography of Bill Veeck (Sports library)","review":"I was a Sox fan who was in Chicago with Bill Veeck, but was too stupid to appreciate him at the time, I stand chastized. Bill Veeck was an anomalie among owners. He was in it for the love of the game, not the love of the gain. His self depreciating humor and honesty set a bench mark that we may never experience again. His honesty about his scheming is refreshing and caused me to break out in a laugh more than once.

Bill Veeck was an original. The man's dream was to field a team of midgets and have them endlessly walk around the bases. My God, he did send a midget to bat. He was crazy in the best way possible.This book's about baseball, but it's really about life and how to live. Bill Veeck lived."},{"Title":"Veeck-- as in wreck: The autobiography of Bill Veeck (Sports library)","review":"Veeck went against the grain. This book explores how he got into baseball all the way until he left due to his leg. The afterward picks up nicely.He knew he made many enemies in baseball, and highlighted many of his feuds, but always from a humorous point of view. While this book is about 400 pages, it goes by very fast.Learn from the man who was the first to put names on the back of jerseys, introduced home run displays, tried to make many games events (like named for players), used fireworks as a drawing point, and more.

I have been a fan of Austen's since I read the first page of Pride and Prejudice. I currently own all of her published works, some having been replaced a couple of times due to wear. Since my latest copy of Sense and Sensibility bit the dust a month or so ago, I was thrilled to get Bethany House's copy in the mail this week.In terms of the actual novel, no changes have been made to Austen's original work. The novel is printed in all its glory with my favorite characters and places still in tact. What has been added by several of Bethany House's writers are notes and annotations about the life and times of Austen.The book comes complete with a key, which indicates the type of note/annotation being applied in each instance. The notes fall into the following categories: \\"historical and cultural details [...] from England in the early 1800's,\\" \\"fact and tidbits from Austen's life,\\" \\"references to S&S; in today's culture, particularly in film,\\" \\"unscientific ranking of the novel's most frustrating characters,\\" \\"themes of faith drawn from the novel or Austen's life,\\" \\"comments and asides on the book's characters or plot,\\" and \\"the parts of the novel that just make us smile.\\"I LOVE the additional comments, quips, and bits added to Austen's work. They serve to add the insight intended into a world of ladies and gentlemen. The authors who have offered their take on Austen's work compliment the novel by adding interesting references and inserting a little comedy into one of the best loved novels of all time.On the minus side (if you can really call it that), the novel did take more time to read. I found myself reading a page, seeing the notations, and reading the page again to see if the added information changed the image I create in my head of Austen's world. In most instances, it certainly did! It did make the reading more cumbersome at some points, but overall I really enjoyed this take on one of the best loved works of literature. I plan to order the Insight Edition of Pride and Prejudice and look forward to many more such editions.This book was provided free of charge by the publisher as a review copy. The publisher had no editorial rights or claims over the content or the conclusions made in this review.

The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love.

My love for anything and everything Victorian has helped me embrace this novel set in the Regency Period, and so, naturally I fell in love with this timeless piece. This story of the very different Dashwood sisters and their clashing tastes in their choices of men to love, was endearing as well as very frustrating at times. Just when I thought the obvious about Colonel Brandon, Edward or Willoughby- the story took a different turn just to add to the intrigue of it all; classic Austen at its best.The story revolves around love-sickness, love-triangles, a marriage of convenience, age and love, differences of choices and opinions, wealth and social status, influence, family conflict, secret-filled pasts and ultimately...and appropriately so: sense and sensibility. I'm still not sure which of the sisters I concurred with the most; Elinor or Marianne... Austen brilliantly shifts us from one perception to the other while embracing both depending on the situation. Ultimately the girls' reconciliation and love for eachother blends the disparities of state helping them come to terms with their own serenity. Love can then be found and accepted under a new light.Sense and Sensibility is a light read embedded with deeper meaning that brings comfort, peaks interest and offers a colourful variety of figures (the comical busy-body Miss Jennings is indeed very special!) On the whole, this read meshed excitement, passion, drama as well as \`sagesse' in the lives of two otherwise very ordinary ladies of the times. The book doesn't skip a beat with essential meanings and turn of events within every paragraph- With this one, you won't want to blink:)One can never get enough of elegantly written suspense-filled love twists and pangs. At least I can't- Loved it!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Being a Patrick O'Brian fan and knowing he was an admirer of Jane Austen, I gave her a try a few years ago with Pride and Prejudice and found it stunningly good and unforgettable. Sense and Sensibility is my second Austen novel and I hoped for an equally good performance. I would not have had the patience to get very far with Jane Austen earlier in my life. Austen can be stilted, wordy (to say the least), obtuse and just plain difficult to read and understand. She also leaves a lot to the imagination which although frustrating, actually adds depth and emotion. There is also a keen, many-layered understanding of people at their best, worst, and various shades of in- between, along with the associated foibles. Sense and Sensibility is a great story that, at times, had me rushing through many chapters to see the end result. For example, Marianne's encounter with Willoughby in London would make my top ten of dramatic literary scenes (if I were to ever compile such a list). As Sense and Sensibility neared its end, I hoped for and expected the sort of satisfying, happy, and witty ending I enjoyed in Pride and Prejudice, but found an unsatisfying, matter of fact (but perhaps realistic) anti-climax instead. I feel like I am defacing something sacred, but I have to give Sense and Sensibility only 4 stars. It is well worth the time, but if one is to pick their first Jane Austen book, based on my limited experience, let it be Pride and Prejudice. Next on my list is Emma."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"This is the first full-length novel that Austen wrote, and - although it's easy to find proof for something you know is true - it shows. This book just wasn't as well-designed as Pride and Prejudice, where it feels like every character and scene has its purpose. But the characters and charming and the story is light and fun, and it's definitely worth the read."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"This book arrived very quickly and is just what I am looking for. Thank you!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness. Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility). How these two interact with the world, each other, as well as family and friends makes up the bulk of the book. They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were. The supporting characters are very engaging and I found myself rooting for most of them, even a couple who are not entirely good. There are a few characters (e.g. Mrs. Jenkins) who are caricatures meant to parody some of the social norms of the day but even she has some depth to her and is likeable.While I initially picked this book up due to fond memories ofPride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics), I found Sense & Sensibility to be an excellent novel in its own right. I'm not sure why, but I was worried that it might be a bit dry. I needn't have been concerned, as the wit and story both sparkle from the first few pages and it only gets better as it goes along.I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending. I did think that a bit more attention could have been paid to Marianne at the end but in many respects Elinor is more the central character so it is perhaps fitting that the climax focuses more on her.In sum, this is an excellent novel and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"After finally getting round to reading the books that launched my top three period film loves (P&P;Pride and Prejudice - The Special Edition (A&E;, 1996), S&S;Sense & Sensibility (Special Edition), and best of all PersuasionPersuasion), it was fascinating to note what Emma Thompson did and did not use in her screenplay of S&S.;As to the novel itself-most surprising and gratifying was the biting satire, wit and sarcasm in Miss Austen's writing. Her carefully veiled views on \\"society\\" good and bad will stand as a historical and societal timeline into the era. A woman's place, or lack thereof, is keenly felt, as is the feeling of helplessness of women with the unfortunate prospect of being born without means. As well as what some women gave up to secure \\"a good match\\".

In Sense and Sensibility it doesn't seem like you get to know the characters as well as in Pride. The novel seems to drag along for way to long before anything happens in the last few pages. I know the novel has a lot to do with people trying to marry rich, but the focus on money seems to be more prevalent in Sense than in Pride.

I decided I wanted to read the book to get the real version. I was not disappointed. I enjoy all of Jane Austen's books. I wish she had lived longer so she could have written more. She was an amazing author."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Two sisters have come of marrying age. One loves rashly and deeply, the other cautiously and with no little reserve - the sense and the sensibility. The contrast set up, Jane Austen takes the two young women through nearly the same set of events. Through love's introduction, intervening conflict and ultimate disappointment, we observe the impacts and the results of these two disparate manners of dealing with the opposite sex. This being a Jane Austen comedy, don't be surprised if things work out for someone in the end.While obviously very well written and full of interesting characters and insights, this, like most of Jane Austen's work, simply \\"doesn't do it for me.\\" Certainly Ms. Austen is not without her modern relevance, but many of the important ideas running through her novels, including this one, are foreign and even offensive. For example, her casual indifference toward the unmoneyed, her obvious belief in the natural limitations of the female sex and the importance she sets on formality set my teeth a-grinding. She writes, as they say, of a different time. Similarly, her writing style is often, including in this book, tedious and opaque. Economy of words and clarity are not so important as obeisance to formality and avoidance of perceived impropriety. As I said, writing of a different time. As one can likely see, my complaints about Jane Austen are more due to my own predilections than any shortcomings of the famed authoress.That said, I do believe that reading this book is good for a person - it will make you more informed and provide material worth thinking on. Several of the characters will stick with you. Ms. Austen has a way of making her characters very distinct despite the smallness of her authorial world. The characters are not Elizabeth Bennett and Fitzwilliam Darcy, but the Dashwood girls are worth remembering. Furthermore, the major themes, while not \\"big ideas\\" are relevant to most everyone and persuasively resolved. Sense and sensibility was for me, however, less enjoyable reading than I would prefer. The plot line moved slowly, the ideas seemed dated and the language obscured rather than revealed."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Haven't had a chance to read the book yet. But, it looks like it will be a great read. The book came as promised. It is a paperback - but a high quality one. If you are looking for this classic, I do recommend this printing."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"&quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; is not as interesting or engrossing a book as Austen's later works; some of the characters are boring, the plot is not especially interesting, nor is the ending altogther satisfying (Marianne and Colonel Brandon are surely one of the oddest of odd couples). But it's a very good book, promising much better to come, a promise which was abundantly fulfilled in &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. Marianne's histrionics drove me up the wall. It took a while for me to realize that Marianne is meant as a caricature; that Austen thinks her as ridiculous as she appears to the reader. Witness Marianne's rhapsodizing about the fallen leaves at Norwood and Elinor cutting her short with her observation that &quot;not everybody shares your passion for dead leaves.&quot; Elinor is the more sympathetic and likeable of the two sisters and Austen clearly identifies with her; Elinor's calm, rational sense and balance promises much better for happiness than Marianne's overblown romanticism. We can see in this first book the emergence of an awesomely talented writer."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"In recent weeks my wife in rapid succesion read this book and Pride and Prejudice and then ran out to the store on a Sunday evening to pick up Mansfield Park. What a disappointment. I hit the wall about p. 20 and could never find a way to get involved. The characters were uninteresting and the situations dull, and I had to force my way to the end. I haven't had this much trouble with a book in a long time. Since this is a minority view, I would only ask: Is this book the best introduction to Jane Austen? Should I have tried anoter title -- Pride and Prejudice, say?"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"There is no greater author than Jane Austin. Some may disagree, as is their right, but I will NEVER agree with them. I love her. LOVE, isn't a strong enough word. And, this book is on my TOP FIVE favs. of all time. The story of these sisters is timeless and the struggle for independance while still searching for love, could have been written today. Jane Austin was SO ahead of her time. Elinor and Maryann's relationship is so endearing and the heartbreak you feel for them is all consumming. You won't be able to put down this novel until you are satisfied that this wonderful and amazing women will be content in their respective lives. The language, whit and concern taken with these characers is a true testament to the talent of Jane Austin. She's amazing. No doubt about it."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I have read 5 of Jane Austen's 6 novels (all but Mansfield Park) and Sense and Sensibility is without a doubt the best of them all. For those of you who were disappointed that it did not match up to Pride and Prejudice, I assure you, it did, and then rose far above it. My English teacher in 6th grade always talked about Sense and Sensibility and how much she loved it. After I read Pride and Prejudice, my first Austen experience, I knew that I had to read that novel. As a warning for you as well, do NOT watch the movie with Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet before you read the book. I did that and then I was totally thrown off by the book. Now, it is a great adaptation of the novel, but they mix up the scenes and so I found myself constantly confused because I did not meet Lucy Steele until much later than I thought I would. The movie introduces her much sooner. Another recommendation: if you want to see Jane Austen at her best, read Emma. (My second favorite) Persuasion and Northanger Abbey are good, but nothing like those two."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I was only 11 when I saw the movie. It was my favourite movie of all time! I read the book after I saw the movie and I really enjoyed it. It gave more detail and the story was told very well."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"A Jane Austen fan, I was disappointed with this book. The language, the style of writing was not in contrast with her other works, but the characters and plot did not interest me. Marianne was decidedly a young woman whom I had no interest in. She was too wrapped up in her own little world to be a girl who deserved the compassion which Austen tried to ilicit. Besides this, Marianne and Elinor's prejudices made them seem as ill-bred as the company they ridiculed for being such. Although I liked Elinor for her honesty and compassion and hated Willoughby and Lucy Steele because of who they were, I was so disappointed with the conclusion that these three did little to save this book. My recommendation: read Pride and Prejudice or Emma instead."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Sense and Sensibility is very good--but as one of Austen's earliest works, it's just not her best. That's not a criticism, merely an opinion. And wherever one thinks this falls in the Austen cannon, everyone should read S&S.; Because even when Austen is not at her best, she's is much better than most 19th century authors. There is the humor and romance one comes to expect in a JA yarn, however here it is not so finely honed. Also, there are no minor characters of the caliber of Lady Catherine de Bourgh or Mr. Collins. However, most novels don't have minor characters as compelling, so again chalk this up as observation.The one rub I do have with the plot is Elinor's love for Edward Ferrars. Frankly, Edward is more than a bit of a drip, and it is hard to imagine him inspiring love much less devotion. A bit more believable but still odd is Marianne's transformation (after recovering from death's door because of a broken heart). Once truly, madly, deeply in love with Willoughby, after a period of convalescence and introspection she transfers her affections to the not-it-the-least alike Col. Brandon. It's rather pat, and though plausible, it is just barely so.It is a vast improvement over Northanger Abbey, JA's earliest work; showing the writer to be well on her way to the style and substance of her later masterpieces."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Jane Austen has a way of writing that pulls you in, or at least for me.Sense and Sensibility is about two sister struggling through the trials of relationships, and doing their best to keep their senses. I specifically liked this copy because of its look. The cover and design is simply beautiful, and that of an older book you'd find in a forgotten bookstore. I saw many copies of this book, but this one caught my eye."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Since I enjoyed Pride and Prejudice so much, I thought I would follow up with Austen's first book Sense and Sensibility. Sadly disappointing. Although Austen's excellent writing style is evident here in her first attempt, the plot is maudlin and predictable. Two sisters, one beautiful, sweet, and trusting and the other more prosaic in appearance, but wise beyond her 19 years (if this sounds a lot like P & P it is because it is) alternate their time between the rural English countryside and cosmopolitan London. The more comely of the two is enamored with a dashing chap who turns out to be a cad. Dumped unceremoniously by said cad, she proceeds to mope and weep through 150 pages. A good smack to the chops would do her a world of good, but sadly never happens. In the end every thing works out, more or less, in a contrived and unbelievable manner and every one lives happily ever after.Most interesting aspect of the book is the description of British customs, class distinctions and the courting ritual. Also, it is remarkable how little has changed in the English language in the 200 years since this book was written. Austen is a superb stylist, but beyond the fascinating historical descriptions of the British upper classes, circa 1790, there is little there here(to paraphrase Gertrude Stein's description of Oakland, California)."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I used to wonder why so many people preferred Pride and Prejudice over Sense and Sensibility. What differences were dynamic enough to make so many people sway? I read the novel and was intrigued, yet not as much as I was when reading Pride and Prejudice.Sense and Sensibility is a delightful story with characters easy to fall in love with. You automatically root for Elinor at the drop of a hat, and though we prefer to think of Marianne as someone completely different from ourselves, we resist reproaching her and root for her instead. Though I wouldn't call it Austen's best, this book is a great way to pass time, especially on a shaded porch swing in a drizzle."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"In SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, Jane Austen begins in her first novel what for her was to be her life long concern: what is the proper role that society should take in the relationship between men and women? In this novel at least, her response is that potential lovers must strike a balance between accepting the limitations upon romance imposed by a society that was ruled by a complex web of social, political, and legal restrictions and rejecting or at least tactfully ignoring those restrictions and thus incurring the wrath of an outraged society that does not easily suffer its laws flouted. In her later novels, Austen implies that wit may be a leavening agent (as in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE) that may succeed where pure sense comes up short or raw emotion may be used (as in PERSUASION) for the same purpose.Unlike in her later novels, Austen divides her heroine into two psychologically different young women. There is Elinor Dashwood, who possesses sense in abundance, and then there is her sister Marianne, who cultivates sensibility. In the context of 18th century English genteel society \\"sense\\" refers not to what we would call today as common sense but the unspoken assumption that single women realize that they do not live in a cultural vacuum. The rules concerning the legal distribution of inherited property, the social rules concerning who may dance with whom at approved balls, and the need to marry \\"upward\\" all interlocked to place a velvet-gloved bear hug on women who had some very real and serious decisions to make concerning marriage if they did not want to end up as the next generation's spinster aunt. There is Marianne Dashwood, who is more than willing to make such daunting choices not based on the sense that guides her sister but on the trashy and sensational pulp romance novels of the day. Where Elinor falls in love with Edward Ferrars, a man of honor, if not of the hidden type, she makes her choice based on premises of which society could approve. Where Marianne has an infatuation with the roguish John Willoughby, a man with clear character flaws, she makes her choice based on her own artificially heightened sensibility of dime-store romance books. The basic thrust of the novel is that both sisters slowly and painfully grow to accept that a life based solely on the one or the other philosophy is unworkable. Austen implies that there is a golden middle, albeit one which probably is more closely allied to sense than to sensibility.In SENSE AND SENSIBILITY, Jane Austen limits her view of the often convoluted knots of human relationships into a deceptively smooth and flattened perspective in a manner that would slowly change in her later books to include a more realistic, if not more necessarily complex vision that would allow women and men to interact in a forthright way of which even an entrenched society might approve. Though SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is not Austen's most popular book, it clearly shows in a restricted way the limits that her culture placed on the rights of women to call their own shots."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Sense and Sensibility is a book that describes the adventures of falling in love in the 19th century. Love back then wasn't as simple a thing as falling in love today is. Women and men had to abide by the rules their society presented- marrying based on money and status- as the main characters of this book had to do.The book follows sisters Elinor Dashwood, a sensible young woman who does not let her emotions rule her behavior, and Marianne Dashwood, a person who exaggerates and acts on her many emotions constantly. Their journey starts off when their father dies and they are forced to move out to the country to live on a very small allowance. At their new home, they meet a numerous amount of people who turn their life into a whirlwind. Willoughby, a suave and prominent young man, steals the attention of Marianne and an old love of Elinor's returns. Both of these relationships turn out differently than anyone can expect, through many twists and turns.This is a wonderful book that holds your attention through the end. The beginning pages that describe different relations, deaths, and monetary concerns were difficult to follow, as well as some of the different situations throughout the book. But Jane Austins ability to portray the hardships, and results, that both of these sisters had to endure, through different situations of love in the unruly 19th century, was without compare."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"If you are not interested in 19th century society and the roles of women, this story is not for you. The plot is excellent, with many unexpected twists and turns, but the way in which Austen goes about presenting this dramatic story is occasionally hard to follow. Although her descriptions of society in the 19th century are very interesting, they are different than society today, so they are sometimes difficult to understand.Austen presents the roles of women in 19th century society in a new and interesting way. In her book, women were expected to stay at home with the children, and they were not even offered the option of working out of the home. The women in the novel longed only to fall in love, get married, and have children. If they did not get married, they employed themselves in matching younger women with eligible men.The love stories are very intriguing as well. Elinor loves Edward, but hardly shows it, while Marianne falls in love with Willoughby and, through her actions, announces it to the town. Both eventually reach a happy medium where Elinor learns that, in order to win Edward, she has to show her emotions more. Marianne, on the other hand, realizes that she needs to be a little more reserved with her emotions.Overall this is a very interesting book though the language is sometimes hard to follow."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Perhaps the negatives of Jane Austen is the dated quality of the words she used. But, when one accompanies reading with a dictionary, she becomes a thoroughly charming author. I read Jane Austen first in the 8th grade, and found it difficult to follow, and difficult to understand the humor. After the 10th grade, a student gave a lecture on Irony and Seven Common Uses as Seen in Jane Austen's Three Most Famous Novels. After hearing this, I came to a new appreciation. Not light reading, it is the type of book that can be read over and over, and enjoyed more as the years go by. I finished it for the fourth time three days ago, and still find myself dreaming, writing, and even speaking in the cautious and conscious turn of phrase that Jane Austen can so well suspend. While not a book for a younger generation, it is definitely the kind of book that should and will be read. Not, however, as sintilating as her future novels, and not as humorous as Emma or Pride and Prejudice. A good starting point to get into reading British Literature."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"The truth is...I cannot esteem it as well as I should like. It can't be explained in entirety, but I find the novel noticeably lack-luster after reading Austen's other outstanding novels. A plethora of secondary characters and sub-plots choke out a lot of the brilliance of its main characters. This is a rather surprising realization for me, being an avid Austen fan - but it is spoken with all honesty. Nevertheless, even though it is not Austen's best written work, it is still a very amiable novel and a nice light read for any classics buff."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I was pretty dissapointed when I read Sense and Sensibility because I had already read Pride and Prejudice and loved it so much that when I read S&amp;S I found it rather long and un-eventful. All the scenes were dragged out and a lot the characters were boring and vain. Pride and Prejudice would have to be the best book I've ever read, it's witty, smart and enjoyable and it's heroin Elizabeth is someone that everyone can releate to whereas Ellinor is quite pompous and boring. I wish S&amp;S had more of a storyline like the other Jane Austen books because I truly love her books but having said that S&amp;S is still a very good book and I'd recomend it for all Jane Austen fans. I thought the movie was very well made but a bit too long like the book but I enjoyed Kate Winslet's performance as Marianne, I think she played the role very well."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I thought that after all these years I might as well pitch in and give my two cents worth in regard to one of my favorite authors. The plot has been well covered with these reviews and others, and even if they had not, you would have had to almost spent your life living under a rock not to be aware, so I certainly will not beat it to death here.Briefly though, this is the story of two sisters of the Dashwood family, who find themselves in a state of reduced circumstances upon the death of their father; a plight not uncommon during that era we know as Regency England. This is the story of Emma Dashwood and her sister Marianne, the relationship between the two sisters, their family, friends, neighbors, and most importantly, possible suitors. The story is told mostly through the eyes of Emma (sense?...I wonder), but through her eyes we get a wonderful picture of some very unforgettable characters. Note: If you watch very closely, you will see these same characters amongst us even to this day! More about this later.Now, for one of my pet peeves; most of the members of the reading Western World will tell you that this is Austen's first novel and it is not her best work, or one reason or another. Now being something of a semi-cultural barbarian, I have a problem with this statement. While I will admit that Austen's later works are some of the best turned out in the English language, I do strongly feel that it is quite unfair to compare and contrast this work, Sense and Sensibility, with her later works. Had this been the only novel Ms Austen had ever written, she still would have been listed with the literary greats on this work along. It has all of the elements that her later works include; the insight to human nature, the subtle humor, the fantastic dialog, the complicated relationships, the unfortunate conditions many young ladies of that class suffered during this period of time and the raw emotions that are so understated in each and every line of her work. I hate to beat dead horses, but the dialog in this work is along with the read!I take my peevishness further in noting that many refer to the situations, manners, mannerisms, attitudes and situations as being typically of those of only this period on English history. As far as I can tell, most, if not all, of the situations encountered by the Dashwood sisters are with us even to this day and are merely cloaked in different clothing. Emotions are emotions are timeless and what was true then, is true now, the truth just manifests itself a bit differently now than it did then. We all want love, security, understanding and companionship; have since time began and I suspect we will until time ends. Not all that much has changed. I also strongly feel that if you feel that there is not a definite class system in existence today, as there was at the time this novel was written, then you well may be missing something. It may no be a blatant now as then, but it certainly is alive and well even to this day.Now all that being said, the bottom line is that this one fine bit of writing; a timeless bit of writing and the reader will certainly be much richer for having read it, and as a matter of fact, it does not hurt to give this one, along with Austen's other works, multiple readings over the years. There is much we can learn here. I've often told people that they should read at least one of Jane Austen's books each year just to keep in the front of their minds what writing is all about. And for goodness sakes, I agree fully that there have been some very fine film adaptations of this work over the years and I certainly do recommend that you see them (I personally love several of them), but READ the book also! You are missing out on a real treat if you do not.This review was of the Penquin Classic edition, one of quite a number of editions I have laying around the house. Between my wife and myself, the get quite a workout...I do not know what I would do with out good old Penquin. I will review other editions, as there are some that are excellent, while other not so great and it does make a difference you know.Don BlankenshipThe Ozarks"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Austen's \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" concentrates upon life in the Dashwood family and the relationship of two sisters, particularly in reference to the amorous events in their lives transpiring over the course of a year or so. The younger sister, Marianne, represents \\"sense,\\" as she views and lives life in a romantic, sensual, and dramatic manner, while Elinor, representing \\"sensibility,\\" is more reserved in her expressions of feeling, and her pragmatic, moral way of making decisions. While treating one other, at times, with brutal honesty, attacking the other for who they are not, each eventually learns that there is a deep love between them. Additionally, the sisters learn that there is something of value in the dominant characteristics of the other's personality, and this works to positive effect for the love lives of both as time passes.Austen paints a picture of early nineteenth century England, especially with a focus on the position of women, who were largely dependent on marriage for their survival. Yet, in spite of this, Austen's characters hunger for their dreams, for love that does not compromise their existence merely to pragmatic ends. In narrative terms, Austen's genius never fails to come through with unseen twists in plot and beautiful, moving dialogue that has been kept at bay to be delivered to the anxiously-waiting reader at just the right moment."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"i didnt like this one as much as i have like some of austens other works. there just seems to be some element of fun missing from it."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness. Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility). How these two interact with the world, each other, as well as family and friends makes up the bulk of the book. They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were. The supporting characters are very engaging and I found myself rooting for most of them, even a couple who are not entirely good. There are a few characters (e.g. Mrs. Jenkins) who are caricatures meant to parody some of the social norms of the day but even she has some depth to her and is likeable.While I initially picked this book up due to fond memories ofPride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics), I found Sense & Sensibility to be an excellent novel in its own right. I'm not sure why, but I was worried that it might be a bit dry. I needn't have been concerned, as the wit and story both sparkle from the first few pages and it only gets better as it goes along.I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending. I did think that a bit more attention could have been paid to Marianne at the end but in many respects Elinor is more the central character so it is perhaps fitting that the climax focuses more on her.In sum, this is an excellent novel and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"For a long time, this was one of my least favorite of all Jane Austen's novels. But having re-read it recently (it was the first selection for our Jane Austen Book Group on The Book Club Forum), I found myself falling in love with the story for the first time. Elinor is a heroine that one can easily love and respect, especially in the way she controls, and yet deeply feels her emotions. Marianne, however, did grate on my nerves some, but I respect her allowing herself to give herself completely to Willoughby. Elinor and Marianne really do seem like opposite sides of the same coin: one hold everything in, one lets everything out.This book also has some of the best comic characters, especially Mrs. Jennings, the jolly matchmaker. One has to admit how uninteresting her life has to be if her ambition is to marry off every eligible young woman she meets! I also think that Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood, the sisters' half brother and sister-in-law are hilarious in their coldness and selfishness. You can tell that John likes to think of himself as charitable toward his sisters, but in reality he is completely self-centered. His wife, Fanny, is a wonderful villain for the book; she makes her husband seem positively warm."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"This is a wonderful clasic and I was so happy to find it and it is in great condition!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"One of the best things you can do for yourself is to read or reread one of Jane Austen's books.

Language and style are elegant and intelligent and imbued with a deep ironic humour, which comes from a keen eye for tensions between opposites.Five stars, always, for Jane."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Critical reviews of Austen's first book don't rate Sense and Sensibility as her best work. In any event, I find her sense of humor and grasp of the English language makes this book a must in any collection of Austen's works. It is well worth purchasing. Too, the Everyman's Library cover is finely done. This book will last on your shelf for years."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"This is the second Jane Austen book that I have listened to this year. I earlier enjoyed Pride and Prejudice and just finished Sense and Sensibility. It is clear to my why this is a classic. It is a fine romance and a great study in character. It highlights how outward appearances and popularity are not necessarily the most important characteristics. The heroes and heroines in this book have their flaws, but are easy to like and root for. The bad guys are not all bad, and do have some redeeming qualities. This is classic 19th century literature of which I am a fan.The reader for this audio book is Susannah Harker. She does an excellent job with the different characters and makes it easy to tell who is speaking. Her accent seems fitted to a book of this period also.I highly recommend this audio book as a wonderful way to pass your commute or a long trip."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"The dual natures of these sisters is what truly makes this novel special. Their natural differences and their abilities in the end to overcome their inborn instincts demonstrate Austen's talent in creating interesting and dynamic characters. For me, this is Jane's best novel (I have not read them all). There is so much to learn from these characters! The men in the novel are complex and interesting as well. Recommended reading. (and yes, the 21st century reader will need to be patient with the language, but the novel is well worth it.)"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I picked up this book largely due to fond memories ofPride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics), but I found Sense & Sensibility is an excellent novel in its own right. I'm not sure why, but I was worried that it might be a bit dry. I needn't have been concerned, as the wit and story both sparkle from the first few pages and it only gets better as it goes along.The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness. Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility). How these two interact with the world, each other, as well as family and friends makes up the bulk of the book. They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were. The supporting characters are very engaging and I found myself rooting for most of them, even a couple who are not entirely good. There are a few characters (e.g. Mrs. Jenkins) who are caricatures meant to parody some of the social norms of the day but even she has some depth to her and is likeable.I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending. I did think that a bit more attention could have been paid to Marianne at the end but in many respects Elinor is more the central character so it is perhaps fitting that the climax focuses more on her.In sum, this is an excellent novel and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Juliet Stevenson is a great narrator she is able to give each of her characters a distinct voice and her intonations are perfect. She makes the emotions of the characters and the situations come alive."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I love Jane Austen and this version read perfectly. It was fun to have the addition of the illustrations as well. They added to the book for me."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"All together, I thought that this book was very good. In classic Jane Austen style, this was a story that followed two sisters through love, heartbreak, and confusion. The story as a whole is very relatable for women everywhere: the classic paths of love that was meant to be, love that could never be, or unrequited love are all followed by the main characters, Elinor and Marianne. Another great aspect of this book was all of the twists and turns; you never knew who was telling the truth or what would happen next, which made it a very fun read. One of the only flaws of this book was that some sections didn't seem to have anything important in them, which made it boring. But when the story got back on track, it kept you \\"hooked.\\"I recommend that readers that want to read this book should read Pride and Prejudice beforehand. This way you will become familiar with Jane Austen through, in my opinion, her best book.So, if you are looking for a fun, but unexpected love story, Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility would be a very good choice."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Sense and Sensibility is an excellent book. When I started it I really did not know what to expect, and was pleasantly surprised. I will say though that this book is hard to get through at times, due to the old language used. But if you stay with the book, it will be worth it. The characters are wonderful, and you will find yourself wanting them to be happy. The Dashwood family gives a &quot;girl power&quot; message that makes it even easier to enjoy. Also, this book is easy to relate to, for everyone has known a Maryanne or Elinor before, maybe you are like one of them. I could identify with Maryanne, because I am involved in everything (and love it all) and I know I share my feelings too much. Although this book will be enjoyed more by young females, anyone would like it, for it also has a lot of humor in it used to display the dramatic situations the Dashwood sisters keep finding themselves in. The book became even more enjoyable when I saw the movie, seeing this amazing book acted out was great. I believe all of Jane Austen's books are worth reading, this one especially!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Boy meets girl, they hate each other at first sight, then fall in love. Only Jane Austen could take such a cliche and turn it in a beautiful story, romantic but not corny, witty, and evocative. Okay, the dialogue is somewhat difficult to follow, especially for those of us whose first language is not English (the first time I tried to read this book I just couldn't get past the first couple of pages), but once you get used to it, you instantly fall in love with the story and the writer. I have read most of Jane Austen's books, but this one remains my favorite."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"This is the story of the Dashwood sisters: the logical Elinor (sense) and the emotional Marianne (sensibility). I actually listened to this novel on audio, and the narrator was so good it was difficult to stop listening to get anything else done. Austen draws us into the world of Regency England, where women are looking for husbands, preferably rich ones, and men are looking for beauty, preferably accompanied by fortune. But there's more to this story than that. I found myself occasionally laughing aloud as the narrator read; some things that were amusing in 1811 actually still are. Jane Austen pokes fun at her characters, and many of their foibles are recognizable as things we would mock today. One example is the description of conceited young gentleman (many of the ladies refer to him as a \\"cockscomb\\") who is seen in a jewelry story arguing with a clerk over the kind of jewel-encrusted toothpick holder he needs to purchase. This is unquestionably one of the best books I've ever read; I highly recommend the audio narrated by Wanda McCaddon, who also uses the names Nadia May and Donada Peters."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"No one needs my naive commentary on this witty, charming, and rewarding stalwart of the canon; plenty has been written about Austen's novels. I merely wanted to report that the reader, Nadia May, does an excellent job here. I enjoyed all ten CDs!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"There are two free electronic versions of this book, both dated March 17, 2006. The other version ofSense and Sensibilitywas clearly a transfer from a free electronic copy -- containing a partially missing introduction, an erroneous index of illustrations (which are not contained in the book), and hard coded page numbers which just waste space on each page which don't make a lot of sense in a Kindle version and just take up space on the screen. Overall, this is a much cleaner transfer."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"This is one volume in the complete series of Austen's novels published by the Cambridge University Press. The series is undoubtedly the best one to own by anyone who is more than casually interested in the great author and her work. The introductions are flawlessly helpful to whatever detail of background the reader wants. The notes explain references and changed or obsolete word usage and are easily skipped by anyone who doesn't want them. The texts of the novels are the most accurate scholarship can now produce. They are mostly the same as in the OUP edition of the novels, but much easier to read because of the typeface chosen. The series also has juvenilia and the unfinished text of \\"Sanditon,\\" omitted from the OUP edition. In the end, I cannot praise the Cambridge series too highly."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"One of Austen's first books to be published, Sense and Sensibility tells the story of the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne. Having lost their father, they had to start life anew, since their half-brother and his wife were not willing to take care of them. So Elinor, Marianne, their mother and younger sister move to Barton Cottage. In their new home, they experience heartache and pain as they mature and grow.Elinor, the elder sister is extremely sensible, even in matters of the heart. When she learns that Edward Ferrars, the man whom she loved, was going to marry Lucy Steele, she takes it in stride. She is sad, but that does not slow her down. Marianne, on-the-other-hand, is very dramatic and emotional. When Mr. Willoughby breaks her heart, she decides she is never going to recover. She starts getting sick often and being melancholy. The story ends well, but both sisters learn to become less rigid in their respective personalities. Elinor realizes that showing emotions is alright and Marianne decides that living life in the past is not useful. Hence, Elinor gains some sensibility and Marianne some sense.Once again, Austen has outdone herself in this novel. Her characters are well-developed. Like in her other novels, Austen's writing paints a charming picture of the life and times of the 19th Century English. The story line is very captivating and Austen goes into great detail describing every aspect. However, it seems that towards the end she wraps everything up very quickly. She mentions Lucy Steele and Willoughby's whereabouts and feelings; she mentions Elinor's and Marianne's respective marriages. She does this without using her usual descriptive language. But other than her ending, this is an excellent novel.Armchair Interviews says: If you have not read Austen before, Sense and Sensibility is the novel to start with!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I picked up this book largely due to fond memories ofPride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics), but I found Sense & Sensibility is an excellent novel in its own right.

Sense and Sensibility (narrated by Sarah Badel) is my personal favorite. Every character has a wonderfully distinct voice. The narration is lively and captivating. You will love it! Pay particular attention to the voice Miss Badel gave to &quot;Robert Ferrars&quot;....it's hilarious!!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"This was a great novel telling of the secretive and not so secretive anguish of two sisters. Love and broken hearts play a large role in the plot, and, at times, it is a little much. You really feel your heart going out to the two sisters, feeling their pain. This is an extraordinary story. However, after reading Pride and Prejudice before this one I was a little dissapointed. None the less, this is a must read for anyone who enjoys stories of english society, stories of love, and other Jane Austin novels."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Kate Winslet who also starred in Sense and Sensiblity lent her beautiful voice for this great story.

Both Elinor and Marianne love each other and try to understand one another. Elinor tries to protect Marianne by attempting to counsel her to curb her sensibility while Marianne advocates her own romantic outlook to her older sister. What each of them fails to realize, until the novel's end, is that without the presence of the other in times of trouble, they would not have a leg to stand on.Both Elinor and Marianne take each other for granted and it is to the reader's gratification that Elinor and Marianne do find satisfactory, and happy, endings when they each adopt a little of the other's philosophical outlook."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Although it's still witty, the tone of this novel is not as light-hearted compared to &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; or &quot;Northanger Abbey.&quot; This gives the story a darker and more realistic feel, certainly more depth. The two Dashwood sisters' situation could not be worse indeed. (without money and rank and lost their father &amp; estate) They had a more difficult life than other Jane Austen heroines. We feel sympathetic when reading this story. In general, this book is witty, ironic, yet serious, warm, and very human. It's an irresistible and rewarding reading experience. Also, don't forget to see the movie (screenplay by Emma Thompson) and enjoy the audiobook (narrated by Kate Winslet) as well."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"The book tells about the remarkable family of Dashwood whose family home was located in Sussex. The book is about two sisters who are as diametrically opposite as two can be. Marianne is the younger sister, and she is eager, imprudent and excitable. Elinor is much more sensible than her young sister, and her voice is always the voice of reason. But it's the world that Ms. Austen always brings to her pages that is so captivating. She more than many others can create a little piece of the world that the reader has the privilege of discovering and then learns to love, just like Ms. Austen's characters do. This is what puts Ms Austen's books so much above the norm in this particular genre."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"&quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; is a witty, diverting book that was a pleasure to read. I was eager to read another novel by Jane Austen after so thoroughly enjoying &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, and was far from disappointed. Austen creates wonderful stories full of depth, elegance and an endless supply of witticisms. There are so many terrific quotes in her novels that it gets hard to pick a favorite. Don't be hesitant to pick this book up - a year ago I would have laughed if someone had told me that I would be a Jane Austen fan. I'll never regret giving it a chance, so I hope that you will too."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"The type was readable, illustrations interesting.

Austen takes the story of two sisters, one quick to emotion and the other reasonable nearly to a fault and puts them in a similar situation of unreturned fancy. In the right hands this could be an interesting story and you would think Austen would make it so. Unfortunately not, her story is dull and I kept waiting for something to happen. There was no biting irony or under the surface commentary. This being Jane Austen's first novel explains some of it. You see a few glimpses of her use of language and irony but not enough to carry this book. I give this a C-."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"There are two schools of Austen. The first, her ardent admirers, adore everything she does; the second find the snobby world her characters inhabit a perpetual turnoff. Belonging to neither category myself, this book strikes me as somewhat tentative, in regards to Austen's development as a writer. This opinion I'm sure won't endear me to the legions of Austen fans who treasure every word she wrote. But though the story itself is a fine one, the novel as a whole lacks the attention to detail, character, and metaphor that Austen would perfect in her later novels (particularly \\"Mansfield Park,\\" which never seems to get the accolades this novel and \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" do). Though Austen compensates for this with various literary techniques (creating an opposite foil for all of her characters, constructing parallels for various scenes, etc.), when it comes right down to it, this is the work of a beginner, a writer just beginning to get her bearings. I know \\"S&S\\" has its passionate proponents, mostly on the basis of its romantic plot, and heartfelt depiction of the love lives of two very different sisters. But on the whole, this book derives its strength mostly from straightforward storytelling, rather than imaginative and poetic writing. Not a bad beginning, but Austen definitely improved her game with her future novels. (...)"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I read Sense and Sensibility for my English IV Course. This novel was written by Jane Austen. This book is for a romantic person, adult or young adult. If you are someone who is interested in 19th Century society and the roles of women, this story is for you. Sense and Sensibility is a classic novel. The author is well known and the quality of literature is world class, because it is so well known.Sense and Sensibility describes the adventures of two young ladies (Marianne and Elinor) falling in love. Elinor is always in control of her emotions and senses. Marianne is an emotional whirlwind whose sensibilities dictate that those who have no evidence of wholly encompassing emotions or are without them entirely. She ultimately marries her long standing admirer, Colonel Brandon. Also Elinor is the heroin of the story. The mother, Mrs. Dashwood, is weird; she is always after her daughters minding their business. She is the opposite of Mrs. Burton from Pride and Prejudice. She has inherited no fortune of her own but wants the best for her daughters and shares Marianne's romantic sensibilities. The love stories are very intriguing as well. Elinor loves Edward and Marianne falls in love with Willoughby.The conflict of the ideas about marriage between parents and daughters is the main theme of this book. If the girls were not yet married, their mothers employed themselves in matching the younger women with eligible men.I recommend Jane Austen's work to all readers who are fascinated with love. This is an excellent book for those who enjoy 19th Century Literature. Even though I missed some details because of the language, I identified with one the girls in the story."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I love all of Jane Austin's works. She captures real life in her day, and it still applies to my day."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Perhaps one of my favorite Jane Austen books. It's perfect in every way!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Jane Austen's first novel Sense and Sensibility was published in 1811. It wasn't written under her name because she was a female; only men were allowed to publish novels and articles. Only her immediate family knew that Jane Austen wrote the novel. Austen is a romantic writer. In Sense and Sensibility there are two different views of love that you will explore throughout the novel.In Sense and Sensibility, there are three volumes that make up the novel. In volume I, Mr. Dashwood dies leaving money to his first wife's son John Dashwood. Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret have to sell their house and move in with John and his wife Lucy. While in the new town of Barton College Elinor, Marianne, and the men explore the town. Elinor becomes quite fond of Edward Ferrars, Lucy's brother. Lucy does not approve of this relationship because she thinks that the Dashwood women are poor, non-elegant ladies. Marianne is loved by Colonel Brandon, but she doesn't realize it until the end when Willoughby betrays her. The focus of this novel is would you love for sense or sensibility.The two main characters symbolize sense or sensibility. Elinor represents sense, because she thinks with her head and loves with her heart. Marianne represents sensibility. She acts like a Damsel in distress with her love interest. Mrs. Dashwood and Marianne are very similar in the ways that they deal with everyday life. This novel is not based on the success of sense over sensibility, but rather a combination of the two together.In this novel, two women fall in love in opposite ways. Everybody has a little of both Marianne and Elinor in them. We tend to want to date the men that every girl dreams of, but we marry for love and long lasting friendships. People in today's society still act the same way about love as Marianne and Elinor do in the novel. Marianne acts like a typical adolescent. She wants to marry the gorgeous young stud, but eventually she realizes that he is a jerk.The novel shows you two different views on how women, in general, fall in love. Some think with their heads while others think with their hearts. Jane Austen wrote during the romantic period. She wasn't respected as a writer until after her death. Austen was one of the best romantic authors of her time."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I was hoping for another masterpiece when I ordered Sense and Sensibility but, other than the eloquent language, it contains none of the charm of Pride and Prejudice. Not a single character in S&S is likeable, and that I find to be a real travesty. In P&P you have the bold and clever Elizabeth and the mysterious Darcy to adore, and even Jane and Bingley have their charms.... but S&S is a dull read, or at least, as dull and the wonderful Jane Austen could muster. I don't recommend it to a Pride and Prejudice lover."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"As SENSE &amp; SENSIBILITY (S&amp;S) was Austen's first published novel, it is perhaps a forgivable sin that this work is almost wholly without that inimitable touch of greatness that makes her later works so wonderful. To be sure, S&amp;S is not completely without charm; as usual, her characters are described along the same uber ironic and caustic lines familiar to fans of her later work, and the soap operish quality of the narrative is, as always, tempered by her wry wit. When Austen sets her baleful eye on the often ridiculous mores of her society, deftly skewing her demographic representing characters with the graceful, devastating wit she made her stock and trade, there is no one better. Yet, in S&amp;S, the other part of what makes Austen so great - the biting, social commentary which is always indistinguishably entwined with plot and that sterling character development we've come to expect - is absent. And though Austen sets her novel up as a didactic tale centering around an overmeasure of both sensibility and emotional excessivity, in the end she fails to create any application, to make sense of the lessons she so clearly intended to teach. The two main characters seem to have suffered trial after trial for nothing, and the rest of the characters, those that MADE them suffer, get off scot-free. That sense of Austen Justice so unavoidable in her later efforts is conspicuously absent here, leaving the narrative in want of purpose and the reader ultimately dissatisfied.A lesser effort from one just setting her foot on the Alpine Path to greatness."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I read Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen. I thought the book was very good. Austen portrays Elinor and Marianne very well. She shows the love and friendship and the jealously of two sisters. She shows how one sister can be in love and the other is trying to find the bad in that person.In the beginning, Elinor finds someone she really likes and Marianne trys to find the bad in him, like he doesn't like drawing and Elinor does. Marianne is just jealous that her sister has found someone and she hasn't found anyone yet. Marianne wants Edward, Elinor's boyfriend. Elinor and Edward don't last that long anyway because they move to Barton Park.The Miss Dashwood's cousin, Sir John Middleton, writes them a letter and invites them to move to Barton Park and live in a cottage. They gladly accept. They tell their brother and his wife and send their belongings in advance and leave. They agree to try the cottage out for a year. Sir John and his wife are very hospitable to the Miss Dashwood's. They always invite them to their house to meet the people of the neighborhood. The Miss Dashwood's rarely accepted.There was on certain time they accepted and met Colonel Brandon, who is a friend of Sir John. Colonel Brandon sets his sights on Marianne. Colonel Brandon likes Marianne's singing and piano playing. Elinor does not like that idea. She would rather him be interested in her instead. Elinor is now jealous of Marianne. She doesn't even care that Edward is supposed to be coming to see her. Their good-bye was like that of a brother and sister. They didn't even kiss good-bye.The Middleton's are always having someone stay the night at their house. The Dashwood's would rather keep to themselves. When Sir John's wife invites them to come to the house the Dashwood's are always busy. The Dashwood's are the type that would rather do for themselves. They are not really the social type. Mr. John Dashwood and his wife live in Norland. They moved there after his father died. Mr. Dashwood made his son promise to provide for his mother and sisters. Which meant that he was to give them money. His wife did not like that idea. She thought that they could find their own money and that the money was the only reason they were still living in Norland. Which in fact was not true. They were still living there because they had no where else to go. Miss John Dashwood thought that they didn't deserve any money from them whether they were family or not. She thought only of herself and her son not of her husband's family.John Dashwood wanted to give them three thousand pounds apiece. His wife wouldn't hear of it. She thought that they would never pay it back because they had no source of income. She managed to talk her husband down to about five hundred pounds. They managed to get out of paying the women any money because they decided to move Barton Park. In the end they both marry and are happy. They don't live too far away from one another, so they can still fight as they please. They can stay in touch with one another because family means so much to them. In reading this book, I had a little trouble understanding and following the context in some places, but I enjoyed the book. I would recommend it to young women who like to read romances. It is very much so a romance, yet it is also a book about the love that two sisters have for one another. Sense and Sensibility is rather difficult to follow in some spots. I highly recommend this to young women who enjoy reading romances."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I find the illustrations slightly disappointing so I deducted one star.

I'm not sure why, I just never had until I was given the opportunity to review this Insight Edition published by Bethany House. I have to admit that I am not going to be a Jane Austen fan. I struggled with Sense and Sensibility. I actually felt like Tom Hanks in \`You've Got Mail'. It just was not my cup of tea, which is strange because I love books that take place in Regency England and I love Jane Austen themed books.But, I'm not really reviewing Jane Austen here. I'm reviewing the Insight Edition. This annotated edition is filled with trivia, themes of faith, and other nuggets meant to enhance the reader's experience. I have to say that I like this concept with classic literature. I enjoyed taking a break from the story and reading the side notes. The notes are written clearly on the pages, but they do not get in the way of the story.One devoted Austen fan told me that reading a book like this is like watching a movie with the commentary on. That can be a good thing or a bad thing. Sometimes a reader just wants the story and nothing else. Other readers, who may have read Sense and Sensibility several times, may appreciate having that little extra. If that is the case, I highly recommend the Insight Edition of Sense and Sensibility for those who want to add to their Jane Austen experience."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is the first published novel of Jane Austen. Originally published in 1811, the novel went through several versions perhaps starting with \\"Elinor and Marianne\\" in 1795, though it is not certain. I suspect that \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is the second best known work of Austen after \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", and I would say that it is not as easy to read as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". One of the reasons for this is due to the importance of what was considered proper behavior at the time, and without an understanding of that standard of behavior, the motivation of the characters is hidden from the reader. Nevertheless, it is still worth the effort to read and overall it is worthwhile. At the same time, it is well worth reading an edition like the Penguin Classics version, which helps the reader understand the period and societal standards which play an important role in this novel.The main characters of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" are the sisters Elinor and Marianne, who are the daughters of Mr. Dashwood and his second wife. There is a third daughter, Margaret and of course his second wife Mrs. Dashwood. When Mr. Dashwood passes away, his estate passes to his son by his first wife, leaving the Dashwood women into lives of reduced means. The two elder sisters experience nearly the same situations. Both find love, then the shock of learning that those they love are pre-engaged.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is written in three volumes. The first deals with the transition of the Dashwood women to their new lives where they leave their Norland home move to stay with distant relations (the Middletons) at Barton Park. Elinor cares for Edward Ferras, the brother-in-law of her half-brother, and Marianne meets and is courted by John Willoughby. Willoughby leaves suddenly for London, causing Marianne distress. This volume also introduce Anne and Lucy Steele, two relations of the Middleton's who arrive as guests, but their arrival causes problems for Elinor who learns that Lucy is secretly engaged to her Edward. In Volume II, it is Marianne who learns that Willoughby has become engaged to another, due to his wasting his fortune and need for wealth. In Volume III the situations with the two sisters and those who they thought they loved is resolved, though in different ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\", in my opinion, is more difficult for a modern reader to digest, but that does not mean that it doesn't have anything to offer. There are some wonderful moments and when presented in a scholarly format with detailed notes it can still be enjoyed the same way it was when first published. I don't personally rate \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" as high as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", but it is still a very good novel and an important piece of literature."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Short and Sweet Review, by Michelle:Sense and Sensibility is one of my favorite books by Jane Austen, who happens to be my favorite author. I don't think I need to incredible detail here since if you're thinking about reading it, you more than likely familiar with Ms. Austen's writing. I think I enjoy this one because Eleanor is such a sensible character, as is Anne Elliot (my favorite Austen heroine). I felt so much for her and enjoyed experiencing her sorrow and her happiness."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"This was my first read for this author and it is worth reading again. Contemporary for its time, this story can still place you back in time and in the minds of the characters."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"This novel was a big revelation for me. Even though I love period dramas, somehow the S&S; movie didn\\"t manage to grab me. It was one of those movies, that I wasn't enthusiastic to rewatch, even though I love Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet and Hugh Grant, and think that they did a great job and the whole movie looks great, but it is the story that I was not fond of.So you can imagine that I wasn't enthusiastic to read the novel either. Actually, when it was voted as the next book in my reading group, I decided I would skip it. And then my cousin just gave it to me and when I started reading it, I couldn't stop. I loved it! Somehow it is completely different from the movie. Here Elinor isn't an Ice Queen, just a private and mature girl, and Marianne didn't annoy me with her liveliness and passionate views as in the movie. I think the only character I liked better in the movie than in the book was Edward Ferrars.I'm sorry to say that S&S; is quite an understated Austen novel: Pride and Prejudice, Presuasion and Emma usually get all the praise and are the favourites of readers, but this Austen novel is excellent in its subdued pastel coloured way too.If you love the movie or the miniseries, you ahve to read it, and if the screen adaptations didn't really engage you, I'd still encourage you to give S&S; a chance, the novel is well worth the read, I'm sure you will love it!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I've been a fan of Austen for 20 years and this is one of my favorites. It can appear to be a little stilted due to the time period it was written in, but the story is timeless and that's why movies keep getting made with it as a base story. I do have to admit that I think Marienne is a spoiled brat who doesn't know a good man when she sees him. Always go for substance over lipstick!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Sense and Sensibility (Insight Editions), a classic fiction novel written by Jane Austen and published almost 200 years ago, is still an extremely popular story today. Bethany House Publishers recently released the \\"Insight Edition\\" which includes footnotes of trivia, notes, and inspiration to help readers understand more background to this story. It is important to note that the story has not been changed in any way. Some of these notes are historical, that expand on life in England in the 1800s; others are facts about Jane Austen that coincide with the story; still others are themes of faith, or comments on the characters or plot.This was my second reading of Sense and Sensibility and I definitely enjoyed reading the extra tidbits included in this version. The culture of the 1800s is very different from current culture and there were many times that the notes gave me a greater understanding of various situations.I recommend this version to all Jane Austen fans, you will probably have new insights after reading this book. And to those of you who have not yet become Jane Austen fan, give this book a try, it's a timeless story."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I love Jane Austen. A couple summers ago, I set out to read all of her books in one summer - even those I had read before (Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility). Even after realizing that many of her characters and stories are similar, I still loved her. I love the way she writes with wit and intelligence. And I really enjoy how everyone who deserves to be happy in the end does indeed end up happy.Sense and Sensibility, for those of you who haven't ever read it or seen one of the many film versions, is the story of two sisters, Elinor and Marianne who are both alike in passion, except that Marianne is all passion and impulsivity on the outside (sensibility) and Elinor is all composure and caution on the outside (sense). The story tells of secret love, not so secret love, lost fortunes and selfishness, and deep sisterly love. This story, even more than Pride and Prejudice, makes me wish I had a sister or two.This insight edition is different from other more \\"academic\\" versions of classic works, because rather than pages and pages of footnotes instructing the reader as to the socio-historical background of the book.... Well, it's like the editors are reading the book with you. Occasionally there are informative footnotes which tell you what a \\"Barouche\\" is (a four-wheeled carriage pulled by 2 horses that seated four people), or tells you about \\"Harley Street\\" (a street in London populated chiefly by medical professionals). But there are also 6 other types of footnotes that occur throughout the book - usually as an \\"aside\\" on the edge of the page - including notes about Jane Austen's life and how a part of the story relates to it, references to S&S; in film and television, themes related to faith, and notes on characters that the editors dislike throughout the story.While at first, I thought that this tongue-in-cheek note system was a little distracting, as I went onward, I began to enjoy the voices of these women. It was kind of like I was reading the book with a friend or with a book club. So that as I read about something really horrible that Fanny said to John or Lucy said to Elinor and thought, \\"UGH! I think Fanny is such a jerk!\\" there was the comment by my \\"friends\\" in the margin saying the same thing.This version of Sense and Sensibility does not add anything new to the text that Jane Austen wrote, and thus the story of course is great. The Insight Edition does add some contemporary fun to the novel however, and it is likely you would also enjoy taking these friends with you on the journey through 19th century England.Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen? 4.5 out of 5The Insight Edition? 3.5 out of 5"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" by Jane Austen focuses on sisters Elinor and Marianne Dashwood and their search for love.

The faith in the book is brought out and given Scripture references throughout the book. I received a free copy of this book to review from Bethany House."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"In the introduction to the Insight Edition of Sense and Sensibility Julie Klassen writes: \\"Jane Austen is more popular now than during her lifetime nearly two hundred years ago.\\" Earlier this week I went to Barnes & Noble. Sure enough, there was an end cap in the fiction section covered with retellings and sequels to Austen's beloved novels. Austen's influence can even be found in the popular paranormal genre; Mr. Darcy (Pride and Prejudice) and Jane Austen both appear as vampires in two such books. The Insight Edition offers a newly packaged look at the original story of Sense and Sensibility, with a few fun surprises in store.I'll be honest with you. Up until this week, Sense and Sensibility was the only Jane Austen novel I had not yet read. Without this new edition of the beloved classic, it's more than likely I never would have made it through. A few months ago, I attempted to read it from beginning to end, but gave up less than a third of the way into the story. I was baffled. If I can read Pride and Prejudice in two days flat, then why was I having so much trouble with Sense and Sensibility? Like in other novels, Austen writes about marrying for love and/or money, first impressions, and differences in class.Sense and Sensibility is the story of the Marianne and Elinor Dashwood. They are the late Mr. Dashwood's children from his second marriage. At the time of his death, he asks his son Henry to care for youngest three daughters and his new widow. However, Henry's wife has his ear and persuades him to give them less income annually than the promise he made to his father. Marianne and Elinor can only hope to preserve their future by making smart matches. Bold and romantic Marianne has her sights set on the charming Mr. Willoughby, and sensible and logical Elinor has fallen for Edward Ferrars. Neither gentleman is what he seems, and both girls soon suffer from a broken heart. The loss of Mr. Willoughby prolongs Marianne's sickness, and Elinor silently suffers through Edward's upcoming nuptials with Lucy Steele. Just as it seems all hope is lost for a happy ending, Marianne opens her heart to a new love, and Elinor learns that things are not exactly as they seem.This annotated edition of Sense and Sensibility enhanced a story I already knew through the 1995 Kate Winslet/Emma Thompson feature film. The editors provided trivia about the movie, ranked their favorite characters and least favorite characters, offered facts about Jane Austen and the Regency period, and provided definitions of difficult words. Whether Sense and Sensibility is an old favorite or a new-to-you text, this is the edition you should read. Lovingly put together by some of Austen's biggest fans, the Insight Edition will earn a slot on your bookshelf.*A copy of this book was provided to me by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.*"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"How do you take a book that is almost 200 years old and make it interesting and new to the modern reader? That's a trick question, I can't imagine not enjoying Jane Austen's writing no matter how antiquated the society and its ideals are. Of course I took as many literature classes in college as time allowed so I may be an exception to the rule.The story itself? The cast of characters is impressive; you've got the calm introvert, the passionate young thing, the rake, the snob, the neighbors you roll your eyes at whenever they show up, the man of integrity, etc. And the plotlines are almost as thick as the characters! Frivolity and fun, true love, desperate, gut-wrenching heartbreak, intrigue and secrets, scandal, mix-ups, horrible nasty people you want to punch in the nose (I know I'm not the only one who thought that.)I've made it a personal project to read all of Austen and this was my third foray and probably my favorite to read - which surprised me because as absolutely wonderful as Edward and Col. Brandon are, I don't swoon over them like Mr. Darcy or Mr. Knightley. Not to sound smarmy about it but I think it did have to do with the \\"insights\\" in my margin.The book has a pictographic key so the notes in your margin are categorized by things like historical and cultural details, film references, themes of faith, Austen facts and tidbits, and comments and asides as well as frowny face and smiley face comments. As much as I LOVE tidbits and asides in all categories what I really enjoyed were the smiley and frowney faces - it was like reading the book with a friend who hated the same parts you hated and loved, laughed and smiled at all your favorite places.(I got quite the laugh out of the film reference which stated: In the 2008 miniseries, Edward's bad mood leads him to chop wood in the pouring rain. The film was written by the same person who had Darcy jump in a lake. We approve of both.And yes I did run out and rent the 2008 miniseries after reading that. Kidding. Sortof.)If you were one of those women (or girls - I knew lots of teens who did this) who ran out and bought Pride and Prejudice the book after watching the 2005 film and found the book hard to read - I'd recommend trying it again with the \\"insight edition\\" which will inevitably lead you to Sense & Sensibility. These editions really do a brilliant job of bridging a 200 year generation gap.Happy reading!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I have always enjoyed Jane Austen's books and film adaptations of Jane Austen, and I have always been troubled by the fact that more younger people are not exposed to the classics rigorously enough in high school English literature classes.For schools or parents who feel like Jane Austen's books may be a bit cumbersome for their students or children, then this book provides an alternative. Instead of tampering with the language or feeling of the original manuscript, it provides fun asides.The margins of the book are dotted with factoids. Some of the details focus on Austen's life, others on English life in general during the time period. Historical details are discussed in some, while slight religious themes addressed in the book are presented in others.

I enjoyed it this time around, and this will certainly not be my last time to read this beloved classic.This new edition doesn't mess with the original text of S&S; - at all! Quite the opposite - it enhances the reader's experience.The Editors point out little quirks and interesting facts found within the text, which had those notes not been there I would have missed it entirely!Other footnotes are witty, knowledgeable and even have some fun tidbits about the movie variations.I definitely enjoyed Sense and sensibility more the second time around thanks much in part to this insight edition!

Elinor and Marianne fall in love with two men, who end up breaking up with then off and on throughout the book until the end when one of them actually marries one of the men. And it is the most boring piece of garbage ever to be written. I'm going to burn my copy after I'm done with it, which should be soon. This book is for women. Not for a man such as myself.

Has lasted not because of its silly plot turns in romance, but because of its one-dimensional characatures of English society in her time, with the perfect heroine, Elinor, at its core. Everyone else falls into a niche, is a type, but as the satire is at times very pointed, the story is forgiven. What is not so obvious, because Austen was probably not aware of it, is the utter dependence of all these peoples' lives on the servants who support them. These people do nothing. They walk, eat, dress, visit, read, play games and music, and do needlework or write letters. That's it, with an occasional shopping trip thrown in. It is this underlying life, the life of the servants, that is never mentioned. Only one, Thomas, has any lines at all. It beats me how they filled their days. They simply lived to amuse themselves."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Sence and Sensibility has neither the clever mystery of Emma or the endearing heroine of Pride and Prejudice. But we all must learn to except that she couldn't top those two novels.That said Sence and sensibility is worth the read for any Austen fan.The Dashwood sisters various dilemas in love make a good story. We don't care for them as much as our beloved Elisabeth and Jane Bennet, but we wish them the very best all the same.Marianne's self-sensure near the end of the novel for the indulgence of her self-pitty and the lack of obsevance of common civility (in contrast to her sister)is not quite as satisfying as Emma's repentance.And sweet sensible Eleanor is just not as witty or charming as Elisabeth. Neither of the girls tempt us with Fanny Prices sweetness or modesty. And none of the love tangles are as interesting, mysterious or hard to figure out as in Emma.And the villians of the piece just don't match up to Mrs. Norris of Mansfield Park, Miss.Bingley of P+P irritates us more than Lucy Steele.Mr.Dashwoods fraternal neglect doesn't spark the indignation of the Bertrams insensitivity and self involvment.We find more dissapointment in Henry Crawfords disgrace than in Willoughbys.It's a great novel in it's own right but just not Austen's finest work. Which considering how good a book it is, should be a great compliment to the author."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Jane Austen's first novel Sense and Sensibility was published in 1811. It wasn't written under her name because she was a female; only men were allowed to publish novels and articles. Only her immediate family knew that Jane Austen wrote the novel. Austen is a romantic writer. In Sense and Sensibility there are two different views of love that you will explore throughout the novel.In Sense and Sensibility, there are three volumes that make up the novel. In volume I, Mr. Dashwood dies leaving money to his first wife's son John Dashwood. Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret have to sell their house and move in with John and his wife Lucy. While in the new town of Barton College Elinor, Marianne, and the men explore the town. Elinor becomes quite fond of Edward Ferrars, Lucy's brother. Lucy does not approve of this relationship because she thinks that the Dashwood women are poor, non-elegant ladies. Marianne is loved by Colonel Brandon, but she doesn't realize it until the end when Willoughby betrays her. The focus of this novel is would you love for sense or sensibility.The two main characters symbolize sense or sensibility. Elinor represents sense, because she thinks with her head and loves with her heart. Marianne represents sensibility. She acts like a Damsel in distress with her love interest. Mrs. Dashwood and Marianne are very similar in the ways that they deal with everyday life. This novel is not based on the success of sense over sensibility, but rather a combination of the two together.In this novel, two women fall in love in opposite ways. Everybody has a little of both Marianne and Elinor in them. We tend to want to date the men that every girl dreams of, but we marry for love and long lasting friendships. People in today's society still act the same way about love as Marianne and Elinor do in the novel. Marianne acts like a typical adolescent. She wants to marry the gorgeous young stud, but eventually she realizes that he is a jerk.The novel shows you two different views on how women, in general, fall in love. Some think with their heads while others think with their hearts. Jane Austen wrote during the romantic period. She wasn't respected as a writer until after her death. Austen was one of the best romantic authors of her time."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"This book is an excellent way to see how English society ran hundreds of years ago. The only issue that people will have with the book is that it is written in an older style of English which can be hard to follow."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"A book that has a happy end, and lets you dream of long flowing dresses and dashing gentelmen!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Out of all of Austen's heroine's these two sisters were my favorites, particularily Marianne. I liked this book a lot and swooned as Marianne did over Willoughby! A wonderful classic and most definitely worth reading."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"This is a story about a family, of a mother and three daughters, as well as their extended family of cousins, step brothers and sisters-in-law and their current love interests. There is selfishness and greed; there are parties and laughter; there is music and books and love; there is heartbreak and deceit. It seems a formula for success.The eldest daughter, Elinor, is the only rational one. Her next sister, Marianne, is a silly, selfish flighty girl who cares nothing of anyone else's problems and wants everyone to focus on her own. The third sister barely gets mentioned, as she is not old enough to fall madly in love with the wrong guy and then make a scene about it when he doesn't love her back.The brother and sister-in-law are greedy and care only about money, even though they have plenty and don't share it with the rest of the family. The cousins are only focused on parties and gaiety and fun.My impression of this book was that they spend the whole time having parties and looking for a husband. They fall in love with men who are unfaithful and they act quite silly about it upon realizing the man doesn\`t love them. The men are all fickle and quite rude about it, pretty much ignoring the girls once they have had enough of them and never communicating with anyone. I almost didn't like them until I recollected that this book was written roughly 200 years ago and times WERE different then. However, I find it hard to relate and also to distance these girls from our modern times. If they were here right now, they would be completely out of place. I would tell them to shut up or to stand up for themselves for God's sakes!This is an era where men and women still marry for money and class. An era where your mother can arrange your marriage to a \\"suitable\\" beau. An era where the women didn't work and then men were landlords as an occupation. It is an era that I do like to read about and would like to understand, but that I have a hard time relating to. Maybe it's Austen's style of writing. Maybe it's just the era.However, for such an old book, it is sometimes amazing how much things really haven't changed. I think this quote still holds true today. \\"Shyness is only the effect of a sense of inferiority in some way or other. If I could persuade myself that my manners were perfectly easy and graceful, I should not be shy\\".This one just cracks me up. \\"Elinor agreed to it all, for she did not think he deserved the compliment of rational opposition\\". So she didn't argue with him. She was snubbing him by not giving him the satisfaction of an argument. I love it. What an insult!But the best quote is this one at the end, which redeems Marianne. She finally turns around and realizes that she is not the only person in the world and the learns to respect and care about other people. She realizes that the man she loved when young was worthless and the one who has stood by and loved her for years is priceless.\\"Marianne Dashwood was born to an extraordinary fate. She was born to discover the falsehood of her own opinions, and to counteract, by her conduct, her most favourite maxims. She was born to overcome an affection formed so late in life as at seventeen, and with no sentiment superior to strong esteem and lively friendship, voluntarily to give her hand to another!\\"I cannot say I really liked this book as much as I thought I would. From hearing what other people have said, I thought it would be absolutely great. It was just okay. I have found that there are several classics that I feel about this way. Maybe the hype is just too much. My expectations are too high. Or maybe I am just not into this style of book. I will keep trying however.I give it a 3 out of 5. I liked this book but I did not love it."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Not only did I receive my purchase in a timely manner, but I also found the book to be in excellent condition and exactly what I asked for. Thanks!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"This book was required for my course on Jane Austen and her life and times. It arrived in perfect condition and the price was cheaper than the school bookstore."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"So you want to read SENSE AND SENSIBILITY. Great choice! Jane Austen's first published novel (1811) can get lost in the limelight of her other \`darling child', PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, but is well worth the effort. There are many editions available in print today, and the text can stand on its own, but for those seeking a \`friendlier' version with notes and appendixes, the question arises of how much supplemental material do you need, and is it helpful?One option is the Oxford World's Classics new revised edition of SENSE AND SENSIBILITY that presents an interesting array of additional material that comfortably falls somewhere between just the text, and supplemental overload. This volume offers what I feel a good edition should be, an expansive introduction and detailed notes supporting the text in a clear, concise and friendly manner that the average reader can understand and enjoy.The material opens with a one paragraph biography of the life of Jane Austen which seemed rather slim to this Austen enthusiast's sensibility, and most certainly too short for a neophyte. The introduction quickly made up for it in both size and content at a whopping 33 pages! Wow, author Margaret Anne Doody does not disappoint, and it is easy to understand why after eighteen years publishers continue to use her excellent essay in subsequent editions.Amazingly, the introduction is not at all dated. The material covered is accessible to any era of reader, touching upon the novels publishing history, plot line, character analysis, and historical context. Doody thoughtfully presents the reader with an analysis of the major themes in the novel such as; the dichotomy of sense and sensibility as it relates to the two heroines Elinor and Marianne, the portrayal of negligent mothers, men represented as the ultimate hunter, secrecy, deceit and concealment, and the crippling impact of the inheritance laws and primogeniture on women during the Regency era. Interlaced with Doody's interpretations are her astute observations of Austen's writing style with references to pages in the novel and outside sources. The entire essay is well researched, populated with footnotes, and an enjoyable complement to the text.The notes on the text explain the editorial trail since the novel's first publication in 1811, whose subtle changes and their significance might baffle the nonscholars! Moody. The select bibliography is indeed select, and includes many editions that deserve recognition as the best of what is available in print on Jane Austen's life, works and critical analysis. One of my favorites listed is JANE AUSTEN: A FAMILY RECORD (1913) by William Austen-Leigh and Richard Arthur Austen-Leigh, revised and enlarged by Deirdre Le Faye (1989). I was also pleasantly surprised to see a category including film versions and commentaries which is often overlooked by other publishers.The chronology of Jane Austen's life lists both significant events and what transpired historically in matching columns. The choices are relevant and interesting with the exception of two events that this writer found humorous; - 1795 Jane Austen flirts with Tom Lefroy, and in 1815 Humphry Davy invents miner's safety lamp. I have yet to be convinced that Austen's flirtation with Tom Lefroy had a significant impact on her life, nor am I clear how a clergyman's daughter living in southern England would be directly affected by the invention of a miner's safety lamp. Just thinking out loud here!The two appendixes on rank and social status, and the intricacies of country dance touched upon both subjects clearly, but briefly, using stories from Jane Austen's life to put the era in context. I appreciated the humorous example of how young women attending balls and assemblies were accompanied by chaperones, usually a mother or an older woman, who were expected to pass the time with cards or socializing rather than dancing themselves. In a letter to her sister Cassandra, thirty-seven year-old Austen recognizes the transition from dancer to on-looker when she writes \\"Bye the bye, I must leave off being young, I find many Douceurs in being a sort of Chaperon for I am put on the Sofa near the Fire & can drink as much wine as I like.\\" Too funny! Even though each of these appendixes is short, they do offer a list of books to explore further reading, which I was inspired to investigate.Since contemporary novels do cease to be contemporary the day that they are published, growing even more distant with each generation, notes can become indispensible to the enjoyment of the modern reader. Prof. Claire Lamont has supplied excellent and insightful explanatory notes, allowing for instant gratification with detailed descriptions of language usage, social and historical context, and character and plot insights. I found this the most interesting aspect of this edition, and reading the explanatory notes alone was like reading a condensed dictionary to Jane Austen, her times, and the plot and characters in SENSE AND SENSIBILTY.In short, Oxford World's Classics has pulled together just the right amount of supplemental material from reputable and readable sources for their revised edition of SENSE AND SENSIBILTY. I found very little wanting in this edition, and recommend it to first time readers, or veterans seeking new insights.Laurel Ann, Austenprose"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I ordered this version of P & P as I wanted a hard back to add to my few other hard back Jane A.'s novels.

No need for glasses or squinting ---- just yet. A lovely addition. I'm not so thrilled about the art work, but then again I don't like any of the art work in the stories I have. It always ruins my character in my imagination. Happy Reading!!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"The audiocassette of &quot;Sense &amp; Sensibility&quot; read by Sarah Badel is truly outstanding. I love S&amp;S anyway, but Ms. Badel's reading has enriched my understanding of it enormously, especially Jane Austen's sparkling dialogue. I don't know how often I laughed out loud (at Mrs. Jennings), or exclaimed with worry about poor Elinor and her carrying of everyone else's burdens. No, I'm not crazy, it's just that Jane Austen read aloud by an expert, articulate, dramatic reader does that to a person. I highly recommend this for those who listen to books on tape; you will cherish every word. Ms. Badel and Maureen O'Brien are the best readers I've encountered yet."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"This is a superb reading by Sarah Badel. I can find nothing to carp about; she scans the language with such assurance and close attention to the meaning that she shows up the deficiencies in almost every other Austen reading known to me. In most cases these readers brush over and miss the point of Austen's remarks but Badel is so clearcut and precise she consistently illuminates the writing rather than obscuring it as so many others do.It may however be a little understated for some listeners. She is rarely overtly dramatic but then neither is Austen. I think Sarah Badel tracks the author's lightly satirical voice almost perfectly but if you prefer a more animated reading you might try some alternative versions."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"In these days of rampant incivility, when we know far too much about each other, I find it relaxing to escape to the early 19th century and immerse myself in Jane Austen's world. Okay, I'll ignore the lack of plumbing and the whole layered economic system that allows some people to do nothing while others are ground down with toil. Instead, I'll celebrate the courteous manners and the formality of even close relationships.The Dashwood sisters are in a difficult position: their father had two families, the first of which produced a son who inherits all his property, and the second of which produced three daughters who are not entitled to any specific amount -- only what the half-brother (and his greedy wife) thinks is fair. So the girls must find husbands who can support them. Austen's skill is that she can deal with these economic uncertainties and class expectations in many of her novels without being repetitious. Everyone knows the rules of the game, and when impulsive, emotional Marianne goes off the deep end, we are all caught up in the fallout of her disappointment. Elinor has a different disposition and an equally complex set of problems that she must face, albeit alone.The great thing about this audio book, and others in the Naxos series, is that it is read by Juliette Stevenson, who does a wonderful job. Her voices are consistent and her trained (and natural) accent is perfect for Jane Austen. Whether I'm in the car or hunched over a sewing project, an audio book is a perfect companion."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I truly enjoyed this book. I'm not a romance novel kind of guy, but decided to check it out on my Kindle (free). I found the old English a little hard to read comfortably, but that passed. With all the hoopla about Jane Austin and her novels, I cought a movie during a plane ride entitled \\"The Jane Austin Book Club\\" and enjoyed it too. Don't be afraid guys, it wont hurt and you might even like it."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Though not considered to be her best work, Austen's Sense and Sensibility is definitely my favorite. The novel tells the tale of two sisters: Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. Having been left nearly penniless after the death of their father, the Dashwood family moves to a small cottage in the country. Elinor, the more sensible of the two sisters, is concerned with keeping up appearances and not letting her feelings for the object of her affections, Edwards Ferrars, be known. Marianne on the other hand, is the more flighty of the two. She wears her heart on her sleeve, a heart that beats for the charming and alluring Mr. Willoughby. The two sisters struggle with their own love affairs and their social standing in what I would call Austen's finest work.I know I go against the majority when I say I prefer this novel to Pride and Prejudice, but I do. Elinor and Marianne are much softer, more endearing characters than the Elizabeth and Jane Bennett. While the plots are similar, I would say that Sense and Sensibility reveals more about the main characters - their emotions, thoughts, etc. - than Pride and Prejudice does with its main characters.Either way, I adore this novel. If you have never read Austen, I definitely recommend starting with Sense and Sensibility."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Most people who have read Jane Austen will have read Pride and Prejudice. With a title like Sense and Sensibility, most readers will assume that the two books can be interpreted and enjoyed in the same way. Other than having three word titles that employ alliteration in the first and third words, the two novels are more different than similar.While Pride and Prejudice is primarily about miscommunication, Sense and Sensibility is about the maturation of two sisters as they find themselves confronted by adversity. The former topic allows Ms. Austen more room to roam, but within the later topic she has plenty of opportunities to display her story telling and comic talents. While maturation is an important sub theme in Pride and Prejudice, you see maturation better developed in Sense and Sensibility.When their father dies, Elinor, Marianne and Margaret find themselves in exile from their family home with their mother. The family estate had been left to their half brother whom their father exhorted to take care of them. But that promise is soon diluted into doing almost nothing through the selfishness of his wife and his vacillation. A relative kindly offers them a country cottage near his home and takes obvious pleasure in their company.At this modest new home, Elinor found herself entertaining the welcome attentions of Edward Ferrars. Elinor's younger sister, Marianne, is all aflutter over John Willoughby who seems to be committed to her. In fact, everyone assumes that there will soon be wedding bells for Marianne and Willoughby.All of these pleasant connections are, however, soon disrupted. Willoughby leaves and ignores Marianne. Elinor finds out an unexpected secret about Ferrars that puts her on her caution in pursuing their relationship. As these complications develop, Marianne soon finds herself distraught despite having attracted another suitor, the reliable, but older, Colonel Brandon. Elinor steps into the breach to try to help her sister regain her equilibrium. Both learn what a broken heart can feel like and adjust in their own separate ways.In vintage Jane Austen style, all bets are off near the end of the book as characters take unexpected steps that open up new possibilities. There's no one quite like Jane Austen for pulling great twists in her romantic comedies. These twists will cause your jaw to drop.Try not to compare this book to Pride and Prejudice. It's clearly a lesser work, but one that can certainly be enjoyed in its own right."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Jane Austen's 1811 novel, her first published, \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" receives a grand treatment in this Broadview Literary Texts edition, edited by Kathleen James-Cavan. Anyone who knows me knows how I doat on Jane Austen, and for the first time reading her in a Broadview edition, I find myself doating excessively. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" was the first public exposure of Austen's masterful characterization, plotting, and satire to reach the reading public of the Romantic Era. Austen thrives on what I like to call 'the middle of the book,' writing the situations that complicate the lives of her characters, better than almost anyone - almost, it seems, preferring getting her characters and readers in a position to learn from their mistakes, than actually getting them out.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" begins with the illogic of early 19th century British inheritance law. The hereditary owner of Norland Park is on his deathbed, and invites the heirs of his estate, the Dashwood family, to reside at Norland. The Dashwood's and their three daughters come to live there, but are put into jeopardy soon after by the demise of both Mr. Dashwoods - bringing the next male heir (and the girls' half-brother), John Dashwood and his manipulative wife, Fanny to Norland. Greedy as they are, John and his wife soon drive their half-sisters, Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret, along with their mother, out of Norland, Sussex, to the Devonshire countryside. Here in Devonshire, in a small cottage, and at a considerably reduced income, the Dashwood sisters and their mother struggle to rebuild their life, while the two eldest daughters, Elinor, 19, and Marianne, 17, try to deal with life and love in the English countryside.Like the well-known \\"Pride (Darcy) and Prejudice (Bennet),\\" \\"Sense and Sensibility\\"s title can be seen to refer to the character traits that mark its two principle characters - Sense on the side of the Enlightenment-influenced, almost certainly emotionally-repressed Elinor, and the overfine Sensibility of Marianne, a great admirer of dead leaves and the dirty ground. As opposed to the former novel, Austen does not really disparage either, except when carried to excess, as each young woman does, instead seeking, as was popular during the period, to reconcile, or strike a balance between rational logic and emotional response. In their love affairs, Elinor's with a distant cousin, the diffident and somewhat mysterious 24-year old Edward Ferrars, and Marianne's with a younger, and very handsome rogue John Willoughby, the young ladies' moral, social, and aesthetic principles are put to the test. While Elinor and Marianne are two of the most cultured, educated, and refined characters in the novel, and while Austen certainly privileges the country over the London metropolis, she makes clear that the ladies' limited interaction with society at large leaves them in a kind of sheltered ignorance which they must come to terms with, both for their sakes and for the sake of their lovers.Austen always does a great job with her minor characters, especially those who serve in comic relief roles - or as the butts of her satire, and \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is no different. In their avarice and greed, John and Fanny Dashwood are the epitome of wholly uncultured social climbers and mindless landowners. In her less than refined, but wholly maternal attitudes toward the Miss Dashwoods, Mrs. Jennings (mother of the neglected, but ever cheerful wife Charlotte Palmer and the reticent to a fault Lady Middleton) is as amusing a character, and as warm a mother as one will find in Austen. Colonel Brandon is a fit counterpart to Mrs. Jennings, in his reserved melancholy, while caring just as much about those around him as Mrs. Jennings. The comic pairings of Mr. Palmer and Sir John Middleton with their wives is absolute genius, both being the mirror opposite in style and attitude to their wives - and in particular the relationship between the Palmers, including the continual laughing of Charlotte at the fact that Mr. Palmer \\"never listens to me\\" and \\"never tells me anything,\\" is both highly entertaining, and at the same time, one of the most troubling relationships in the novel.I've praised James-Cavan's handling of this Broadview edition, and now may be a good time to say some more on that head. Broadview and its editors, like the people who put together the Norton Critical Editions, concern themselves with really presenting literary texts in a solid foundation of cultural, theoretical, and critical contexts. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" contains a real treasure trove of such material - the two contemporary reviews of Austen's novel from 1812, generous selections of essays from the late 1700's and early 1800's on contemporary debates on the meanings of the words \\"sense\\" and \\"sensibility,\\" and on the cult of sensibility and the picturesque. Also included are exerpts from poems referenced by Marianne throughout the novel, illustrations of the vehicles they travel in, and a map of the character's London residences. James-Cavan's excellent introduction also lays out the novel's issues in their contemporary, cultural, critical, and theoretical contexts, none more obtrusive than any other, and all quite helpful. Altogether, the Broadview \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a tremendous edition for Austen scholars and casual Janeites alike."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Jane Austin is one of my favorite authors. I think that \\"Persuasion\\" is her best novel, with both \\"Sense And Sensibility\\" and \\"Pride And Prejudice\\" tied for second place. \\"Sense And Sensibility\\" is an absolutely wonderful book, capturing beautifully the English Regency period's mores, manners, and lifestyles. The central theme deals with the extreme differences in temperaments between two sisters, and the eventual reconciliation and moderation of both their characters and temperaments.Marianne Dashwood is a passionate young woman, with a definite inclination toward the humanities: art, music and literature. Her heart rules her head, more often than not, and she has a very spontaneous nature. Elinor Dashwood, the older of the two sisters, is much more practical and sensible. While Elinor appreciates the music and literature that her sibling so passionately loves, she definitely thinks things through before making decisions, or taking action, and keeps her personal feelings to herself. She feels tremendous responsibility for her family's well-being. Elinor does have a wonderful, dry sense of humor, and her witty comments enhance the novel. Throughout most of the narrative, Marianne believes that Elinor, whom she dearly loves, is too cold, and restrained - more concerned with propriety than with feelings. She is obviously judgmental concerning Elinor's reticence to freely express her emotions, and she also pities Elinor, for her perceived inadequacies. Elinor, on the other hand, is concerned about Marianne's open and guileless behavior. She fears her sister will be hurt by indulging in her strong emotions, and that conventional society will condemn her for this attribute.The story opens with the death of Elinor and Marianne's father. He, unavoidably, has left them, along with their mother, (his second wife), and younger sister with little money. They are forced to leave their home, the Norland estate, and move to Barton Cottage, close to a distant relative's estate. Norland and all its treasures have been left to Dashwood's son, by his first wife. The four women have been left on their own, to pursue life, love, and loss in their different manners.Both Elinor and Marianne fall deeply in love, while at Barton, and each, in turn, are disappointed by their choices. These devastating losses, plus their adjustments to an entirely different lifestyle, serve to modify their temperaments and change their lives.\\"Sense And Sensibility\\" is a deeply moving novel, with biting satire, especially demonstrated in the characters of Fanny and John Dashwood, and Lucy Steele; and of course Elinor's fine wit adds much to make the reader smile. Ms. Austin's writing is pure elegance. Her female characters are well developed, including those in minor roles. The men, particularly John Willoughby, Edward Ferrars, and Colonel Brandon are very different in nature, and not at all stereotypical. I loved the scenes at Barton Cottage with Marianne and Willoughby, and with Willoughby and the Dashwood family. I also really enjoyed the visit to London and the tragic ball scene.I found myself laughing and crying while reading this book. So with all the discussion about moderation and passion, Jane Austin, once again, brought out the gamut of emotions in me. I cannot recommend this delightful novel highly enough!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I confess I own many editions of Jane Austen's works [individual and collected sets]. These Barnes and Noble editions are true value for money - in this instance, Sense and Sensibility is beautifully bound, with a cloth spine, and has a lovely portrait on the cover. The text is not too small unlike some other editions, it makes for comfortable reading. The book itself is sturdy, as it is in hardback, but not unwieldy - it fits nicely into my hands. Besides the main text of Austen's novel itself, it has added features - a brief chronology of the world of Jane Austen & Sense and Sensibility, an introduction, the main text, as well as useful endnotes, a list of adaptations of the novel [in both film and book format],comments, as well as a list of resources for further reading [biographies and letters of Austen] and criticisms. In all, a value buy."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I went into this without expecting much but was soon surprised by how engrossed I became in this classic! This is essentially the story of two sisters, Elinor and Marianne, who are different in temperamentbut experience similar disappointments in romance. It's interesting to see the contrast in their personalities in deealing with their heartbreaks. Prudent Elinor puts up a strong front, confiding in no one and worrying no one while Marianne becomes the very picture of wretchedness.It started off slowly but once you get into the main plot it's hard to put this one down! You hope for each of the sisters to achieve happiness in love, you smile at Austen's wit in observing the upper social strata, you condemn those who are against the sisters and their family and you eagerly read on for each new development. And, of course, there's the lovable supporting cast of characters who at first are viewed as obnoxious but become dear friends in light of true folly from others. And let me just leave off by saying that I loved Mrs. Jennings from the start ;)."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Can you imagine a world where there was nothing to do but walk and talk? In the historical fiction novel Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen it proves that a story can be more interesting than what it appears to be. One character represents sense (Elinor) and the other represents sensibility (Marianne). The story which takes place in the early 1800's when two teenage girls who move to the country with their mother and sister to live on their cousin's estate. While there, the two girls enter into several relationships. Some will last and others will not. Marianne meets the \\"dashing\\" Willoughby and they soon fall in love, but when Willoughby goes to London things take a turn for the worst. \\"Old\\" Colonel Brandon soon expresses his love for Marianne which complicates things even more. Elinor becomes close with Edward Ferrars (their sister-in law's brother) and eventually makes it clear she has fallen for him, but when Lucy Steel tells Elinor a big secret her feelings are forced to change.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a romantic, comical novel. This book is suitable for anyone about 12 and up. Overall, I really enjoyed Sense and Sensibility. I thought that it was a story that was fairly easy to grasp and it taught me a few things about life back in that day. Very few really learn what these people went through. For us, playing piano, playing cards, writing, taking walks, and visiting may not sound that ideal. This is because we are exposed to so many more interesting things, but you learn a lot from seeing the way the girls coped with having a much simpler life. My only complaint about this book was that since it was written so long ago, some of the language is difficult to comprehend. I would rate these book 4 stars out of 5. In conclusion, I think that Sense and Sensibility is a excellent book that has a good storyline and is perfectly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I have read all of Jane Austen's novels and this my second favorite, after Pride and Prejudice.

It is called the Insight Edition. It was with great anticipation that I opened the pages of this book for I had never read it before. I had only watched the movies which lent me great enjoyment. I knew, having read other Austin classics that the novel would be much better than the movies, and Jane (and her story) proved to be a most amiable companion.What sets this edition apart from any other, except Pride and Prejudice, is the wealth of added information from a Regency historical aspect, tidbits of opinion which evidenced delightful humor, and movie trivia. I even learned there was a S&S; under the sea movie which I had heretofore never heard.Astoundingly, I was somewhat surprised at myself because I truly enjoyed someone else's pain and agony for a change of pace. For fully 30 chapters, Marianne was just as full of passion and sensibility at Willoughby's disgraceful treatment of her as any movie depicted. Elinor was just as full of suppressed passion and sense as the movies depicted her, and of course Mrs. Dashwood was so much more sensible than Mrs. Benton of P&P; fame, which made for quite satisfying reading without the frustration of stupidity.If you do not have a copy of Sense and Sensibility for your library, I suggest you pick up this copy. It is well worth the money and is quite a satisfying read."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Sense and Sensibility, Insight Edition by Jane Austen is the classic story of two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, who are different in every way ~ but both discover love.

Several of the comments made me laugh out loud! (Though I wonder if Jane Austen would appreciate the humor in it!) For example, about halfway through the book, there's a conversation with \\"proper, flowery\\" English verbage between Elinor and Marianne, talking about a love interest. Then, in the side note it says: [7] As Beyonce says: Put a ring on it!

Austen's greatness lies in her backing out of the box of 19th-century literary moralism and seeing the areas of gray in human relationships and within the individual. Over and over again in this \\"early\\" work (Austen was only 41 when she died) we see characters acting in unexpected ways, even while social strictures are so much in evidence. The most outstanding characters are those who go against the social grain, and Austen unfailingly creates classic foils against whom these interesting individuals can stand out. Entertaining, existing in a stable social world, clever, and funny, this novel is like \\"comfort food.\\" If you're in the mood for a diverting stroll into another century, let this book be your guide. I also highly recommend the Penguin Classic that has an introductory section by Tony Tanner (if you can find it). Tony Tanner's brilliant insights into Austen and this work deeply enriched it for me.

They included Historical and cultural details, information on Jane Austen's life, references to Sense & Sensibility in films, an unscientific ranking of the novel's most frustrating characters and themes of faith drawn from the novel and Jane Austen's life. I actually caught myself laughing out loud as I read some of the side notes. The comments helped lighten the tone of the book and made it painless and even fun to read.

The love and loyalty between the sisters is astounding, but they do not understand each other. Elinor is a quiet, sensible and sensitive young lady cheerful and putting others first.

Her wishes and desires come first regardless of who is hurt.The family lives in late 18 century England where a person is judged by breeding and wealth, looking down on the working class. Circumstances change in the sisters lives and they are forced to move from the family homer to the country. Their half-brother has good intentions as to their welfare, but is overruled by his wife. Through the goodness of a distant cousins and friends, the sisters remain in polite society. Both have feelings for two gentlemen of the upper class, but whose feelings do not appear to be in their favor or any chance of marriage. What transpires in the lives of Elinor and Marianne along with their friends leads to some interesting conclusions.Jane Austen has always been a favorite author of many. However, this is a reprint of the original book first published around 1811. The trivia and notes that highlight this \\"Insight Edition\\" in the right margin is very distracting, and at times I found the story rambling without anything worthwhile being said.Jane Austen fans who want to reread the book will, no doubt, purchase the reprint for the interesting trivia, but I found it very hard to follow, due to the inserts in the margin, and to only hold my attention for short periods of time.This book was provided by the publisher for review."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"If you love Jane Austen, you will love this edition of Sense and Sensibility.I admit I was at first a little skeptical of reading an \\"insight edition\\" as often I have found, in the past, insights to be annoying and often detract from the story. That is not the case in this edition of Sense and Sensibility. I found most of the insights to be very helpful and often amusing.This timeless classic is brought to life in even greater detail through the insights included in this version. It includes many fascinating details from Jane Austen's own life which help explain her perspective on many different situations. Many of the insights have to do with bringing the rich cultural details out to a generation who may not immediately relate to life and places in the early 1800's.For those who have loved (or even hated) the many movies and mini-series' based on this book, you will find frequent comparisons, applause, and criticisms of the film versions.The faith that is evident, though not always clearly, is brought out and given Scriptures references for throughout the book. I found these very interesting as I had never thought of Sense and Sensibility as a Christian book before.This is definitely a book all Jane Austen aficionados will love. If you've never read Jane Austen, I strongly recommend you make this the first one you read.I must mention that I did receive a complimentary review copy of this book, however that in no way influenced my opinion."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Jane Austen's classic tale of a pair of two very different sisters, and their quest to find their own true love...As most of you already know, I'm a huge Jane Austen fan! I've read all her books several times and never seem to tire of them. Reading Jane's writings is a bit like curling up with a cup of tea while visiting with a very dear friend. Some things are just meant to be cherished and savored.While I have taken the time to do a little research on Austen's life and works, I was curious about the new Insight Edition of Sense & Sensibility by Bethany House Publishers. The Insight Edition seeks to provide readers with a deeper level of understanding of Austen's world and that of her famous characters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. No \\"Googling\\" required.This recently published version provides clever trivia and tidbits which are sprinkled throughout the margins of the book. Also included is a helpful Quick Guide that acts as a key for deciphering the note's symbols, and a Questions for Conversation section that can be used for book club discussions.While I admit to feeling almost giddy with anticipation over this book, I found myself feeling a bit disappointed by some of the commentary. I was very interested in both the historical and cultural notations, but I really didn't care to read what felt like an overabundance of \\"opinion\\". For example, \\"Mrs. Dashwood would've loved HGTV.\\" {page 33} To me, that felt completely unnecessary. Also the flash of \\"today's society/vernacular\\" while reading a novel set during the early 1800's felt a bit jarring at times.However, the Insight Edition does hold many interesting bits of information that most, if not all, Jane-ites will readily appreciate. I also enjoyed the fresh new cover art, which added a lovely ambiance to this most delicious diversion. :)"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I was excited to receive a free copy of the Sense and Sensibility Insight Edition by Jane Austen($11 .99) from Bethany House!

Much, I believe.Austen wrote a book that is very instructive in how people face life and love. Set in a time when many seemed to thrive on that which was deemed genteel and appropriate, but were very superficial, Sense And Sensibility shows the manner in which two (There were several others, but the Dashwood sisters are the two main characters.) sisters dealt with love. Elinor was prudent, careful, and thoughtful (She used sense). Marianne was passionate (Sensibile is the way Austen described her.). They both fell in love, and both were hurt in different ways. In the end, both learned the value of having a balance between careful, well-thought out approaches to love, and a passionate approach to love.The ins and outs of their loves are not too different from our times. Neither are the people. The great difference is in the setting. Human nature remains the same. We can learn much about life from this book.Bethany House Publishers has done the reader a service by providing appropriate historical details, references to various movies based upon the book, and humorous comments along the way.Who would have ever thought that reading a classic could be so much joy!?!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible.

A bit difficult to read in the old English but having seen the movie made it more understandable."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Published in 1811 but still a book that can be enjoyed and related to today's generations. A widowed mother taking care of three daughters. Being evicted from their home and moves into a relative's home. The daughters all taught that they don't have to marry into money or their social class. They're also encouraged to be well educated in all subjects.Now in the early 1800's, women were not allowed to own property. They didn't have civil rights that we do now. So when Henry Dashwood dies, the successor of all of Henry's property is John Dashwood (son by Henry's first marriage). Henry's second wife, Mrs. Dashwood (40 y.o.), is forced to find another place for herself and her 3 daughters. John Dashwood is a man who allows his wife to manipulate him. He wants to do right and follow his father's dying wish, but the spoiled wife convinces him otherwise.The title \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" was not Austen's original decision. None the less, the title is an example way English teachers want for comparison and contrast essays. The usage of the two terms are also fitting. In this case, sense refers to Elinor Dashwood. She is the eldest daughter and 19 years old. Elinor is reasonable and reserved toward her feelings. Romanticism is apart of the definition of sensibility. Marianne (the 16 y.o. middle daughter) and Mrs. Dashwood both where their hearts on their sleeves. They rely on their emotions for all the decisions they makes. The youngest daughter, Margaret Dashwood (13), is also romantic but is still young.Mrs. Ferrars, Fanny Dasholwood, and Robert Ferrars believe in social class and high status of wealth. None of them have job or money income. They live off their inheritance and marriage dowries.

I believe that this can relate to a lot of girls in today's culture. All of the girls in today's culture are always looking for love. They are always seeking for a boyfriend. This book is about two older women who are searching for the love of someone. This book can also relate to the lives of people today because it is about broken hearts and finding the right person. A lot of people today think that the first boy that they date, they are going to marry. That is not true in a lot of cases and that is a lesson that can be learned from this book.This book is about two sisters. Marianne and Elinor are both looking for someone to marry. They are at the age when it is time for them to be married and that is what they want. In the beginning of the book, Elinor has fallen for a man named Edward Ferrars. He is a respectable gentlemen who Elinor falls on love with at first site. When Elinor and her family move away, he promises to come and see them soon. He never comes and only sends a letter. This makes Elinor very upset. While all of this is happening, Marianne meets a man. His name is John Willoughby. He is also very respectable and helps Marianne when she falls down. He carries her home because she cannot walk. This is when it happens. When John meets her family, they instantly like him. He hangs around and is then called out of town. Then, before they know it, Willoughby is called out of town.When the two sisters go into town for a few months, they hear some devastating news. They hear that Willoughby is marrying another woman and so is Edward. This devastates both of the girls and they are in a wreck. In the end, They both ended up getting married. You will have to read the book to see how the end turns out because I don't want to give away the ending for those of you who have not read it yet.In the end, The book was good and I would recommend it to some people. I would not recommend it to all people because as I would put it: \\"The book is a chick flick\\". I would recommend this book to people who like romance and fiction. This book I think would best fit teenage girls. This is what I feel about the book."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"The Kindle edition was well-formatted with only two recurring issues: (1) every 4-5 pages or so, some sentences or phrases were repeated on separate lines near (but not perfectly next to) where they first appeared or were about to appear, but they were easy to spot and ignore; and (2) bracketed numbers appeared occasionally within the text, but it was unclear what they referred to. Content includes table of contents with chapter titles and a somewhat antiquated preface (not by Austen, of course) from the out-of-copyright text.With respect to the content itself, Austen's story and story-telling is amusing and witty, her language is ornate and sometimes a bit tedious, and most (though not all) of the characters are sketched vividly. This was the first Austen book I've read (and the first she published), but I rather doubt it would have remained so popular without the success of her other books; I would recommend Pride and Prejudice or another of her books as a first read.

I caught on pretty fast. The beginning is confusing but afterwards, it makes more sense. Things such as He is very agreeable or five and twenty (25) come up a lot. My advice is too read it with no noises or distractions. I had to re-read many parts cause of the background noises. The book is hard enough as it is as many will agree with me.

All throughout the books they sprinkle little trivia and helpful side-notes. Everything from how things were depicted in film adaptations, to what was happening in Jane's real life at the time of her authorship, to giving the context and definition to various phrases and references in the books, the Insight Editions truly give that extra little verve and interest to the classic works. The extras are well written and added with care by a fellow author (Julie Klassen) who has a genuine love and appreciation for Austen's work.Now, of course, Jane Austen stands on her own just fine, but having always been an avid watcher of DVD Bonus Features, the Insight Edition was right up my alley!

I can't remember the last time I had read one of her books, but I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this book. It even inspired me to rent the 1995 movie with Emma Thompson and Hugh Grant in it.

This is a shame, because the format is quite attractive and the print size is very good. I wrote a letter of complaint to the publisher, but received no reply."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" was first published in 1811, although it appears that Jane Austen had worked on various versions of the novel since the 1790's. It is less polished than the later, classic \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", but it contains all the familiar elements we expect and enjoy in an Jane Austen novel.The novel is built around the two Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, whose contrasting styles are the \\"sense and sensibility\\" of the title. Elinor is the elder sister, patient, considerate and practical. Marianne, on the other hand, knows no halfway love of anything in life.As the story opens, their father has just died, leaving the family estate to his son by a first marriage and his second wife and three daughters in near destitution. The widow and three daughters move to a small cottage on the estate of a distant kinsman in Devonshire. Elinor leaves behind the cherished Mr. Edward Ferres, a shy but loyal and seemingly compatible friend, who has however strangely not offered marriage to Elinor. The beautiful Marianne attracts two suitors soon after their arrival in Devonshire, the older, sober and respectable Colonel Brandon, and the young, handsome, and charming Mr. Willoughby. Willoughby wins Marianne's heart, and an engagement is expected momentarily.To Marianne's immense disappointment, Willoughby unexpectedly departs for London without proposing. The two sisters are persuaded to travel with an aunt to London to take part in the social scene. In London, the sisters will learn shocking news about their respect suitors, and each will learn to cope with the help of the other. The journey back to Devonshire will set the stage for dramatic developments for Elinor and Marianne.Austen's sense of dialogue and ability to set up scenes staging are less acute in \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" than in later novels, but she makes up for it by a more emotional approach to the characters and some savage if indirect commentary on the social customs of the day. Those readers whose introduction to the story is the excellent 1995 movie \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" will find a longer, more subtle, and complex story in Austen's novel. This novel is very highly recommended to fans of Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Sense and Sensibility is about the Dashwood girls Elinor and Marianne.The time is the Napoleonic years of the nineteenth century though nothing so sordid as the little Corporal's baleful visage will appear in this novel of domestic romance. The girls are forced to leave their home following the death of their father. The estate they live at is invaded by their dullard half brother John and his insufferable wife. The two girls, their mother and younger sister Margaret are off to the West of England to live at Barton Cottage being supported by John the brother.In this novel Miss Jane Austen tells two convoluted love stories. Elinor who is the oldest and most sensible of the girls is in love with Edward Farrars. Farrars is an Oxford man who eventually goes into the ministry. He has been involved in a longterm engagement to the odious but ambitious Lucy Steele. Elinor is heartbroken at this lost love but keeps her stiff upper lip in order to minister to the needs of her younger and more emotional sister Marianne.Marianne is in love with the rake Willoughby who has had a torrid affair with Eliza Williams. He jilts Marianne but lives to rue his rejection of her.As in all Austen novels all is resolved with a wedding. Elinor will eventually wed Edward Farrars and live in a parsonage. Her sister Marianne will become Mrs. Brandon as she weds an older and wiser manColonel Brandon.Along the way we meet the lovable Mrs. Jennings, the fautous Steele sisters and Robert Ferrars the stupid brother of Edward Ferrars. Mr. and Mrs. Palmer are also satirically viewed as a dull married couple living in luxury.It amazes me that no one in a Jane Austen novel really works! As Emma Thompson who directed the film \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" quipped one wonders why these women don't go out and get a job! In an Austen novel there are the inevitable long walks and conversations, mixed romantic signals with mixups aplenty and the occasional dance across the ballroom floor.Austen can be tedious and it can be a challenge to keep up with the characters and conversations. She is a great artist with a very narrow focus; a few middle class families living in the country with a love story to be told. Within this baliwick she is peerless, witty and wise. She brings a few hours of quiet where the only sound heard is a bird singing or a carriage rumbling up to the house.Sense and Sensibility published in 1811 is a classic of English literature. Jane Austen is unsurpassed in the realm of Regency romance!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I have recently read the novel Sense and Sensibility for an English class project. It was a great love story but it was a very difficult book to read. I wasn't used to reading books that were written many years ago in that type of writing so it took me some time to understand some things.I love to read love stories and dream about how my life will turn out. Jane Austen did a good job of writing this love story. I think it was so sweet how Colonel Brandon loved Marianne since the moment he met her and in the end, they were together. I was also very happy about Edward and Elinor that they loved each other and another engagement was about to keep them from ever being together but thankfully things worked out.I would recommend this book to anyone who is a great reader or used to Jane Austen's writing. Otherwise, I suggest you just go out and rent the movie becuase it pretty much follows right along with the book and it was very good."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I just finished reading this book and I have fallen in love with it. Austen is funny and poignant and though the social commentaries she makes throughout this splendid novel were originally meant for the 18th century, much of what she says still holds true to some degree. The characters of the story will tug at your heart strings as you laugh out loud. Absolutley stunning!!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"\\"Sense and Sensiblity\\" is a masterpiece. It's greatness and universality, besides it's pure entertainment value, can be extolled all day long. So its very easy, when you are dealing with a masterpiece, to lean on clich&eacute;s to describe a work.But I don't want to do that. I will, however, tell you that for young romantics who believe in Mr. Right and long walks on the beach, this novel takes you through the breathtaking ride of falling, captively, into love and falling, quite willfully, out. Also, you vicariously experience the emotional stupor of coming out on the other side of such a relationship exhausted...and wiser. Also, if you're like me, you can wrestle with the tale of a woman who believes in the security of decisiveness. Her conflict is how to be sensible in an insensible world, and then, finally, how to reconcile the whimsicleness in herself. Where does the mind retreat and the heart take over? \\"Sense and Sensiblity\\" lastly is a tale for sisters. A truly unique relationship, Jane Austen captures the complexity of sisters--persons, peers even, that are equipped with the same tools in life but that often are very different. And despite these differences, share an eternal bond that can only be severed by themselves. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is worth the time and money any day."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Unfortunately, this is one of those novels that depend on style to carry its weight, so after seeing the movie and discovering beforehand what was to happen, the book was a bit bland (though through no fault of the author's). Nevertheless, it was enjoyable despite young Miss Austen's profuse mistakes, which made for hard reading at times. It is amazing that Austen had the perception to write social satire at the level she did at such a young age."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"It was required of me to read one of Jane Austen's books. I chose S&amp;S and I actually found myself enjoying the book and the movie. This story reminded me of myself and my siblings who immediately assumed the roles of Elinor and Marianne. This is quite an interesting novel."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Jane Austen had me shocked at the turn out with Wiloughby. It made me get involoved in the story. I think all her descriptive settings and characters made it a great novel. I read P&amp;P and loved it, now I have another Austen book to admire. Although I hadn't seen the movie first I was quite dissapointed with the change in somethings of the movie! Well, what was supposed to have been a book to pass the time on the plane, became one of my top 10's! I also recommend &quot;Over The Moon&quot; by Linda Anderson*****!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I do admire it is a good book, but not good as Pride and Prejudice. I read P&amp;P before reading S&amp;S, maybe my exception is then rised because I enjoy P&amp;P very much. I just think S&amp;S is boring.It is quite simple a story but Jane Austen made it long. Everything is predictable. But I still recomment this book if you are fans of Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Jane Austen had such a great sense of humor. This book is so enjoyable on so many different levels. I am a light to moderate reader and this book had me entertained right away. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I am really enjoying reading the classics and for some reason enjoy reading more on my Kindle. I was never much of a reader before."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Having not read Austen before seeing the many theatrical productions of her work, I can truly say her works reflect everything I have read or heard about. Now, on to a new Austen novel....."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Wasn't quite what my wife was thinking about when she ordered it but will try again. Actually she found out that she had the wrong author."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"This is a stunning novel, Jane Austen captures the nuances of life and as such is as relevant today as she was in her time."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"English literature at it's best. This is a perfect e-reader or kindle version of any kind. Suggest reading this before any visual represenatation. If viewed, suggest the Emma Thompson version. She manages to capture all of the subtle emotional inferences on which eveything depends."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"The late, great Jane Austen was famous for her keen observations of life, love and the foibles of people involved in both and for her ability to gently make fun of them. For me, Sense and Sensibility is another classic and classy example of this master at work. While not as complex to read as something like Shakespeare, the formal language and speech of the nineteenth century is more subtle and difficult for many modern readers, it's not a fluffy beach book. I think it does the modern-day reader good to read a story that requires one to slow down and savor the words and the subtleties of interactions as well written by a great author. This is your chance.Read the book and then watch a movie version- such as the one with Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet. You could do the same for Pride and Prejudice, but for that movie version I highly recommend the A&E; version with Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. My family loves to compare and contrast the movie version with the original book. 9 times out of 10 the book wins!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"This is a classic that I missed and wanted to read for a long time. Written in the old english style it was a bit tricky to comprehend although as I got more into it the book kept me intrigued. A must read for most anyone."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"All of Jane Austin's books are great, including this one. It's handy to have this on my Kindle. Thank you."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"A long tale and not my kind of story. It was about a widow lady wanting her two marriageable age daughters find a suitable husband. All the players in the story seem to have this same pastime and providing tmes and events where it can take place. The verbage was in old English, sometimes with different meanings than today and the narrater didn't always make voice changes to distinguise who was talking. It became more interesting toward the end and I'm sure in the day it was written it was a good story."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I read (heard--on audiocassette) this book after seeing the film. I loved them both. Jane Austen shows how intricate and complicated even the plainest of lives can be. I was especially moved by the beautiful use of language--sentiment was so well expressed. Julie Christie's narration was terrific, so full of expression. Her renditions of the different characters, both male and female, were unique and very well done. As an audiobook enthusiast, I appreciate, and depend upon, a good narrator."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"&quot;Sense and Sensilibilty&quot; was fortunate to have Patrick Doyle as the composer. The songs are beautifully written, with strong tones. Even if you've never seen the movie, it's easy to imagine what happens in the movie when each song plays. While this CD isn't exactly car trip music, the instrumental pieces are fabulous. There are also two songs sung by soprano Jane Eaglen."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Being only 13 years of age, I found this novel quite intresting eventhough the vocabulary mabye hard for the typical 7th grader. I read it after I saw the movie(which Kare acted very well in ) and I found it a little confusing as to why Marianne married Cononel Brandon and the events in Wiloughby's past. I loved it anyway and I'm starting to read Emma. I highly recomend this novel."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I was quite dissappointed when I read Sense And Sensibility. I'm not saying that it was not a good book. To be frank, it was one of the best book I've ever read. I guess the cause of this is because I've just read Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice before this. Both are just as refreshing, but I must say, I did not enjoy this one as much as P&amp;P. For instance, not as much humour was injected into the story. And, now that I think of it, the story is not very much fast-moving. The story lacks of excitement and it drags in every scene. As in, there seems to be a lot of time spent in reading about a particular scene where nothing much actually happened. All in all, this book did not make me read it for a second time. However, I highly encourage everyone to read this, as it is quite refreshing to the mind. Generally, I must say that this book deserves more applause than I have given it. I admit that I am prejudiced, a little, after reading P&amp;P."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"This book is good. You can't put it aside, because you just want to know what's going to happen next. I loved it. Only one but: If you're going to read it, make sure you have enough spare time. If you lay it aside for a week, you're bound to forget who's who: there are so many characters! Anyhow, just read it."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Sense and Sensibility is a work of wit intelligence and genius--the critical apparatus and here I mean the work of modern critics is the work of those \\"favored\\" by stupidity.

The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love.

A great transaction. Thank you."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Though not as dazzling in wit as Pride and Prejudice or as passionate a love story as Persuasion, Sense and Sensibility gives the modern reader a true feeling of what it would be like to be a woman of limited means falling in love at a time when Romance was a matter of public discourse. In Regency England, many Britons hailed Samuel Johnson, Isaac Newton, and philosophers of the Enlightenment as voices of reason and logic who relied on empirical data rather than religion or emotion to support their assertions. Perhaps as a reaction to this matter-of-fact and somewhat dry philosophy, there arose a movement called Romanticism which hailed instinct, spontaneity, and feelings over careful analysis. While ostensibly a novel about two sisters' journey to love, Sense and Sensibility is also an extended metaphor comparing the competing intellectual philosophies of Reason and Romance.The title Sense and Sensibility is confusing to many modern readers due to the words' virtually identical meanings in today's vernacular; however, in Regency England, \`sense' was synonymous with 'logic' while \`sensibility' meant something more along the lines of \`sympathy.' In the case of the novel, Elinor Dashwood is a woman of sense whose attitudes toward love are so rational that they leave the reader (and her sister Marianne) wondering if she is capable of falling in love at all. Marianne, by contrast, is so in love with the idea of love (as sensationally depicted in literature and the arts) that she is quite literally swept off her feet without understanding the character of the object of her affection. As the story progresses, Elinor and Marianne must deal with the not always pleasant consequences of their very different approaches to love.Although the novel focuses on the two sisters, Austen supplies the reader with plenty of entertaining supporting characters. While Fanny's calculating manipulation of her husband John Dashwood results in the impoverishment of the Dashwood girls, it also provides the reader with an entertaining twist on the classic stereotypes of the evil sister-in-law and the henpecked husband. Likewise, Mrs. Jenkins' always uncomfortable references to husband hunting make the reader squirm in her chair, even as Sir John Middleton's endless commenting on hounds elicits eye-rolling.The men of the novel do not disappoint, either. Willoughby, Edward Ferrars, and Colonel Brandon all portray characteristics that make them worthy of the heroines' attentions, though they are quite the diverse crowd. The reader may even find her own attitudes towards love deepen and evolve as she reacts to the dashing Willoughby, steadfast Brandon, and thoughtful Edward.In sum, this novel is beautifully written and well worth reading at least once, if not several times."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"A story of two sisters who search for marriage partners. What is nice about Jane Austen is the quality and quantity of conversation, so that the reader imbues a sense of the 1800s among the countrified gentry. The memorable characters run the gamut from respectable, cultured Colonel Brandon to his opposite John Willoughby, who is out for a good-time with the ladies. The lady between them is Marianne Dashwood--inexperienced, beautiful, artistic, and idealistic. She is lovingly censured for her candor and romanticism by her older sister, Elinor Dashwood--rational, proper, loyal, and stoic. Before they marry an appropriate partner, a whirlwind of misjudgments, gossip, and surprises threatens to upset their chances at happiness."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Sense and Sensibility is about a family of women: Mrs. Dashwood, the mother, and Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret, the three daughters, who are made to relocate as a result of their father's death. Their home is given to their gullible half-brother who means well and their manipulative sister-in-law who does not mean well at all. Settling in a cottage given to them by a generous distant relative in Devonshire, the girls experience romance and heartbreak.I've heard of Jane Austen's work before, and I read this as a prelude before I read Pride and Prejudice. I have to say, even though it was engaging towards the end, in the beginning I had trouble plowing through the introduction. There was nothing there to grasp my interest, only long, insipid descriptions of the surrounding countryside, and a long build-up to the main plot. About halfway through, when Marianne begins her romance with Willoughby, I actually found myself wanting to read the book and thinking with excitement and a feeling of suspense about what would happen next.The characters weren't perfect, with both flaws and redeeming qualities, such as Elinor, who is very intellectual and polite, but may be missing out on life because she's very reserved, and Marianne, who likes to live life to the fullest emotionally, but is completely devastated when bad things happen to her.I liked that it gave me a feel of what life was like for people in the moderate and upper end class in the early 1800's, as I'm used to stories such as Oliver Twist, where the main subject is life in the low slums, so it was nice to see the other end for a change. In regard to the storyline, it was very interesting in the latter part of the book, when its it is full of romantic betrayal and unseen engagements, and people turning up unexpectedly.This was a good introduction to Jane Austen's books, but based upon to the admiration she has received, I don't believe this is her best, and I'm ready to see what she can do in Pride and Prejudice."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Not as good as \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" of the same author, although some chapters are brilliant. Particularly good are those where Jane Austin applying her great satirical talent. I liked very much how she painted the character of John Dashwood: soft but very biting image of the selfish and greedy fellow. Balance of judgment and passion - dilemma as old as Seneca writing and beyond - revealed in this novel slightly in obsolete form, but essence is the same: you suffer more when submit to passions, but who can live by the rule of judgment only?"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"First time I read this book was in high school & I fell in love with Jane Austen's writings... then went on to read all of her books. It's quite enlightening to read this book today & realize how women were treated not too long ago. Classic read, romantic yet \\"sensible\\". A book to be read again & again."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"As always, Jane Austen has an extremely soothing writing style. Sense and Sensibility describes the trials and tribulations of the young Dashwoods who strive to keep their senses about them despite the dramatic flurry of relationships. There are a number of wonderfully entertaining characters, including Ms. Jennings with her loud squawking and gossiping, as well as the Steeles. And, of course, she neatly wraps up the ending as always.Jane Austen is simply brilliant in conveying the idea that indeed, sense and sensibility may not always guarantee happiness and certainly, neither can money and matches of material gain. More was gained than was lost- both knowledge and true happiness were the result of simply answering to the heart and not to the powers that be who called for marriage on the basis of dowry. The Dashwoods, for all their gentleness, sincerity, and society, certainly deserve all of the contentment and satisfaction which can be afforded to them.Anyone who is looking for a cozy book and craving some entertainment and emotional support from a relationship- this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"...It is a suggestion in the way that you read this book. I suggest attacking this piece of literary masterpiece in a three-pronged maneuver - through reading the book, listening to the audiobook and watching the film, as close to the same time as possible. I did it backwards and I wish I had staved off watching the film all the way through...I began my S&S; journey by discovering characters through Mamma Mia, of all places. The groom in the movie, Dominic Cooper, was intriguing to me, so I looked him up and guess who he turned out being? None other than Mr. John Willoughby himself. From there I was hooked on the youtube.com 2007 BBC version and HAD to read the book because I just knew there were holes in the story!The first few chapters of the book were hard to get through, but I had Willoughby's smouldering eyes to keep me going. I read a few chapters, then listened to the chapters over again. I found the audiobook for free on iTunes, under a section by Southern Florida University called Lit2Go. It helped IMMENSELY that the reader had an English accent because the colloquialisms came right through and there were many \\"aha!\\" moments.When I finished both, I bought the DVD of S&S; (BBC version) and I will be purchasing/renting the Kate Winslet version soon. So with $[...], you too, can discover this amazing piece of literature through exploring the visual (film), the audio (audiobook) and the actual book. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"The funny thing about Austen's work is that, although not much happens in her books, they are always interesting. Sense and Sensibility is in fact interesting, but lacks something. The ending is disappointing, and overall, it wasn't nearly as good as Emma."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Although this book is not about the two sisters of \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" the primary characters are two sisters (which will remind you of Jane and her sister), Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. Again, as in \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" the underlying theme is marriage. There is a lot of misunderstanding due to partial, or erroneous, information. The sense and sensibility is shown in how the sisters handle the different predicaments.The cast includes, among others, the sisters, Willoughby, Edward Ferrars, and John and Fanny Dashwood.This edition has the complete text and not much else. The introduction has some historical information about the author and about the publishing of the book. There are only two pages of this. The margins are small, so taking notes within the text will prove difficult. It is easy to carry around and seems to put up with a moderate amount of abuse.I do recommend this book. The edition is worth the price, and the story is indeed a classic."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I have had the pleasure now of having read a great deal of Austen's works. She had a knack for depicting human nature in a very skillful and entertaining manner. My one regret in my reading of Austen is that I started with this book.

At every moment of the book vanity is criticized, from its opening to its ending. Many of the characters, even if not actively participating in the story, are vain as they can be.In the very opening of the book, as Mr. Dashwood passes, there is the interference of Mrs John Dashwood , who, in the fear of losing part of her wealth ans status, has her husband, a weak character, reduce the pension that he had promised his dying father that he would provide to his half-sisters.When Edward Ferrars declines to wed Miss Morton, Mrs John Dashwood quickly sets a fit and expells his future sister-in-law from her house due to her disapproval to that engagement that is, in their views, less than favourable. Edward also falls victim to the rest of his family , who disconsiders him as a member of the family due to his choices.Willoughby is another example. In love with Marianne, he chooses to marry a rich woman who will provide him of his extravagances (as he himself later admits) than to open his heart to true love. He is also an example of cruelty, for he leaves a young girl he had earlier seduced to her own luck.A last exaple will be Lucy Steele. Fearful of what might happen to her, she is secretly engaged to Edward Ferrars, but leaves him for his own brother who can provide her comfort in a better way.Although vanty is not exactly the theme of Sense and Sensibility , it is at every moment of the book criticized, and vanity in its own way supports the plot."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"It takes little time for the reader to become completely engrossed.

It's written in such a form that it's hard to follow and understand what she is talking about. I've truly had to read and re-read sentences and paragraphs to get what in the world she is talking about. Here's an example: \\"She was faithful to her word; and when Willoughby called at the cottage, the same day, Elinor heard her express her disappointment to him in a low voice, on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present. The reasons for this alteration were at the same time related, and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side impossible.\\" OR: \\"The situation of Barton, in a county so far distant from Sussex as Devonshire, which, but a few hours before, would have been a sufficient objection to outweigh every possible advantage belonging to the place, was now its first recommendation.\\" HUH??? See what I mean? I had to work too hard at understanding much of the book and it was no longer relaxing or fun to read so I gave up. I guess when it comes to these period pieces, I was better off watching the movies. I wanted to return the book"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"i know that i am going to mangle this quote, but mark twain once said something to the effect that \\"a library without any books in it would still be a pretty good library, seeing as it lacked any works by jane austin.\\" well, right on mr twain. i read \\"sense and sensiblity\\" a few years back and am still trying to recover from the near coma of boredom that it put me in. really awful and dreary stuff. i mean it. now, to be of further help, let me give you directions to the unhelpful voting button. it can be found directly below this review, over to far right hand side. it's the button with the word \\"no\\" on it."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Several well-spaced readings of this novel during a long life have not yet enabled me to tell what happens in it. There is a superb early chapter in which Elinor and Marianne's sister-in-law pares away the direction expressed by her dying father-in-law that his son share his inheritance with his half-sisters and their mother. Jane Austen manages this almost as well as Shakespeare has Goneril and Regan stripping King Lear of his \\"retinue of an hundred knights\\". Then towards the end of the novel, when Elinor keeps vigil at her gravely ill sister's bedside, a horseman arrives who turns out to be the very last person she expected. Between these memorable events, try as I might, I cannot distinguish between most of the numerous female and the few aloof, mysterious and unpredictable male characters, neither can I sort out how they are interacting.What delights me, however, on every page is Jane Austen's prose. Every sentence is carefully fitted into its place, every word connotes its precise meaning, every adjective such as \\"affable\\" and \\"agreeable\\" carrying a specific ranking in a scale of values.In today's parlance, I suppose I would say that the plot and the characters lack the edge that is so sharp and memorable in other of Jane Austen's novels."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Sense and Sensibility was published in 1811 when Jane Austen was just 36 years old, and only 2 years before the publication of Pride and Prejudice. In the span of such a short time, and almost 200 years ago from today, Jane Austen produced two timeless classics. I find it bitterly ironic that in almost every case, a classic is known by the whole world over - celebrated, written about, studied, discussed in painstaking details in a classroom, read aloud in packed lecture halls and admired by masses - yet the creator of it all is spared this knowledge of success.Sense and Sensibility's characters add richness and color to the story, where the central theme revolves around two sisters, opposite in character and ideals, both in mild struggle with the life choices afforded to them because of their situation, their connections, and their small fortune. The Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marrianne, live with Mrs. Dashwood, their mother and younger sister, Margaret. When Mr. Dashwood dies, he leaves the decision of their care in the hands of his son, John. John has never played the role of a compassionate step-brother to his father's other family but he is not vindictive or evil. His wife Fanny is. The Dashwoods are politely and slowly forced out of their beloved home in Norwood, as John is persuaded out of any kindness that Fanny found appropriate for their living situation. The compassionate cousin of Mrs. Dashwood, Sir John Middleton, offers the family to live in a small cottage, Barton Park, for as long as they shall like.The sense of duty and responsibility from Elinor is unparalleled. When she learns that Lucy is secretly engaged to the love of her life, Edward, she is stunned and saddened when the terrible news is confirmed as true. We do not see a single outburst of anger, frustration, disappointment from Elinor's lips or thoughts. She continues to care for Marianne's deep wounds over Willoughby and does not mention a word of her own loss. For four months, she is resilient and silent to even Marianne, for she has promised Lucy to keep the secret for her. How she endures it all is a testament to her character. She exerts herself to be strong, and act with dignity even at the expense of her own happiness.Perhaps it is ironic that Elinor who is the sensible one with such measured approach to her desires is in the end united with the true love of her life, Edward - while Marianne, who is the sensitive, emotional, passionate, idealistic one, is rejected by Willoughby, suffers greatly in love, and is at last united with Colonel Brandon, whom she neither liked nor respected earlier in the story. Is Austen telling us that it is better to be sensitive or sensible, or that both will do as they may, and life will happen all around us, and we shall never choose our destiny - rather, it chooses us?Whatever the answer may be, Jane Austen is one of my favorite authors of all time and I can't get enough of her!

A must read! Wonderful, excellent, terrific!! Cannot say enough about how great a writer Jane Austen was. Only regret that she didn't live longer to write more books."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I always love the vicious innocence with which Jane Austen tears her characters apart, and Sense and Sensibility is a prime example. Her brutally sarcastic observations of the British upper class reduce her antagonists to sniveling school children who cry and grovel and simper their way through life behind a thin veil of dignity, a veil gleefully ripped open by Austen.From her opinions of parents:\\"...a fond mother, though, in pursuit of praise for her children, the most rapacious of human beings, is likewise the most credulous; her demands are exorbitant; but she will swallow anything...\\"to the value of children:\\"On every formal visit a child ought to be of the party, by way of provision for discourse. In the present case it took up ten minutes to determine whether the boy were most like his father or mother, and in what particular he resembled either, for of course every body differed, and every body was astonished at the opinion of others.\\"Austen constructs a tantalising slaughterhouse of a book, inside which she adorns her hooks with a dazzling array of conceited, deceitful and shameless characters, few of whom escape her witty blade. All this however is not to say the novel is bereft of heart. As the title suggests, the central theme is the conflict and reconciliation between heart and mind, exemplified respectively in Marianne and Elinor, both of whom are endearing characters in their own ways, despite their flaws. It is this respect, no matter how faint, that Austen shows her characters that elevates the story above a satirical denunciation of her society and allows the reader to lose themselves in her narrative and become attached to her players.The overall flaw for me, were the happy endings handed out like charity flyers, though the fact that everybody gets one - from her most hated of villains to the most saintly of maidens, somewhat tempers the sacchariferousness. Sense and Sensibility was an utter pleasure to read - and surprisingly enjoyable when read side by side with Game of Thrones Book 3 - A Storm of Swords. When the clumsy fantasy writing made me cringe too much I could switch back to the succulent eloquence of Austen, and when sitting around in parlours reading the subtext behind eyebrow lifts became a little tedious, I could flip back to sex and bloodshed. Unfortunately due to the size differences in the books, I was only 44% of the way into Game of Thrones when I finished Sense and Sensibility and was forced to endure another six hundred pages of undiluted lumbering nerd prose."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"had not read this book since school days , its a joy to read , and one gets a real feel for the times when women were dependent on their men folk , not allowed to own property in their own right , and a good marriage was the aim"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Love Jane Austin. Hard to put the book down even on rereading it. I only wish she had written more. I love reading on Kindle so I can look up unfamiliar and archaic words. It makes it all the more pleasurable."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"In Sense and Sensible the storyline dwells on the two elder sisters of the Dashwood family, Elinor and Mariane. Elinor is always in control of her emotions and is governed primarily by prudence (sense). Her younger sister, Marianne, is an emotional whirlwind whose sensibilities dictate that those who do not evidence wholly encompassing emotions are without them entirely. As in Pride &amp; Prejudice, the family home of the Dashwoods has been willed to another member of the family not in the immediate nuclear family. In Pride &amp; Prejudice, the home was entailed to Mr. Collins, a distant cousin. Where there was only an overshadowing of the loss of the estate in that book, in Sense &amp; Sensibility, the house is actually lost to the half brother whose wife, a Ferrar, not only talks her husband out of the generous support to his half sisters that he promised (albeit vaguely) his dying father but makes life in general unpleasant for the Dashwood ladies until they find a situation with a cousin, John Middleton. Part of the unpleasantness surrounds an apparent but unprofessed affection of her brother, Edward Ferrars, for the eldest Dashwood, Elinor.It would seem that the move has quashed the supposed attraction, leaving Elinor attempting to contain her disappointment. Marianne meanwhile strikes up an intense relationship with equally extroverted Willoughby. When Willoughby suddenly disappears, the two girls come together to support each other emotionally through a storm of discoveries, pleasant and unpleasant.Sense and Sensibility develops into its own independent storyline after many similarities with Pride &amp; Prejudice. Although this novel holds its own and is an enjoyable book, I still feel that Pride &amp; Prejudice is its superior in pace, story line and general feel. Sense came out well before Pride and it almost feels that the same idea is being worked out in both - an idea that got clearer and was better communicated in Pride. Pride had a much more natural (believable) feeling to the events where Sense does require a little suspension of disbelief in some of the contrivances to get to a happy ending (specifically referring to the actions of Robert Ferrar). If you liked Pride and want more Austen, this is your book. If you are choosing between the two, choose Pride ... than come back for this one."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Since enough people have reviewed the novel's plot itself, I'm writing instead about the formatting of this particular (Kindle) version of the book. I liked the illustrations, though they came only at the beginning of each chapter. There definitely could have been more. As to this version's formatting, it was pretty bad. Line's were frequently unintentionally cut off, making the dialogue difficult to read. Also, as a stickler for grammar, I was frustrated with the mistakes in the book, which I believe are due to the publisher's mistakes (I've read other versions and have never noticed it). For example, words are misspelled and punctuation is missing - very annoying. I realize this version only cost me 99 cents, but I was still aggravated while reading."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Although SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is not Jane Austen's best novel, it is nonetheless a major novel, with the author's then-young talent in full display. Its publication in 1811 marked Austen as a huge literary talent, and its significance reverberates even today as contemporary readers re-discover the works of this author so adept at uncovering the foibles of nineteenth century aristocracy.The title refers to the two eldest Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, one of whom (Elinor) embraces practicality and restraint while the other (Marianne) gives her whole heart to every endeavor. When the Dashwoods - mother Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor, Marianne, and youngest sister Margaret - are sent, almost impoverished, to a small cottage in Devonshire after the death of their father and the machinations of their brother's wife, they accept their new circumstances with as much cheer as they can muster even though their brother and his wife have taken over the family estate and fortune. Their characters, albeit wildly different in their approaches to life, are impeccably honest and intelligent - and their suitors take notice. Elinor falls in love with the shy, awkward Edward, while Marianne's affections are lavished on the dashing hunter Willoughby. As in all Austen's books, love and marriage don't come easily, as affections aren't always returned and social jockeying sometimes takes precedence to true love. In an interestingly twist, the end of this novel brings into question which sister represents which part of the title.SENSE AND SENSIBILITY only hints at the social skewering Austen would use to such great effect in her later novels, and the humor here is only occasional and slight, as this novel adopts a generally serious tone. Parody is largely limited to the gossipy Mrs. Jenkins, who jumps to wild conclusions about situations she knows nothing about. Though arranged marriage and true love figure prominently in all of Austen's novels, this novel focuses almost exclusivity on the prospects of the two main characters, making it less complex than the novels that followed. Reserved Elinor and exuberant Marianne are expertly drawn, with Edward, Willoughby, and Colonel Brandon (whose lovesick hopes for Marianne are dashed again and again) also engaging creations. Except for the first page or two where the circumstances of the Dashwoods are set up through a series of deaths and relations, possibly causing some confusion, this novel is exceedingly easy to follow for contemporary readers.This novel is an excellent introduction to Jane Austen's works because of its relative simplicity (though readers should not dismiss it as simple) and the use of typical themes and social situations. Book clubs and students might want to explore the influence of money on nineteenth century British society as well as the meaning of the title as it applies to both the sisters and the other characters. It is also interesting to note both the helplessness and the extraordinary power of women in different circumstances.Even though this is not Austen's best novel, I could not take away a single star because it is such a delightful book. I highly recommend this novel for all readers. -- Debbie Lee Wesselmann"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"This is my second Kindle purchase of S&S.

I'm not sure why, but I was worried that it might be a bit dry. I needn't have been concerned, as the wit and story both sparkle from the first few pages and it only gets better as it goes along.The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness. Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility). How these two interact with the world, each other, as well as family and friends makes up the bulk of the book. They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were. The supporting characters are very engaging and I found myself rooting for most of them, even a couple who are not entirely good. There are a few characters (e.g. Mrs. Jenkins) who are caricatures meant to parody some of the social norms of the day but even she has some depth to her and is likeable.I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending. I did think that a bit more attention could have been paid to Marianne at the end but in many respects Elinor is more the central character so it is perhaps fitting that the climax focuses more on her.In sum, this is an excellent novel and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"SENSE AND SENSIBILITY chronicles the young lives of two sisters, spirited Marianne and the more stable Elinor. After being driven away from home by their step-brother and his wife, the Dashwood family (Mrs. Dashwood, Marianne, Elinor, and younger sister Margaret) settles down in a small cottage in the countryside.Each sister proceeds to fall in love in her unique way: Elinor quietly and seriously loves somewhat-awkward Edward, while Marianne impetuously and passionately gives her heart to the dashing Willoughby. As with most of Austen's works, disparity in social class and inconsistencies in personality cause the lovers turmoil.Austen uses some of the satirical techniques that are so prevalent of her other works. While not as funny as her other satires, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY presents some characters' absurdities quite well.When I read this at the age of 14 or so, I did not enjoy it nearly as much. Older readers will like the subtle humor that Austen invariably includes in her work.Overall, a good introduction to the classic work of Jane Austen."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Austen's S&S follows the same line of experience that all of her other books seem to follow, down to the family of sisters and the problems of proper behavior and good connections. But like a truly masterful artist, she can write, essentially, the same story over and over again and still have it be exciting and interesting for all readers.

Both experience love, heartache, and eventual happiness in marriage, and both have their beliefs and value systems tested. A host of memorable, comic minor characters combine with the principal heroines and heroes to develop a tale that is both lively and thought provoking, humorous and psychologically astute. Anyone who has ever struggled with conflicts between spontaneity and caution, heart and head, can identify with the central characters of this novel.This edition of &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; includes a number of helpful supplementary materials that enhance the reader's understanding and appreciation of the novel. Excerpts from contemporary texts clarify the historical context of the terms \\"sense\\" and \\"sensibility.\\" Among the works included are selections from Johann Wolfgang von Goethe's &quot;The Sorrows of Young Werther,&quot; a classic example of the novel of sensibility, and Maria Edgeworth's &quot;Letters of Julia and Caroline,&quot; an earlier novel of contrasting female characters, in this case two friends, one of whom is sensible and the other romantic and impractical. The edition also includes the whole of Jane Austen's &quot;Love and Freindship&quot; (sic), a hilarious parody of sentimental fiction written when Austen was fourteen. Besides background materials, the volume includes four essays from recent critics that represent a range of different interpretations of the novel.Finally, the introduction provides useful biographical and historical information and outlines a variety of critical approaches to the novel: some critics believe Elinor is clearly the favored sister and the sense she embodies the preferred value system; some critics by contrast believe the novel either consciously or unconsciously betrays sympathy for Marianne and the sensibility she represents; and other critics believe the novel advocates a middle ground between sense and sensibility, according to which both sisters need to abandon aspects of their initial beliefs and adopt attitudes and behaviors associated with the other sibling. &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; has sometimes been criticized for being too didactic and formulaic, but those who read the novel along with the various background, critical, and introductory essays in this volume should discover a work that is richly complex, ambiguous, and many-sided in its exploration of the competing values of emotion and reason, spontaneity and restraint, and personal fulfillment versus duty to others."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" was the first Jane Austen novel to achieve publication. Its reception was just sufficient to open the way for the publication of more of her novels, and the next to be published was \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". It has been a matter of speculation ever since whether, if nothing other than \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" had been published, Jane Austen would be remembered today.Those who believe this novel would not have sustained her reputation offer several reasons. They cite a lack of comic characters, a lack of male characters who excite interest or stimulate the imagination, an overabundance of unmemorable minor characters, and prose that is sometimes too heavily overworked.Those who believe this novel could alone preserve Jane Austen's fame produce different arguments. They cite the depiction of the two sisters Elinor and Marianne and their approximation to the concepts of sense and sensibility, the famous passage near the beginning in which the wife of John Dashwood, the sisters' half brother, pares down the deathbed promise her husband made to his father to provide financial support to John's half-sisters, and to Jane Austen's detached but involved, good-humored but stern narrative stance.Having re-read the novel recently for the umpteenth time, I could see the merit in all these arguments. Nevertheless the reading experience held me enthralled. Accounting for this is difficult. I read hundreds of pages in which women talk about men. I read of a world where every quality, every characteristic, every manner is put in little boxes, clearly labeled, and arranged in order from desirable to base. These things do not usually appeal to me. Ultimately, I believe it is Jane Austen the storyteller that casts the spell. My sense and sensibility are alike spellbound.Readers who like to refer to film or television adaptations to help their reading of the classics, will benefit from seeing a 1995 version of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" adapted, scripted and starring the English actress Emma Thompson."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Even though it has been two hundred years since the world was first introduced to sisters Marianne and Elinor Dashwood's financial, social and romantic trials, their story remains for me, as fresh and vibrant as any contemporary story you might read of, experience yourself, or hear tell tale of today. I give full credit, of course, to Jane Austen. Her understanding of human nature and how to craft emotions and characters into an engaging story remains unparalleled. Add to that a delightful twelve hour and forty-three minute reading by the accomplished British actress Juliet Stevenson's polished interpretation of memorable personalities and you are primed for unsurpassed entertainment. Here is a brief description from the publisher:\\"When Mrs. Dashwood is forced by an avaricious daughter-in-law to leave the family home in Sussex, she takes her three daughters to live in a modest cottage in Devon. For Elinor, the eldest daughter, the move means a painful separation from the man she loves, but her sister Marianne finds in Devon the romance and excitement which she longs for. The contrasting fortunes and temperaments of the two girls as they struggle to cope in their different ways with the cruel events which fate has in store for them are portrayed by Jane Austen with her usual irony, humor and profound sensibility.\\"It is amazing to think that SENSE AND SENSIBILITY was Jane Austen's first published novel. As a debut author she showed incredible understanding of characterization and plot development. Many of the personalities contained in this novel remain the most memorable for me of her entire canon. The affability of Sir John Middleton, the persistent meddling of Mrs. Jennings, the droll indifference of Mr. Palmer and the malleable weakness of Mr. John Dashwood are played against the narrow greed of the unscrupulous Fanny Dashwood and her officious, spiteful mother Mrs. Ferrars. These secondary characters really make our heroes and villains shine, and withstanding the two heroines Elinor and Marianne, it is amusing to see how Austen plays with our emotions in guessing who the heroes will be and how the morality will play out. SENSE AND SENSIBILITY does have a few plot wholes and loose coincidences that readers will be raising eyebrows over, but it remains a novel wholly entrenched in the passionate joys of youthful love and emotional loss, cruel social snobbery and biting social reproof as relevant today as it was in 1811.Laurel Ann, Austenprose"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Ultimately, I enjoyed this book, but it took quite a long time to get into it. I found myself rereading many paragraphs, as I really needed full concentration for this one. I will say that the book did keep me guessing throughout. Though I knew that things would turn out well for the heroines, I truly did not know what was going to happen until the very end."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Sense and Sensibility was Austen's first published novel and the third of hers I read. I must admit, I did not like it very much at first. I found it too somber compared to some of her other works. I liked Elinor well enough, but Marianne annoyed me to no end. The men weren't that great either. Willoughby was doubtless a scoundrel, Colonel Brandon was boring, and Edward was a spineless wimp. That's not to say I did not like the book, far from it. Just in comparison to other Austen novels it didn't hold up.All that changed on my last rereading this year. It was such a surprise to see all the humor in the book! How did I not notice before? Yes, it does deal with some dark subjects but there are more than enough funny moments to go around. Mrs. Jennings stands out in particular, especially the scene where she overhears bits of Colonel Brandon and Elinor's conversation. Brandon is of course, telling Elinor he intends to give Edward the living at Delaford. But Mrs. Jennings, not wishing to \\"eavesdrop\\", can't hear everything and jumps to other conclusions. Another funny scene is a man taking forever to pick out a particular toothpick case in a shop, who turns out to be none other than Robert Ferrars. And I must not forget to mention Elinor! Anyone who imagines her as all prim and proper from the movies should take a closer look at the book- she is full of snark! It made me love her even more.My opinions on the men changed as well. Not Willoughby, of course. But on closer reading one notices that Colonel Brandon, while he may seem \\"stuffy\\" is actually quite the romantic. And Edward really is an honorable man. Yes, you all want him to just dump Lucy for Elinor but he felt he was actually doing the right thing by Lucy in keeping his promise to her. And there was the fact that she could have sued him for breaking the engagement...And he's not really so dull either. I noticed he even teased Marianne about Willoughby at one point. He did have some personality after all!So, all in all, the male characters are not my favorite of Austen's heroes, but I do appreciate them a great deal more. Marianne does still annoy me at the beginning but I feel for her more now, and admire how she realizes the error of her ways in letting her sensibilities take over all the time. The relationship between Elinor and Marianne is really well-written, more the focus than either of the romances. Austen's writing skills were not quite to the level of sophistication that she would achieve with her later works like Persuasion, but still pretty darn good! So, if you already love the book, good for you. If you don't, I recommend rereading and keeping in mind the things I noted in this review. I hope you'll learn to love it as I have."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"SPOILERS FOLLOWJane Austen\\"s \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" tells the story of the Dashwood Sisters, Marianne and Elinor, imbuing the siblings with respective liberal and conservative worldviews. The book is at its absolute strongest delivering illuminating commentary that, in some ways, validates the viewpoints of each sister.The sisters are introduced into society, receiving visits from chiefly the courtly but shy Edward Ferrars, the mysterious Willoughby, and the wise Colonel Brandon. Each of these men reflect on the emotional lives of the sisters, mirroring hopes, potential loves, foolish anticipation and vanity. In the two sisters, Ms. Austen creates a fantastic representation of competing and supportive sisterly, as well as sibling, complexity.A major complaint is that the book feels very creatively stifled, stifled in the lives of the women as well as in the events of true import in the story. In some ways, it begins and ends in the drawing room, and never ventures much to other topics which would be more all-encompassing. It's possible that Ms. Austen is making a sweeping societal statement about the proscribed lives of Englishwomen in her time. However, the storytelling features cast a general slowness over the plotline that precludes much forward momentum."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Believe it or not I had never read this book.

Sisters Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, left with little income following the death of their father, go to live with some distant relations and meet men they wish to engage. However, there are complications, as both seem to be quite unsuitable.I was continually struck by the eloquence with which this book is written and the gracious manner in which the primary characters endeavored to conduct themselves. Did people really speak to each other that way in that era? How interesting that even one described as \`illiterate' can issue such a statement as \\"I am sure you think me very strange, for enquiring about her in sucha way, but perhaps there may be reasons--I wish I might venture; but however I hope you will do me the justice of believing that I do not mean to beimpertinent.\\" The articulacy of the text was almost confusing at first because the poor standards by which most modern authors express themselves is what I am used to reading and speaking. However, that difficulty was soon overcome, and I found _myself_ both speaking and writing with greater vocabulary and altered cadence.I was also surprised that I could find a tale consisting mostly of the conversations between the idle members of British society so suspenseful. I found myself invested in the characters and their eventual happiness so much that I was quite eager to turn the page.Highly recommended. Compared to this, the romantic tales of the 21st century are vulgar and coarse."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women.

Set in England's Regency period, the story revolves around the Dashwood sisters and their love interests. The difference with this edition is the inclusion of notes on the side relating geographic info, historic tidbits, info about the movies based on the book, theological reflections and the opinions of the editors about the story and characters.At first, I was put off by the constant interruption of the side notes. I grew to appreciate mainly the historical and geographical information, but occasionally felt irked by the opinion flavored notes. I think if I were choosing between a notated or un-notated novel, I'd choose the latter. Nevertheless, any Jane Austen book is well worth reading.

Her books make me laugh, sometimes make me cry, but always leave me with a smile.Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen is the story of two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood; two girls raised well, but reduced to poverty at the death of their father. They each have met the man they want to marry, and are both convinced that the young men feel the same. Everything seems to be going along smoothly...or does it? Both of their romances collapse, and they are left to deal with them sensibly. However, both stories end surprisingly, giving each girl her happy, although not necessarily expected, ending.The copy of Sense and Sensibility I read was the Insight Edition by Bethany House Publishers...in addition to the original classic story, they have added footnotes throughout the book, explaining details about the culture and history, the films based on the book, Jane Austen herself, etc. I found them to make the book even more interesting, even though I already enjoyed the story for itself. Also, in the back of the book, they have added several \\"questions for conversations,\\" which seem like they would especially help younger readers analyze the story better.If you're looking for a classic romance, this would be a good read for a lazy summer afternoon.(Bethany House Publishers provided me with a copy of Sense and Sensibility - Insight Edition in exchange for this review)"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Sense and Sensibility is the classic tale of Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, two sisters who share a remarkable bond of love despite their differences. Marianne is given to emotionalism; Elinor is refined and self-controlled. Both women indulge in unhealthy extremes of these mindsets throughout the story and yet they find that they are in many ways alike as they walk through life and search for love.Jane Austen is one of my favorite historical authors. Her characters are real and I found that I could identify with Marianne especially. The only thing I found to be questionable was the presence of Margaret. She was rarely present and did not seem to contribute much to the story.The version of this book that I read was very insightful. Throughout the story there were notes in the side margin that explained certain words that may have been unfamiliar to some readers. The notes also mentioned parallels between Jane's life and the lives of her characters. Having seen the 1995 version of the movie, I had some expectations as to what the book would be like. As with most films that are based on books, I found that I enjoyed the book more than the movie simply because the book gives so much more depth to the characters and their situations."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"From BethanyHouse, I received a copy of Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility Insight Edition.

Every time I begin, I get so sleepy I have to take a nap. I loved the movie (with Hugh Grant), so I'm just not sure what's up with me.

This book also includes questions at the end for discussion."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"On the 27th January, 1817 Jane Austen began work on a novel that is now known as SANDITON. It was never completed. Her declining health robbed her of what she dearly loved most, writing, and on the 18th of March 1817 after penning 22,000 words she wrote the last lines of chapter twelve and put down her pen. Four months later at age 41 she would succumb to what is generally believed to have been Addison's disease.Set in the emerging seaside village of Sanditon on the Sussex coast we are introduced to a large cast of characters dominated by the two minions of the community: Mr. Parker a local landowner with grand designs of turning a fishing village into a fashionable watering place offering the therapeutic or curative benefits of sea-bathing and his partner Lady Denham, the local great lady who has \\"a shrewd eye & self satisfying air\\" and cares little about the community and only her pocketbook.The story unfolds from the perspective of Charlotte Heywood, a young lady experiencing her first trip away from her family as a guest of Mr. and Mrs. Parker. Sanditon is populated by a comical ensemble of residents and visitors who upon Charlotte's first acquaintance are altogether different than they later appear. Lady Denham's nephew Sir Edward Denham is handsome, amiable and titled but is prone to long inflated speeches in the most pompous and affected style in an attempt to reinforce his own notion that he is a romantic character born to seduce women \\"quite in the line of Lovelaces.\\" (Lovelace refers to the villain Robert Lovelace in Samuel Richardson's 1748 novel CLARISSA who rapes and ruins the young heroine.) He has designs upon Lady Denham's companion Clara Brereton who he shall either woo with affection or carry off. Clara is a poor relation of Lady Denham's who is maneuvering to be her heir and in direct competition with Sir Edward for her favor.Also sharing the spotlight is Mr. Parker and his four siblings, three of whom Charlotte is told are sad invalids, but after their arrival talk a great deal about their maladies but exhibit little consequence of their afflictions. Here we see Austen at her comedic height characterizing the foibles of those who attach illness as an identity and hypochondria as their religion. The one bright light of hope in the novel is Mr. Parker's brother Sidney who we know of only through letters and others descriptions. He may be the only character besides Charlotte who has the potential to set things in balance with his sense of humor and honest opinions. Sadly he is destined to remain the mystery hero of Austen's oeuvre. Add to that a lineup a nest of plot ironies to raise an eyebrow at business speculation and hypochondria, and a sharp jab at the effluvia of novels and poetry and you have a narrative that whizzes along until an abrupt halt just when we are hooked.The uncompleted novel is a great loss to literature but also to the characters who after a bright and comical beginning are left with uncertain futures. What does remain is more than a novelty of Austenalia. SANDITON'S levity despite the author's failing health when it was written is quite remarkable. On first reading I thought it quite energetic and satirical, similar to the burlesque humor of Austen's NORTHANGER ABBEY. I then put it aside and did not reflect on it further. My second reading after several years brought an entirely new reaction. Austen has taken a new and fresh direction from her usual three or four families in a country village and sets her novel not about an individuals struggle but an entire community. Money is still the fuel that powers the plot, but her physical descriptions of the landscape and town are entirely new in her cannon foreshadowing what may have been an evolution in her style. SANDITON is a gem that no Austen enthusiast should miss.Laurel Ann, Austenprose"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Jane Austen's first published novel, Sense and Sensibility, tells a timeless tale of two sisters search for true love and the heartbreaking circumstances they endure along the way. Bethany House's new annotated version of this classic offers readers historical and cultural details about England in the early 1800s, facts about Austen's life, references about films based on the novel, themes of faith, and comments about the novel's characters and plot.Unlike many editions of this novel, Bethany House's version contains a foreword of only two pages and does not give readers a detailed, scholarly analysis of the novel and Austen's life. Instead, this book provides facts and tidbits of information on the pages' margins. I found this edition simple to navigate and many of the notes offered interesting and helpful information to better understand the story. Another unique feature of this version are the scriptural and moral reflections sprinkled throughout the book. The editors often quote verses from Proverbs.I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Jane Austen classics and does not need a detailed introduction about the story and the author's life.Note: I received a complimentary copy of this book from the publisher for the purpose of reviewing it."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I fell in love with this story the day I saw the movie.

I have to say that I had a very difficult time getting through that book. I find it extremely slow reading on inane subjects. But I am obviously in the minority with that opinion. I expected wonderful stories like Louisa May Alcott's books, but then maybe I am listening with the wrong \\"ear\\". Maybe I was suppose to listen to the sound of the words like a James Joyce novel. I've read a lot of period novels written in that time and place, so it's not a lack of familiarity with the era or the language.I will say that it shows a very real contrast between the use of emotion controlled by intellect vs. total emotional immersion in the subject of romance."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Jane Austen is remembered fondly for her warmly written romantic comedies. The comedy is subtle and difficult to spot for the untrained reader; in contrast the romance is thickly spready throughout her books, often too easily spotted.Sense and Sensibility was Austen's first published work. It is not her most successful novel. By the time Emma was written, Austen was a more successful author. Emma is funnier than Sense and Sensibility; it also posesses a more realistic romance. However, there are positive traits of her style present in Sense and Sensibility.Sensibility, easily slots into the genre of Romance. It concerns two sisters, unfortunately deprived of their family inheritance, and their search for love. One sister, Elinor, is sensible, while her younger sister, Marianne, is a passionate and silly romantic. Austen, in fact admires both her leading ladies contrasting traits, but it is easier to sympathise with Elinor. She puts up with a lot of torment in the novel but never allows herself to break down, unlike Marianne who almost lets a lost love end her life.Happily, there is a trace of comedy running through the book. As usual, the principal humour comes from the characters (the delightfully droll Mr Palmer), but Austen herself has fun with her narrative and enjoys creating set-ups to confuse both the reader and the characters. There is always an element of mystery in her novels. Who will end up with who? And this heightens the enjoyment of the novel.Sense and Sensibility has a lot to offer it. It is a primitive work from a great writer. It has hampered by the ridiculously happy ending. Marianne and the Colonel should never have matched. There is a gloss of reality (often lacking in the book), however when we find out that Willoughby (the bad guy) actually ends up living a happy life. It is a rarity in Jane Austen's novels that the villian (if you can call it a villian) of the piece finishes the novel in a merry vein.I wish I could tell you it was fantastic or indeed awful but I share Elinor's traits, in that I'm not one for exaggerated emotion. It's good but not great."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Personally, I think that Sense and Senibility was a good book, but lacks the wit that was constantly present in Pride and Predjudice.While there was conflict in Sense and Sensibility (both in the sister's jealousy and the the scorn from their lovers later), Austen didn't allow her characters to really address the conflict directly. (For example, why didn't Willoughby explain himself to Marianne, as opposed to using Elinor as a go-between?)While this may be the subtle temper which reflects Austen's style, it also makes it more difficult for the reader to discern any true sense of feeling.The plot is &quot;okay&quot; - boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love, boy scorns girl. In Sense and Sensibility, it's done twice, in parallel. The only difference between one and the other is how each girl copes with it. But, from reading several of Austen's books, I've found that plot development wasn't the author's strong suit.Jane Austen's real strength lies in character development. Her major characters are well developed and dynamic. An interesting aspect of Sense and Sensibility is how Elinor, the logical and practical sister became more emotional, while the ever-feeling Marianne developed a more practical view of her situation by the end of the book.This isn't one I would recommend for folks that have never read Jane Austen before (read Pride and Predjudice first), but it is a book I would recommend it to anybody who likes Jane Austen's style."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I had to read this book for my college novel course. It hooked me on Jane Austen. I am currently reading Persuasions, which is the last book I have to read to have finished all her books! And then I can go around showing off how cultured and well-read I am. Blah blah blah.Anyway, this book has a really great heroine, Elinor, who is perhaps my favorite heroine because she's so much like me, introspective and cautious, and carefully controlled. Her sister Marianne, who is said to be the \`life of the novel' and \`more likeable', is actually a silly, foolishly romantic girl who is passionate and loving. Sure, you love her, but you don't really like her (at least I didn't) and you certainly don't respect her. Elinor however, earns your respect and admiration for her steady character and sense. If you don't know, \`sensibility' is the opposite of sense, it means emotionality and imprudence etc. (I learned that in college!!!) It isn't a common word nowadays, so I thought I'd let you in on the plot. Elinor is sense, Marianne sensibility, and you should be more like Elinor etc. It's a story with a moral, you see, like Pride and Prejudice (Elizabeth is prejudice and Mr. Darcy pride).The mother, Mrs. Dashwood, is really weird; she isn't always after her daughters to marry well. She is looking for romance as much as her girls are, as opposed to Mrs. Burton from Pride and Prejudice, who rejoices even when her daughter marries a good for nothing, simply because she's married. It was a good book, with surprising and unexpected plot twists that are pretty complicated, plus loveable characters and a good romance. It almost had me in tears at the end which is a miracle because I never cry, and almost never am moved to tears by a book or movie. Great book, try it out!!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Anyone who gives this book a bad review has no class. Jane Austen is one of the most celebrated writers in history.

The illustrations in this edition are nice, but the story is long and tedious reading."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"When Mr. Dashwood dies, the family estate passes to his son, John. The widowed Mrs. Dashwood and her three daughters are left homeless and with little money. A kind relative offers to rent them a small cottage on his property.The two eldest Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, find both romance and heartbreak in their new home. Elinor is sensible and restrained, so that even when she falls in love with Edward, she keeps her feelings to herself because she knows that marriage is not a possibility. She has no money for a dowry.Marianne, on the other hand, wears her heart on her sleeve. When she falls in love with handsome playboy Mr. Willoughby, she doesn't care who knows about it.Both sisters experience heartbreak before they find love and happiness."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Taking place in Norland, England, in 1811, Jane Austen astounds her wide audience with yet another uplifting and eye-opening novel. Sense and Sensibility explores the life of the Dashwood family, consisting of the new widow Mrs. Dashwood and her two daughters, the composed and affectionate Elinor along with the sensible and spontaneous Marianne. Inheriting all of his father's money, John Dashwood visits his sister Mrs. Dashwood and gives the three devastated ladies a good share of his inherited money. During the visit, John Dashwood's wife, fanny, brings along her sensible older brother, Edward Ferrars, who develops a very close relationship with Elinor Dashwood. Although they are given a hard time by Fanny, Mrs. Dashwood, and the later promiscuous old friend Lucy Steele, Elinor and Edward establish and progress their love throughout the entire novel. As their love grows, Austen compares and contrasts the trait of sensibility, possessed by Marianne, and the trait of sense, possessed by Elinor. She does this through the two sisters' interactions with their significant others.Just like almost all of Jane Austen's preceding novels, Sense and Sensibility dives into the themes of love and judgment. The reader learns how the characters in the novel become blind when they are in love, and the effect this has on their judgment.Although it is a great read, I do not recommend it to just anybody. Readers must stay attentive to the multiple characters that are introduced throughout the novel; readers must also have strong patience because the novel is written with the old English dialect of the early 1800's. This is one of Jane Austen's best novels, in my opinion. In her novel Mansfield Park, she merely spends the whole novel demonstrating the progression of love in a New England town. In Sense and Sensibility, however, not only is the reader able to explore the development of love in a relationship between two people, but also the progression of individual character qualities, such as those of Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. In totality, this novel is one of Jane Austen's best works."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Once criticised as being \\"least interesting\\" of Auten's works, I entirely disagree. Sense & Sensibility is one of my favourites, if not favourite Austen novel. Perhaps not as \\"light, and bright, and sparkling\\" as Pride & Prejudice, it is still a wonderful and enjoyable read, and definitely not as dense as Mansfield Park. Personally, I could not put this book down, when usually with Austen I read a chapter or two a day.The dual heroines is one of the most interesting literary techniques here, interlaced with the usual infuriating members of society (John and Fanny, Lucy Steele), silly women (Charlotte Palmer) and men (Robert Ferrars).My only criticism of the plot would be the somewhat rushed ending, but the story goes through regular \\"ups and downs\\" and enough changes of scenery to keep interest.I often prefer the Penguin Classics versions of the Austen novels. They are easy to carry around and have comprehensive footnotes as well as interesting and thought-provoking introductions and appendices. In this version I prefer the original introduction by Tony Tanner, but the introduction by Ros Ballaster is interesting in its discussion of the opposing themes of the novel i.e. first and second attachments, scream and screen, and of course, sense and sensibility.My only criticism of the Penguin Classics version is the cover art, which I don't feel encompasses the true characters of Elinor and Marianne. While I appreciate the use of 19th century art on the Penguin Classics covers, I never feel that they truly embody the character (except for maybe sickly Fanny Price). As a side note, I do like the cover art of theSense and Sensibility (Oxford World's Classics)edition.In ending, if you are an Austen fan, and haven't read this, you must. Furthermore, if you are considering Austen I would recommend either Sense & Sensibility or Pride & Prejudice as first reads. In any case, the Penguin Classics version will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, guided respectively by rational sense and passionate sensibility, navigate love and heartbreak together in their own inimitable styles. The plot is simple and straightforward, with only a couple of surprising twists. This is good, though, serving only to clear the stage of contrivances and to give plenty of room for the entertaining and memorable characters to play out their schemes, hopes, follies, and humanity. It's this latter quality that breathes life and interest into characters who could in less capable hands have been reduced to paper-thin archetypes. In Jane's hands, her characters feel like someone you might still meet in a corner of England that time forgot."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I love the narrator, I love her accent. It took me a little longer to figure out the whole story since I didn't catch her for the most part. But I think it is not uncommon for a foreigner to find some difficulties in getting used to her accent.I like British accent although sometimes I cannot understand them."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Okay, I wrote a review on this novel about 4 days ago, and I don't think it's going to show up on here, so I'll give it another try.I can't help but love Jane Austen. She is my guilty pleasure read, like a Jackie Collins of the early 19th century because her novels are just drenched in drama and scandal. They are not really a thinking man's novel, just fun stories to read. I also enjoy the romance aspects of her novels because they are classy, not like the trash smut you read in today's modern \\"romance\\" stories. I feel almost uncomfortable and embarrassed when I read a modern romance story. Well anyhow, when it comes to drama and scandal, Sense and Sensibility does not disappoint. When you commit to the story, it really takes you in. I really enjoyed the protagonist, Elinor, but I was unhappy with Austen's Marianne character. It seems as if Austen could truly identify with Elinor because she did a great job developing her character as level-headed, proud, and classy. Perhaps she took a little Elinor from herself? Now, in the beginning of the novel you get drawn in by Marianne. She commands a good third of the book with her story and her character starts off well developed. You get a true feeling for her impetuousness. She is emotional, passionate, wears her heart on her sleeve. The novel is so interesting until the end. The end completely disappoints. Now I don't know if Austen became uninspired at the end of the novel or just didn't know how to end it better, but it falls completely flat. Like I mentioned before, you get interested in this Marianne character and you know how she is, but then at the end she decides one day to become like Elinor?! Just like that?! An impetuous person like Marianne would not and could not do a 180 with their mannerisms. Then, Austen does no justice to Marianne by having her marry at the end of the novel. It is just so dubious it doesn't make sense. Austen also wraps up all the scandal and drama in almost 3 pages. How convenient! That was just bogus to me. But the rest of the story is so good I would still recommend this, especially to Austen fans. If I were to make a recommendation to a new Austen reader, I would recommend Pride and Prejudice over Sense and Sensibility. It is more concise and it is a shorter novel."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"This book, like her other books transports me back to that time and place so it feels as though I am a part of that moment in time."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"For the ladies can you imagine a world in which you have no career options except that of being a wife, a world in which everything depends upon how much money you have, and if you're at a loss for lucre, then you'd better marry into some moolah! You don't do anything except go to dances, mooch off richer relatives, and hope you marry somebody before you become a spinster! If you're a man, it's pretty much the same thing, except your career path is more open. You can do a lot if you have money, but like most of the male characters in Sense and Sensibility, why bother?! You got a rich relative to pay your way through life! Just spend your time hunting, whether it be game or a woman, especially a rich woman, if you're a debauched ex-noble who's lost his fortune in disreputable consumerism. All these examples pretty much sum up the world of Jane Austen as portrayed in Sense and Sensibility.Three sisters, Elinor, Marianne, and Margaret...Well, let's forget about Margaret, since she's basically a non-character in the book....Well, 2 sisters, Elinor and Marianne are on the prowl for a husband, a well-off husband, since their father has died and left control of his estate to their half-brother, who happens to be married to an uppity and greedy wench of a woman who cuts them out of most of their dead father's money and land. So the sisters and their mother are \\"banished\\" to a charming cottage in the English countryside. Oh, the horror of it, while a lot of England working class and poor were just lucky to find something to eat for dinner in that time period. Elinor is the common sense sister and hopes that Edward loves her, but she can never figure out what his feelings for her are. But she's not going to do anything rash to find out. Just keep a cool head Elinor. Marianne is the exact opposite, youthful, idealistic, passionate, and brash, and falls for the first guy that satisfies her sense of the dashing Byronic hero, even if he might be a cad!I don't know, something about this book rubbed me wrong, even though I thought it was pretty good. All of the characters just seem like parasitic bums, even if they are psuedo-aristocrats. They're lazy, judgemental, and obssessed with appearances, even though they hardly ever have the courage to look under those appearances to see the truth. They really have no activity in their brains. Like animals they are only seeking comfort and security, nothing beyond the most basic of human needs. There is no aspiration to anything. Well, except aquiring money. At some points in the book you wish all of these people had been in France during the Reign of Terror. Then they would have found out their real priorities. I guess, while I could understand the problems of the girls, I didn't sympathize with them. While the spoon they were born with was not silver, at least they had A spoon. It was left to Dickens and Balzac to see how the other half lived. To me, the book's only redeeming value besides Austen's excellent and entertaining style, was to show just how far women have come in the past 200 years, and how lucky they are for being born in the 21st century instead of the 18th!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Sense and Sensibility is a pretty slow book. I felt as if I had to wait and wait for something interesting to happen. When something did happen, I found it to be pretty predictable. I think that some parts of this old book have been used in other films. I know I am not all the sudden good at predicting what happens in stories. I think it was just this book. I was confused in the beginning of this book because I spent most of the time trying to get all the Dashwood people straight. After I became familiar with the characters, I started working on the plot. I have to say that the plot was a bit uninteresting at times. When it was interesting, and not predictable for me, I really enjoyed it a lot. There were several surprises in the book. I enjoyed how tricky the plot was. Toward the end of the story I began wondering how the plot was going to wrap itself up. The ending of the book was quite unexpected for me.One of the things that I liked best about this book was that it was so tricky. Once I thought the movie was going to end a certain way, but I was immediately proven wrong. I think this happened at least five times. The bulk of the story may have been a little dry, but with all of the twists in the plot of Sense and Sensibility, I have to say I was entertained. One of the lower parts of this book would have to be the ending. It seemed as if in the space of about three minutes everyone went from melancholy, to perfectly content with their lives.Overall, I have to say that I enjoyed this book. Most Austen fans do not praise this as her best book. Most of them overlook disliking the book because it was Austen's first book. I cant be to sure because I have never read any other Austen books. However, after reading Sense and Sensibility, I am definitely going to dig in to another Austen book really soon."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Austen's &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot;, I read every page with sheer delight. Although one of Austen's earlier works,her wit and evocative story telling nevertheless shone through. Concerning her characters, each one, from the caricature to the heroine, kept me amused, entralled and enraptured. Although not everyone would share my excitement for this book, I don't care, because I can fully relate to both Marrianne and Elinor's plight, feeling poignancy for Elinor's hidden love and jealousy for Marrianne's passionate relationship with Willoughby.Definitely one of favourites."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I finished my first Jane Austen novel, Pride and Prejudice, 2 days ago and was quickly hooked.

Gosh, such a great story. I love it. One of the reasons I finally decided to read it, is because my sister got meSense and Sensibility and Sea Monstersfor my birthday. I didn't want to read that before I read the actual Jane Austen story it's based on! I might skip the Sea Monster story and just read this one again, though. It was amazing.I read this on my Kindle for PC and reading it on my computer was easy on my eyes and I finished it off in a couple days. If you don't have a Kindle, I recommend downloading and installed the Kindle for PC. There are many free Kindle books available and I really was pleasantly surprised at how easy it was to use. Honestly, my eyes did not get tired at all."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I've read four Jane Austen novels in rapid succession, having been rapidly ensnared byEmma (Modern Library Classics), and avidly seeking more of this fabulous writer whose greatness I was amazed to have only just discovered. (The others werePride And Prejudice, andPersuasionAs with all the great classics found on Amazon, many readers have already offered excellent reviews. In these cases, I have felt little need to add my own, unless I feel I have something new to offer. In the case of Sense and Sensibility, I do indeed believe the need to offer my view, to do this book what I believe is better justice! Here's why:Many reviewers profess what is apparently the party line on Austen's works-- that while they \\"love this book and give it 5 stars\\", they (feel obliged to) then damn it with faint praise by adding \\"EVEN if it is one of her a. earliest, b. \\"not as poslished\\", c. \\"not as complex\\", or d. \\"not as funny, well-written,... etc. etc.\\"I must take issue!1. Even if any or all of the above are so, (which I could waste many lines on disputing, to no useful purpose), why would any of these attributes of supposed inferiority be relevant to enjoying this book for itself? They themselves belie such relevance by noting their own great pleasure in reading THIS Jane Austen book. If indeed JA is a brilliant master novelist (no contest here), any and all her books is worth reading for its own sake, as each of them, and as no doubt JA herself would hope. The only reason to compare the finer distinctions among them would be to recommend which of her books one should read IF one could only read one or two. Indeed, not a one reviewer would I dare say recommend any such thing! Sense and Sensibility, as does each of the other 3 JAs I've read, has its own unique treasures to yield to the reader, and it is for these that each must be appreciated and each and all read.2. Sense and Sensibility is a great analysis and example of the power of FILIAL love to transform a person for the better, and thereby to enable her to gain happiness. In my view, the interest in placing the two \\"opposing\\" virtues of Sense and Sensibility in each of the two sisters, Elinor and Marianne, is not simply to showcase the benefits and pitfalls the key virtue confers to the holder, but, much more illuminatingly, the value of the love between the two to cause the other to grow into a woman who can have BOTH in proper degree. Indeed, the book's ending will prove this!3. In Sense and Sensibility, there are many themes developed extensively which are not a focus of the three others I read, aside from #2. One is demonstrated in the character and actions of Lucy, initially presented as an almost deceptively minor character. (I wont say more, but this alone is a real gem worth reading the book for.) Another is the evolution of the sisters' regard for a number of important characters in the book. Each of these is developed and explained beautifully--the regard for Willoughby, for Mrs. Jennings, for Captain Brandon, Edward. These changes are effected not only by and within each sister, but by and within several other characters...with most edifying effects for the education not only the protagonists, but for me!4. Finally, Sense and Sensibility features key themes also showcased in the other three books, e.g., the power of real love to change one's character--one's pride and or prejudices for example (in that named book!), or the well-known to all (but beautifully illustrated examples of) wisdom, that how one reacts to love and the obstacles it creates or are created in its way, depends on character, and luck...but the love itself rarely is under one's control! And yet, of course, since each book's treatment of this theme is unique and reveals a host of unique vicissitudes it can involve, S and S and each of the others is well-worth the reward of the unique discoveries it offers the reader.I need say no more, and direct the reader to start \\"clicking\\" all four of the above into your carts!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"It's hard to know what to say about an unfinished draft of a novel... Was it interesting? Yes, in a way... Do I want to know how it ends? Yes, I think... Do I think the part that exists is good? Well, no not really. It's not Jane's best work. Or maybe it's just not like her other work. It seemed uneven--too rushed in some parts and too slow in others. Overall, there was not much character development - that is, we didn't learn who the characters are based on their dialogue and actions. Instead, we were mostly told what to think of them, either by the narrator or by Charlotte, the heroine. Charlotte has been sent, on only a very short acquaintance, to stay with the Parkers in an up-and-coming, soon-to-be fashionable seaside town called Sanditon for a fortnight or so. We are introduced to a varied, but not particularly interesting or memorable (yet) cast of characters over the first 12 chapters, which are all that exist of this last novel Austen was working on before her untimely death.As for this Hesperus Classics edition, it is very nice. Printed on good paper in a easily readable font, it is better quality than I would have expected for a small, relatively unknown, unfinished novel. Bravo to them, as I have no idea when I would have gotten around to reading this without the incentive of a nice new, pure copy (as opposed to the one I have which another author completed). While I don't understand why there is a rooster on the (presumably final) cover, it is just fine by me and I like the cover flaps very much. You don't often see them on paperbacks, but they are very useful for holding notes, marking ones place, or just generally making the book stronger and more luxurious-looking than a regular old paperback. The Introduction was illuminating and the endnotes were few (only 5) but quite helpful. The intended audience is clearly those who are familiar with Austen and are \\"completists\\" of her work.[...]"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"This beloved classic, Sense and Sensibility, never fails to please. This recent printing, however, takes the beloved classic a step further. Interlaced onto the pages are facts, trivia, and inspiration, enhancing the reading of the classic. The \\"insight\\" brings humor and knowledge to the page - giving historical facts to help the reader understand the context, showing humor in an otherwise vague passage, and giving movie references (from the many cinematic versions of the story). A Jane Austen fan will definitely enjoy this \\"insight edition\\" of one of her classics."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Dear Jane Austen Fans,We all know the story of Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen.

While living in Barton Cottage, the girls search to find love. This very beloved story is a true classic.Excitingly, a new version of the book has just been released. This edition has everything a true fan could want in this book. There are several side notes throughout the book with very insightful trivia. Who knew that \\"furniture from this time period was far from comfortable since springs weren't used until 1828 (p. 119)?\\" Or that the \\"average life expectancy was only 40, but if you made it past 20 and were wealthy, you could hope to live nearly as long as we do today (p.41).\\"At the end of the story, the reader will find a list of 12 questions for conversation. Although I wish it had questions instead at the end of each chapter, this book with it's side-notes and extras still make it a great addition to any fan's library. It would be great to use in a book club as well.So my advice to you is to get this copy to add to your memorabilia wall of Austen books today! You'll be glad you did!Sincerely,Number One Austen Fan**** I received a copy of this book from Bethany House for free to review."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I was thrilled to have the opportunity to re-read this book. I have read many of Austen's stories and have seen the characters portrayed in movies as well.Plus I enjoy reading books set during this time period.I enjoyed the many variations of notes not typically in study / Amplified editions. I was pleased at the easy to read format they used to include the notes as well.(that the comments were labelled with symbols and in the margins near the text being commented on. The information did change how I viewed some of the scenes that I had previously read or seen which was surprising to me.I didnt enjoy the comments that were listed of a personal nature or that were there to be funny! Ranking of the novels characters which was marked by a frowny face or the smiley faced comments were highly distracting to me. But I know that is a personal preference so I didnt take it too highly into account when giving it a rating. (they are two out of seven of the notes listed!) Many readers may enjoy these comments and would in fact find them entertaining and engaging. I could easily see this text being used in a classroom situation with young readers as well as being read by reading groups / Book clubs. The Group discussion questions were what I thought to be well written and thought provoking.So, if you have met the characters of Pride and Predjudice before or are reading this story for the first time this addition would be one I would reccomend.Note: A copy of this book was provided by the publisher for review purposes. I received no other compensation for this review and this does not influence my opinion of this book."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I enjoy all of Jane Austen's books, and Sense and Sensibility is one of my favorites. When I receivedPride and Prejudice (Insight Edition)as a review copy, I was worried that the text would actually have been changed or modernized, but the words of Austen remain the same, to my great relief. Instead, this version intersperses personal observations, movie trivia, historical background, spiritual insights, and other tidbits of information throughout the text in side boxes.I would also recommend this for younger readers or any other readers who are not familiar with Austen's time period, since it explains some terms and customs of the era that they might not otherwise understand. Any Austen trivia fan will also enjoy it.Some of the comments were rather too obvious and didn't add too much, others were really quite funny. The added info/commentary was really a good mix of just plain good fun and informational. The conversation questions at the end would make this very suitable for book club use, as well.I prefer the side box format to the usual footnote or margin format for \\"amplified\\" versions. It added the information without taking over the book.This is my third version of Sense and Sensibility, and I have to say it might be my favorite. This would make a great addition to the book collection of any Austen fan."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Thank you to Jim Hart at Bethany House for providing my copy of this classic. I couldn't help but wonder how the classic might have been improved.Historical and cultural details and definitions from England's early 1800s, facts about Austen's life that enhance the storyline, as well as many other notations, conveniently interspersed along the side margins make this an easy-to-use tutorial.I suggest that Homeschoolers, students of all ages and stages would benefit by the read or rereading. As a retired high school English teacher, I would chose this edition to teach."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Sense and Sensibility is more than 200 years old. The world was a dramatically different place in the early 1800s. The culture was different, the language was different, the governments were different. The entire state of mankind was completely different.So the question is, does a 200 year old book still pack a punch in 2005? Or has it become an archaic, dusty tome that alienates any reader with its unintelligable prose and mindless story? The answer, I believe, is a little bit of both.Clearly, the pre-Victorian writing style varies greatly from the Hemingway-esque brevity that is encountered so often in modern times. Often, Austen's writing is confused and cluttered. It can seem overly pedantic, trivial, and circumlocutious. There are entire paragraphs that can, and should have been, omitted because they are utterly flippant and redundant. The writing style was, for me, a barrier.The society in which the story unfolds; that is, the cultural background, is also quite distant from our own. If anything, Sense and Sensibility is a study in history. We see what life was like back then. We hear it from a primary source. And, for the most part, the petty pursuits of the luxurious upper-class, the countless balls and parties, and the mindless squabblings of money grubbing lords are fine. The reader accepts it as part of the history.The story itself is where the true beauty of the book is revealed. The story is timeless. It proves, refreshingly, that one does not need a massive war or wrenching poverty to create a good yarn. Yes, Elinor and Marianne live ridiculously priveleged lives (and often complain about their \\"misfortune\\"), but we all can identify with the romantic aspects of the tale. We can identify with the characters, the people, who inhabit Austen's world. And the characters are, quite simply, incredibly colorful and richly created. The characterization is where Austen shines.So the main drawback to this story is its age. If you can get past the age of the book or even enjoy it intellectually, you will uncover a gem of a novel. Austen's subject (unlike her prose) does not alienate us at all. Instead, it reacquaints us with the yearnings and struggles of love and friendship. If you can slog through some of the more clunky passages, there is a lot of insight and beauty in this book, as well as a fairly good story."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility is a classic novel. It's a very entertaining book. A few pages into this book, I already had taken sides for and against the characters. They are wonderfully believable. Some I disliked; some I liked. The ones I didn't like were money grubbing types who must have been pretty common in that period. The one I most liked was Elinor Dashwood, the eldest Miss Dashwood. She was very pretty and had good sense. Throughout the book, I found surprises. These were unexpected events that twisted the plot. Jane Austen uses the English language very well. This book is almost contemporary in language and is eminently readable. In fact, Sense and Sensibility is a classic worth owning.I recommend Jane Austen's Sense and Sensibility to all readers who want a fascinating cast of characters and a good read."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"This is a story of two sisters, marrian and elinor, which, though very similar in some aspects, and share a very similar unfortunate love affair, are total different in their behavior and approach toward matters of the heart.

It's inspiring and interesting"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"While a quick review of any NYT book review will make clear the many ways to evaluate the worth of a book, I've found that, with novels, 80% of my assessment can be delivered by answering two simple questions: 1) did I consistently desire to turn the page; i.e., did the narrative flow unremittingly retain my interest and curiosity, and 2) did the ending leave me with both the ethereal wish for the story to continue in perpetuity and lacking that, the more prosaic desire to immediately read it again.I recently read Pride and Prejudice and, having answered both questions with a resounding \\"yes,\\" expected more of the same with Sense and Sensibility. Unfortunately and very unexpectedly, I was disappointed. The book was successful in holding my interest but in a far from fervent way. Rather than caring deeply for the characters and anxiously awaiting the unfolding of their fates, my curiosity was clinical in nature, wondering at the outcome without particularly strong partisanship. Compared to the convincingly developed, full-bodied relationships between Elizabeth and Darcy and Jane and Wickham in P&amp;P, those of Elinor and Edward and Marianne and Colonel Brandon come off as shallow, cold and flimsy. To be fair, the ill-fated love of Marianne and Willoughby is carefully developed and generates sympathy. However, the lack of substance behind the Elinor/Edward connection and the lack of credibility supporting the Marianne/Colonel Brandon match left the book's ending with a flatness that far from inspired the desire for a continuance.The other missing factor that really set P&amp;P apart was the wry humor of Mr. Bennett. While S&amp;S is not without similar elements, they are primarily limited to comments of the narrator and lose the effect of being embedded within the dialogue of the primary characters.Is summary, this is not a book that you will put down with disinterest before finishing but is also not a work that will leave you exhilarated by the experience.

The story of two sisters altogether different from each other could be an interesting plot ... if it had Austen's usual style. Austen is famous for her keeping her balance between too romantic and too realistic. This time her style is much too romantic and by no means both feet on the ground.

She was a clever lady whose shrewd insight into human nature and English society allowed her to make effective use of satire, and her plots have enough twists and turns to keep the reader interested in what is going to happen next. The dull, dirty world Austen inhabited has limited appeal to me so I can't say the book was highly attractive (which is part of the reason I ranked it with a 6.) By way of recommendation, I would encourage a viewing of the movie version to help better understand the book.

Well, almost to sleep since I was driving as I was listening to it, afterall.Listening to the book felt like tuning into a radio from another country in a language I didn't understand. It took several chapters for me to really focus on what Ms. Harker was even saying! Her British accent is lovely, to be sure, but goodness it is difficult enough to tune in and comprehend Jane Austen's elaborate style of writing even on a good day. Ms. Harker's inflections were a bit odd. Time and time again I was shocked when a chapter was finished because it would be read something like this:\\"then they went to the other room (voice lilting up)......Chapter 2.\\"As for the story, what can be said about this Jane Austen classic? I had never read Sense and Sensibility before. Having only read Pride and Prejudice, I must admit that I found myself wishing Mr. Darcy would race in and save them all from their trifling worries."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Another winner from Jane Austen, I loved her when I read her in High School, still love her now."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Quickly shipped and item as promised and in good condition."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I tried very hard all through high school and college to be a Jane Austen fan. I could never get fully engrossed in one of her books and thus assumed that the writing style just didn't appeal to me. But once I tackled Sense and Sensibility, I found that Austen could engage me after all. I love Austen's structuring of this book--the contrast of the Dashwood women and the subtle caricatures presented in their surrounding families. And I thought the plot was plenty dramatic enough to carry me through to the final page. I finished it in three days."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"This novel may not by Austen's most famous, but it is certainly worth reading.In Sense and Sensibility, we are given several characters that appear to be static. You have the good and bad sister and they are destined to remain so for the rest of the story. But are they? I thought the way the so called \\"bad\\" sister changed her character by the end of the story was inspiring.The catch to this story is you have to read the whole thing in order to get to the good stuff at the end. Don't worry, it is time well spent."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"After seeing the movie version of Sense and Sensibility on cable, I fell in love with the story and went out and bought the book.

It shows the reality of the sensible always winning out. Marianne fell insensibly in love with Willoughby and ended up sad, but when she fell slowly and sensibly in love someone else, she is satisfied and happy. The characters also show the contrasts, we have Elinor with her steady sensibleness and Marianne with her lightheaded love of poetry and music. We also have Willoughby who was a confessed romantic with immature hopes, and wants, caring only for his own comfort, in contrast with Colonel Brandon whose steadfast love, and care is an example to us all."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"the movie was absoultly fantastic and the book was wonderfully writen by Jane Austin, This book, expressed a very good point, that many chose money over love and that many fall in love when it isn't aloud. the book is tottaly worth reading, yet had the downfull of not being as good as pride and prejustice"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"This is a very lovely cd and captures the movie brilliantly.

In all circumstances, Elinor never once demonstrated her misery in front of Marianne when she was having problems. This also shows how very shallow and selfish people were in Britain.

Kate Winslet is charming in the film, and it carries over into the audiobook. If anybody enjoyed her performance as Marianne in the film, they should absolutely listen to her tell the story.

Thank you"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"It took me a lot longer to finish up Sense and Sensibility than it really should have. There are several reasons for this and not one of those reasons is that the book is not very good or engaging- in fact, it is monstrous both. The school year started back up for me on Wednesday which took a lot of wind out of my sails and a lot of reading time out of my days. About a week before I decided to participate in the Austen in August reading even over at Roof Beam Reader's site I had purchased a copy of the Masterpiece Theatre/BBC version of Sense & Sensibility. I simultaneously watched the episodes while reading the book. I believe that this helped me to get a visual of what was going on as well as assisted in deciphering the prose of the time that the book was written in. I had seen this version a few times on PBS and I loved it very much so there were no spoilers for me, though it would have been nice to not know that Willoughby was such a scoundrel and that Elinor was going to marry Edward after all.Mmmmm.... Edward Ferrars....I enjoyed this book immensly, and I am almost ashamed to write this, but it is the truth and I'm striving to be more like Elinor in my life, which in one respect is to say more honest and so I must confess: I prefer the movie version better (the Masterpiece version, as I have not seen the Ang Lee version, yet.). I truly believe I prefer the screen version over the print because it was my first involvement with the story of the sisters Dashwood. If I had read the book first, I surely would prefer it.My favorite thing about this story is the fact that I could have easily been Marianne (or to a lesser degree, Elinor). Even in the 1800&#8242;s in England, girls still fancied boys who are jerks and girls still had a tendency to slight the good guys! When it comes to the opposite sex I have made numerous mistakes in my years of dating. I tend to choose the Willoughby over the Colonel Brandon and then rue the wasted time and the heartbreak caused by my own dumb choice. So, I didn't feel as embarassed and I didn't cringe as much regarding my past mistakes in dudes since Marianne was doing the exact same thing I did at her age: impulsively falling in love, flaunting it all over town, ignoring common sense, getting the short end of the gossip stick, you know, just basically acting in love and then getting dumped for the rich (in modern language: popular) girl and mooning over it for months. However, one part made me feel a little old maid-ish and a little pissed off-ish at Marianne:\\" \`A woman of seven and twenty' \\" (Egads, I am 27 years old!) \\"said Marianne, after pausing a moment, \`can never hope to feel or inspire affection again, and if her home be uncomfortable, or her fortune small\\" (very small, I work in public education), \\"I can suppose that she might bring herself to submit to the offices of a nurse, for the sake of the provision and security of a wife.'\\" Gulp!I love Marianne because she is me, but my favorite characters were definitely Elinor and Mrs. Jennings. These two women are as opposite as night and day but I love them both for who they are. Elinor is so reserved and calm and cool and collected and everything that I just am not but that I strive to be. I love her for always keeping her cool and never going nuts and silently suffering heartbreak for MONTHS just to spare her sister and her mother from feeling heartbreak for her. If I'm heartbroken, I'm taking out a billboard and begging for sympathy and pity. Now, Mrs. Jennings, she is a hoot and a holler!! This is a sassy, brash little old lady that I pictured as Sophia Petrillo from the Golden Girls!The brashness, the sauciness, the rudeness, the likability of these two ladies is what makes them the bitchin' characters that they are. Neither of these ladies is afraid to lay on the innuendo and offend those around them, especially when it comes to relations! In addition to the talent of genuinely writing two such different characters that both become so love-able and appreciated and necessary to the rest of the story and the other characters, Austen also portrayed my favorite kind of character: the strong female. In an age of weaklings (see Bella Swan in Twilight) I am of the opinion that showing female characters, especially in this time when so much of their worth was dependent on the men in their lives. Austen blows that out of the water, and as the case with Willoughby shows, the MEN sometimes must be dependent on the WOMEN for money and status! Hu-zahhh Ms. Austen, Huzzah! Though each of her female characters are bad-ass women (even the deplorable Fanny- she knows how to turn John Dashwoods head and get EXACTLY what she wants, when she wants it, and how she wants it) they still find classy ways to tell each other to get bent, especially Elinor when dealing with that despicable Lucy Steele. This is what all women in every country and in all times should aim to be like and I am so thankful when I see these types of characters in books. So, thank you Jane for writing these characters into your works, and like Sophia would say, thank you for being a friend!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Such pretense on my part to rate a classic known to the world for nearly two centuries. Still, I can offer assurance to the hesitant reader that Austen never disappoints.I do wish the pictures appeared in the Kindle edition, instead of merely the captions. I imagine they were wonderful old engravings."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I have read some works by Jane Austen, however, I have never read Sense and Sensibility until now. It is a story about two sisters, one is prudent and the other is outright passionate. You get to see Elinor and her sister Marianne go through a changing process by the end of the book.What is really neat about this book is that there are notes typed in the side margin to help you understand the story and to give you other entertainment facts of the story. This is helpful for those who want to understand the works of famous authors.I received a review copy via Bethany House."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"At last I overcame my inner resistance and read past page 1, which had previously turned me off with its dry accountant prose. Very soon, already in chapter 2, I realized what good use Ms. Austen was able to make of her special style: the chapter narrates how the rich young man, who had made a rash emotional promise of monetary generosity to his 3 half sisters, is talked down by his rational wife, from 1000 Pounds for each of the 3, to precisely nothing for anybody, all step by step. Brilliant.The main theme of the story, the contrast between the two sisters representing sense and sensibility, which might have been called reason and emotion to be clearer, makes me suffer somewhat due to the impossibly complicated communications between the two girls. None of the two can figure out how to shed the stilts that they are constantly walking on. The dialogues are not easily bearable, and then, frankly speaking, both girls are silly chickens in their different ways. Their mother is a silly hen in her manic optimism. The fact that the main personnel of the story is not entirely admirable fades away in the course of the tale. We find ourselves exposed to the horrors of English gentry of the period, and one begins to realize that the silly girls are rather admirably nice people compared to most other people in this story. We meet more monsters than I would have thought possible in the setting.The mother hen has to pick up her nubile 3 daughters and move with them to a cottage in Devon after her husband dies and the house in Sussex, which had been his father's, is going to the girls' older half brother. In reduced circumstances, they all make the best of it. Marriage prospects and related hopes and disappointments are the most prominent subject of thoughts and conversations.Compared to her later colleagues like Dickens and Trollope, Austen, in this book, has the advantage of superior plot design. The later professionals, in the Victorian age, lived by their writing and their constant output for publication in periodicals. S&S;, by comparison, is not driven by piecemeal design, not by the need to package publishable installments, not by ramblings from one subplot to another and back to the main story line. That is an advantage that one can appreciate, though it does normally not diminish my pleasure with the later writers.Austen's station in society is clearly reflected in her novel's world: the lower gentry, people who don't work for a living, but who are not wealthy. Her access to other levels of society must have been restricted by circumstances, hence she was wise to stick to what she knew. Her stories are sometimes called 'romantic', but hers was not the romanticism of the romantic school, which was essentially irrational. She was very rational and had a sharp eye for all kinds of falsities and pretensions. The novel's main effect on me, in the end, was a sense of despair about the lack of sensible life choices for women (and probably men too) in the suffocating closedness of the 'society'."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I am a die hard fan of Coralie Bickford-Smith's clothbound series. They are more then just a book, they are so beautiful they could decorate any bookshelf or be a present for someone special. Not to mention the fantastic stories she designs for! Puts a new, yet old-fashioned face to the classics! Brilliant!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"One reading is sufficient for most novels, but not Jane Austen's. Her style, wit and engrossing storytelling grow more delicious with every re-reading. I know in general what's going to happen, but there are so many wonderful details and so much rich characterization to rediscover.I loved Sense and Sensibility more than ever this time around.As the introduction points out, Austen's novel was part of an ongoing obsession in the 1790s and Regency period with defining and assessing \\"sensibility.\\" Too little sensibility was repellant; too much, dangerous. Whereas a perfect balance of intelligence, good manners and deep feeling should result in true happiness!The two elegant Dashwood sisters illustrate the point. Nineteen-year-old Elinor is amazingly sensible. When she suffers reversals, she takes rational steps to heal her wounds. Whereas Marianne at seventeen is awash in romantic opinions and sensations, and rather wallows in her misfortunes. Both have to deal with lovers who cause them misery. The plot revolves around how the sisters cope.But Sense and Sensibility is much more than a lesson in proper behavior. It's a feast of social satire full of delectably flawed characters. Nobody but nobody delivers a barbed criticism or witticism more beautifully than Jane Austen. And the Dashwood sisters are captivating young ladies who totally engage our sympathies.Broadview editions are my favorites, with their scholarly introductions and appendices. I particularly enjoyed the detailed drawings of a curricle, post-chaise and town chariot. Now I can picture the vehicles that carry Austen's characters to dinners and balls and on journeys to town and country.Jane Austen began writing Sense and Sensibility when she was twenty-two and published it in 1811, when she was thirty-six. Why she chose to publish it before Pride and Prejudice is one of many interesting questions explored in the introduction."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I'm reviewing the Penguin Classics edition rather than the content of the novel itself (which is wonderful). The cover is beautifully decorated, nicely textured, and sturdy, the introduction and notes are interesting but not obtrusive, the paper is high quality, the print is very readable (the font is not too small like some other editions of classic literature), and the colored ribbon adds a touch of refinement as well as utility. I've bought the other Austen novels in this Penguin series. They're among the most handsome books on my library shelf. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Love the novel. Happy to have it on my Kindle. I purchased this, however, for the illustrations...where are the illustrations?"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Recently I read Austen's 'juvenalia', and when I started reading this book, I could see a lot of similarities. The beginning of S&S; has a tone of satire. The reader can tell Jane is a young writer, mocking many of society's views which were common at the time.However, as the story progresses, I began to see Jane getting more serious about her subject and caring about her characters. That was when I began to love this book. And it just got better and better toward the end.On a personal note, I found some similarities to my own life in this book. When I was young and in love for the first time, I acted a bit like Marianne, wearing my heart on my sleeve. I think many of us probably did. I loved this book and gave it 4 stars - but you can see how I might be a biased reader.Some of Austen's other books are definitely a little better, but this is also a good book. It's amazing to me that hundreds of years can pass, and a modern reader like me can still identify with these characters."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"This is going to be a totally different type of review from me. In fact, it really isn't a review at all. It is more of an \\"ode to Jane Austen\\". I truly do think she ruined my dating life but I totally forgive her for it :)First question you are going to have is why do I have a picture of Jane (played by Susannah Harker) from Pride and Prejudice on a post about Sense and Sensibility?Answer: I listened to the audiobook version of Sense and Sensibility read by her and it was possibly the best audiobook I have ever heard! Yes better than Jim Dale reading Harry Potter (which I also really enjoyed)! If I am going to review anything in this post that is it. If you get a chance to pick up this audiobook version, you should. She is very good at making each character unique and keeping you engaged the whole book. It is unabridged so 14 hours long but well worth it.Disclaimer: Yes, I have read Sense and Sensibility a few different times before listening to it on audio. It is my 2nd favorite Jane Austen novel behind Pride and Prejudice. So the story is very comforting and familiar. I have the characters I love, the ones who annoy me, and the ones I would like to throw to the wolves. However, as with all great books, it always leaves me with the the hope that in the end the nice guy does in fact finish with the girl of his dreams. Austen is one of the best at taking flawed characters that come from a place of good and making them find each other.This book particularly appeals to me because out of all of Jane Austen's characters I am probably the most like Elinor. I am a little more open about my opinions but otherwise she is the closest to me personality wise. I would also like to think that out there is an E. Farris for me, as he is exactly the type of guy that I go for. Smart, Off-Beat humor, Loyal, Kind, and good to his word. So reading their rather understated romance always warms my heart. Plus, I love Brandon and his steadfast beautifully portrayed personality. He is the Bingley of this novel but Marianne takes awhile to realize that.So my rating: 5+My Recommendation: Get thee to the bookstore and read it!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Purchased for my daughter and her school needs (she is home shcooled) and she was very happy with the book, not to mention that the business end was a pleasure and easy to do as well.

I must say that S&S; was a very easy and accessible book to read. The plot wasn't overly complex and it did not feel bogged down and dense like some old classic novels can. I think this would be a great book for someone who wants to read classics but who is worried or scared to.The two main characters are easy to love and I was wondering what would happen the whole way through. Without saying anything specific, Austen kept me on my toes and I was very satisfied with the ending.Now I'm off to read more of Austen's books!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Eventhough I am only 13 I saw the movie, fell in love with it then read the book.

I love the fabric cover. There is also a ribbon book marker in each of these books in a coordinating color!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness. Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility). How these two interact with the world, each other, as well as family and friends makes up the bulk of the book. They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were. The supporting characters are very engaging and I found myself rooting for most of them, even a couple who are not entirely good. There are a few characters (e.g. Mrs. Jenkins) who are caricatures meant to parody some of the social norms of the day but even she has some depth to her and is likeable.While I initially picked this book up due to fond memories ofPride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics), I found Sense & Sensibility to be an excellent novel in its own right. I'm not sure why, but I was worried that it might be a bit dry. I needn't have been concerned, as the wit and story both sparkle from the first few pages and it only gets better as it goes along.I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending. I did think that a bit more attention could have been paid to Marianne at the end but in many respects Elinor is more the central character so it is perhaps fitting that the climax focuses more on her.In sum, this is an excellent novel and well worth reading."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"This novel was the first one written by this particular author and, as such, shows the talent that she possessed of telling rich tales full of in-depth descriptions of her characters. Reading this novel was not a totally enjoyable experience for me, probably due to the fact that the writing of a nineteenth century author seemed a little stilted to this twenty-first century reader.The wording was at times difficult to follow, but the use of words was masterful. In this present day and age of instant gratification, the flowery descriptions and the lingering way of dealing with the subject causes the reader to slow down to savor the experience.The first half or two-thirds of the book could have been made more concise to hold the attention of the reader. Too much time was taken in dealing with mundane things. There was little action in the first portion of the book. In fact, there were times that she could have taken a less circuitous route to tell her tale.Miss Austen did an excellent job of describing the mores of the upper and high class society. She employed the use of humor and satire in her writing. The overly dramatic portrayals of heartbrokenness and disappointments were amazingly humorous. The social niceties were well portrayed - the practice of leaving calling cards, the pairing of \\"acceptable\\" couples, the importance of not marrying beneath one's status.This novel is a must on a reading list of important works and should give the reader a desire to follow by reading Ms. Austen's later works to watch her development as she progressed in her writing career.-----------------------"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I have to say I loved this book. Most of the cogent points about this book have been pointed out already, so I'm not going to repeat them, but add some comments additional to what has been stated already.It's not Austen's best book, it's a simpler book than the ones that come after it, but that does at least make it easier to read - each successive book is a quantum leap in terms of style, narrative, dialogue and plotting over the previous, and Austen was changing the way novels would be written forever.Not that this is a bad book. Personally I liked it because it has something that's not so obvious in her later books, with the exception of Persuasion - the rock hard scathing judgment that comes accross in her letters - her obvious contempt for characters like Sir John Middleton, Lady Ferrars is searing in it's acidity.There are some excellent scenes - the scenes with Lucy and Elinor are classics in their own right, and the coup de theatre scenes when Edward bursts in on Elinor and Lucy, or Elinor throwing open the door after waiting for her mother when Marrianne is desperatly ill, instead finds only - Willoughby!Although the habit of the author colouring the narrative with her own opinions does get irratating at times, (a lesson she'd learnt by the time she wrote Pride &amp; Prejudice, which is neutral and unbiased) this still makes for a marvellous read. Marianne's sensibitility is breathtaking, and the revelation of how individual behaviour is fundamental in preserving the very fabric of society is unsurpassed."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Did anyone else feel a distinct sense of disappointment at the revelation of the mercenary, materialistic nature of the otherwise handsome and dashing Mr Willoughby's character? However, I think Marianne's heart-break was eased by the stead-fast and loving Colonel Brandon. I love this novel. I had been forever avoiding experiencing any other Jane Austen novels for fear they would not live up to the high expectations created by the fabulous &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;, however, when hearing of the imminent arrival of the fabulous Emma Thompson's adapted version at local cinemas, I decided to take the chance and read this book. I'm glad I did! This is another Austen gem. Elinor and Marianne are wonderful characters, as are all the others. If you are like I was and are afraid of spoiling your first Austen experience with another, don't be. &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; is another Austen triumph. Marriage, society and class are again given a unique Austen work over!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Being a fan of Jane Austen but never having read Sense and Sensibility, I approached this novel both nervously and excitedly. Reading any work by Austen is a delight, but I was worried this one wouldn't be as good as some of the others I'd read. However, I slipped into the language and time period effortlessly as I was introduced to the Miss Dashwoods and their plights of love and friendship. This debut novel by Austen is light, witty, and charming, and a complete joy from beginning to end.Both Elinor and Marianne Dashwood have fallen in love, but as the story progresses, we discover that both are going to face unrequited feelings in their relationships. Still, though slightly impoverished, the girls are taken under the wing of several friends who introduce them into London society and further the story with many twists and turns. Elinor becomes entangled in secrets she would rather not know, and Marianne plays into the drama of her love relationship grandly. As both girls come to realize what is really important, the story turns yet again and leads us into unexpected events. This is a truly engaging tale, and a terrific introduction to all of Austen's works. Recommended reading for all lovers of classics."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Although SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is not of one Jane Austen's best novels, it is nonetheless a major novel, with the author's then-young talent in full display. Its publication in 1811 marked Austen as a huge literary talent, and its significance reverberates even today as contemporary readers re-discover the works of this author so adept at uncovering the foibles of nineteenth century aristocracy.The title refers to the two eldest Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, one of whom (Elinor) embraces practicality and restraint while the other (Marianne) gives her whole heart to every endeavor. When the Dashwoods - mother Mrs. Dashwood, Elinor, Marianne, and youngest sister Margaret - are sent, almost impoverished, to a small cottage in Devonshire after the death of their father and the machinations of their brother's wife, they accept their new circumstances with as much cheer as they can muster even though their brother and his wife have taken over the family estate and fortune. Their characters, albeit wildly different in their approaches to life, are impeccably honest and intelligent - and their suitors take notice. Elinor falls in love with the shy, awkward Edward, while Marianne's affections are lavished on the dashing hunter Willoughby. As in all Austen's books, love and marriage don't come easily, as affections aren't always returned and social jockeying sometimes takes precedence to true love. In an interestingly twist, the end of this novel brings into question which sister represents which part of the title.SENSE AND SENSIBILITY only hints at the social skewering Austen would use to such great effect in her later novels, and the humor here is only occasional and slight, as this novel adopts a generally serious tone. Parody is largely limited to the gossipy Mrs. Jenkins, who jumps to wild conclusions about situations she knows nothing about. Though arranged marriage and true love figure prominently in all of Austen's novels, this novel focuses almost exclusivity on the prospects of the two main characters, making it less complex than the novels that followed.

Except for the first page or two where the circumstances of the Dashwoods are set up through a series of deaths and relations, possibly causing some confusion, this novel is exceedingly easy to follow for contemporary readers.This novel is an excellent introduction to Jane Austen's works because of its relative simplicity (though readers should not dismiss it as simple) and the use of typical themes and social situations. Book clubs and students might want to explore the influence of money on nineteenth century British society as well as the meaning of the title as it applies to both the sisters and the other characters.

The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Sense & Sensibility has been reviewed ad infinitum, but I wanted to say that this is one of the most beautiful books I own.I was looking for a series of classics that I could purchase in hardcover to spruce up my personal library. I stumbled upon these special editions from Penguin Classics, with covers designed by Coralie Bickford-Smith. I love books, but these books still make me giddy with delight when I pick them up. The covers have so much character and they're sturdy. The fonts are classic and easy to read, and the paper is substantial. The ribbon bookmarks, that match the cover, are a really nice touch. The only bad thing I can say, and it's so minor, is that the binding is a little stiff when the book is new. It loosens as you read.There are more titles available, though some are still exclusive to the UK.

I highly recommend this novel for all readers."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"One thing needs to be made clear before reading this book; the words \\"sense\\" and \\"sensibility\\" do not mean the same things today as they did in Jane Austen's time. Though \`sense' referred to intelligence and the ability to judge situations well, \`sensibility' had connotations to having appropriate sensitivity toward moral and artistic issues, linked with the superiority of a person's aesthetical \`senses'. As such, there is room for debate over which sister represents which trait, something seemingly obvious from the outset of the book, but which dramatically changes by its conclusion (which amusingly mirrors the ongoing debate over which traits Elizabeth Bennett and Mr Darcy embody in the title of their story \\"Pride and Prejudice\\").\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" was Austen's first novel, and as such is considered her weakest by the critics, though this also means it is also the most accessible and easy-to-read novel. First novels are almost always the most amateurish, and as such it is a much simpler work, from the storyline to the sentence structure, which leads to an easier reading experience than her more complex novels (\\"Emma\\" and the aforementioned \\"Pride and Prejudice\\"). Anyone new to the world of Austen is best to start here as the easiest book with which to ease into her range of novels.The sisters Elinor and Marianne Dashwood are extreme opposites; oldest sibling Elinor uses her head, whilst the younger Marianne follows her heart; but for all of this, the two are very close. After the death of their father, Elinor and Marianne - along with their mother and younger sister - are forced to give up their comfortable estate to their stepbrother (the product of their father's first marriage) and sister-in-law due to the inheritance law. But before relocating to Barton Cottage, Elinor forms an attachment with Fanny Dashwood's brother Edward Ferrars, a shy and awkward, but good-hearted man. Hoping that her feelings are returned, but unable to make any advances, Elinor travels to Barton Cottage in the hopes that he will return to her there in the near future.At Barton Cottage, the girls make many new acquaintances, in particular the loud and bustling matriarch Mrs Jennings who is determined to marry the girls off as quickly as can be, and the quiet and gentlemanly Colonel Brandon. As for the romantic and dreamy Marianne, she's fallen hopelessly in love with the dashing John Willoughby after he rescues her from a rainy day and a twisted ankle whilst out walking in the countryside - much to the dismay of the smitten Colonel Brandon. Already concerned at Marianne's overly romantic disillusions, Elinor is concerned at her rather wanton behaviour in the presence of her new beau, but is then has her attention drastically diverted on being introduced to a Miss Lucy Steele who has a secret to share about Edward Ferrars...The story winds its way through the girls' negotiations with the society they live in, the restrictions held upon them and the individuals which hold power over them - not with the same deftness that Austen displays in later novels, but still with much thought-provoking commentary. The family's plight in being reduced to guests in their own home at Norland, at the mercy of their somewhat dim-witted brother is particularly revealing as to the social injustices of the time, and though the frustrations of the girls' status is never explicitly stated, it is readily evident for anyone willing to read between the lines. At the end of the day, all they have is each other and the fervent hope that they will find both happiness and security in marriage. Their trials in love are perhaps the most heart-rending experiences of any other Austen heroines, (where romances are either touched by irony or poignancy) in the fact that a happy ending is not guaranteed for the sisters and that their future happiness depends on a good match - it particular it is hard not to feel your heart break for Marianne, whose unswerving belief in her own feelings and the raptures of her heart are so cruelly put to the test.The characters of Elinor and Marianne are utterly irresistible. Elinor is the sort of person you would desperately wish for in your life in order to benefit from her good sense and protective nature, whilst Marianne is utterly charming in her romantic flights of fancy (in fact she's so winsome and dreamy that it's almost a shame when she gains some \`sense' at the novel's end - one would have been contented to have her indulge in her dreaming forever). Though the novel is told almost solely through Elinor's eyes, in several ways Marianne is the main protagonist, who goes through the most trials and changes. Whatever your own opinions, the two provide an excellent foil for each other, and at all times the sisterly bond between them is apparent.There have been so many adaptations of Jane Austen novels throughout the years, though to my mind none is better than Ang Lee's \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" starring Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet. As I was reading the novel, I often found myself switching on the DVD in order to compare the two. It is a beautiful film, loyal to the themes, storyline and characters of the novel and in some cases improve upon it, and so comes very highly recommended as a companion piece to Austen's first novel."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"The audio is great if you can play it. Before buying the CD I tried to find out if it came in CD version so that I could play it in my car on my 35 minute commute to wk. I had bought Jane Austin compact disc collection and was able to play it in my car; so I compared it's notes with this version and they both said CD. I wished they had included the notation from the back of the CD.

Here we follow the adventures of the Dashwood sisters as they find love in an class-conscious Regency England.The Dashwoods, impoverished when their father dies, are forced to live in a small house in the coutry on 500 pounds a year. With such unfortunate pospects as those, it will be difficult for the elder two, Elinor and Marianne, to find good marriage prospects. Marianne finds herself falling in love with the dashing Willoughby, who ends up being not all that he appears. Elinor, the more sensible of the two, falls for Edward Ferras, a match that seems much more suitable. But again, things are not what they seem, in this delicious tale of love. The young women must use their sense to see what is really there, and their sensibility to see what will be (unfortunately, Marianne uses neither, much to the detriment of the family). Colonel Brandon is the unassuming, unlikely hero who falls in love with Marianne and saves her from death.Having read this book several times, I can safely say that it gets better and better with every reading. I also recommend the 1995 film starring Emma Thompson, Kate Winslet, Hugh Grant, and others."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I don't know which book of Jane Austen, I love more. Sense and Sensibility is just so romantic. Pride and Prejudice is awesome and Emma is just fabulous. To think that Jane Austen wrote those books so long ago just goes to show that women have felt pretty much the same about love for always."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"The present novel is about two young women, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. They are part of a family living in Sussex. The family is of average financial means or a bit higher than average but the family loses its home when the father dies; and, the mother and sisters move to a smaller cottage in Devonshire. The novel follows the romances and complications of the two girls. Beyond knowing those facts, you should not read any more about the plot until you read the novel, or you will risk spoiling the read. I will not give away the plot, but will only describe the writing style and structure.I read Austen's \\"Mansfield Park,\\" then read some analysis by Nabokov from his Cornell \\"Lectures on Literature\\" and the comments of Jane Stabler from the introduction of the Oxford version. After that I got a bit excited and read Austen's early writing \\"Sense and Sensibility,\\" along with the analysis by Margaret Doody in the Oxford version. Yes, I guess I am now an Austen fan, and it is a pity that she did not live longer. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is my third Austen novel and so far the most fun to read.Based on the three novels written over two different time periods, it is clear that she developed a certain fixed writing style and a common structure. She uses the early pages to introduce the families, and other characters, and give start the story. She moves characters around from place to place in part for time shifting. She does a wrap up in the last few chapters.Those opening chapters are an obstacle for most readers. She uses her own vocabulary and has an unusual way of structuring her prose. That structure is a trademark of Austen's writing. Also, she manages to work in a lot of drama and social issues with some humour and irony.Based on what Nabokov and others are saying, she got her inspiration from Sheridan, Richardson, Henry Fielding, Sir Walter Scott, and the poetry of Cowper. She modulates the complexity of the prose to reflect the characters - such as making the sentences of Sir Thomas Bertram in \\"Mansfield Park\\" somewhat elaborate instead of describing how the character is dressed or a similar description to convey qualities and traits, i.e.: she uses the complexity of speech to convey character. Also, she uses lateral shifts and epigrammatic notations and similar literary techniques. These techniques are interesting for some readers but just confusing for others. It is all part of the price of admission to entering the world of Jane Austen, and it is part of the fun in reading her novels.Overall, once you get past reading and digesting 50 pages or so and have absorbed the Jane Austen vocabulary (words such as felicity, remonstrance, countenance, etc.) and understand the structure of her prose, the book becomes a compelling read. The second Austen novel seems much easier than the first.This was written by a young Jane Austen and honed for over a decade before being published. By way of comparison, it is an interesting read but less complicated than \\"Mansfield Park.\\" It not as interesting nor as witty as \\"Pride and Prejudice.\\" Still, it is a delightful and a pleasant read."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I had the pleasure of reading two of Jane Austen's books, Pride and Prejudice and Sense and Sensibility, and loved both of them. Austen writes in such a romatic way that you wish you could be there in person to experience every word. Anyone who found the book to be boring, needs to re-read it again. It speaks of honesty, integrity and love that is lacking in todays books. Elinor in, Sense and Sensability, was a strong and smart woman while on the other hand, the younger sister, Marianne, was weaker but became a stronger individual because of the strong bond between herself and Elinor. Every young girl should read Austen's work because it protrays love as good and bad and shows that no matter how much someone can love you, there maybe a hidden agenda behind that affection."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"This review is my personal commentary on &quot;Sense and Sensibilty&quot; and, as such, explains and analyzes the novel. Eleanor Dashwood, the main character, is an example of a young woman's position in eighteenth century England. Her dependent situation in a typical Pre-Victorian setting introduces the reader to a common stereotype of the times. Miss Dashwood, a prospective bride at the tender age of nineteen, possesses adequate beauty and genteel manners making her attractive to select suitors. Chestnut hair, rosy cheeks, and plump figure serve her well, in accordance with the latest standard of femininity. However, she is a victim of circumstances. Her father's recent death has left the meager dowry of one thousand pounds, which presents the illusion of an unfavorable marriage As there exists minimal monetary gain, any match would be for the companionship of Eleanor alone. The equilibrium of both attractiveness and virtue offers an amiable personality. Although she is reserved almost to the point of appearing indifferent, the case is quite contrary. She sacrifices personal feeling to uphold and protect the reputations of any worthy acquaintance amid slanderous social gossip. These qualities of self-control, prudence, and nobility are exemplified in daily life. Perhaps they are best noted in her treatment of Lucy Steele, an undermining ninny who neither desired nor expected Eleanor's kindness. Eleanor's selflessness is her most outstanding characteristic, as seen in constant care and consideration for those around her. When her own heart is aching under the strain of Edward Ferrars' impending marital rejection, she suppresses it to help her younger sister Marianne heal from Willoughby's own recent announcement to wed another. Even against the incogitant avarice of the former fianc&eacute;s she bears no lasting grudge. The unprejudiced man who seeks Eleanor Dashwood would have to be satisfied on these terms, as they are more precious than fortune, though rarely esteemed in a material world. The conflict of this book that will intrigue most readers is recognized in the title. Sense, comprised of the model attributes of Eleanor, opposes sensibility, a glamorous self-indulgence. It is sensibility that governs the outrageous conduct of Eleanor's and Marianne's former fianc&eacute;s. Lucy Steele, ignorant of Eleanor's affiance to Edward, confides in her of their own secret engagement four years previously. Lucy is beneath the Ferrars family in class and fortune, therefore making their future marriage a disgrace. Willoughby's guise is still worse. He has fathered an illegitimate child with a scoury maid, unconcernedly teasing the affections of many an earnest young woman. Unbeknownst to Marianne, he is currently betrothed to Miss Gray, daughter of a gentleman and recipient of a forty thousand pound dowry. These hindrances, intended for personal amusement, have now blinded them both to true love. The ceaseless appetite of sensibility has devoured their past and is eyeing the present. Will it be allowed to overtake weakened wills? The climax, predictably tragic, is inevitable for such foolish young men. A third party reveals the secret arrangement between Edward and Lucy, thus Mrs. Ferrars' anger resolves her to transfer the inheritance of eldest son to the other brother, Robert. Eleanor is resigned to believe he will wed the luxurious Miss Morton as arranged by his mother. Marianne receives a formal letter from Willougby informing her that any such engagement must be entirely a figment of her clever imagination, a sort of wishful thinking for a girl of her social position. This throws her into a desperate melancholy, which leads to potentially fatal illness. Everyone is at this point unhappy or unfulfilled in his or her expectation of the future. A complicated code of social formality coupled with personal confusion checks the true desires of each.The resolution to all these issues, however, swiftly materializes. Upon learning that Edward would no longer be the endowed heir Lucy desired to marry, her affections quickly change to Robert. Edward then realizes that he never really loved the fickle Lucy, and relies on sense to direct him back to forgiving Eleanor. Willoughby is not so lucky in his domestic outcome. He forgoes personal happiness to marry Miss Gray, as his own fortune has diminished. Ironically, a breach from sensibility occurs after he has taken a pint of liquor, and he confesses his true feelings about Marianne. He acknowledges all that has been lost for the gain of cold, inanimate money. Marianne recovers from her lovesick illness, and marries a family friend who deserves her. All is well in the marrying off of the Dashwood sisters; their fianc&eacute;s attain whatever it is that they desired and deserved in the first place. Despite mishaps and malignancies along the way, sense triumphs over sensibility. I would higly recommend this book to anyone interested in the gentry of the times, or is a fan of Jane Austen. It is truly one of her finest works, set in flowing language and adequate print. The paperback edition is fine for study, but I would select another for one's family library."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Sense and Sensibility follows the lives of two sisters, Eleanor Dashwood (Sense) and Marianne Dashwood (Sensibility). The story begins when the Henry Dashwood passes away, leaving his estate to his son, who is only half related to the Dashwood sisters. The girls, their younger sister, Margaret, and their mother are obliged to leave and seek residence elsewhere since they are no longer the rightful owners of the Dashwood Estate. Without much money to themselves, and a conniving sister-in-law who keeps their brother from providing them with any income, the family is forced to move miles and miles away near to their obnoxious cousins who have offered to allow a low rent. As if it weren't bad enough having to leave their home, the move brought with it some other negative outcomes. For one, Eleanor had to leave her love, Edward Ferrars (who happens to be the brother of their snobby sister-in-law), and Marianne ends up falling for a man who is not quite what he appears to be. The story follows the lives of the two girls and their tumultuous relationships, as well as their loyalty to one another. Full of twists and turns, broken hearts, reputation-ruining secret, and surprising turns of events, this novel is sure to hold you until the end!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"It's been years since I first read Sense and Sensibility. I was nineteen, and while I loved it back then I've had the feeling that I'd probably appreciate it more as an adult reader. Or who knows, I'll probably end up hating it the second time around. Lucky for me, that wasn't the case. This is definitely not Austen's best work (I'll explain why later), but its simple tale of two sisters who are as different as night and day and how they deal with financial destitution, heartbreak and feelings in general is still wonderful to me after all this time. Those who have read S&S; know that this is the story of the Dashwood women -- a mother and her three daughters -- and how they have to adjust to a new situation after the girls' half-brother inherits their large country estate. The aforementioned readers would also know that the two elder sisters, Elinor and Marianne, fall in love for the first time. Elinor is the oldest and with the most sense, preferring to suffer in silence in order to honor promises and not bring her family unnecessary pain. Marianne, on the other hand, believes in total emotional and passionate abandon. Transparent to a fault, she often ends up hurting and alienating people in her whims and heartbreak. Throw in meddling neighbors, a womanizing cad, a gentleman colonel, a jealous little interloper and you get a story full of intrigue and twists.As said earlier, I love Sense and Sensibility now more than I did thirteen years ago. Austen is one of those writers that draw you in with her sharp wit and satirical look into the society around her. I couldn't put this book down and it proved to be the perfect antidote for my cold and flu. I still think Edward Ferrars is awkward and gutless, Willoughby is a total player (and I so don't feel sorry for him when he explains himself to Elinor. He made his bed, after all. Elinor is far more forgiving than I am), Marianne is whiny and rude and Lucy Steele is probably the nastiest character in the whole book. Mrs. Jennings is still hilarious and I laughed at Austen's ironic narrative. However, this novel is not perfect. There are way too many twists that Austen pulls out at the last pages that strike me as bizarre and like a copout. I won't go into detail in case someone who hasn't read the book is reading this, but those who have read it probably know what I'm talking about. But flaws and all, Sense and Sensibility is still my third favorite Austen (Pride & Prejudice and Persuasion are my two first faves, in that order) and rereading this book was like reuniting with old friends. What a wonderful treat!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"At first I was disgusted with this book; the characters seemed to be mere shadows of characters of P & P and Emma. However, as I continued reading I was pleasantly intrigued by the plot and the characters were more fully developed (although the still are quite similar to P & P and Emma characters). Although I really like P &P and Emma, I would say that their plots and endings were quite predictable. S & S leaves you in suspense and doubt until the last few chapters. A really great read--if you stick with it."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I picked up this book largely due to fond memories ofPride and Prejudice (Enriched Classics), but I found Sense & Sensibility is an excellent novel in its own right. I don't know why, but I was worried that it might be a bit dry but the wit and story both sparkle from the first few pages and only get better as it goes along.The basic plot involves two sisters who have been more or less cheated out of an inheritance and are struggling to find husbands and happiness. Elinor is the oldest and is very intelligent and wise (Sense) and her sister Marianne is all raw emotion and passion (Sensibility). How these two interact with the world, each other, as well as family and friends makes up the bulk of the book. They struggle to understand each other even as they slowly grow more alike... meeting not quite in the middle but closer than they were. The supporting characters are very engaging and I found myself rooting for most of them, even a couple who are not entirely good. There are a few characters (e.g. Mrs. Jenkins) who are caricatures meant to parody some of the social norms of the day but even she has some depth to her and is likeable.I won't give the ending or any major plot points away but the story does move along well and has a fairly satisfying ending. I did think that a bit more attention could have been paid to Marianne at the end but in many respects Elinor is more the central character so it is perhaps fitting that the climax focuses more on her.In sum, this is an excellent novel and well worth reading. The Enriched Classic edition also has excellent notes to help you understand references or words that may be hard to decipher more than 200 years after the book was written and I found this very helpful."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"What happened to me when I first began reading this novel was that at first try I put it back on the shelf because I thought it was dreadfully dull. Little did I know that I just was not ready to read such a classic, much less a Jane Austen piece. But when I decided to give it another chance I realized that I almost passed such a great opportunity to expose myself to how a novel should be. Sense and Sensibility's twisted plot was a treat, and although the movie was somewhat truthful to the text, I still enjoyed the novel much more. I recommend this novel to people who are ready to face Austen's sometimes frusttrating vocabulary, but trust me, you'll be reaping benefits and will love to read this novel again and again!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Sense and Sensibility is a remarkable novel. Ostensibly a social comedy centered on romance, this book is really an unusually acute description and analysis of the collision of Enlightenment rationalism (Sense) with the Romantic ideas of the early 19th century (Sensibility). Austen uses the romantic entanglements of 2 sisters to present these contrasting views of life. This is a remarkable way of showing how ideas permeate and influence the life of society as a whole. The plotting, laden with clever irony, is brilliant, and the characters are drawn with Austen's usual insight."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"SENSE AND SENSIBILITY is a story about two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, who are as different as night and day. Elinor represents &quot;sense&quot; - thoughtful, considerate and calm, while Marianne is &quot;sensibility&quot;: wild, emotional, and talented. The story opens with the death of Old Mr. Dashwood, who leaves his estate to his nephew Mr. Dashwood (the father of Elinor and Marianne). Mr. Dashwood is about to die as well; he passes the estate to his son by his first wife, John Dashwood. Unfortunately, he has nothing of value to leave his second wife and their three daughters (Elinor, 19-years-old; Marianne, 17; and Margaret, 13), though he does manage to get John Dashwood to promise to look after them. But John Dashwood's selfish wife, Fanny, convinces him to give very little. And so, Mrs. Dashwood moves them to Barton, where they live humbly in a cottage on her distant cousin, Sir John Middleton's, land.Before their move, Elinor had met and fallen in love with Fanny's younger brother Edward Ferrars. But Fanny and Mrs. Ferrars are much too snobby to let their relationship prevail. When they moved to the countryside, the two are further separated. Meanwhile, Marianne's romances are just blossoming in Barton. She gains the admiration of Colonel Brandon, but she prefers young, dashing Willoughby, who helps her home one day when she fell and twisted her ankle. This however proves disastrous, as Willoughby abandons Marianne for wealthy Miss Sophia Grey after a long, intimate friendship. Elinor is also suffering from love-loss. She discovers that Edward had been engaged for four years to Miss Lucy Steele, a distant relative of Mrs. Jennings (Sir John Middleton's mother-in-law). At this point, &quot;sense&quot; and &quot;sensibility&quot; seem to coincide and we learn that we must have both &quot;sense&quot; and &quot;sensibility&quot; in a balanced, corroborated manner to have a truly blissful life.The story is very interesting and entertaining, though Austen tended to drone a lot between events. In my opinion, she spent too much time trying to convey Elinor's judgement during parties and other social gatherings (which was wayyyy too often). On the whole, this was a wonderful book, full of fun and surprises (especially at the end!). I highly recommend this book to people at or above the age of 14 (which is how old I am, and I'm telling you it was a bit of a stretch for me - or maybe it was just that I was a little impatient to get my AR reading points). My only advice is have patience, prepare for a lot of rereading (things can get kinda confusing - there were a little too many characters for my comfort), and to watch the movie (fabulous!) afterward. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I have read all of Jane Austen's novels at least once, and&quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; is, at the moment, my favorite,because it was the last one I read. Jane Austen is - and always willbe - my absolute favorite writer. I love the way she can take just an average person and reveal the hero or heroine inside.This is just what she does with Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. The central theme of this novel is not the love between a boy and a girl; it is about the love between two sisters and how they come to a better understanding of each other when they are forced to endure similar situations and handle them in completely different manners.When each sister, through dissimilar circumstances, discovers that the happiness she had believed she would find in marriage is not to be, it at first appears that Elinor is rather cold and heartless - more worried about propriety than feelings - and that Marianne is more in touch with her emotions and would rather express her grief than take into account how her display will affect those who love her...As for the relationship between the sisters, at the beginning, Marianne seems to pity Elinor for her lack of esteem for art and poetry, and she believes that Edward is not worthy of her. Elinor, while seeing the youthful faults of her sister, always keeps a sense of humour and does everything out of love for her and the rest of the family. In the middle, Marianne believes that no one has ever suffered as she, and continues to pity Elinor for her inadequacies...This is a wonderful and deeply moving novel that should be read more than once to be thoroughly understood and appreciated."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Sense and Sessanbility is one of the greatest novels I have had the pleasure to read. The injustice with love and society made me realize how good we all live today. I wish everyone could atleast read one chapter, for I know that with a few words that you read you will not want to put the book down. The unforgetable love between Elinor and Edward will make you cry, and wish you were there when they finally got..... read the book!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"A very difficult slog: this was written by an 18th-century woman, for 18th-century women (not even 19th!) And it was not even popular in its day. Few modern day woman would enjoy this book, and even, far, far fewer modern day men.Basically plotless (excepting cliches) and almost totally irrelevent to the modern reader (who marries for position nowadays?) The only value of \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" at all is in its prose, but, here anyways, its quality is not high enough to be a saving grace. This was a stepping stone, but it is from here, next to the Bronte sisters, then to George Elliot before we get something half-tolerable to read, if we are reading for pleasure.Austen's prose is better than average, but it is not the perfect syllable/phenome-diction of some others. And there is nothing -- absolutely nothing else. In one scene, Austen attempts humor by poking fun at some random male character's superficiality, but her only effect is to highlight her own.If you have ever struggled with a Victorian era novel, you will be surprised here, by how much worse it can get. Though published in the early 19th century, this book was basically written in the late 18th century. Some 18th century books are readable, like \\"Robinson Crusoe.\\" Some are even, in part, very good, like \\"Gulliver's Travels\\" or \\"The Wealth of Nations.\\" But the hit percentage was very low back then. The competition of years, of each author trying to do better than his or her influences or predecessors, had not really developed back then. There wasn't much evolution or refinement of entertainment back then because the market had yet to develop.Jane Austen not only never saw a movie, she probably never dreamed of one. She was writing in an agrarian age, before the invention of the steam locomotive or the telegraph. She probably had no conception of an edited, plot-driven story. Indeed, though the world she was living in was more similar to ancient world than ours, I would rate not one but several thoroughly ancient books as being far more meaningful and entertaining.I will be the first to admit most modern popular books are trash, but though this may be slightly better written, it is as superficial and brain-destroying as anything on the NYT's bestseller list. There is not a single scene of imagination, nor one character you can root for. I actually saw someone lulled to sleep by the reading of \\"Jane Eyre.\\" No doubt, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" would put him in a coma or in an early grave."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I'm sure if I hadn't seen the movie, (DVD) I wouldn't have had the least understanding of what was going on half the time.The book was very boring, with long unending sentences and characters that made no sense. Yet, I kept reading and reading until I was done. I think I was determined to make some sense out of it. After words and words of whatever, the ending came to a short, brief end. To this day, I'm not sure if Marianne was ever in love with Mr. Brandon, or she just admired him and married him because her family thought it best. Nor could I find one single reason why Elinor who was to have had some sense would have fallen for an idiot like Edward.The long silly relationship between Edward and Lucy was ridiculous, and made no sense at all. For the older sister to even care for a nerd like Edward when she was the one who was supposed to have some sense, made no sense. As to the rest of the characters, they were all ridiculous, pompous or stupid, and had no sense or sensibility at all.The film was much better. Don't bother with the book."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Jane Austen delivers an interestingly romantic story of two sisters and their everchanging love lives. Written in a time when a woman's fate was decided by her marriage, the characters in the novel depict the role of women in the nineteenth century. As for exiting and adventurous, Austen's novel doesn't have it. This book was sometimes hard to stay focused on because the story does not relate to modern relationships. Although, the intriguing manner of the Dashwood girls did have me interested at times. I found myself laughing at their wit and quirky dispositions. I would recommend this book to an older audience who can appreciate a more old-fashioned style of romantic novel."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Jane Austen wrote about what women in her time lived through. Marriage and society. Unfortuantly, in present times those subjects can become tedious after the 400th page. If you are not up to an extremely slow book, do not read Sense and Sensibility."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I so much wanted to like Jane Austen and, specifically, this book. That's because I dearly loved the movie \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" directed by Ang Lee with an amazingly good screenplay by Emma Thompson. Now that I've attempted to read the book on which it was based, I'm all the more impressed by Emma Thompson because she extracted the story from this novel and told it via dialog and made it interesting, engaging and charming.So I have to credit Jane Austen, at least, with having invented the characters and their situation. I've heard she was an astute observer of human beings and apparently she was.But her style! Reading Jane Austen was for me like swimming through half-set concrete or undergoing a root canal.Mark Twain made two observations about Jane Austen.First, he wrote in \\"Remembered Yesterdays\\": \\"Jane Austen? Why I go so far as to say that any library is a good library that does not contain a volume by Jane Austen. Even if it contains no other book.\\"Second, in a letter to his good friend William Howells, Mark Twain wrote in response to remarks Howells had made about Edgar Allan Poe:\\"To me his [Poe's] prose is unreadable -- like Jane Austin's [sic]. No -- there is a difference. I could read his prose on salary, but not Jane's. Jane is entirely impossible. It seems a great pity that they allowed her to die a natural death.\\"I find Twain's prose eminently readable and agree with him about Jane Austen. I can't read her prose and I couldn't even if I were paid to do it.I greatly admire those who can read Jane Austen. I credit them with great patience and intelligence. I'm not stupid, but my own gift of patience is utterly inadequate to the task. Yes, I would put up the ongoing tedious annoyance of root canal to save a tooth, but when it comes to reading a novel, I can find no reason to put up with tediousness. There are too many other novels written by authors whose style is both engaging and entertaining.I simply have to have sentences of prose that hold my interest and make me want to read the next sentence and then the next and the next until the book is done. If after reading several sentences, I feel as though I've just endured a lengthy session of reconstructive dentistry, I just can't be bothered.It's probably not Jane's fault -- she was a product of her time and place and that's how they wrote back then. If it makes Jane Austen fans feel any better, I'd put Nathaniel Hawthorne in the same category. I've heard they were paid according to the number of words written, and if that is true, it would explain a lot. But whatever the explanation, I understand completely Twain's hyperbole that she shouldn't have been allowed to die a natural death."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"(Warning!! I do give hints to events in the book) Simply put the book is a romance novel that is very long and some what drawn out. It takes Austen pages to discuss how some woman brings her kids to social events so she can talk about them. Just imaging this going from one social event to another. I personally found the book sort of repetative after about chapter 18 of 50. It seems the only way the book is kept alive is by introducing new characters. If you are a fan of romance novels with one of those cheesy endings, then cheese it up with this four hundred page novel. I couldn't get any furhter than chapter 18, I got tired of nothing happening, specifiically action. Like in &quot;One Who Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest&quot;, which is an awsome book things happened. Not only that it was funny, but realistic enought to keep my attention. In conclusion if you like books were the entire novel revolves around the realtioships between people (soap opera) then this is the book for you other wise keep away."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Seeing how Sense and Sensibility by Jane Austen barely makes any sense, I wouldn't even touch this book again, even if you paid me. Extremely long and mundane, Sense and Sensibility is a book that actually requires effort and stamina to go through the entire thing. To me, the three-hundred-and-fifteen-page book translated to absolute gibberish as I did not understand, nor really cared to understand what was going on.Seeing how the there was no purpose to the plot, I was left bored from the first word to the very last. I really did not see the point of writing a story about two well-off, high society women court other men. There was absolutely nothing interesting about that in the story. No one really cares if the ladies must suffer through heartbreak because in actuality, everyone does. Jane Austen could have done a much better job in piecing a more attractive and purposeful novel together.As I read, the more I learned about the characters, the angrier I got. Why does every character have to be a member of a high social status? To me, everyone was snobby, everyone was self-indulged, and everyone was too one-dimensional. The characters were too well-off to even sympathize with. I did not care or feel emotionally attached to any character whatsoever. Each individual was not self-motivated, and they came off as stuck-up characters. I was just waiting for someone to do something, but no, each character has to wallow in his or her own self-pity. People have worse problems to worry about than worrying about the problems the character has. I kept going through the story and saying, \\"So what? Who cares? Fix your own problems.\\" The characters were too detached to make me feel interested.All in all, the story was just bad. It lacked purpose and meaning. Although you have to admit Jane Austen constructs beautifully crafted sentences, sentence style could only take the story so far. If you have time to actually read this book, I suggest you spend your time doing something worthwhile instead of wasting your life on Sense and Sensibility."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"....&quot;thoroughly unpleasant&quot; was how he found Austen's work, &quot;English in the bad, mean, snobbish, sense of the word.&quot;I wouldn't go that far, but those stilted paragraphs, those arid drawing-rooms, those aristocratic concerns and conceits (how to redo the parlor? How to arrange for the right guests to see it?) leave me completely exhausted. The superegoic hatred of impulse; the Dickensian pasteboard moralizing; the conservative exaltation of appropriate manners and self-restraint....The only characters I was able to care about in this novel were the villains--or rather, given Austen's sterilized offsetting of taste versus boorishness, call them negative role models. And even they did nothing more dramatic than offering an occasional cold shoulder to the well-bred and undeserving.But then I wonder: perhaps all this is some fantastic satire? Perhaps the pomposity and the Emily Postian fussiness is a deliberate attempt at humor? If so, I'm sorry to say it went above my head.Pride and Prejudice is next; I hope it's a more human work than this one was."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"when my friend read all of jane austen a few years ago and just couldn't stop raving, i thought it was time to give the old girl a test ride around the block and see what all the fuss was about. on first try i fell right off. it was like reading a foreign language. my mind wouldn't stand still long enough to learn it. now, though, with the continued push to read jane austen ever before me (the new book, \\"the jane austen book club\\" peeked my interest), i thought i'd strap on my helmut and give her one more try. a few years of meditation under my belt would surely slow me down and give me more of a chance to \\"get it\\", i thought.she's still out of reach. i was initially teased, even laughed once or twice as i started \\"sense and sensibility\\" but then....it's just soooo boring. austen's portrayal of elinor and marianne and the crew are about as shallow as it gets. there is no depth here in these characters. my mother even joined me in this reading endeavor. we started a book club of two, just to accomplish this task... strength in numbers and all that. but, alas, we were both so \\" monstrous\\" bored. it was a \\"sedulous\\" task at best. we have now named our book club the \\"anything BUT jane austen book club\\".the reasons for the boredom:1)i'm just not entranced by long, long, long sentences. proust gave it a go and did a much better job.2)i'm also put off by the confusing use and over use of pronouns..who really is \\"he\\" and \\"she\\" and \\"they\\"...i think if i'd have submitted this work in college, it would have come back with many margin notes on grammar, syntax and style.3)i think i got the idea of the social structure and nuances(where there any?) in the first 50 pages.. the rest was just\\" monstrous insipid \\".4)and for the storyline.. when austen lovers run out of austen material do they go on to harlequin romances? seems it would be a logical move.no more austen for this old girl. life's just too short and there are too many really good books out there."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I'm sorry the book put me to sleep, it took over a 150 pages until something interesting happened, stayed interesting for a few chapters and then got boring again.

But Sense and Sensibility is very good on its own if not compared to those two:)Well to begin with Marianne is not as bad as some of the other reviewers have made her out to be. They should take into mind that she spends more than half of the book with her heart most cruelly broken by a man that I fell for just as hard as she did. (Willoughby.... Willoughby!)On a happier note though, there is one man whom I can still love at the end of the book, Edward Ferrars. He is not the wildly romantic man that Willoughby was, but what he lacks in that area he makes up for in others, such as his strength of charachter, his sweetness, and, as another reviewer mentioned, his loyalty. Yes, he is so loyal he almost left my heart broken twice. Luckily, Lucy did one thing right and saved us all from having to see that unhappy arrangement:(Well I really think I've said enough to give you the picture that this story is filled with drama and romance.(For all you that like that sort of thing, I know I do!) Also the romance in this book is completely clean! I definetely appreciate that, and if Jane Austen were here I would thank her for making all of her novels clean, so that girls like me who don't read books filled with trash can enjoy a good love story every once in a while!! :)"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"This was my first Jane Austen experience, and it turned out to be mostly what I expected. Flowery writing, wandering storyline, and mostly emotional drama, this is not at all like my typical reading fare. That being said, SENSE AND SENSIBILITY was an enjoyable read, with undeniably beautiful prose and often biting social commentary of old British society. While Elinor and Marianne didn't face any life-threatening scenarios or experience any true danger, their experiences trying to attract mates while navigating the social maze of British aristocracy was nonetheless interesting and amusing. The ridiculousness of that society when compared with our norms of today is spectacular. When an entire class is judged by nothing more than the family coffers, and labor seems unthinkable, marriage is of the utmost importance, especially for those unlucky 2nd and 3rd born children who are unlikely to inherit the estate. It seems totally bizarre today, but this kind of thing was apparently the norm a couple of hundred years ago, and is actually quite fascinating to think about (and learn about) while reading this book. And while we still have some elites today, it is hard to imagine the massive social divisions, bigotry, and unequal opportunity of the past. Jane Austen succeeds in her goal of highlighting the wrongs and inconsistencies of old British society. This book is worth the read if you have the time, even if mostly for the stark comparisons it provides with current times."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"This was my first Jane Austen book and initially I was unmoved - even bored - by the torturous romantic entanglements of two well-bred Regency young ladies.

So well written and so much more true romance than any dime store novel ever could attain to be. The only downside is that this copy seems to have some glitch where it will double a sentence and place that 2nd sentence a few paragraphs later but it's in a way that it's obvious it doesn't belong there. The only thing I could figure was that in the hard copy there is some book print style picture with a quote from the book under it as would be typical in many books of this type and that in the kindle version it just doesn't show the picture."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Love Jane Austen!

I am working on collecting them all!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Sense and Sensibility, Jane Austen's first published novel, is the story of two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood. Marianne is young and flirtatious and has very set ideas about what sort of person her true love, her knight in shining armour will be. Elinor, much more restrained, mature and sensible, has quite a different attitude to life and love. Both meet the man they believe is for them, but for neither does the course of true love run smooth. This charming novel has some very likeable characters, as well as a few to despise or disdain, and plenty of muddles, misunderstandings and wrong assumptions. Altogether a delight to read: easy to understand why this is a classic."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"One of the Dashwood daughters is smart, down-to-earth and sensible. The other is wildly romantic and sensitive.And in a Jane Austen novel, you can guess that there are going to be romantic problems aplenty for both of them -- along with the usual entailment issues, love triangles, sexy bad boys and societal scandals. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is a quietly clever, romantic little novel that builds up to a dramatic peak on Marianne's romantic troubles, while also quietly exploring Elinor's struggles.When Mr. Dashwood dies, his entire estate is entailed to his weak son John and snotty daughter-in-law Fanny. His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance. Her impoverished family soon relocates to Devonshire, where a tiny cottage is being rented to them by one of Mrs. Dashwood's relatives -- and Marianne soon attracts the attention of two men. One is the quiet, much older Colonel Brandon, and the other is the dashing and romantic Willoughby.But things begin to spiral out of control when Willoughby seems about to propose to Marianne... only to abruptly break off his relationship with her. And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash. What's more, they each have to become more like the other before they can find happiness. There's also a small but solid supporting cast -- the hunting-obsessed Sir John, the charming Willoughby (who has some nasty stuff in his past), the emotional Mrs. Dashwood, and the gentle, quiet Colonel Brandon, who shows his love for Marianne in a thousand small ways.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is an emotionally powerful, beautifully written tale about two very different sisters, and the rocky road to finding a lasting love. Not as striking as \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" but still a deserving classic."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"When I read Pride and Prejudice, four or five years back, I loved it. With Sense and Sensibility, I finish a read through Austen's work with her first novel. It is a strange genre, maybe, but I think Austen wrote as much for men as women, and there is something in her male characters, good and bad, for us to think about.Why Austen appeals to the Marxist in me, I cannot really explain. Somewhere, on the edge of her books, the world is moving, rapidly, from a feudal society to one the Bourgeoisies. Maybe there is an idea in a rewrite of Austen from the servant's point-of-view. They are, as I read, only inches from the page.Sense and Sensibility is a decent example of Austen. The characters are well drawn and do not suffer the familiar defects. The story is somewhat predictable, but so are all her story-lines. The story resolves a bit too quickly and neatly, and it ends far too abruptly, but, again, it is the same with all her story-lines.With S&S;, I find that I cannot tell if Austen is parodying, as I have always believed, or if she is not, instead, pining for the world she depicts. I think her readers probably wonder that about themselves sometimes.Probably I did not give the book as much attention as I could have, as I read three of her books in quick succession through the spring and summer in order to finish (be done) with her from my reading list.None of Austen's work can really approach P&P; and so, for me, was somewhat disappointing in comparison. I have also since, read Wuthering Heights and I think it somewhat eclipses Austen on all points except, maybe, that of pure language."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I have come to appreciate this more and more. I love austen's works and the struggling characters and emotions in this novel is so accurate that it's scary. The opposite personalities or sense of that keeps this book intense. Their is intense love in this family unit which I find delightful and you are sucked in the whole novel."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I really didn't enjoy Pride & Prejudice, so I didn't expect much from Sense & Sensibility. But I found myself truly enjoying Austen's wit and tongue-in-cheek descriptions of silly women and men who can't make a proper decision to save their lives.And the DRAMA! My God! Did people during this time really act like this? With every 18th and 19th century book I read, whether it's Jane Eyre or Wuthering Heights, I am amazed at how it was so normal to over-react to everyday disappointments. We have mad people locked in attics and sad people dying of broken hearts. People marrying out of spite and people running away from responsibility. It's insane! If anyone thinks that today's society is any less dignified than 200 years ago, well...we may talk with more slang and have short attention spans, but...well, I guess we are pretty ridiculous in our times as well.At any rate, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed this book. I wouldn't call it light summer reading, so I'm not sure what made me pick it up and start reading it (it's August), but I would venture to say that it was just as dramatic and ridiculous as any other book I would have brought to the beach with me. Fantastic!"},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"I'm a relative newcomer when it comes to Jane Austen; I didn't finish my first Austen until well into my twenties, and I'm still working my way through the set. \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is my third of her novels, and I find myself loving the overall story but at the same time seeing where there are problems with the text.For those who are unaware, the story is about Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, two sisters who are near-opposites of each other. Elinor is calm and stoic, bearing personal difficulties and disappointments in silence and with great dignity. Marianne is vivacious and feels everything to extremes; when she has an emotion, everyone around her is aware of her great passion. After the death of their father, the girls, their mother, and their younger sister, Margaret, move to Barton Cottage, where they meet several men who will influence their futures. Marianne quickly falls for Mr. Willoughby, a young, dashing, impassioned man who may not be a good match. Elinor is in love with her sister-in-law's brother, Edward Ferrars, but due to their shy natures, their relationship isn't always viewed by others for the reality that it is. And Colonel Brandon, a friend of their neighbor, has a secret about one of their beaux that is imperative to future happiness.In typical Austen fashion, problems ensue, with deception and courtship mixing in equal measure. To be quite honest, it's very similar to \\"Pride and Prejudice\\", with Willoughby clearly an early forerunner to Wickham and Colonel Brandon a prototype for Mr. Darcy. But unlike that great novel, this one is slightly unfocused. \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is clearly about Elizabeth Bennet, but \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" can't quite seem to make up its mind as to who the main character is. It's told from Elinor's point of view, but most of the story focuses on Marianne and her troubles, though the ending abruptly revereses course and focuses on Elinor, relegating her sister as almost a footnote. And, like some of Jane Austen's other novels, it does wrap things up very quickly.\\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is clearly a classic. It's one of the most beloved novels in the English language, and its countless film adaptations are proof of its greatness. But while the story is wonderful, it's not the best of Austen's novels."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"Jane Austen's first published novel, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\", has lost none of its charm and ability to entertain over the years. Two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, are thrown on hard times by the death of their father. Living in straitened circumstances in a tiny country cottage, their prospects for marriage are set at risk in an age in which a young woman's first job was to find a good husband. The two sisters will pursue much different methods in searching for a suitable man. The sensible Elinor exercises almost superhuman patience in waiting for the man of her choice to make the right choice, while her emotional sister will throw herself into an impulsive love affair. Their lives will be further complicated by the well-meaning and often humorous interference of friends and relatives.Austen's talent for ingenuous plotting and excellent dialogue carry a superb story to a most interesting conclusion with an ambiguous moral that fans are still arguing about. For fans of Jane Austen, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is worth reading again; for new readers, find out what you missed; highly recommended."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"When Girlebooks decided to publish a bicentenary edition of Sense and Sensibility, they were faced with the dilemma of how to make it \\"different\\". Sure there were fewer ebook copies on the market than hardbound, but even a cursory search on Amazon.com offers over 2,000 Sense and Sensibility listings. How could they stand out in such a crowd?Enter the combined creative talents of Margaret C. Sullivan and Cassandra Chouinard. Sullivan, no novice to the historical world of Jane Austen (she is the author of The Jane Austen Handbook) first collaborated with Chouinard when writing There Must be Murder, a sequel to Austen's Northanger Abbey, set in Regency Bath. Laura McDonald, founder of Girlebooks, had recently prepared There Must be Murder for ebook publication and knew that Ms. Sullivan's meticulous research abilities and smart, fun style were a \\"matchless match\\" with Ms Chouinard's lively illustrations--a perfect pairing for a beloved classic.So- as Sense and Sensibility turned 200 years old, a fresh look was taken at the book. For the first time in years, new illustrations for an unabridged copy of the book were created. Characters come alive--not in a dated, Victorian tinted way, but with faces and expressions which display both sense and sensibility--along with charm, alarm and a variety of other emotions drawn from a book that seems at times to be \\"nothing but a succession of busy nothings.\\" Certainly most of the major activity happens off page, and yet, there is nothing boring or monotonous here. Ms. Chouinard has provided 23 large illustrations...and, in a nod to Hugh Thomson, a charmingly illustrated chapter header for each of the 50 chapters! These darling headers give a glimpse of \\"what's to come\\" to even the most rapid reader, flying by the scenery in order to discover Willoughby's secret and Marianne's fate.While Cassandra was busy sketching and drawing, Ms. Sullivan was hard at work, researching the allusions which would have been readily apparent to Jane Austen's contemporary readers, but have been lost in the following centuries. Her plan was to read it with an eye towards the first time reader--not creating a scholarly treatise, so much as answering the questions that arise when considering Colonel Brandon's supposed \\"nabobs, gold mohrs, and palanquins\\", for instance. (Incidentally, I discovered that these are a: an Englishman who became rich by doing business in the Indies, b: an Indian coin, and c: a litter carried by four attendants and covered with a shade).Sullivan's insights also help reveal the depth of coquettish conniving betrayed by the Steele sisters in choosing to join the \\"Doctor\\" in a post-chaise all the way to London, for \\"it seems that the party was made up of just Anne, Lucy and the Doctor, and as the post-chaise seats only three, it would have been a very cozy party indeed.\\"Although it has been many years since I first read Sense and Sensibility, I confess that I learned more, and understand it more now, than I ever have before. It is one thing to view someone else's impressions of the book on film, but reading the book again, this time with clever chapter notes (97 in all) which answer so many of my questions before I can even begin to ask them, I finally feel like I begin to understand the world that Jane Austen was writing in. Certainly, the book is far deeper and more complex--and better told--than any film adaptation to date.Along with providing ample notes on the text, Ms. Sullivan has added to \\"the improvement of [our] mind by extensive reading.\\" Included in this edition are a biography of Jane Austen and inclusive bibliographies on subjects as diverse as \\"Biography and Criticism\\", \\"Authors Having Fun with Jane\\" and \\"Fiction inspired by Sense and Sensibility\\". There is also a complete list of Sense and Sensibility films--surely enough extended reading to satisfy even my enthusiasm for the subject!Sense and Sensibility, the Bicentenary edition is available in paperback, as well as Kindle/Mobipocket PRC, Adobe Reader PDF, Microsoft Reader LIT and Epub editions.

His widow and her three daughters are left with little money and no home.Over the next few weeks, the eldest daughter Elinor begins to fall for Fanny's studious, quiet brother Edward... but being the down-to-earth one, she knows she hasn't got a chance.

And during a trip to London, both Elinor and Marianne discover devastating facts about the men they are in love with -- both of them are engaged to other women. And after disaster strikes the Dashwood family, both the sisters will discover what real love is about...At its heart, \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" is about two girls with completely opposite personalities, and the struggle to find love when you're either too romantic or too reserved for your own good. As well as, you know, the often-explored themes in Austen's novels -- impoverished women's search for love and marriage, entailment, mild scandal, and the perils of falling for a sexy bad boy who cares more for money than for true love... assuming he even knows what true love is.Austen's formal style takes on a somewhat more melancholy flavor in this book, with lots of powerful emotions and vivid splashes of prose (\\"The wind roared round the house, and the rain beat against the windows\\"); and she introduces a darker tone near the end. Still, there's a slight humorous tinge to her writing, especially when she's gently mocking Marianne and Mrs. Dashwood's melodrama (\\"They gave themselves up wholly to their sorrow, seeking increase of wretchedness in every reflection that could afford it\\").And Marianne and Elinor make excellent dual heroines for this book -- that still love and cherish each other, even though their polar opposite personalities frequently clash.

I saw it on the clearance rack for $2 at Half Price Books and just had to buy it. I was definitely not disappointed. I have two older sisters myself, and Elinor and Marianne constantly reminded me of them. My oldest sister is full of common sense like Elinor, always thinking of the outcome and how actions will affect her and everyone around her before she does them. On the other hand, my other sister is sensible and romantically charged like Marianne. She lets her emotions get in the way of her common sense and is in the \\"right now\\" instead of looking ahead to the future. Some of the situations they were in and the things they did and said also reminded me of myself and things that have happened in my life. Jane Austen did a wonderful job of making these characters \\"real\\" and easy to imagine actually living, breathing, and doing and saying the things she described. Even though I am only 16 and some of the ideas and language in this book were hard for me to understand and comprehend (I am trying to become more \\"well-read\\" and expand my vocabulary by reading books such as these), I was still easily able to relate to the characters and thoroughly enjoy this book.

Instead I am going to review the audio download which is what I had this time. I enjoy listening to books while I clean, it is my way of getting myself to stay busy. I have been known to spend several days with my nose stuck in books having done absolutely nothing throughout the day. Now that I have started downloading audio books to my iPod, I can wear my armband and get tons of things done around the house and go for long walks while having my favorite stories read to me. The best of both worlds! Sense and Sensibility is performed by Juliet Stevenson and she does a wonderful job. Her voice gets a little 'nasal-y' (I'm sure that's not a real word.. lol) and stuffy sounding at times, but I'm not sure if she does that on purpose to suit the characters. It was a little distracting and annoying, but most of her reading was pleasant. I would recommend it to any Austen fan that wants to listen to wonderful stories while being productive."},{"Title":"Sense and sensibility","review":"The Penguin clothbound classics are all beautiful, but I like the Sense and Sensibility cover the very best.

They are vaguely unwelcome at their stepbrother and sister-in-law's home, but they don't have sufficient funds to live easily elsewhere. Luckily, a relative steps forward to offer them a home at a small cottage some distance away.The two older Dashwood girls, Elinor and Marianne, are of marriageable age, and begin scrambling to find appropriate matches. Elinor is attracted by Edward, an awkward man who is her sister-in-law's brother. The match is not approved by Edward's family, who is more well-off than Elinor, and they conspire to separate the couple. Elinor is reasonable and stoic, and bears her hurts quietly.Marianne, an impetuous and emotional girl, falls for Willoughby, a charming man who seems to have good prospects and who dotes on her and the family. But there may be trouble brewing in their relationship as well.I find Austen's novels to be a fascinating glimpse into the difficulty of life in England in the late 1700s. The society is so complex and so rigid, and the characters spend so much of their time trying to navigate their way through the social restraints before they are even free to try to fall in love and choose a spouse.I liked reading about the struggles and triumphs of the Dashwood sisters, although I found the ending of this story to be a little abrupt and not quite satisfying."},{"Title":"Slaying is Such Sweet Sorrow (Far Wychwood Mysteries, No. 2)","review":"I thought that the first book,Arson and Old Lace: A Far Wychwood Mystery (Harwin, Patricia. Far Wychwood Mystery Series.), was good, but this volume is even better. I was gripped by the story, sitting up until the wee hours with it, and am becoming very fond of the characters. I would recommend that fans of Jeanne Dams' Dorothy Martin series give it a try.This series features a woman who has moved from New York City to a small English village near Oxford, where her daughter, son-in-law and grandchild live. Catherine's relationship with her daughter is prickly, but thankfully not overwrought into melodrama; I sympathize with both characters. Harwin doesn't try to substitute bickering for plot. This volume has a lot of fun with the difference between England and the US, especially in vocabulary. The chapters are headed with quotes from 15th-16th century works that are exceptionally well-chosen for their beauty.In this book, Catherine is forced to confront her ex-husband at family affairs. One thing that I like about this series is that it appears that the character is not going to be locked into an unchanging formula, facing the same problems without resolution over and over again. When her likeable son-in-law is accused of murder, and Catherine finds that the police see no reason for further investigation, she goes into action. Although I would like Harwin to find solutions for Catherine other than breaking and entering, I am very happy to say that she is NOT the sort of amateur who, hearing that an axe murder might be in the cellar, goes down to check.While I don't think that Harwin is necessarily ruling out romance, I like that Catherine is an independent woman who can do just fine by herself. Harwin doesn't follow the rather tired plot device of having the character find Mr. Pluperfect in the first book.In addition to Jeanne Dam's Dorothy Martin series, I also recommend Monica Ferris' Needlecraft Mysteries featuring Betsy Devonshire and Katherine Hall Page's Body in the ... series, featuring Faith Fairchild."},{"Title":"Slaying is Such Sweet Sorrow (Far Wychwood Mysteries, No. 2)","review":"It should have been an occasion for great celebration for Catherine Penny: her gentle, scholarly son-in-law, Peter, is about to be named head of faculty of non-Shakespearean Elizabethan Drama department at Oxford's Mercy College. Except that her faithless ex-husband, Quin, who broke her heart when he left her for his younger secretary, has decided to attend the ceremony with that woman! Catherine is not sure if she can be in the same country with Quin without bursting a blood vessel, but she's agreed to try for her daughter's (Emily) and for Peter's sakes. But on the night that the announcement of headship is to be made, Edgar Stone -- a pompous sarcastic and detestable character, known for his emotional cruelty towards his wife, his womanising ways and his great dislike for Peter -- is named head instead of Peter, much to everyone's dismay. And when hours later, Stone is found murdered in his house with Peter caught looming over the dead body. The police automatically assume that Peter had murdered Stone out of professional jealousy and anger; especially since they had received an emergency 'phone call from Stone claiming that Peter was at his door threatening him with a knife, just before he was found dead. Peter's solicitor wants Peter to plead temporary insanity; but Catherine fears that such a move would spell the end of Peter's career even if he gets off. And so determined to help Peter and Emily, Catherine decides to do some investigating of her own in order to unmask the read murderer. After all a great many people hated the detestable Edgar Stone! Now if only she can keep her attention focused on the investigation at hand, instead of her anger at Quin...I, also thought that Slaying is Such Sweet Sorrow\\" was a much better mystery novel than \\"Arson and Old Lace.\\" And isn't that how it should be? The second novel surpassing the first? Not that \\"Arson and Old Lace\\" was a shabby book. To the contrary: it was a fantastic read. It's just that I thought that Patricia Harwin had got the proportions interspersing her heroine's private life with the mystery at hand, much better in this installment. Catherine Penny's inner turmoil at having to come face to face with the faithless Quin and his middle aged floozy, and her confused emotions where Quin was concerned, was nicely juxtaposed with the mystery subplot of who murdered the unlikable Stone and framed Peter, perfectly, without one subplot hijacking the other. Both subplots were vital to this story and I was in awe with the competency with which the author handled them. Add this to the wonderfully vivid and affectionate manner in which she brought Oxford University with its deer park and spires to life; the skillful manner in which she fleshed out her characters (both primary and secondary); and the masterful manner in which she kept things quietly suspenseful and constantly humming, and you have a book worth touting as an excellent read.

The man that is chosen, Edgar Stone, is a womanizer and is not well liked.Stone is found dead, and Peter is accused. Catherine does everything she can to prove he's innocent. Unfortunately the police have a call from Stone saying that Peter is there threatening him with a knife right before he's found dead.Her daughter and ex-husband have hired a solicitor, but he doesn't seem to be much help. Her relationship with her daughter is tenuous at best, and these circumstances really wear on it. Plus Catherine and her ex-husband run into each other more than Catherine would want. This adds a lot of tension in the family.I am not a big fan of mysteries set in England. I think one of the reasons I like this series is that it is an American who has moved to England. So often she will explain the idiosyncrasies I would otherwise not understand.Catherine is an enjoyable character. I like seeing England through her eyes. I enjoy the English countryside.

Catherine Penny moves to a small village in England and it's almost as though she is transported to a simpler time and place. A place where you really know your neighbors; a place where friends drop by for coffee and gossip; where you plant your own garden; where you can walk for miles through the lovely countryside and never cross an expressway. Her characters were appealing and warm and Catherine's own strengths and weaknesses made her seem a very believable and likable person. When death and arson occur in this idyllic setting, the reader is caught up in the attempt to identify and eliminate this menace.Unhappily the characters in her second novel were just not as interesting. They were sophisticated and shallow and it was very difficult to care about their petty problems. When the worst among them is murdered, it just didn't matter very much to me.Instead of Slaying is Such Sweet Sorrow, I would recommend one of Elisabeth Ogilvie's novels, perhaps A Theme For Reason.

Her son-in- law, Peter, is slated to win an award and receive a prestigious appointment at Oxford. Everyone is shocked when the position goes to another professor, Edgar Stone, who is not as qualified as Peter, nor as well liked. When Sloan is found dead, Peter is the most likely suspect, since Sloan made a phone call to the police telling them Peter was threatening him with a knife.In her heart, Catherine knows Peter is innocent and she is determined to prove it. Catherine and her daugher have a shaky relationship, so the daughter turns to her father for help and he hires a solicitor for Peter. Her ex-husband being in the picture adds more stress for Catherine, although she tries to be civil and concentrate on Peter's problem.This mystery does have a few weaknesses. There are too many digressions, and it takes a while to get into the plot. On the other hand, the descriptions of Oxford and the surrounding area, the nice chapter headings with quotes from English literature, and the appeal of Catherine's character as an independent woman who has made a new life for herself later in life, makes it well worth reading."},{"Title":"Slaying is Such Sweet Sorrow (Far Wychwood Mysteries, No. 2)","review":"I looked forward to reading this second book in Far Wychwood Mystery series. I wasn't disappointed. I must admit however,I thought some of the pretentious dialogue between the characters in this book was a bit much and quite frankly tiresome (a little editing would have helped) However, the storyline itself was delightful. So happy Catherine decides to stay on in England and not fall back into the arms of her ex-husband. She is far more interesting on her own."},{"Title":"Slaying is Such Sweet Sorrow (Far Wychwood Mysteries, No. 2)","review":"After Catherine Perry's husband Quinn dumped her for another woman, she packed her belongings and moved to Far Wychwood to reside near their daughter Emily, her son-in-law Peter, and her grandson Archie. When Quinn and his lover Janet come for a visit, Emily promises her mom to keep her dad away from her because Catherine wants nothing to do with her ex. Quinn and Catherine separately attend a dinner where Peter is to be named head of his department at Oxford.The outgoing head names Edgar Stone to replace him leaving Peter very disappointed. When Catherine returns to the banquet room, she sees Peter standing over a dead Edgar. The police arrest Peter, feeling they have an airtight case after hearing a phone call Edgar allegedly made to the prime suspect. However, the case collapses when Edgar's wife is found dead with a suicide note in her handwriting saying she killed her husband. Catherine feels good for her daughter and grandson, but has some lingering doubts how the two deaths occurred.Patricia Harwin has written a delightful British cozy that will appeal to fans of Ann Granger and Patricia Hall. Readers receive an insider's look at a small English village consisting of thirty cottages yet the heroine feels more at home here than back in the States where she used to live. The mystery is cleverly constructed so that Catherine's attempts to solve the case ring true as she stumbles from one incident to the next. Readers will seek out the previous Far Wychwood tale (see ARSON AND OLD LACE) and look forward for the next one.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Slaying is Such Sweet Sorrow (Far Wychwood Mysteries, No. 2)","review":"I read the first author's book in this series and thought it was interesting though with some reservations. But it was the first one and anyone who reads series books knows that they often improve with subsequent books. However, this second book I could not even finish.The protagonist of the series, Catherine Penny, moves to England after her husband of 25 years dumps her for another woman. Hence the American in England.There are two main reasons why I gave up on this series.First, Catherine is completely irresponsible. Her daughter, who has married an Englishman and also lives in England, leaves her baby with grandma on occasions. More than once Catherine goes off leaving the baby alone, or gets side tracked and forgets for a while that she is baby-sitting and endangers the child's life! The daughter finds out about some of these incidences. She protests, but then hands the baby back over. Both Catherine's and her daughter's behavior was totally unbelievable in these situations. No one in their right mind would leave a child or baby alone with this woman!Second, and the real killer for me, is that Catherine is a complete and total shrew! Her obnoxious behavior shows up much more in this second book. She is constantly screaming and yelling at some poor slob, demanding this or that from someone who obviously can't help her. This happens more than once and I only got half way through the book! I can only guess at how many more triads the read has to endure to get to the end.The only mystery for me was how her husband could have stayed married to someone that unpleasant, selfish and demanding for 25 years. Or why he didn't murder her!Perhaps my disappointment is heightened by the fact that at first this seemed like such a promising series. There are things the author does well. I liked the setting and the writing itself is fine (hence the two stars). But I just can't take that main character.I hope the author will do another series with a different (i.e. tolerable if not out and out likable) protagonist."},{"Title":"Slaying is Such Sweet Sorrow (Far Wychwood Mysteries, No. 2)","review":"Extremely disappointed that there will only be two books in the Far Wychwood series....I loved everything about this middle aged American woman moving to the lovely English village of Far Wychwood..such a delightful setting and I was getting attached to all the characters and was looking forward to getting to know them all...please find another publisher!!!!"},{"Title":"Slaying is Such Sweet Sorrow (Far Wychwood Mysteries, No. 2)","review":"Enjoyed Harwin's first book but couldn't get past page 21 in this one. The main character, Catherine, is just about the most unsociable person yet. Her interaction with family and others borders on rude and obnoxious. I enjoy a good mystery where the main character at least has a level of consideration but this just annoyed me from the get-go.Sometimes I can get past this and give the book another 30 pages but this was too much for even me. This is not to say I don't enjoy books where the primary character is rough around the edges and prickly but this was just annoying to the point of not wanting to put up with 272 pages just to see if it would get better."},{"Title":"The Warrior's Camera","review":"\\"The Warrior's Camera\\" is not a casual book for fans of \\"Yojimbo\\" and \\"The Seven Samurai.\\" It is a dense, scholarly tome designed for film majors to study. The book takes for granted that you are familiar with the films of Eisenstein, the books of Dostoyevsky and the plays of Bertold Brecht, as well as the personal philosophies of each of these Kurosawa influences.This is also not a biography, and none of Kurosawa's personal life is put on display. Films are dissected shot by shot in tight detail.However, if you are prepared, \\"The Warrior's Camera\\" lends tremendous insight into a fascinating director. Each chapter focuses on philosophical themes central to Kurosawa's work, and dives into the films that most represent these personal philosophies. The strength of the individual, and the ability for personal choice, is outlined by \\"Drunken Angels,\\" \\"No Regrets for Our Youth\\" and \\"Stray Dog.\\" Strength of will is shown in \\"Ikiru\\" and \\"Red Beard.\\" As this is a scholarly work, each chapter presents an argument and then presents evidence to support the argument.I have come away from this book with a much deeper understanding of Kurosawa and what he was trying to accomplish with his films. Highly recommended, but be prepared to work for your knowledge."},{"Title":"The Warrior's Camera","review":"Contrary to the last reviewer, this is not, in some exclusive sense, a book \\"designed for film majors to study,\\" and if one is interested, you'll do fine without any previous study of Dostoevsky, Eisenstein, or Bertolt Brecht. Some previous knowledge helps for sure - but don't let such elevated requirements discourage you from exploring Prince's work of Kurosawa scholarship. I am not a \\"film major\\"; I have read few works of Dostoevsky; I have seen only 2 Eisenstein films and read only fragments of his writings. I know more about Brecht than the other two figures, but with this said, I still gained much insight and understanding from Prince's arguments and observations. If you're still worried about it, don't hesitate to put to use one of the greatest research inventions ever: the internet.Now on to my review: This book begins with much promise but ultimately ends in disappointment. Prince begins by stressing the importance of historically-based analysis. He suggests that one understand Kurosawa's films as \\"address[ing] the Japan shattered by World War II and [as helping] reshape society.\\" (8) This is a most interesting, preliminary claim that initially promises certain fascinating paths of reading. Also, Prince begins by criticizing 'auteurism' and naive assumptions of 'authorship'. He notes that the formation of 'film studies' as an academic field imposed a \\"major code\\" that reduced all Kurosawa films to \\"the ideal of humanism\\". Now this is also promising - finally, a comprehensive work on Kurosawa, other than that of Donald Richie, that gets beyond 'auteurism'.Unfortunately, Prince's book does not live up to these introductory assertions. First, Prince continually makes use of terms like \\"Zen Buddhism\\", \\"heroic ideal\\", \\"warrior ideal\\", instead of terms like \\"humanist universalism\\" as if they were more accurate interpretive concepts for understanding Kurosawa's films (see pp. 10, 11, 28, 30, 115). However, he never 'historicizes' these very concepts but treats them as somewhat static and a-historical. I don't think that one would find it completely convincing or that interesting if some critic put to use concepts like \\"Christian providence\\" or \\"protestant individualism\\" for the purposes of deciphering the work of Orsen Welles without demonstrating first the historic intricacies of such empty concepts and second their specific, contextual relevance to a given Welles' film-text. Thus, it must be asked: why make use of analogous empty signifiers of Japanese history and culture so carelessly in relation to Kurosawa's films? Ultimately, Prince's interpretive framework remains less than convincing , for his initial imperative to read \\"against the grain of history\\" is violated repeatedly throughout the book.Also, it is disappointing that right after Prince criticizes the usual appeal to authorship or auteurism he categorically states, \\"Kurosawa's films form a series of inquiries on the place and the possibilities of the autonomous self within a culture whose social relations stress group ties and obligations.\\" (27) From this Prince establishes his own master code for interpreting the totality of Kurosawa's work based upon the supposed \`intentions' of Kurosawa-as-author. It is a code that reads Kurosawa's films as being primarily about the negotiation of the ego in the modern world. Prince continues, throughout the work, to make sense of the rich diversity of films in terms of this restricted framework. He writes, \\"Kurosawa's world is an arena where his characters must be tested , where they must be victorious in their goals or must be broken and defeated.\\" (116) Later, he reduces the entire complexity of Kurosawa films into a \`meta-narrative' that is \\"...the passage from willed optimism of the early films to the ethic of resignation and despair that pervades the late works...\\" (154) The meaning that Prince detects in these films is not wrong per say but way too limited and reductive. There is a vast complexity of meaning and significance in Kurosawa's diverse catalogue of films, and some of it is in direct contradiction to Prince's \`auteurist' thesis. I cannot say that I was satisfied with Prince's analysis for these reasons. However, if one is sympathetic to auteur forms of criticism, then this book may be for you. Just remember what Foucault says in \`What is an Author?': \\"the author serves to neutralize the contradictions that are found in a series of texts.\\" Personally, I think the \\"contradictions\\" that one might locate in a series of texts serve as the sites of most interest in any interpretive investigation; thus, they should not be effaced by way of some reductive narrative of authorship.I give this book 3 instead of say 2 stars because it is quite an extensive project providing a vast amount of helpful information, and the analyses of certain films is thorough and somewhat technical. It just had so much potential to be better. Read this alongside Mitsuhiro Yoshimoto's book."},{"Title":"The Warrior's Camera","review":"This is one of my favorite books on film in existance. Stephen Prince gives a beautiful analysis of Kurosawa's entire career. The way he goes into detail about each film and the meta-textual/contextual support he gives to one of cinema's greatest directors is fantastic. His writings on Yojimbo were definately the high point of the book for me (it only further cemented it as my favorite Kurosawa film).I wish more film scholars produced such cultural and over arching comparatives as Prince presents here."},{"Title":"The Warrior's Camera","review":"I have the pleasure to have Dr. Prince as a teacher at Virginia Tech, but his book is one of the best books on Akira Kurosawa. I have been a fan of Kurosawa since I found my intrest in film at the ripe young age of 15. I have read his audiobiography, and next to that this is the only book that actually said something. It has many details not even in the biography, and insighful information on all his important works."},{"Title":"The Warrior's Camera","review":"The Warrior's Camera is a really intelligently written book with very important information about the groundbreaking director. The book is worth buying just for the Legacy section of the book, which is a wonderfully written section about Kurosawa's legacy. This section also has some great quotes from other film directors, such as Steven Spieldberg and George Lucas, and prominent film critics. The book also has some great info on his style and the way to view a Kurosawa film. If you are writing a report on Kurosawa or if you are just a big fan, make sure that you pick up this book along with his biography."},{"Title":"The Warrior's Camera","review":"The problem with getting good books on cinema is that they are expensive and they tend to focus too heavily on the best or worst parts of a director's work and are usually focused on content instead of context.This is hard to swallow, because you've ponied up a bunch of cash for a book and wouldn't have done so if you didn't already know said director's work. Insights into the film are nice, but belong in a friendly conversation, not a pricey book.This balances rather well the biography and the cinema of the late master and I saw several of the films through a different lens (no pun intended)."},{"Title":"Free Enterprise: A Novel","review":"Most of us have heard of John Brown and his unsuccessful raid on Harpers Ferry. But how many of us have heard of Mary Ellen Pleasant? Mary Ellen Pleasant was a civil rights leader before there was an official movement, yet she is often omitted from history books. In FREE ENTERPRISE Michelle Cliff uses a mixture of historical fact and fiction to create a complex tale that highlights the life of this often overlooked phenomenal woman.The book takes place in the mid 1800's and focuses on the lives of Mary Ellen Pleasant, a wealthy hotelier from California, and Annie Christmas, a young Jamaican who left her home to make a life in the United States. In addition, special attention is paid to the relationship the two women shared and their involvement in the abolitionist movement. The story is not told in a linear fashion; instead the author takes readers back and forth in time. In addition, the story is told from through the voices of several different characters in a series of vignettes. The result is a complex and richly detailed story told with a strong literary flair.I thoroughly enjoyed FREE ENTERPRISE; it is a thought-provoking and enjoyable tale. It is a weighty read, and requires full attention and thought. As Michelle Cliff alternates from time to time, place to place, and voice to voice, she provides intricate details that when woven together result in a powerful tale. I particularly loved the fact that all of the major characters in the book were women, and that the author depicted them as strong, intelligent and well-rounded, especially considering the time period in which the story took place. FREE ENTERPRISE is a well-written, literary read with strong female characters, and a pleasant mixture of history and creativity. This is the kind of book you could read several times and each time take something new away; definitely a story to savor.Reviewed by Stacey Seayof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Free Enterprise: A Novel","review":"Michelle Cliff has an uncanny ability to make the reader feel the characters' emotions. This book is definitely not for the passive reader, but for those who want to walk away enlightened and changed, which is what good historical fiction is meant to do.

She sounded like a fascinating person, and I was eager to learn more. Unfortunately, I found this book pretty disappointing. A few of my beefs:1. Despite the subtitle, Mary Ellen Pleasant is a relatively minor character in the book. Considerably more space is devoted to Annie, a different fictional (I think) character. Pleasant's (short) wikipedia article contains more information and gives a better picture of who she was than this entire book.2. Pretty lacking in the plot department, which seems unusual for historical fiction.3. The modern writing style & turns of phrase seemed jarring in a book set in 1850-1920. A skilled wordsmith may have made it work, but I was not impressed by the prose.Perhaps Cliff was going for something along the lines of Toni Morrison's Beloved -- a meditation on slavery inspired by a historical figure. But Toni Morrison she is not, and this book does not do justice to a person as intriguing as Mary Ellen Pleasant."},{"Title":"GOWER STREET","review":"historical set against the sprawling London of the early years of the last century, Gower Street magnificently re-creates the turbulent life of the theater and the medical world of the time as it follows the careers of two ambitious &quot;guttersnipes&quot; who seek to make their fortune: Abel Lackland whose foray into body snatching awakens him to an interest in the sinister new art of surgery, and Lilith Lucas, born Lil Burnell, who will let nothing stand in the way of her rising to be queen of the English stage. ...some mystery and some romance in this one.

Its medical section goes well beyond that found in most first aid books. It correctly assumes that paramedics and doctors are not a phone call away. It also provides information on starting fires, cooking, building emergency shelter, water, snaring and simple crude traps, fishing, preparing game, backpacking, hygiene, and much other useful information. Information is presented concisely. The book is well illustrated with line type drawings -- no photographs or colored pictures. If you do not already have this type of information, this book would be a good buy.Now for the deficiencies. It lacks information on weaponry (guns, knives, improvise, etc.) or self-defense (with and without weapons). Both are essential to survival, especially for urban survival. It has no information on surviving roaming hordes, which is highly important in an urban survival situation.The book does have a chapter on evasion. This type of information is missing from most wilderness survival books, which assume that you want to be found. However, his evasion information is for a rural or wilderness setting. He does not cover evasion for an urban setting.The title claims that it is an urban survival guide. Although much of the information presented can be used in an urban setting, they are really mostly useful in a rural or wilderness setting. An urban survival guide should include information on surviving societal breakdown, riots, curfews, martial law, police state tactics, intermitting and erratic utilities, etc.It also fails to explain or provide tips on washing oneself, clothing, dishes, etc. with highly limited amounts of water, which was common knowledge before running waterBecause of its size, this is not a book to carry in the backpack.

I bought this before 2005 when my daughter was going to UConn. It still applies this year, 2012 when my son starts college. Key chapter - the one that tells you to get your AGI, adjusted gross income, below $ 50,000. That is key. Works like a charm. Get that number low by creating a few small businesses. Sell stuff on craigslist or ebay? That's your small business. Write kids books? Sell Avon? Keep those receipts, save that gas station charge. Those IRS Schedule C's can bring your AGI just a few thousand down to where you need it to be. And yes. Your child will suddenly get Pell grants, subsidized loans, etc. I'm not saying cheat. I'm saying be smart, do what it takes for a few years for your income to be low and it will help your college finances. Schedule A deductions do not work the same way. Scholarships are good, but for every 30 your child fills out, they may get 3 or 4. And they are time consuming from finding them, to writing essays, to getting whatever they want into the application. College kids don't always have time to apply. So, I highly recommend this book to give you a clue into how the whole financial aid process works. I hope a new edition will encourage kids not to leave school with $ 50,000 or more in debt.

The Art of Florence is truly a masterpiece..."},{"Title":"Art of Florence","review":"This is one of those books I wish I could give six or even seven starts. This is not only a book about great art; it is itself a beautiful work of art. The care lavished in making this book shows from the beautifully decorated slipcase to the wonderfully textured covers (my kids say they feel furry), to its large format and glorious reproductions. There are many foldouts showing large-scale works in broad sweep and even full-page reproductions of details of works shown in the book.While the artwork shown is dazzling to the eye and overwhelming to the mind, the articles illuminating the works are first rate as well. One really nice feature of the articles is that there are marginal listings of the plates and figures discussed in each paragraph so it is easy to find text related to the images in which you are interested.There are two volumes and over 1,300 pages. Volume 1 begins with a brief essay on Florence's prelude to greatness (59 B.C. 0 A.D. 1200). Then the book is organized into sections of varying size: Civic Price and Prosperity (1200 - 1340), An Age of Crisis (1340-1400), Images of a Free Republic (The Early 15th Century), and The Era of Cosimo De' Medici (1430-69). Volume two has: Lorenzo Il Magnifico (1469-92), The End of the Republic (1492-1530, and ends with The Medicean Principate (1530 - c. 1600). Each of these larger sections is organized in the same way - Architecture, then sculpture, and then painting. It is quite fascinating to watch how tastes and techniques evolve over the centuries.There is also a glossary, bibliography, a section on the photographer and authors, an index and photo credits.This isn't a book you will likely read from beginning to end. It is almost an ocean you will want to spend time exploring for years in order to take in all that it has to offer. It is almost impossible to not take away something new every time you open its magnificent pages. This is a real treasure for your library.

THE ART OF FLORENCE does full justice to its subject -- and it's a lot cheaper than plane fare to Italy.The last time I was in Italy I witnessed three muggings, one in the Church of Santa Maria Novella, and those experiences were so unnerving that I couldn't fully concentrate on the loveliness of the many treasures before me. I barely remember any of them. So what a delight to discover so many of them in stunning full-color plates, to be enjoyed again and again in the comfort and safety of my own home.The dual volume book is divided into historical sections of about a generation each in length. Each begins with a lucid account of the history of the city during that period with emphasis on the political, social and economic events that influenced the patronage of art at that time. There are separate accounts of the architecture, sculpute and painting done in each period. A rich and exciting interplay unfolds between the arts, the politics and the social structure of each time period. No wonder Florence was the artistic and political leader for all of Europe during the 13th through 16th centuries.The authors confine themselves to Florentine artists or those who lived for some time in Florence. References to other artists, when necessary, are minimal. Michaelangelo, for instance, is discussed only in terms of the Dona Madonna, since it is the only painting of his in the city. His limning of the Sistine Chapel in Rome is mentioned only in passing.These two volumes are special -- so special they'll draw you to the reading chair even when the siren of Spring calls through your window."},{"Title":"Art of Florence","review":"An amazing book! Elegant, informative, photos and history that just won't quit. The only downside is that this book (there are 2 volumes actually) is so large it is hard to manage. I got a copy for my 10 year old granddaughter for a trip we are taking this Summer.

The amount of detail in both the written word and stunning photographs brings Florentine art to life.

These discourses can be a little dry but they are enlightening. The photography will certainly recapture ones interest when the text gets a little dull."},{"Title":"Art of Florence","review":"I read the set when flat on my back with an illness. I was somewhat familiar with a few of the signature works, but knew nothing of the history of the period, or of the details of the artist's lives. I can honestly say I enjoyed every page. The text was informative, but did not make you feel that you had to skim over a lot of of academic and technical information of interest only to scholars. On the other hand it was far from a \\"survey\\" or \\"highlights\\" book. I feel the best aspect was the broad historical scope. It takes in several hundred years. One excellent feature was the amount of space given to architecture. You learn of the processes of problem solving that went into the construction of the iconic church dome. Another helpful feature of this book is that the pictures and the text are close, so you don't need to flip back and forth. For anyone who is not an art historian, or a specialist in Renaissance history, these books will provide hours of delight, new insights on every page, and a thirst to learn more. For me the best feature of the book was the scope of the historical progression. The lives of the artists were influenced by external events, such as wars, and created their masterpieces under a variety of circumstances. They also had a profound influence on one another. The books are not something to dip into here and there, but are like a long Russian novel, rewarding in the scope as well as the details."},{"Title":"Art of Florence","review":"As far as I know, this is the most complete sum ever published on the Tuscan art capital.

You will be glad that you did."},{"Title":"Look-Alikes Christmas: The More You Look, the More You See!","review":"This book is unbelievably creative. My daughters, ages 6-10, pour over the pages for hours each year at Christmas time. I have no idea why the 1-star reviewers are so concerned about a bra being used in the opening scene. It's an inanimate object, people! If it were a seductive woman wearing a bra, yes - I too would be highly concerned. But it's an image of snow capped mountains in the distance that are actually made out of a bra. Seriously, the author's creations are ingenious. Don't miss out!

Some people think Look-Alikes involve trick photography, but Steiner assures readers this is not the case. Most of her sets measure four to five feet across, in fact! The painstaking process of the perfectionistic Steiner often takes years. She admits that it took her THREE and a HALF YEARS to complete Look-Alikes Christmas! WOW...that's dedication!I'm totally intrigued by the Look-Alikes books (we have two), and LOVE trying to spot all of the elements. Look-Alikes are similar to the I SPY books, but don't have the riddles. And, the items aren't so much \\"concealed\\" as they are so seemlessly integrated that you don't realize (at first!) what you're looking at! For example, in the Nutcracker scene, one look at Uncle Drosselmeyer's outfit and nothing really stands out. However, upon closer inspection, you realize that the flowing orange lining to his black cape is actually a Dorito!There are ten lavish sets in the book, each spanning two pages:*Winter Wonderland - A snowy outdoor scene (The skeleton draped in a bra is bizarre and a poor choice for this scene.)*The Nutcracker - Dolls come alive in this indoor scene. Look closely--the curtains are made of hair!*Santa's Workshop - What looks to be a fake nose serves as Mrs. Claus's cap, while orange Circus Peanuts double as elf shoes!*Grandma's Kitchen - It's obvious that Grandma's apron is a dollar bill, but did you notice that the \\"spoon\\" the granchild is using to lick the batter out of the bowl is, in fact, a Q-tip?*Christmas Windows - Shoppers stroll outdoors, gazing at delightful holiday windows. Women's purses are made up of a lock, a fig newton, a postage stamp, and a packet of pepper. How cool is that?!*Cathedral - Jellybeans and suckers double as stained glass windows, while vertical bullets (?!) stand in the center of the church.*Dollhouse - Dental floss as a water closet, a loofah sponge as a hamper, a wooden switch plate as a table top, and a jar of nailpolish as a lamp bottom.*Toy Train - A loaf of bread does time as a tunnel, while dry spiral pasta makes a neat bow for a present under the tree.*New year's Eve - A skyscraper made out of a computer keyboard, radiator, and crossword puzzle makes a great background for a bright celebration.If you love the I SPY or Where's Waldo? books, you'll love the Look-Alikes books by Joan Steiner. I'm partial to the Christmas one, I think, because it was the first one I bought! My 8 year old, a train buff, likes the original because guess what's on the cover? Yep, a train!"},{"Title":"Look-Alikes Christmas: The More You Look, the More You See!","review":"My family has owned and LOVED the first book for 4 years now.Our sons (now ages 10 and 8 years) still look at the first book and beg us to play what our family calls \\"The wacky game\\"(one person is \\"IT\\" and spots something on a page in the book while everyone else has their backs turned , and the challenge is on).When I saw this second book I thought it would be the perfect family Christmas Eve present.Boy was I WRONG!Our whole family was so dissapointed at how unchallenging the pictures where put together.We've look at it for a total of 15 mins and it's sat on the book shelf ever since.I must say that we STILL enjoy the first book and it's always under one of the boys's pillows."},{"Title":"Look-Alikes Christmas: The More You Look, the More You See!","review":"Creative book.

It's absolutely perfect for the holiday season. The pages are so full of fun objects. Some of the objects are so interesting (including the bra and the skeleton). While you may think those objects are too adult for children, I think that's because we look at them as an adult. Children look at a bra and it's just a garment. So I didn't have a particular problem with that. I would absolutely recommend this series for some interactive fun with your child!"},{"Title":"Look-Alikes Christmas: The More You Look, the More You See!","review":"This book is very clever, the artist uses various objects in a 3D collage to create several Christmastime scenes: Winter Wonderland, The Nutcracker, Santa's Workshop, Grandma's Kitchen, Christmas Windows, Cathedral, Dollhouse, Toy Train, New Year's Eve.

John is the only one left at home and he changes his plans of going away to school to stay and help his mother. This is a collection of his stories/memories of that time, one or two of which I think are also told (although a bit differently) in his other books. And this one explains why you won't find Adenville on any maps (if it ever existed, that is).For those who love \\"The Great Brain\\" series by J. D. Fitzgerald, this is more of the same sweet stories, although a bit more grown-up. The boys all get married in the course of the stories, but only J. D. (who is telling the stories) is mentioned much. Mostly the stories revolve around Mamma and her boarders. Earnest Dawson, the orphan taken in by the Fitzgeralds, and Uncle Will and Uncle Mark are also prominent. But without the children's perspective, the stories don't have the same \\"youthful\\" feel as \\"The Great Brain\\" or \\"Papa Married a Mormon,\\" and the story-telling sometimes feels a bit \\"wooden.\\" This is not to say it's not good or worth reading, just that it's different from those earlier books and doesn't have the same feel or level of humor. Still, a wonderful book to read.. if you can find it!"},{"Title":"Mamma's Boarding House","review":"John D. Fitzgerald produced a bibliography of over three hundred publications; yet in Utah where he was born, the literary community has rarely commented on his work. Because his books appeal chiefly to children, they are basically unknown to the state's over-thirty citizens, most of whom wrongly associate his name with the writer of The Great Gatsby, F. Scott Fitzgerald. At his passing in May 1988, only an obituary in the Salt Lake Tribune acknowledged the event. Yet to thousands of readers in the United States, England, and Germany he is a well known author. The Great Brain character in Fitzgerald's series for children is as familiar as Tom Sawyer to these young people.To relax in the evenings Fitzgerald began Papa Married a Mormon as a family history about his boyhood. He said, \\"I was dumbfounded when it was accepted by Prentice-Hall and even more dumbfounded when it became a best seller.\\" In the tradition of the culture it depicted, five trunks of souvenirs, carefully labeled by his mother, formed the basis of the book. Its creation was a tribute to her. Possibly critics of Mormon literature find it difficult go give importance to what some have labeled as a family memoir."},{"Title":"2001 Poet's Market (Poet's Market, 2001)","review":"All right, I can already hear y'all saying &quot;I bought last year's edition, do I need this year's edition too?&quot;The answer is, of course, YES!You need it because things in the writing world are changing even more rapidly than they ever were, exponentially since poetry went online.

Many publishers will just answer that your poetry is great but... they have a list of future publications for the next 3,4,5, .... 100 years. I also wasted quite a lot of money on contests, before learning that many of them are just rip-off ones...Not only the addresses were wrong but most emails on the book were wrong too.I admire the work that has gone and goes in preparing this book, but it's a complete waste of time. In the time of the internet you can do just a lot more in less time, and it will cost you much less. Many magazines, even the printed ones, accept submissions by email, and if they don't you'll find an updated address on their site. Besides that, there are thousands of e-zine sites where you can get great exposure, that, in spite of bad reputation, will get you more readers than the most popular printed poetry magazines.

However, Turkish position is not known at all in general public. Book starts with creation of the Republic of Cyprus. Then follows the path of conflict as intercommunal hostalities of 1963, separation of communities under their separate administrations, then distruction of 1960 constitution by Greek Cypriots with reasoning of &quot;doctrine of necessity&quot;. Then it reaches Greek &quot;coup d'etat&quot; of 1974. As a result of it Turkish intervention of 1974. The book then discuss the legal base of intervention, the Treaty of Guarantee, and then constitutional proposal from both communities, diccussions about a future federation for Cyprus. Then books examines 1980 talks, role of United Nations, principle of self-determination, creation of Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in 1983, and issues about state and recognition. Even it is written by a Turkish Cypriot, author based his opinions to legal documents, UN reports, reports from international press and sometimes to Greek Cypriot press. It is a very well structured book from a lawyer. Therefore, I suggest this book to everybody who interested to &quot;Cyprus Question&quot; and looking for a different approach to it."},{"Title":"The Cyprus Question and the Turkish Position in International Law","review":"Necatigil has written a most valuable resource for the ongoing reality on the island of Cyprus.

Also it is a fine interpretation of an issue, which offers not so obvious underlying implications, thus is solely enlightening and encourages the reader to come to an opinion on a contraversey and debate. It is ultimately scientific in that it is objective relying on realtiy rather than on petty opinions. I had read this book in the course of acedemic research, along with numerous other authors writing on the subject. By far, this is the book I would choose to maintain in my own library, if one is searching for a complete history and analysis of the Cyprus Conflict.

Almost all of her books are terrific and Brat Farrar is the best of the bunch. Less precious than Sayers, Tey writes every bit as well and has an eye for description. She writes about mysteries in every day life among the privileged, although not aristocratic, class. This book is very clever, involving a lost heir and an appealing imposter. The author lets you know right away who the &quot;bad guy&quot; is, but what he did and how he did it are only slowly revealed. This book shares a theme with two other of Tey's mysteries (which I don't want to spoil by telling more of the plot ) Miss Pym Disposes and The Franchise Affair. I enthusiastically recommend all three."},{"Title":"Army Life in a Black Regiment","review":"Those familiar with the critical role that the recruitment of black troops into the Union Armies in the American Civil War usually think about the famous Massachusetts 54th Regiment under Robert Gould Shaw which has received wide attention in book, film and sculpture. And those heroic fighters deserve those honors. Glory, indeed. However, other units were formed from other regions that are also noteworthy. And none more so than the 1st South Carolina Volunteers commanded by the arch-abolitionist Theodore Higginson one of John Brown's most fervent supporters and an early advocate of arming the slaves during the Civil War. He desperately wanted to lead armed blacks in battle and got his wish.I have remarked elsewhere (in a review of William Styron's Confessions of Nat Turner)that while the slaves in the South, for a host of reasons, did not insurrect with the intensity or frequency of say Haiti, the other West Indian islands or Brazil that when the time came to show discipline, courage and honor under arms that blacks would prove not inferior to whites. And Higginson's book is prima facie evidence for that position.One should note that, unlike the Massachusetts 54th which was made up primarily of freedman the 1st South Carolina was made up of units of fugitive and abandoned slaves. Thus, one should have assumed that it would have been harder to train and discipline uneducated and much-abused slaves. Not so. After reading a number of books on the trials and tribulations of various Union regiments, including the famous Irish Brigade, the story Higginson tells compares very favorably with those units. While Higginson's use of \`negro' dialect in the telling of his story which may not be to the liking of some of today's \`politically correct' readers of this book it is nevertheless a story worth reading told by a \`high' abolitionist and Civil War hero."},{"Title":"Army Life in a Black Regiment","review":"But Higginson was really more of an abolitionist. One of the secret six IIRC. His regiment, the 1st South Carolina, made up of \\"contrabands\\" from the sea isles and low country of South Carolina, was relegated mostly to garrison and picketing duties near Beaufort and Hilton Head. The action they saw with Higgonson in command was limited to a few up river raids in SC and FL, and the occupation of Jacksonville FL for a short time. Higginson spends many pages with comparisons of the black and white troops, and engages in descriptions of his soldiers that seem to be directed at a circa 1860s New Englander who had never before seen many black folk. This book also contains one of the earliest known collections of slave songs.Much of the book is lengthy detailed descriptions of rather trivial camp events, such the visit of a fellow officers wife and child, or a night swim Higginson took between the lines. Higginson gives here no details of his personal life or experience before joining the regiment, or after (this book first published in 1869.)I would recommend this book if it's narrow perspective falls within a specific interest of the reader."},{"Title":"Army Life in a Black Regiment","review":"Black men not only had to endure decades of slavery in the United States, they were also called upon to shed blood in order to end it. For that, \\"Army Life In A Black Regiment\\" would seem to carry the potential to be very moving, yet an inert narration by the regiment's stodgy commander and an absence of overall incident make for a dull read.The first regiment of black volunteers to serve the Union cause in the Civil War was the First South Carolina, or \\"Fus Souf\\" as it was called. It was led by Thomas Wentworth Higginson, an abolitionist supporter of John Brown with orders to use the regiment as the nucleus for an army of freed slaves with which to harass the enemy from parts well south of the Mason-Dixon Line. Higginson didn't quite manage to rally thousands of slaves to his cause, though his force acquitted themselves well in skirmishes and strategic maneuvers along the Deep South coast.For Higginson, the cause was about more than ending slavery. It was showing white Americans that blacks were as able to defend a common flag and serve a common cause, even if the government was playing games with their pay. Most of his troops were native South Carolinians born into slavery: \\"There were more than a hundred men in the ranks who had voluntarily met more dangers in their escape from slavery than any of my young [white] captains had incurred in all their lives.\\"Higginson deserves respect for putting his life on the line in service of his belief in human equality. Yet I don't think he understood his troops. When he's not making patronizing comments about \\"my dusky soldiers,\\" he's offering vague generalities about how they conduct themselves. An early incident in camp when a non-pious soldier tells his more religious comrades he can do without the spirit of the Lord so long as he can \\"die a good sojer wid de last kick\\" suggests a broader view of black people than the rest of the narrative offers. For the most part, Higginson is content to note his troops' more docile qualities, or how they are growing to be more like white men, \\"less naive and less grotesque,\\" a remark like too many others he leaves unexplained.Granted, docking a fighting abolitionist for political incorrectness is unfair. Maybe if he offered more action to distract me, I would have been more accepting. But the truth of the matter is Higginson seems to have had a quiet war. There's a scene in the movie \\"Glory\\" where the main character, like Higginson a Union commander of a black regiment, tells his superiors he wants his soldiers to be tested in combat, not just given backwater duty. Higginson seems more content keeping his men safe.He fills his book with stories about such matters as a late-night swim near enemy lines, a riverboat journey that goes slightly awry, and looking after a baby in the camp. The last story ends in a strangely cruel \\"by-the-way\\" fashion, but there is little else here to capture our interest. Higginson doesn't even seem to know his men, identifying few by name and always in the most general fashion.The First South Carolina fought well, and just by existing made a statement about basic human value and a worthy cause. But one reads in vain for a story that gives you something more, of a command finding its place in a larger struggle, or a commander discovering deeper truths about himself and his fellow man."},{"Title":"Army Life in a Black Regiment","review":"i was not sure what expect when i first started reading this book. soon i found it captavated my interest.

OK, I'll admit I haven't read all the other accounts, but this one gives all the information any interested person needs to know about the trial without getting mired in needless detail. Plus it's written in narrative style and the Tusa's personal observations are side splittingly funny at times (Hard to imagine for such a serious topic, but they do it)The book begins before the actual trial and details the discussions that the four powers had about the trial - what the scope of it would be, which countries would be represented, what the charges would be, who would fund it etc... The actual pre-trial preparation was such a mammoth task and this book helps the reader appreciate the difficulties facing the judges, lawyers and administrative staff.After this introduction, we get a view of the prosecution and defence teams and the judges. The Tusas have done an excellent job by bringing us behind the scenes of the actual trail and getting us up close and personal with the 'stars' at the trial. They help us understand where the judges are coming from and how the different systems make it difficult for them to agree on certain aspects of the trial - very accessible to those who aren't lawyers.What is the more interesting part of this book is the character studies of the various defendants. The Tusas have succeeded in making these men come alive. I was reminded of the movie Nuremburg with Alec Baldwin when I read the description of Goering and Speer. (Incidentally that would be an excellent movie to watch after reading this book.). The cases against these men are explained both from the prosecution and the defence side. Heavy sarcasm lightens the mood especially when some of the heinous crimes are described; it is amazing the blatant lies that some of these 'leaders' told when faced with their crimes.There is a short section on the case against Organizations; the SS, SA, Gestapo etc... which is followed by the verdicts and the executions. I think that this book is fairly unbiased and factual (there are references at the end of each chapter and it's from the BBC J ) I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the second world war and especially the part that the Germans played in it."},{"Title":"The Nuremberg Trial","review":"I first became familiar with the Tusas' study in 1985 while covering Argentina's \\"mini-Nuremberg\\" trial of the three military juntas that ruled in Buenos Aires from 1976 to 1982 for Newsweek and the Washington Post.It is a wonderfully written, comprehensive study, really the best I have read on the subject either before or after. I recommend it without hesitation for all those interested in the trial itself, its effects on international law, or anyone who is just trying to make sense out of the murky period in which we now live.Martin Edwin AndersenChurchton, Maryland"},{"Title":"The Nuremberg Trial","review":"This book is well written and informative. If your goal is to know about the Nuremberg Trial, or if you're a lawyer studying issues that arise in conducting international tribunals, you'll enjoy this book and it'll be five stars for you! If you're looking for an exciting book on WWII or the aftermath of that war, you'll probably be a bit bored with portions of this book and at best think it's worth three stars.Best parts of the book deal with the opening and closing statements at the trial, testimony and cross examination of Goering, Speer, etc, the deliberations of the judges, the verdict and subesquent executions, including the mystery of how Goering got the cyanide the night he was to be hanged in order to commit suicide.What might bore you if you're not a lawyer is the international law stuff, so I'll give the book four stars."},{"Title":"The Nuremberg Trial","review":"You need not be a lawyer to understand this account of the first of it's kind &#34;war crimes&#34; trial. The background information alone is worth an entire book. What many people fail to realize is that it took months of hard work by dedicated lawyers to figure out complex issues, the least of which is the fact that the tribunal was not sure if they had the authority to conduct the trial. This is one of several issues faced by the tribunal and the authors have brought each to life."},{"Title":"The Nuremberg Trial","review":"There is no doubt that the Tusas' exhaustive account is factual and complete in its telling of the Nuremberg tribunal. Yet, the British authors allow an obvious bias for the decisions of the British delegation at Nuremberg to creep into many parts of the book. Perhaps this may be the result of the voluminous records retained by the British in comparison to their Allied partners (thus giving the Tusas more to write about when it came to the British effort). Whatever the reason, the Americans, French, and Russians end up (unfairly) appearing as mere bystanders.It is also worth noting that some chapters should have been simplified into a few pages; these areas can be rather cumbersome."},{"Title":"The Nuremberg Trial","review":"Exhaustive discussion of the Nuremberg Trials of the surviving Nazi leaders after World War II. While parts were a bit tedious, the set up to the trial was quite interesting - lots of fighting and disagreements amongst the Allies on how to do things, and especially foreshadows the future disputes with the USSR.Some of the Nazi leaders come across as somewhat human; those that were hung certainly didn't. Doenitz was quite interesting to read about.Recommended."},{"Title":"The Nuremberg Trial","review":"The authors give a full account of this historical trial. I had no background knowledge of the Nuremberg Trial, and I found this book easy to read as well as complete and detailed enough.

But there was a lot about the defendants and other information that I did find interesting. So, if you're not a lawyer, just skim over the details that don't interest you and, with the rest, learn something about this time in history that I hope is never repeated in the future!"},{"Title":"The Nuremberg Trial","review":"While I have had a long interest in the Second World War, this book was a little too much for me. It didn't really appeal to me until chapter 8. Even then there were only three of the defendants that kept my attention: Goering, Doenitz and Speer. I did a lot of page skipping until the end, which did have a brief bio of each on the defendants. A lawyer might get more out of the general presentation. Not my cup of tea."},{"Title":"The Nuremberg Trial","review":"If you are truly interested in the Neurimburg trials, this is a good source of information of the day to day details of the lawyers, evidence, and process of the trial; however it gets tedious after a while."},{"Title":"The Nuremberg Trial","review":"I have to admit I have not finished this book yet. I have read other books on this subject though and its a interesting take on \\"the Trials\\". Its a much more international view, less American only oriented and begins at the inception of the idea of a trial. The book seems to be a very good view of the legal and international journey to the trial, the defendants attitudes and lives at the time and the proceedings.I have to admit Ive found a few things that sound a bit more like opinion ..then fact ( which most is). I question some of the word choices for descriptions of how some of the American lawyers bungled their parts or did inadequate jobs.Its not an easy read...but then most books that cover this subject wouldnt be, nor would historical subject books that arent fiction."},{"Title":"The Nuremberg Trial","review":"...for ther history buff. This is nicely written detail about a trial that should not be forgotten. The process of forming the judicial panel and selecting the prosecutorial and defense teams speaking different languages and coming from differing legal systems was most interesting to a modern reader who knew the trial took place but gave it no thought. It delineates personality traits for major characters brought to justice for the excesses of the Nazi regime. The trial process formed the basis for international courts of law that now routinely hold accountable former leaders responsible for war crimes and crimes against humaity."},{"Title":"The Nuremberg Trial","review":"I am glad this book was only two bucks, as I found it to be virtually unreadable.

I'm rating on the low end as a heads up for bad formatting of the current file version and would love to be able to revise this if / when a corrected file is released. I would have enjoyed the book thoroughly if it seemed that an actual human had proof read the e-version. Many (and it feels like most) of the dates, foreign phrases and a goodly number of the names have obvious OCR scanning errors. Those really do interfere with reading enjoyment, even though ii September is not difficult to translate. 11 September would be so much smoother. I clipped the typos, and sent an email requesting the file be corrected and re-released.That said, and knowing the formatting is correctable by the publisher, this is a fascinating treatment of the trial and context.Yes, it is geared to the legal crowd, not so much to a general audience, but that's a very valid approach, and one I happen to appreciate and applaud. I had not read such a clear treatment of the jurisdictional and conceptual difficulties of setting up the trial until this book."},{"Title":"The Nuremberg Trial","review":"Finally there is a readable book which gives a comprehensive legal background to the trials. Even the discussion of earlier views on war crimes (such as after WW1)is germane and helpful. If you'd like to actually understand these trials,you will appreciate and likely be fascinated by the many details; otherwise, not. As demonstrated by the range of reviews here, more than anything else, the number of stars mainly reflects the reasons a reader chose the book. Objectively speaking, this book rates a minimum of 4-1/2 stars."},{"Title":"The Nuremberg Trial","review":"This chronicle of International Military Tribunal is a must read since the Tribunal created the system of justice under which those who start aggressive wars and commit war crimes are prosecuted today. The difficult task faced by the tribunal and the prosecution to meld then existing international law, the Civil Law and the Common Law into a just, workable system is explained in terms a layperson can understand. The characterization of the personalities involved is extremely well done as well as the descriptions of the logistics problems inherent in conducting a trial in four languages simultaneously.

If you can see past this major flaw I would definitely recommend the book to everyone looking to learn about the first Nuremberg trial, how it all came about, what went into having it, difficulties with conducting the trial, the trial itself, and the outcome. I did have to write myself a cheat sheet with the names, positions, and crimes of the defendants which can be easily found in the back of the book. In fact if you do choose this book I suggest you look at the back first to get a good overview of the charges and defendants, it will add greatly to your understanding."},{"Title":"The Nuremberg Trial","review":"A good review of the Nuremburg trials, short and concise by my standards.

I was hoping it would be about the trials them selves"},{"Title":"The Nuremberg Trial","review":"This was a very carefully researched, thoughtfully organized, and extraordinarily well-written account of a very difficult and challenging end to a horrendous war carried out by a cruel and remorseless regime. The authors thoughtfully analyze and explain the conflicting politics behind the desires of the victorious Allies to bring and demonstrate justice to those who instigated and prosecuted the war. They explain the difficulties of melding very different legal and governmental systems to create an international tribunal. They explain the difficulties of basing a trial on pre-existing law rather than trying people based on laws created after the fact. They explain the logistical nightmare of conducting a meaningful trial in which the participants spoke different languages and came from different cultures and different justice systems. They explain the need to give the defendants a meaningful opportunity to defend themselves and, equally important, to create an environment in which those defendants might feel that they had a fair opportunity to defend themselves. They give us fascinating thumbnail sketches of the major characters--the defendants, the lawyers, and the judges. And they do all this in an articulate and light-hearted manner with flashes of humor. I am a lawyer, and I found the analyses of the legal issues fascinating. But I think a non-lawyer would find them fascinating too.

Could have told the story with less words, likes to repeat and tell the same story over and over. Would not recomend."},{"Title":"The Nuremberg Trial","review":"The Nuremberg TrialThere's no question that this is a definitive book on the Nuremberg Trial. It's chock full of well-researched detail on every aspect of the trial, from whether the Allied powers had jurisdiction and authority to hold the trial, to choosing defendants, to locating, organizing, publicizing, and implementing the trial itself, all the context of a war-torn international environment and a bombed-out city with little left in the way of infrastructure (food, transporation, communication, etc).The tedious detail of the writing reminded me of Einhorn's book You Can Fool Some of the People, since that book was also written in a detailed and legally precise \\"this is what happened, this is what X said, then this happened, etc\\". Probably all books that report such precise detail on a story that takes place over time would have such a flavor. So in a sense, you can't fault the book or the authors for the endless detail inherent in good coverage of so many aspects of a story as complex as the Nuremberg one. I'm just saying this book is definitely not an easy read, and definitely does not have a strong narrative or plot line (although it does have a few characters developed).The content of the book was very good. I came away with a much deeper understanding of the problems and issues of the time, on many topics from the legal basis for the trial to the logistics of supporting a cast of a thousand people or more during the trial. The trial was a big job, as was the book -- you certainly get your money's worth of pages in this one!There were a few mentions of various atrocities carried out by the Germans during the war, but the book does not focus on those things. (For example, the A Convenient Hatred book contains many more stories of deaths and atrocities.) So this book is not filled with details on Hazi atrocities -- It properly concentrates on the trial itself. The book says 12M people at a minimum lost their lives in the area, including people from many different countries and religions. Another huge blot on the human history of wars and fighting.I probably would not recommend the book to an average reader because of the tedious detail and slow reading, although it would probably be a very good read for people who had a particular interest in the trial or the times. Nuremberg is certainly one of the major stories of that time in history, and the author has done an excellent job of reporting on all aspects of the trial and people involved."},{"Title":"The Nuremberg Trial","review":"There are sections of this book that are fascinating, particularly when the Tusa's detail the lives and activities of the Nazis on trial. There are sections that greatly disturb. Even if you think the horrors of Nazism have all been learned, being reminded of some of the evil brings about new terror and pain. And there are sections when the narration seems to bog down in legal details, arguments, and discussions. Lawyers specializing in international law would find these sections to their liking. All is all, an excellent study of the trial and the people involved in it but, be warned, it can be ponderous at times."},{"Title":"Psychology and Industrial Efficiency","review":"Munsterberg's approach to psychology is to answer common questions through psychological experimentation. This book is split into three parts, each dedicated to an aspect of industrial psychology: finding the right employee for the job, procuring the best performance of the job, and obtaining the most effective end result. Although nearly 100 years have passed since the original publication of this book, and some of the terminology and social conceptions have changed (i.e. women in the workforce), this work by Munsterberg remains relevant. Industry is ever changing and therefore the ways that people interact with it also stands to be changed from time to time in the interest of efficiency. I highly recommend this book for students of psychology."},{"Title":"Dictionary of Retailing and Merchandising","review":"New to the retail industry I felt this was a book that I just had to have. It is exactly what you would expect it to be. Laid out in the same format as a regular dictionary this book provides concise but sufficient definions of regularly occuring words in retailing (iceburg principal, planogram, INP etc).

This collection, however, captures so many of the nuances and back stories that make the game of hockey so incredibly unique. E.M. Swifts piece titled \\"A Reminder Of What We Can Be\\" is my favorite hockey story ever. I was a 15 year old hockey player at the time the United States beat the Soviet Union and I remember following that team in the papers all winter. When the big game was tape delayed, I was so disappointed because I had a game that night and we didn't have a VCR back then. One of the fathers had a B&W; television going in the penalty box and although we new the outcome, both teams decided to stop play and huddle around that television to watch the 3rd period. We hugged and high fived as if we had beaten the mighty Russians ourselves. That moment in time was a rare convergence of what is great about life and hockey. E.M. Swift clearly understands the meaning.\\"Facing The Shooter\\" by Wilkinson is a fantastic account of what its really like to play the most stressful position in sports, hockey goaltender.This book may be a bit difficult for younger readers to get through and grasp, but older fans will appreciate the depth and quality of the writing."},{"Title":"The Greatest Hockey Stories Ever Told: The Finest Writers on Ice","review":"Quibbles first: I don't know if anyone can fairly claim to have collected \\"The Greatest Hockey Stories Ever Told.\\" There are far too many to fit in one volume, and no matter how varied your selection, you're going to miss several stories that some diehard hockey fan somewhere will gripe about. (Which is why I'm going to end my complaint there.)That said, please don't make the mistake I did and assume that this book will fall short of your expectations. Urstadt's collection is worth every penny. From 1980's \\"Miracle on Ice\\" to junior hockey in Flin Flon, Manitoba, Urstadt has managed to capture the many sides of the game, offering blow-by-blow accounts of hockey games from around the world--including Romania and Corpus Christi, Texas. (Believe it or not, they're actually quite similar.)There are highlights, including Red Fisher's memories of Hector \\"Toe\\" Blake; \\"The Style of the Man\\" by Hugh Hood, which uses near-scientific poetry to describe the graceful ferocity of Jean Beliveau; and Jeff Robinson's painfully accurate take on the hockey fan. Yet, almost every selection will have you flipping to the back of the book, looking with hope to see if it was merely an excerpt. (I myself have added several books to my wish list thanks to this volume.)The one disappointment, oddly enough, is a short article by William Faulkner (\\"An Innocent at Rinkside\\") originally printed in Sports Illustrated. It's clear that Faulkner didn't understand and didn't like hockey, and in the end, he uses his presence at Madison Square Gardens to question the common practice of beginning sports events with the national anthem.

Soul refers to the whole person, including the body, but with particular focus on the inner world of thinking, feeling, and willing. The author describes soul care through the ages, and also shows how relevant insights from modern psychology can be an integral part of this much needed activity. The description of Jesus as the model soul shepherd, the comprehensive description of what Christian spirituality is, the comparison of various forms of Christian soul care (i.e. Christian Psychotherapy, Spiritual Direction, Pastoral Care), and the guidance for both how to give and receive soul care are excellent. I would recommend this book for anyone who wants to go deeper in their relationship with God, and also for those who want to help other people to do the same."},{"Title":"Care of Souls: Revisioning Christian Nurture and Counsel","review":"In \\"Care of Souls,\\" Benner proposes to explain \\"soul care\\" in its totality. He does so by examining the ideal characteristics of soul care providers, presenting his own definition of \\"dialogue,\\" and explaining in detail the distinctiveness of \\"Christian spirituality.\\" Unlike typical counseling techniques, Benner suggests that \\"providers of soul care\\" ought to offer \\"judicious advice, suggestions or offerings of direction\\" (155). He reasons that if dialogue is based on an \\"authentic relationship of care\\" then offering \\"ideas\\" and \\"suggestions\\" are expected (155).I found the \\"seven characteristics of Christian soul care\\" helpful because I used the list to measure my own \\"qualifications\\" (207). Benner states that soul care providers should be \\"spiritually mature,\\" which includes descriptors such as \\"personal holiness\\" and \\"well-developed habits of prayer\\" (209). The term \\"personal holiness\\" seems vague because it might be misconstrued as \\"holier than thou.\\" The \\"demands of Christian soul care\\" are realistic and should be expected from all \\"soul care\\" providers (212). I think counselees expect (and deserve to get) truthfulness from the counselor; and counselors should \\"continue to grow\\" through continuing education, but more importantly they should continue to grow in their relationship with Christ in order to remain effective in their Christian counseling practices (213).I found Benner's presentation of the future dilemma of \\"soul care\\" to be very troubling. According to Benner, soul care is not clinical or therapeutic (in the secular sense). Even though it is not clinical, soul care that is provided by a lay counselor will be seen as \\"substandard\\" and if it is promoted as \\"distinctly Christian,\\" it will not be taken seriously (215). Based on Benner's suppositions, a soul care ministry would never work. His statement bothers me since this is the type of ministry I would like to start at church.Although Benner's section \\"Preparing for Soul Care\\" is meant for people who will receive care, I think there were helpful suggestions that care providers should do for themselves. For instance, Benner recommends the practice of self-reflection (or \\"contemplative prayer\\"). This is where a person can \\"sit in God's presence\\" by allowing Him to \\"fill\\" one's consciousness thus enabling \\"psychospiritual growth\\" to happen (231). This seems like a fancy way of saying that persons ought to have personal devotions and meditate on God's Word-something soul care providers should be doing. Benner also suggests writing a \\"soul care autobiography\\" whereby a person can assess how \\"internal reality\\" matches with \\"external behavior\\" (232).Providing soul care should be taken very seriously, in fact Benner lists seven \\"challenges\\" for those who wish to provide this type of care. Two challenges resonated with me: \\"Guard against the erosion of the personal in such care\\" and \\"avoid sacrificing being on the alter of doing\\" (216). Sometimes I forget that soul care is different from \\"traditional counseling.\\" In a traditional counseling situation, friendship is not encouraged or developed-there is a \\"professional attitude\\" that keeps the relationship very business-like (216). From my understanding of Benner's stance, \\"professionalism\\" (one-sided approach to counseling) is discouraged because he believes the caregiver and receiver are \\"mutually\\" caring for each other (217). I tend to think that if someone seeks care, then the person is probably not very capable of giving care, so \\"mutual care\\" is not realistic.Doing ministry due to an obligation, or forgetting the reason why one does ministry (to serve God) is probably a common problem for soul care providers, who are concerned about providing good care and meeting the needs of others. Ministry may start to feel like a chore. If the other \\"challenges\\" are met, then the focus of ministry will always be evident and soul care providers will never be drained of their \\"inner psychospiritual resources\\" nor neglect the \\"formative and transforming power\\" of the gospel (216).

However, it, like all books in its class, should NOT be applied to 'everyone'. Not every woman marries at 17 and gives up her life for her husband and 3.5 children. While it is fascinating (and probably had more validity in the 60's), and should be required reading in Psychology 201; I don't find it to be a 'harrowing triumph of the human spirit', as I have oft heard it described."},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"The Feminine Mystique is amazing. It is eloquently, but it is also an acquired taste. So to enjoy it one must enjoy the equalities and difference of men and women."},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"A few weeks back, I came across a yellowed, dog-eared copy of this aged chestnut, its hot-pink cover and ridiculous graphics clashing mightily with the somber spines of the Penguin Classics into the midst of which it had been shoehorned years ago. Opening it and settling in for a re-read, the decades rolled away, and I was transported to Pittsburgh in the early 1980s, when, as an eager young collegian, I was assigned to read this magnum opus. I won't say that a gun was actually to my temple, but back in those innocent days, one dared not utter a word of criticism about this book, for fear of being tarred, feathered, and banished forever from the nepenthean shade of tolerance cast by the academic elms.It was a strange experience. My well-fed, well-dressed, economically secure female classmates, their daddies' wealth presumably having something to do with elbowing women out of the way in the occupational rat race, spoke with moving eloquence about the domestic slavery endured by their mothers, aunts, or grandmothers in the Dark Days of the '50s. (You wouldn't believe the suffering. Back then there were no microwaves and you actually had to heat TV dinners in a conventional oven, peel back the searing-hot tinfoil, and pray that the martini-soaked old man wouldn't wallop you off your six-inch heels with a rolled-up Edsel brochure.) My male classmates were either glumly silent, or oozed a kind of sickening sycophancy, trying their damnedest to out-Phil Donahue each other. No one, to my recollection, dared to ask a question that always troubled me about this book: WHERE ARE THE VERIFIABLE FACTS??????? Other than the psychosexual flapdoodle, which has the factual substance of a kitten fart, there isn't too much here. It could be that the editors excised it in the first edition, but this book has been around for so many years that it has an ear trumpet and a gray beard the length of a tow rope. If the source information were still available, wouldn't somebody have cited it by now? Could it be that Friedan was asking her readers for a leap of faith on some really essential points? I got roundly hooted for asking these questions, but a couple of the quieter guys bought me beers. Unfortunately, they kept bringing the discussion around to Freidan's homophobia, so I withdrew to my dorm room with a copy of Aristotle's Metaphysics to catch up on my Greek.Seriously, like all books that hit the right note at the right time in the popular consciousness, this one is more a manifesto than a significant product of scholarship. Ralph Nader's &quot;Unsafe at Any Speed,&quot; is another example in the same vein. It's got heroes, villains, and distressed damsels, all served up in prose pretty much uncluttered with hard facts, statistics, footnotes, endnotes, graphs, tables, and all those other things that could cause eyestrain, make your head hurt, or give you the chance to draw your own conclusions.The changes in gender roles in the West have a hell of a lot more to do with the circumstances of our wealth and scientific progress, and how those things have rendered the older roles less relevant, than they have to do with Freidan's self confessed inability to get the shivers from pushing a mop. If you want to understand the history and outlines of gender roles in America, you can't take Friedan's word for it. You have to go look at some contemporaneous source material, and uncover what it tells us about both male and female roles. A good exercise is to read &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; and then follow it up with Warren Farrell's &quot;The Myth of Male Power.&quot; You might still sympathize with Friedan's antipathy toward housework, but hell, at least she wasn't drafted and riddled with bullet holes on the shores of Normandy."},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"I had to order this book for a History Fair Project for my daughter, it was great service.

The author is too long-winded and seems obsessed with the sexual aspect of the post-World War II American woman's problem. In my opinion she does not focus enough on the educational aspect. The book could have been condensed to half its size, and that would have made for a much better read. You could skip a page or two and not miss anything important. I found myself bored with the repetition and rushing to get through it. Basically, it's a bunch of words speckled with a profound thought every 100 pages or so.

I never knew that most women went back to the home and dropped their fight for womens rights. I am so glad I was able to read this book, not only is it one of the best books I have read, but also one of the most important, for men and women. I highly recommend this book, because it proves that women are equal and that they have every right to do whatever they choose."},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"I read this book as research for a script I am writing that is set in 1959. I wanted to get a better handle on my female characters, but I found myself on an unexpected journey of self-discovery. I was born in 1963 -- the year this book was published. On these pages I found my mother, my stepmother, my grandmothers and my aunts, but I also saw myself and my friends. Beyond general feminist theory, Ms. Friedan also touches on the issue of dehumanization of American youth, which we can see today in the mass murders being committed by today's youth. THIS BOOK SHOULD BE MANDATORY READING IN ALL AMERICAN HIGH SCHOOLS! It is an important work of social history which should not be forgotten."},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"To fully evaluate this book, you have to put it in context. You must know the history of the '50s and '60s. Given, Friedan is not particularly a good writer and is quite repetitive (I read the first chapter and felt that it could be condensed into half its size). But imagine being a housewife at that time, just 50 years or so ago, feeling dissatisfaction with daily life and not being able to convey your feelings to even your closest friends in fear of humiliation and confusion at your expense. You wonder if you're fulfilling your role in society; are you a faithful wife, a devoted mother, a committed donor to your community? What's missing, you constantly ask yourself, that you feel such restlessness and need for escape? Then you thumb through some magazines since you don't have time to sit and actually purchase books you want to read... and maybe read an excerpt from a book by some woman named Betty Friedan. The first sentence is arresting: \\"The problem lay buried, unspoken, for many years in the minds of American women.\\" What problem? What is she talking about? American women have problems? You read on and find that she has captured exactly what you've been going through for years. Why does it matter that some statements are biased or not completely justified? Someone out there UNDERSTANDS!Betty Friedan has deservingly won nationwide acclaim for her work, even though many falsely accuse her of being a left-leaning misandrist. She may be revolutionary for her time, but in no way is she male-hating or anarchist. She is bringing to light a problem people have been uneasily noticing. And yes, she is reaching out to the middle- and upper-class--anyone who can afford to stay at home or has to stay at home to be viewed as a successful woman. The poor doesn't have the same kind of problem because the women have to work. This issue does not necessarily transcend the classes and unite all women. But the media at the time hold that successful, beautiful women are housewives who live for their families and friends. They are altruistic, dutiful, and committed to loving others. Forget education; it is not a woman's role to be an intellectual--but hey! she is still equal to her husband. Just because she shouldn't be educated or working outside the home, it doesn't mean she can't orgasm making peanut-butter sandwiches for her kids. All women should be staying at home, joyfully doing their work. It is a disease to feel otherwise.THAT mindset was what Friedan was addressing. THAT mindset was what Friedan wanted to change, or at least acknowledge for the sake of others.And THAT is why this book changed lives."},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"Although Friedan's current role in the women's movement is hindered by her inability to &quot;share&quot; with other activists, this book takes the reader back to a day when she was one of the few voices to challenge pervading gender roles (even as she contended with an abusive husband)and treatment of women. While (being born in 1979) I was fortunate to have been raised without narrow gender roles, I can see where such socialization would have set previous generations up. My mother (who was an oddity because both her parents worked) does not conciously identify herself as feminist, but says this book strenghthened her independence.Most of the facts, statistics and tables are obviously outdated (and therefore unusable to support current discrimination) but there are sections of the book which should be able to carry over into the 21st century. It is worth noting that with the exception of Simmone Beavior's Second Sex, there were few books at the time calling for women to be treated like human beings and equals.Comparatively devoid of &quot;controversial&quot; issues (like GLBT rights) compared to other books, this gave Friedan the leeway needed to get her admittedly radical writting out to a larger audience. Friedan's status as a suburban middle class wife (despite her radical past with labor unionizing)gave her the protective covering necessary to raise this very important issue.Even as I personally favor Gloria Steinem (who also understood that women's rights were interconnected with that of other oppressed groups) I found a lot to admire in this book. Friedan was clearly ahead of herself on this one, and problaly was unpreppared for the wave of positive (and some newgative) responses that followed the orginal publication of this book."},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"I am a 23 yr. old woman reading a book that was written in 1963 for and about women. I thought this book would help me learn more about women's history, but it was a huge eye-opener and a complete inspiration. The chapters in this book still describe me as a young American woman almost 40 yrs. later. Every woman and man should read this book. It has completely opened my eyes."},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"First of all, I recommend everyone to read the book in order to have an idea where a lot of modern day values come from.The book recognizes a problem women (as well as all other humans) have to deal with: how to find fulfillment in life. The problem is that Friedan seems to think this problem only concerns housewives and stay at home moms, and that the problem could be solved by those women getting jobs outside the home. An interesting hypothesis, but judging by today's women, clearly wrong. There are plenty of career women that feel rather unfulfilled.She describes the problem as women slaving away to keep the house perfectly clean and the kids perfectly taken care of, and then getting depressed as a result. They do this out of a perceived societal pressure. To me, the solution seems to be to check whether this is really what their kids and husband want. In reality, probably no-one cares whether you wash the windows once per week or once per month, so you could spend that time thinking about your values in order to raise your kids as moral individuals, or learning about current events, so that you can actually have a real conversation with your husband, or reading a book for fun.Getting a job because you're feeling unfulfilled trying to outperform Martha Stewart is as much of an escape tactic as becoming an alcoholic. Being a teacher is as much \\"living through others\\" as being a mother is. Shuffling papers around like people with average office jobs doesn't intrinsically give any more fulfillment than making a healthy meal for your spouse and kids does.The book did some good in promoting equal rights for men and women, but also caused a harmful movement that indoctrinates modern girls and women that the *only* path to fulfillment is through employment, which is clearly nonsense. Housewives and mothers can be really valuable to society, which can give them a strong sense of fulfillment.Aside from the above, the research Friedan did to back up her point was rather bad and biased, with frequent misuse of statistics. A list of factual errors and omissions in her book is listed on this website:cf.en.clIn conclusion, the book is important as a historical document, but has to be approached with extreme caution.

In this role it is invaluable. However, I am having a hard time accepting that someone who rallied so courageously for the rights of one group turned right around to bash another one. Ms. Friedan tears apart the theories of Sigmund Freud to support her arguments on the role of women, but then uses them as \\"evidence\\" on how \\"deviant\\" homosexuality is. She says \\"The role of the mother in homosexuality was pinpointed by Freud\\", the same Freud she spends all of Chapter 5 tearing apart. She goes on to spew putrid bigotry, saying outrageous things like \\"The shallow unreality, immaturity, promiscuity, lack of lasting human satisfaction that characterize the homosexual's sex life usually characterize all his life and interests\\".

It opens the sparkling clean refrigerator door of Beaver Cleaver America (which only existed on TV anyhow) and shows us the moldering lettuce sitting in the crisper drawer.

Now, I think FM falls into that category of \\"Well, I have never read (or seen, or heard) it; but, since everyone talks about it a lot, it must be great, so I am going to say it is great as well without really knowing what the FUDGE I am talking about.\\" Its that good old American intellectual laziness rearing its ugly head yet again.I think FM is horribly dated. This was supposed to be an updated or special edition, but I just didn't see much of that either, except for the essays at the beginning which were very long winded. These days, in many cases, women make MORE than men as they should if they are better qualified for the job. Like I said, to me, the book was a bit of a waste of time.

This book made a tremendous impact when it was first published, and perhaps more than any other contributed to the 'Feminist Revolution' in the United States.Friedan looking at the Post- World War II American housewife did not find anything like the 'ideally happy person' that the Society advertised. Instead she found the housewife to be a frustrated human being who sacrificed her individual development and personality in order to play a subordinate role in the family drama.She did not call for the end of marriage, or the break- up of families. She rather called for something 'rational and humane' that women develop their potential, especially through going back into the working world.She became after the publication of the book, and with the founding of NOW The National Organization of Woman one of the major forces in the Feminist Revolution.Without going into its subsequent history and divisions it is sufficient to say that she made a major contribution to opening many worlds for women.Her pioneering spirit, and her courage and insight are felt in these pages."},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"This book required no wait-time.

This is no longer just a book for femininsts; it is now a book for both men and women and can help a person live a more full and honest life."},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"To illustrate why this book has remained relevant and world-changing, to me and to all women (even those who don't live in the U.S. seem to be inspired by our freedoms) ...The Feminine Mystique struck a major chord with me. It helped to validate a lot of my perceptions and to fuel my righteous rage about how society treated women. It clarified how hurt I felt, for being treated as \\"less than\\" because I'm a woman. The Feminine Mystique set fire to my soul because of Friedan's eloquent statements of basic truths, the exposure of so many societal prejudices all set down together to reveal the larger truth that women were just plain treated as inferior.The Feminine Mystique isn't just social commentary. It and the unjust conditions that engendered it have affected women in fundamental ways. In my personal battles over injustices aimed at me for being a woman, The Feminine Mystique helped me to focus more clearly on my principles and to have confidence that my perceptions were true. It helped me to know that those injustices weren't \\"just in my mind.\\"Per the review saying, \\"I'm tired of anti-feminist rich republican wives putting down the feminist movement. It helped my life and that is all I can say about it,\\" amen, sister!!! It makes me angry, too, when women are anti-feminist.How can they not appreciate the tremendous strides made by women like Betty Friedan? Don't they appreciate those who struggled so they could own property? Don't they appreciate that women can legally escape from abusive husbands? Don't they appreciate that women can go to college and aren't required to wear dresses there anymore?Don't they appreciate that they can have jobs outside the home? Don't they appreciate that it's legal for them to use reliable birth control now, so they're not in as much danger of dying in childbirth? (Fewer kids, less risk.) Don't they appreciate that rape victims aren't often blamed for being raped anymore?Feminists have made major changes in our society, in my lifetime. I remember when just about the only professions that women were in were nursing or teaching K-12. I remember when married women couldn't get credit cards in their own names and couldn't establish a credit history, which was a huge issue for women who got divorced and didn't have much money, like my mother (who fortunately got a good job). I remember when almost all doctors were male and even the few female doctors didn't take us seriously at all. I remember when housework was \\"women's work,\\" when housewives weren't taken seriously and the women who worked fulltime (like my aunt Mary Ann)were also expected to do all of the housework; that seems to still be true in plenty of cases. I remember when there was no such thing as maternity leave. I remember when it was astonishing that Sally Ride became an astronaut.I've also had very personal experiences with prejudice against women. At Georgia Tech in the 1980s, the men, especially professors, were very condescending. They seemed to think that women were just incapable and weren't worth their time. The prevailing attitude was that women belonged in liberal arts programs. When I later got a physics degree, in 1992, at a \\"regular\\" college, it was better but not by enough. There too, it was assumed that men were naturally more capable of learning hard sciences than women. Most professors were less arrogant than the ones at Tech and took me seriously, *after* I'd excelled in their classes, but I don't think they would have if I'd done \\"just\\" good or average work.At IBM in the early 1990s, women still had to wear skirts, even when it snowed. In several jobs, my work conditions weren't as good as those of men in comparable positions. In one job, for instance, I was put in a cubicle and my male colleague, with the same workload and using less technical skill, had an office and had a contractor to help him. He was underhanded, as well, and I got a bad review for not getting along with him. (You can bet that I called b.s. on that one! With clear examples. And found another job. Thank you, Betty Friedan.)It's been common that when I've suggested an idea in a group of men, they don't seem to hear it, and in a few minutes one of them will say the same thing, and the others respond as if it were the first time they'd heard it. (I've called b.s. and walked out of a meeting over that. Thank you, Betty Friedan.)I've personally seen that math, physics, engineering, computer programming, and management are still dominated by men, even on the west coast. Maybe that's because most women don't want to go through the exhausting effort of battling general prejudicial attitudes and having to do superior work, for people who aren't very helpful in guiding them, to get there. Women have had to act like men to do well, and then they're called (rhymes with) witches for that. Those conditions have gotten better but still exist.One big reason that I moved from the \\"Heart of Dixie\\" and came to the west coast is that most people here treat me like a person, not someone who can't be taken seriously, because of being a woman. The men I know here aren't intimidated by strong, independent women. Best bumper sticker ever, seen only a few years ago: \\"Feminism is the radical notion that women are people.\\"Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem, Simone de Beauvoir, etc., etc., etc., have inspired women tochange society and to greatly improve our lives, in important ways that reach deeply into our confidence, our self-esteem, our incomes, our treatment by others, and our ability to be ourselves, fully and with passion and with celebration for who we are. They've truly made the world a better place. I'm forever grateful to them."},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"After reading all the reviews I am shocked.

Ms. Friedan makes several good points, but then has the tendancy to draw them out pages and pages longer than they need go on (a group of my freinds who have also read this book agree with me that each chapter, minus quotes, could be reduced down to about a paragraph). She also has the tendancy to not say exactly the source of facts she has in her books. I often found myself reading something along the lines of &quot;...and a very famous study showed...&quot; without having a footnote, endnote, or any marks as to which study this so-called &quot;famous study&quot; is. Ms. Friedan is a very intelligent person, that much I do not deny, but she is not gifted with the ability to put things in their most succinct form. I wanted to give this book much less than 3 stars, but I couldn't, simply on the basis of what it is credited with doing. The book is very good in the way that it presents what were fairly radical ideas at the time it was published with a lot of vigor, but is one of those books where I found myself nodding off every paragraph or so and thinking after I got into a chapter &quot;Didn't I just read this a few lines ago?&quot; My bottom line is, if you want a book about femininity in the 60's and around that time period, read this book, but if you want a good book that deals just with real life struggles of a group of people, read W.E.B.

However, I finally took the plunge, and found it even worse than I had imagined.Ms Friedan's loathing for the housewife is so venemous that it took me quite aback. Housewives, she reckoned, are mentally arrested, infantile women, afraid to engage in the 'real world' of work (it goes without saying that the workplace is more 'real' than the home, at any rate in Ms Friedan's estimation).Her theory was that any woman who spent her life as a housewife was wasting her time, only in paid work could a woman really find fulfillment. And not just any paid work either. She doesn't have a kind word to say for the men who work at jobs which are not exciting, fulfilling, and challenging either. The housewife is no more making a significant contribution to society, she tells us, than is the man imagines he has built a car because he tightens the bolts on the assembly line. It doesn't seem to occur to Ms Friedan that we can't all be brain surgeons, college professors, and high court judges. Someone's got to tighten the bolts.Ms Friedan believed that the rash of divorces in America at the time she was writing the book (early 60s) were caused by men being sick of supporting their useless wives. However, since nowadays most wives work, and since the rate of divorce has not noticeably decreased, I can't help feeling that perhaps the zombie-like housewife is not ENTIRELY to blame for this situation. She thought housewives were to blame for child-battering and homosexuality as well. Neither of those things have noticeably decreased since women gave up being housewives.Even women who are not housewives are not necessarily safe from Ms Friedan's icy disapproval. She launches an attack on Shirley Jackson and Jean Kerr, both of whom wrote sublimely funny books about raising their children. Ms Friedan seems to be annoyed that even a career woman might think that her children are worth writing about.But then I'm only a dumb housewife, what would I know?"},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"I thought this book was amazing. She not only presented great points, but they were well researched and thoughtful. I can't believe all the posted reviews that attempt to undermind Friedman's work. Those reviews must of been posted by scared little men."},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"Betty Friedan's 1962 classic on feminism, based on her own interviews as well as research by others, like: Sigmund Freud (who she generally disagrees with), Margaret Mead, Dr. Alfred Kinsey, and Henry Maslow, provides insight into the status of American women of that era. Those who chose housewifery over higher education are especially maligned, less so are those who became educated and then obtained an MRS. According to Friedan, most women of that time felt unfulfilled living the life of a hausfrau. Each chapter covers a different aspect of the \\"feminine mystique\\" aka \\"mystique,\\" phrases used interchangeably and occurring about 200 times in the book. \\"The problem that has no name\\" seems to be that American women were kept from growing to their full capacities due to the expectations of others. The author provides alternately what seems like reasonable, reliable information on women, for example, the attitude of many men (and probably some women) that they needn't bother becoming educated because they will become wives and mothers anyway, as well as contentions and conclusions (sometimes based on others' research) that are excessively inflammatory or just plain wrong. Among them, the comparison of housewife wannabes with concentration camp victims, (p 423) \`...the women...who grow up wanting to be \\"just a housewife,\\" are in as much danger as the millions who walked to their own death in the concentration camps...' and that mothers are at least partially to blame for schizophrenia, (p 414) \`As for the causes, the authorities felt that they \\"must examine the personality of the mother, who is the medium through which the primitive infant transforms himself into a socialized human being.\\"' This sort of heavy-handedness is a major turnoff of the book. Ms. Friedan, founder of the National Organization for Women, fit the role of educated unsatisfied housewife that she wrote of so extensively (and had some pretty unconventional political views). In the epilogue she tells about her divorce (in 1969) after which she felt \\"less lonely than any time in her life.\\"As a college-educated mom, I too cringe every time I write \\"housewife\\" on the line marked \\"Occupation,\\" but thankfully, gone are the days when women chose not to bother with college because being a wife and mother was so important. Hopefully, women who choose to have children and can afford to do so will make the choice that is best for their children (tougher than any paying job I've ever had). The Feminine Mystique was a landmark book in the 1960s, and contains information that is both timeless and timely, spot on and off the mark. I found some of the historical information and research particularly interesting, but her personal interviews with women generally awful. Those who loved this book will likely also enjoy: The Awakening by Kate Chopin, Loving Frank by Nancy Horan, The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood, Servants of the Map by Andrea Barrett, and Runaway by Alice Munro."},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"It's common wisdom to think of the Feminine Mystique as a classical feminist text. This is perhaps the case, but I would like to argue that it is so much more than that. The book examines what society tells women about their lives -- education, career, family, sexuality, goals, values, and anything else. The book discusses what society tells women, who exactly promotes these views about femininity, out of what possible motives, and what toll do these views have on women, their family and their children. The basic thesis of the book is that femininity has been mystified, manipulated, and taught back to women, in their homes and schools and churches, in the novels and magazines they read, etc -- that this mystification of femininity is a monsterous distortion of a person's life, resulting in emotional problems, marital and family tension, stifled careers, and general unhappiness... That we -- society -- have been living in denial of the condition women have been manipulated into, and therefore have been ineffectual in our help. That there are good reasons why things are the way they are -- it's embarassing to discover just how economically profitable this distortion is.The Feminine Mystique is profound and penetrating in that it questions a state of affairs so many of us take (or have taken) for granted. The book appeals to reason. You won't find any &quot;masculine logic&quot; vs. &quot;feminine logic&quot; stuff here; Just logic: The book is a systematic expose of the problem, its toll on women, and its toll on the rest of the family -- men and children. The book is humane and compassionate in dealing with human suffering: It doesn't place men and women on opposite sides of some battle of the sexes, but rather places all of us on the same side -- the side of the victims -- of some really bad ideas that have been dominant in society for a long time.The book is frightening, because having read it, the magnitude and scope of women's suffering takes on a new meaning. The book is liberating, because having read it, you realise the mistakes you've made in your own life -- how you may have contributed to the problem, and you have a pretty good idea as to how to go about changing things -- your own life, and the way you deal with others. This is a great book."},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"I find the review below about the women who were &quot;bored because their men looked after them too well&quot; to be very amusing. Coming from a poor area like Appalachia when I was young in the 50s I don't remember being too well looked after by my men. My mother was beat every night by my father and then he left her when I was 14 and we both had to go out and get jobs. Of course one of the problems back then was that it was so hard for women to find good jobs and we just weren't educated for it. We had to work as waitresses and that was about all we could do until we got married and then when our husbands got layed off we had to find work again and I had to work in a pencil factory while I was married anyway even when my husband wasnt layed off, my husband wasn't making enough money for the both of us and all our kids. So see, we weren't all rich little house wives back then and the author herself doesn't say much about the poor. I will tell you this though, if there weren't books like this around my daughter wouldn't be a doctor today and having a secure future. Shed be working at some dead end job like I was waiting for a guy to marry her and then probably still having to keep a job to keep the kids clothed. I'm tired of anti feminist rich republican wives putting down the feminist movement. It helped my life and that is all I can say about it."},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"This is a well-documented and well-reseached book that discusses the problems faced by many American housewives. It was written in the sixties, when women were returning to their homes after the sexual revolution and the woman's right movement, when they were proudly filling in forms with &quot;Occupation: Housewife&quot; once again. These women were told by psychoanalysists, who mostly based their findings on Frued's theories, that a woman's sex life and happiness was ultimately found through living her life soley for her husband and children. The women Freidan studied and interviewed for this book were usually surburban wives, living in nice houses with their executive husbands who made a lot of money. These women had done everything right. They had married young: some barely finished or didn't finish high school, others dropped out of college, all for the goal of marrying their sweetheart and fulfilling the perfect image of the feminime mystique. These women had had many babies by natural childbirth, they sewed all their clothes and washed all their dished by hand, they had breastfed them all, they had doted on their childrens' and husband's interests and goals so much that they lost sight of their own. And even though these women were living by the perfect standards set by the &quot;feminine mystique&quot;, they were dreadfully unhappy. So many were seeing pscyhoanalysts without positive results, so many were harboring resentful, depressing thoughts, and contemplating everything from an extramarital affair to suicide. And the most common problem of all came to be known as &quot;chronic fatique syndrome&quot;. The women with this problem experienced listlessness and wrestlessness. They were always tired no matter how much they slept. Their joints and bones ached. They could not stayed interested in or concentrated on one subject for a long period of time. They were physically with their children all the time, but never really there in spirit.And so, based on these findings, Freidan studied these women more, interviewed them more, and wrote The Feminine Mystique, in which she published her theories. I found most of her ideas to be extremely well thought out, and I can imagine how much the american housewife of the sixties, and later, really needed these ideas. For instance, Friedan comments on how &quot;housework expands to fit the time available&quot;, noting that the house of the working women was always clean, even though she had a limited amount of time to clean it in, while the housewife who was perpetually cleaning and recleaning everything could never seem to &quot;get anything done&quot;. Friedan also studied the ways in which these mothers affected their children, and most grew up to be dependant and irresponsible. The men looked for girls to marry who would take the place of their mother, who did everything for them, and the girls grew up to be stuck in the same trap as their mother, being a mother not only to their children but to their husbands as well, since their husbands had grown up under the feminine mystique and expected his wife to act as his mother had. Many times, the mothers try to live the dreams they never got fulfilled because of early marriage and motherhood through their children, and this is never good.The most important thesis in this book, in my opinion, is the way in which Friedan pleads for women to become their own individuals. When a girl marries at seventeen, before she has even grown up herself, and has children of her own, her growing and learning process is stunted and she never finds out who she really is or what she really wants. When a woman waits on her family night and day, she loses such a big part of herself that she begins to feel like all she does for everyone else is useless and taken for granted. Freidan implores women to follow their own interests and not let the feminine mystique stunt their growth. She gives findings of women who finally went back to the desires and goals they had in their youth, as well as women who never left them but were the rare minority who combined motherhood with a career, and showed that they were no less women then the ones who stayed at home. In fact, having a life of their own improved the woman's marriage, family and sex life drastically when compared with the women whose worlds revolved around other people.I found a few problems with Friedan's book and although they are insignificant in comparison with the book's positive aspects, they are worth pointing out nonetheless. Mainly, although Friedan is very advanced for her time in suggesting freedom and independence for women, she was very descriminative against homosexuals. She spent the first half of her book refuting Freud's theories about women and stating how he was a bad pscyhologist with unexamined and biased theories when it came to this area. However, she backs up her thesis about &quot;weak&quot; homosexual men being drawn to the love of other men because of the relationship they still desire with their mothers with all of Freud's theories. I don't think she should tear Freud's theories apart when it is in her favor and use the same person to back her up when she is talking about a different subject. Also her book is still sexist in the sense that she always expects women to do the housework and, if they choose to have a career, manage it along with the housework, when what she should do is suggest that if the man and the woman are both working, the man and the woman should both help out with the housework. However, since her views were so revolutionary at this time I am sure she did not want to press it by suggesting men actually do &quot;woman's&quot; work, since her very suggestion that women can and should do &quot;man's&quot; work was already taking things far.On the whole this book was unquestionably fantastic. Although, fortunately, many women work today, some still face bias, prejudice, and descrimination from others, and this book goes to show that there is nothing wrong with a woman doing what she wants to do with her life just as there is nothing wrong with a man doing the same thing. And there are still some housewifes caught up in the feminine mystique who should read the book and find out why they are suffering the &quot;problem who has no name&quot;. I feel that this book has done a tremendous amount of good for women throughout history after its publication, and it can still do a lot for them today..."},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"As someone new to reading the printed word on feminism, I find Friedan's style accessible and readable. The content is at once dated and amazingly contemporary.I never knew the issues my mother had to deal with, or her mother. Learning something of the conditions in which they lived gave me a somewhat better understanding of why my mother acts as she does many times. It helps me to understand the helplessness of an entire generation of women, though I still find it somewhat difficult to completely excuse.The image of women today, particularly that of the contemporary, suburban housewife could not be better described. It is strange to me that in a &quot;modern&quot; American, women are so complacent. Do they choose this, or is it as Friedan describes it? Are the ideas of feminism subliminated? Has the state of being a woman really changed all that much? Are the women who other women model themselves after, not the same toy people, fluffless creatures Friedan presents her reader?A penetrating and well written feminist work. A classic worth reading and carefully considering."},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"I read this book in high school, and was very happy to read it again in my 40s. In each instance, the urgency, and the modern-day applications of this work hit me in the face: the American woman exists in a world with extraordinary pressures. The pressure to get married; the pressure to let a man support you; the pressure to fully believe that unless you live your life through your family and solely through your family that you are somehow a failure.Some parts of this book feel dated--and certainly the author is concentrating on but a section society: white, college educated, and at the least middle class.However, look at how our teenager daughters and nieces are being sexualized today--this is only slightly different from the 1950s, where a young girl's sexuality was her primary trading commodity. Look at how the consumer culture continues to influence us. And look at how intelligent women (college educated or not, because there are plenty of smart women who didn't go to college) are still pressured to stay at home. The current cult of the \\"perfect parent\\" and \\"helicopter mother\\" still stems from the insidious understanding that women must give all to creating a perfect family.THE FEMININE MYSTIQUE is thought-provoking and still more than a bit scarey. Can anyone imagine a time where your college major was, pretty much, a course in ironing?If you want to learn more read PINK THINK--more lighthearted but as thought provoking."},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"Let me start off by saying that this book got an additional star from me because I completely agree with the point of this book: That if woman doesn't stand up and provide themselves with an identity and use themselves to their whole potential, they will become incomplete and nothing. This is mainly summed up in the chapter: A New Life Plan for Women. I recommend this book simply on this chapter. It is inspiring, positive, and relevant for women to read, even to this day. However, the rest of this book was hard for me to get through. In reference to the title of my review, I am young and perhaps I can't relate to some of the issues Ms. Friedan has brought up because of the women's movement of the '60's and '70's which has provided me with more opportunity, as a woman, to make life and career choices for myself without pressure or guilt. I am glad that I don't have the restrictions that women had back then and I am so grateful that there were women out there that knew our potential and were not willing to compromise it. But asides from possibly not liking the material because I found it hard to relate to, I did find that Ms.Friedan used alot of subject matter that is at best, subjective (for instance, the chapter Mistaken Choice was absurdly biased-- she makes references that the men in the military that were rejected for service due to mental issues usually came from homes that had doting overly loving mothers, that juvenile deliquency was non-existent in the homes of mothers who worked, that Russian children were more stable and adjusted than American children because their mothers worked or had interests outside the home etc, and that she even goes to imply that over loving a child is more traumatic for the child than raising them in a household where whippings and beatings are frequent possibilties.) There are other scattered observations that she made that I found hard to swallow as well, such as part of the chapter The Sexual Sell which implies that business caters to the homemakers because they do all the buying, and that mothers with careers or serious interests outside the home do not have the time to take to buy from business. I find it hard to believe that big business couldn't capitalize on the working mom. I can't believe that a working mom wouldn't be interested in an appliance that could cut her time to get chores done back then as well as today. That part of the chapter made no sense to me. Basically, I felt that Ms. Friedan used a lot of subjective facts, scare tactics (mother and housewife bashing), and propaganda that was unnecessary, at best, to get to her more inspiring point. I felt that all that \\"material\\" detracted from the point of the book, but I am glad I made it all the way through to get to the \\"New Plan.\\" That's where the \\"heart of the artichoke\\" lies. But to those of you who feel that the point of the book is, \\"women who are unhappy with their lives are this way because they don't have a job\\" are missing the point. While although it is evident that she found her calling through her career and those around her (upper middle class women with privilege) did the same, her point is for women to challenge themselves and demand more than what is offered. Don't settle for less."},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"Thank goodness for Betty Friedan's book. Although occasionally dull and repetitive, the book was overall well-researched and shocking. At the time this book was written, universities were actually reconsidering the value of educating women because so many women were going to become just housewives. Since this book was written, no one has dared suggest such a thing again. In those days, too, housewives had a societal image as somewhat brainless and childlike. These days, housewives are taken much more seriously because all women are taken much more seriously. My aunt was the most talented math student in her freshman college class but she dropped out to get married. After her two daughters were grown and well-educated (one's a neurosurgeon) she started working for her cranky brother in his photo shop. Now's she's waiting for her 60-year old husband, who obviously is not as smart as she is, to get his business off the ground so she can stop supporting him. On the other hand, my mom and her sister, same generation, became lawyers and professors. My mom, as a public defender, has measurably improved the lives of hundreds of poor people in Chicago and she lives a lively intellectual life. As a single mother, she raised me without much difficulty and sent me through college and graduate school, and now my husband and I are always pushing each other to better ourselves and be as interesting as possible. Would my life be possible, and as guilt-free, without Friedan's book? I don't know. All I do know is that never once, in my whole life, did I hear from anyone a suggestion that I should ignore my talents and my strengths to merely support my husband's ambitions. Now, I think, for upper-class women at least, staying home with children is much more of a real choice, not a default choice. Thank you for everything, Betty Friedan!"},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"If Friedan's book is so outdated, Stalinist, whiney, biased, &quot;middle-class&quot;, etc, why can it still provoke such angry (and fairly empty) reviews from other readers? For a book that other reviewers on this site have rejected with such force as meaningless, it can certainly still provoke a mighty argument (and some misogynist comments from a an undoubtedly male Texan customer, too). This book was written at a time when no one said these things, and as such it's a wonderful piece of history which I think is still very interesting and relevant today, if for no other reason than for people my age to look at the women a generation ahead of me and understand better their situation. Although there are moments when the book betrays its publication date, I still think it has much to say-- obviously, if men (and some women, too) still can't read it without becoming angry on the Amazon review board!"},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"It's nice to know that more than half of this country's population is considered a \\"special interest group\\" by too many politicians.Betty Friedan broke a *big* boundary in the early-1960's with \\"The Feminine Mystique\\" by asking women to want more out of life than what was already planned for them as little girls: Marriage, babies, and cooking.The feminist movement that Friedan unofficially founded is, for all intents and purposes, dead today. Too many young women are so hooked on the notion that they need males to define who they are (pop \\"culture\\" not helping the cause one bit). I saw it with people my own age: Many of my classmates married right out of high school (alot of them already had kids by graduation) and too many of those marriages have fallen, or are in the midst of falling, apart.It's the main reason why more than half of marriages end in divorce today and why people stick in unhappy and/or unhealthy relationships: We're conditioned from little children that something was wrong with you if you weren't seeing someone and, to this day, nosy people have the nerve to ask why you aren't married at 20 years old.Except for the progressive parent, hardly any child is told to be comfortable with and love themselves before getting in a relationship. I feel that if more people did more things before they were married and/or had children, or if they realized that there is absolutely nothing wrong with not wanting to get married or have children, there would be less dysfunctional and abused children walking around and less of a divorce rate.Betty Friedan's writing is as powerful today as it was then. \\"The Feminine Mystique\\" is writing at its best and most thought provoking."},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"\\"The Feminine Mystique\\" should be required reading for every American citizen. Shockingly few people know the history of the feminist movement in the US. My own mother (who was born in the 1950s) asked me when I was reading \\"The Feminine Mystique\\" if I thought it was \\"outdated.\\" I was unclear what she meant by that; I suppose she was wondering if the material is no longer applicable to current times. I tried to impress upon her that it is a piece of history which seems to be largely overlooked by the general population- the amount of resistance to feminism I hear is appalling, especially considering the lack of knowledge people have concerning the subject. Not only is \\"The Feminine Mystique\\" a piece of history, but shockingly applicable to and informative on the state of gender roles in the US today, which seem to be a confused amalgamation of Victorian, 1950s housewife and ridiculously hypersexualized imagery which no woman could possibly live up to (and still maintain an individual sense of identity).The other day I was at the gym and there was a show called \\"Millionaire Matchmaker\\" on (I believe it was MTV) where some horrible woman in LA runs a business telling women how to change their looks in order to hook them up with her millionaire clients. I honestly can't believe that stuff like that exists. Probably because most people aren't smart enough to even consider the negative consequences of gender stereotyping.I guess I figure that anyone reading this review is in fact smart enough to realize these consequences, however. This (hopefully) being the case, PLEASE research the Victorian era, the first wave of the women's feminist and suffrage movement, then read \\"The Feminine Mystique\\" and a book like Sara Evans' \\"Personal Politics\\" that explains the second wave of the women's movement. You will not only develop a deeper understanding of history, but a deeper understanding of yourself as well. I try to stay away from making cheesy statements like that, but it's true."},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"When I first heard about this book I was immediately intrigued. I couldn't wait to read it and see how far women have come. Imagine my surprise when the author seemed to be describing the present day instead of a distant past. I couldn't believe how relevant a book from the 1960's is today.Betty Friedan describes a generation of women who were manipulated into thinking that motherhood and housewifery is the be all and end all for women. She explained that in the 50's and 60's women defined themselves solely through their children and husbands instead of developing an identity of their own. Women were seen as childlike with limited capabilities and, thus, education for females was dismissed as unnecessary. However, many women were unsatisfied with their only career choice as wife and mother. They were desperate for a sense of meaning and true identity. Some attempted to fill this void by using sexual promiscuity, focusing on their appearance, and/ or buying an endless amount of material things for their homes. This is still true for a lot of women today.Friedan thinks that women tried to elevate the status of housework and child rearing by obsessing over natural child birth, breast feeding, and homemade bread and clothes. Mothers became so over involved in the lives of their offspring that the kids could hardly develop into independent human beings. Researchers later found that children are actually happier, and develop better, when the mother has a career, or other purpose besides her children. Unfortunately, women seem to be falling into the same trap again. The media seems to be telling them, once again, that unless they give up everything and turn into helicopter-parents, their children are doomed for failure. It almost seems as if there is a second wave of this back- to-the- home trend. I see many women that are so preoccupied with their children that it appears as if they are trying to live their lives through them. Just think about shows like Toddlers& Tiaras- is it really the dream of those little girls to be presented like a show pony for the adults?I have to admit, there have been times when I, too, have thought about how idyllic it would be to have a big family, prepare all their organic food at home, and even (gasp!) home school the children. But after reading this book, there is no way that I will ever give up my education and career. Defining yourself through your children and husband is simply not the way to live a fulfilling life. This book may have been a bit dated and repetitive at times, but obviously our generation hasn't gotten the message yet, and it can't hurt to hear it more than once. In my opinion, they should really make this work required reading in high school. It's very powerful."},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"The Feminine Mystique is a study of what happens to people when they are brainwashed from birth to only &quot;live for others&quot; and not ignite the fire of brilliance in their souls. It delves into the misery of those who are cared for but do not acheive, and contrasts it with the happiness of those who do. Those who think that feminism is too wrapped up in Marxist social thought should give this book a try. Ms. Freidan doesn't have the most balanced view on her subject, and she doesn't cite all of her sources, but as an essay on the human spirit, it is timeless and refreshing."},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"I have to appreciate Friedan the same way I have to appreciate Freud or The Beatles: because, at the time, her ideas were, some might say, revolutionary.Although Friedan makes many acute observations, from them she tends to draw irrational conclusions. As other reviewers have stated, her work could have easily been reduced to 3 or 4 chapters.In the first half of her book, she whines that women (as mothers) have been unfairly blamed for the various psychological woes of mankind, referencing, among others, Mr. Freud. Subsequently, however, she uses these same references to conclude that indeed mothers ARE to blame for the conditions of society--even going so far as to cite her nemesis Freud in a disturbing passage about the evils of homosexuality.While Friedan cites many studies (of her own, and of others) featuring America's downtrodden women, these studies feature exclusively MIDDLE and UPPER-CLASS women. As she is so diligently trying to prove that college-bound/educated women are being persuaded to accept the role of housewife in liu of a richer life, she completely overlooks the many women who do not have the option of going to college (or to a Freudian-biased psychologist, or to the suburbs...).Because of the importance of this work IN ITS TIME, I must give it 3 stars and not 2. There is--hidden amongst the whinning, ranting, and contradicting--some good material here. It is worth reading, if only because it is worth judging."},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"After reading a few 1 star reviews, I think a little clarification needs to be made. The Feminine Mystique, as modernly irrelevant as it may seem today, has/had a lot to teach us about race and class issues. Yes, this a work written about and by rich white women, but their resources and privilege created space for such a criticism to even exist. As feminist thought developed and splintered, this work became vital to understanding that identities exist in layers; for instance I am a middle class white queer pagan woman. My whiteness and class provides me with privilege in certain contexts where my sexual orientation, spirituality and my femininity, in some contexts, afford me less and make me vulnerable to discrimination and sexism. This text was important to opening up discussions about layered privilege and was revolutionary at its inception. Anyone who reads this must put the work into a socio-historical context. Why wouldn't an upper-class white woman's voice be heard over others given the time it was written in? Today, feminist scholars for the most part acknowledge and understand that class strongly mitigates women's experiences. And while dated (written 1963), modern feminism has developed and changed to observe many gender (including masculinity!), sexual, racial, and class identities."},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"If I were a woman suffering from this problem with no name, I would have gone mad. This book is such a good look into the lives of women in the 50s. I would highly recommend this book and have. Arrived in good condition and in time."},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"I can understand how Betty Friedan would be so alarmed as she looked at the world around her. She was an intelligent and well-educated woman who was looking to make a difference in the world, but when she looked around, what she found was a country full of women who were sleepwalking.Many women at the time of this book had been convinced by teachers, by magazines, by advertising, by society at large, that they would miss out on their opportunities to find love and have children unless they were willing to drop all other ambition. As a result, there were huge numbers of intelligent women who focused their entire lives on having babies and doing housework. The very monotony of being a housewife was causing an epidemic of depression and malaise amongst women who were convinced they ought to be happy in their place.This book goes on to explain why the situation exists in the first place--the reasons why it would be beneficial for certain groups to have bored women staying at home. The book also included numerous interviews with a variety of women as they stated over and over that being a housewife was simply not fulfilling on its own. It seems obvious today that people need something in their lives that challenges them and brings them joy, but for many women in the 1950s, there was simply no outlet for their intelligence and creativity.I don't believe the solution is as simple as Friedan claimed--that all of these women should go out and get jobs. She made it seem as though juggling child care and housework as well as a job would be just as simple as staying at home. Growing up today and seeing so many women who do work, we know this isn't entirely true. I do think it's a positive sign, though, that for today's young women it is a possibility and in many cases even an expectation that they will be able to have children without giving up career ambition.The sections on women causing their sons' homosexuality I skimmed over as an unfortunate and ridiculous belief of the time. Much of the rest of the book I found valuable, though, despite the fact that it was dated.I feel lucky that I grew up in a time in which women had many more opportunities than the women in Betty Friedan's book. Society still has a ways to go in ensuring that women and men are both given fair opportunities, but I don't feel as though women are trapped by their biology in the same way that was so alarming to Friedan when she wrote this book."},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"I used to know Betty Friedan, years ago, and with her wonderful heart-centered help for women, to find that \\"missing something\\" in their life, despite their unfulfilling feelings of being a housewife and doing nothing more years ago, when opportunities were not open to women, this book, and her tireless work, have broken down the boundaries so that women can be treated as equal human beings.Betty wrote this book when it was direly needed. She cared about helping women come into authentic empowerment. When I knew her, it was at the most dis-empowering point in my life, and her talks were a beacon of hope. She had nothing against men, she simply cared that women had equal opportunity.I am so sorry to hear of her passing. She was a woman of heart, courage, and truth. She opened so many doors, and her book helped women re-claim their truth. To me, there is nothing more important than that.I will miss her, and salute her, this book, and her memory. She was a treasure!Barbara Rose, Ph.D. author or Know Yourself: A Woman's Guide to Wholeness, Radiance & Supreme Confidence and Stop Being the String Along: A Relationship Guide to Being THE ONE"},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"In her classic revealing text, Betty Freidan attacks the problem without a name with unapologetic spearheaded force and directness. Her controversial expose demands to be heard, not only by women, but by anyone who considers themeselves an equal rights humanitarian. Freidan does not advocate \\"special rights\\" as is often the case, with the current NATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF WOMEN agenda. No, here she reveals the hidden duplicitous hyocrisy that incriminates (women) and anyone else who subscribes to a white washed Victorian ideal of women's liberation and empowerment, into a mass of mental frustration and suppressed solitude.It is simultaneously a powerful promise and dangerous revelation into the ideas of those who espouse egalitarian belief systems for men and women alike, because Freidan does not rest until her labor to dismantle gender partiality is heard. Make no mistake, Friedan braves a battle of real and crippling sexism with terrifying transparency.You will either be convicted of the unbiased logic of her well articulated argument, telling of the silent incarceration that resides inside the mind of the suburban housewife, or chalk it up to a (wholly uncomfortable) radical manifesto, that cuts like a sharply brutal double edged knife. She stirs the soul of woman to question that which plagues her pressing and ever restless need. Can the pristine trinkets of housewifery forever satisy her? Do the platitudes of her mothering devotions, leave her empty and unfullfilled with only a perfunctory semblance of human dignity?And what does the fight for equality mean for those who care enough to advocate on its behalf? It means a united front and committed belief to excellence in all its human forms. It signifies a spirit that endeavors to propel humanity towards an honorable goal of mutual respect for the aspirations of both genders: female and male. It cements itself within the bounds of that which lies in the goodness of woman and man. It requires a selfless and fearless love for believable justice that delivers. But, it is only made possible, by unwaveingly sacrifical acts of heroism. Acts that know no oppositional threats, bow to no cowardice, and act in the favor of all who aspire to embody all that is good, noble and just."},{"Title":"The Feminine Mystique","review":"I agree that the book was written for upper middle class housewives (college educated) & gave the impression that going to work meant excitement & accomplishing great things whereas being a stay at home Mom was like watching water boil for the \\"bright\\" woman. Most women work for money & perhaps to much lesser degree for social interacition. Betty never seems to address millions of waitresses, domestic workers & the multitudes holding repetetive office jobs. This is the real women's labor force today. Most professional women are still teachers & nurses (not that this work isn't totally meaningful) I am glad that women now have a much higher ratio of law school & medical school grads.But there has also been a huge throwback in our culture today which increasingly shows role models of the Kardashians, poor Lindsey Lohan & Brittiney Spears etc. to young girls growing up. Pornography abounds....magazines like Hustler & Playboy completely objectify women as only sex objects. It amuses me to hear Hefner ,in his 80's now, thinking of his legacy as a \\"civil rights activist\\" because he had some token integratiion at his Playboy club .Reality TV like The Millionaire Matchmaker showing young women lined up with mini skirts & breasts hanging out are also terrible images for young girls growing up.The Feminine Mystique was written well before these times but how far have women really come?Ms. Friedan was unhappy with her life & the book is totally slanted against any woman who could actually find fulfillment in being a full time wife & mother. It did help desegregate employment ads based on gender & make us all aware of being called \\"girls\\" but was totally for women of Ms. Freidan's class which was very normal. Most of us relate to where we come from & are.What realy changed for women was The Pill!More than all the blather, once women could be in control of their reproductive destiny almost 100% of the entire womens liberation movement began in earnest.

The book is subtitled \\"A Saddle-Trip on the Southwestern Frontier.\\" It was written by New Yorker Frederick Law Olmsted in the mid-1850s and describes a trip by horseback through a large swath of Texas, including a trip to the Mexican border. As a longtime Texas resident, I can safely say that for him to have traveled as far as he did over the types of terrain that he did without major incident was an amazing accomplishment in itself. The author was then a newspaperman reporting on slavery in the South, but he later became a famous landscape architect who would help design Central Park in New York. The book is like a time capsule from the pre-Civil War frontier. His descriptions of the natives and settlers in Texas are detailed and revealing. If you are from Texas, his descriptions of the early days in familiar places (Austin, San Antonio) will be especially enjoyable. His accounts of visits to small towns in Texas (New Braunfels, Castroville, many others) are also quite entertaining. Lastly, his observations on the corrupting influence of slavery and on the variety of peculiar relationships between slaves and masters (including former slaves holding slaves!) are absolutely fascinating. Anyone wishing to learn what it was like in the \\"Old West\\" in Texas will enjoy this book. Those interested in the history of slavery in the antebellum South will also find this book valuable. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Journey Through Texas, or, a Saddle-trip on the Southwestern Frontier","review":"The writer's descriptions of places, things and people are so good that it is the closest thing to being there. People, like me, who tend to look at the Peculiar Institution through rose colored glasses will have to struggle through his continuious comments on it's all too apparent evils, but it is well worth the struggle and the stark lesson. He makes it easy to also see how the feelings, North and South, had obviously chrystalized to a point where the Civil War was bound to happen. Texas in the 1850's, with all it's raw beauty, was no place for the faint hearted. If you love animals you will want to buy a mule and name it Mr. Brown! This is 1850's Texas with the bark stripped off."},{"Title":"A Journey Through Texas, or, a Saddle-trip on the Southwestern Frontier","review":"Take a journey through Texas in the early years of statehood with famed reporter, biodynamic farmer and future landscape architect, Frederick Law Olmsted. Olmsted traveled on horseback across Texas in the mid-1850's as a reporter for the New York Times just ten years after Texas attained statehood. Texas was big, wild and untamed.There were three trips taken: east Texas; west Texas; and along the Gulf coast. The three journals have been combined into a book, a first-person travel narrative. With Olmsted's keen eye for culture, landscape, crops, farming practices, diet, persona and folkways, your reading chair is transformed into a horse named \\"Mr. Brown.\\" Several times, \\"Mr Brown\\" nearly drowns in fording Texas rivers. However, most evenings after each day's travel, \\"Mr. Brown\\" collapses into deep slumber in a rough camp or next to a settler's cabin, utterly spent.Described as one of the best books ever written about the American West, \\"A Journey through Texas\\" does not disappoint. Olmsted's predictions correctly point to where Texas would stand when the Civil War became reality just a few short years later.His observations about the last of the free-roaming American Indian tribes, German settlers in the Texas hill country, Mexicans who had settled in Texas long before it was occupied and absorbed by Americans, slaves, escaping slaves and free Negroes, the Cajuns from Louisiana who settled in east Texas and American settlers from played-out farms in the old South, states like Alabama, Tennessee, Mississippi and Kentucky are rich with detail. In the 1850's people knew what GTT stood for: Gone To Texas.Observations of Texas character and culture described by Olmsted stand to this day. His narrative is full of intrigue, danger, charm and insight.This is a great work that brings history alive in a way that few textbooks could ever hope to match.

However, the book oversimplified the Functional Behavior Assessment (FBA) process and did not provide enough information to allow an individual to become an \\"expert\\" in the process of an FBA. Of specific concern was the lack of direction concerning data based decisions (i.e. collecting data appropriately, visual analysis of data, how to determine when to make adjustments within a support plan, etc.). There are other concerns with this book; the main point however, is that the book cannot be used as a stand alone book.

This should come as no surprise since Howard tapped Don to become one of the original instructors at Hollywoods Guitar Institute of Technology.Don provides real world applications for these unique sounds. He keeps you from spending a lot of time practicing scales that you then can't quite figure out how to use correctly.I recommend this book and its companion on the melodic minor scale to all aspiring guitarists."},{"Title":"Guitar Secrets: Harmonic Minor Revealed","review":"As I've mentioned in previous guitar book reviews, the value of lesson material must be kept in mind with regards to your level of understanding, playing ability and in relation to what your ear is both comfortable and capable of hearing and comprehending. That being said, most books will have some value but choosing one that has the most value for where you are as a guitar player is key (or you can have an entire library of lesson books that you never start or finish). I am a big fan of stuff that Don Mock has done in Guitar Secrets. I got this one and the Melodic Minor as my private instructor has been pushing me to develop these abilities in my improvisational efforts over jazz standards, chord changes. So both these books (harmonic and melodic minors) have been very helpful to discern where and how to use these scales. Specifically to the Harmonic Minor Revealed -- there's a solid explanation to the harmonization of the minor scales that put a great deal in perspective, there's a listing of the 5 harmonic minor scales (but there is an error, the third pattern is a repeat of the second patter in my copy-- so there's only 4), a list of the all the arpeggios for the harmonic minor chords, some great examples and some \\"out there\\" kind of stuff also. Like all decent books, there's a level of digestion and incubation that has to occur and you have to be careful to what level you get involved with details that may not necessarily advance your playing in an efficient fashion (again, depending on where you are as a player). The challenge would be to use the harmonic minor scale fluently in an improvisational approach. I often wish these books had a few more \\"in between\\" exercises. That is some approaches that bridge the gap from understanding what their taking about (\\"getting it\\", at least theoretically) and being able to apply it effectively (\\"really getting it\\", as a player). All that said, the Don Mock series is part of my routine learning approach."},{"Title":"Guitar Secrets: Harmonic Minor Revealed","review":"This is a fascinating subject covered by an expert teacher.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Guitar Secrets: Harmonic Minor Revealed","review":"My expectations were very high when Harmonic Minor Revealed by Don Mock showed up in my lap. This was due to a combination of my fascination with lesser known scales (I know, harmonic minor is not that rare, but still...) and the unbelievably positive reviews of Don Mock's books, especially this one. I must admit that I was pretty disappointed. Not only is this book very short, but there isn't a lot of good examples nor breadth of uses for this scale. This book is basically about how to use the scale as the 5th mode of the minor scale and to really only play it over a functioning dominant chord. With that in mind, this is actually a really long book. I don't need to spend this much time to learn just one application. Don even says, think of this scale as the fifth of your song's key and that's how everything is explained.I have a problem with this. There is a lot missing. One example would be more Latin sounding music that has progressions and melodies based on the harmonic minor scale, where it's played from the root. Also, he really doesn't go into too much detail about using the fifth mode as a root chord, otherwise known as the Phrygian Dominant Mode. Leaving a solid discussion of this out of a Harmonic Minor Book spits in the face of an entire genre of music, that from the Middle East. See the Guitar Atlas book on this region for that.This book does contain some useful info, especially for jazz players. But it is not complete and really only contains one major lesson. I can't really recommend this one and I decided not to purchase the Melodic Minor counterpart which I almost did.-Anthony[...]"},{"Title":"Guitar Secrets: Harmonic Minor Revealed","review":"This book is great, especially if you'd like to develop intervallic lines for improvisation.

Here's a sentence, to give you an idea of the style: \\"Then in life mayst thou be wretched, and after death may Osiris refuse thee, and the judges of Amenti give judgment against thee, and Set and Sekhet torment thee, till such time as thy sin is purged and the Gods of Egypt, called by strange names, are once more worshipped in the Temples of Egypt, and the Staff of the Oppressor is broken, and the footsteps of the Foreigner are swept clean, and the thing is accomplished as thou in thy weakness shalt cause it to be done.\\" It gives the story a certain Biblical weightiness, and isn't as intrusive as it might seem, but be prepared. That aside, it's a great character study of strong personalities against a violent historical backdrop."},{"Title":"Cleopatra","review":"5* for the Book, 1* for the version from General Books LLCLove H Rider Haggard's books, and Cleopatra has to be his best \\"little known\\" novel (as compared say to the better known ones such as \\"King Solomons Mines\\". Other reviewers have done a great job describing the novel, I'm not going to rehash, I agree.However, if you are interested in buying this, be aware that the book is now out in the public domain and a plethora of reprints are available, mostly from Print on Demand Publishers reprinting copyright-expired books. And, believe me, there's some truely awful reprints available. Some of these publishers produce quite good quality books, some do not. What you do need to do is check the publisher carefully for all these older \\"copyright expired\\" books. An outstanding example of \\"not good quality\\" is the reprint published by General Books LLC. This version is scanned in using OCR technology (and using pretty poor quality OCR scanning equipment and software from the look of their books), is overall of very poor print quality, uses automated reproduction with no index, no illustrations and an excessive number of typos.To quote some specifics from the publisher's own web site:\\"We created your book using OCR software that includes an automated spell check. Our OCR software is 99 percent accurate if the book is in good condition. However, with up to 3,500 characters per page, even one percent can be an annoying number of typos....\\"\\"After we re-typeset and designed your book, the page numbers change so the old index and table of contents no longer work. Therefore, we usually remove them. Since many of our books only sell a couple of copies, manually creating a new index and table of contents could add more than a hundred dollars to the cover price....\\"\\"Our OCR software can't distinguish between an illustration and a smudge or library stamp so it ignores everything except type. We would really like to manually scan and add the illustrations. But many of our books only sell a couple of copies....\\"\\"We created your book using a robot who turned and photographed each page. Our robot is 99 percent accurate. But sometimes two pages stick together. And sometimes a page may even be missing from our copy of the book. We would really like to manually scan each page and buy multiple copies of each original. But many of our books only sell a couple of copies.....\\"General Books LLC are flooding Amazon with these low quality publications (450,000+ listed so far) and, unfortunately, many of them have the reviews associated with the original or with better quality imprints associated with them. For the buyer that's not aware of this publisher this can result in a rather unfortunate purchasing decision.A good rule of thumb for these Print on Demand publishers is to take a look at the cover - if it's a good quality illustration that reflects the content, there's a table of contents, and when you do the Look Inside thing there's no disclaimer saying you're looking at another book, and they've stated that they used facsimile reproduction technology (rather than OCR), it's usually a pretty safe bet. Conversely, if any of these are missing, you're taking a chance on the quality. I've bought a few based on my selection criteria above and they've been good quality. General Books LLC however, is a publisher to steer clear of at all costs.If you have been unfortunate enough to buy the General Books LLC version by mistake, you can return to Amazon for a full refund (but check Amazon's return policy and process first)."},{"Title":"Cleopatra","review":"I recently got my Kindle (Love it!!!) and this was the first book that I downloaded for free @ Gutenberg.org where there are thousands of books for the public to enjoy. I had never read anything by this author but I have always enjoyed the subject of Cleopatra and that era, so I thought I'd give it a chance. I literally could not put this book down and I was saddened when it ended! I felt like I was right there, the intrique, the betrayal, the all encompassing love! My next stop...\\"King Solomon's mines\\" I can only hope that it is as magnificent as this one was."},{"Title":"Cleopatra","review":"OK, this is a novel, not history, but Haggard was able to weave a very readable story that makes you believe you are a time-travelling witness to the lives of his ancient Egyptian characters. Now, I can't help but feeling I have a secret insight into what MIGHT have happened during Cleopatra's reign. There are so many beautifully written, free, pre-1923 works.
