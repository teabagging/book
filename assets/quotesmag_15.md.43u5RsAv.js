I know the plot and several pages by heart, but it never gets old.At first glance, it seems like an indiscriminate stab at any intellectual who, a la Welch, is wildly passionate about his or her subject-- Amis pissed off a lot of people that way. My father, a professor, refused to read \\"Lucky Jim\\" because he remembered all of the intolerable anti-intellectuals who hauled the book around in their back pockets when it was published in the fifties, and it's hard to blame him-- but ultimately, I think the joke is on the anti-intellectuals. Amis is an academic man himself. Once you drop below the surface of it, he isn't jabbing at intellectuals at all-- after all, Jim admits that history, \\"well taught,\\" is a necessary discipline; it's just that he's not the one to teach it. Michie, for my money the one true intellect in the entire book, is only bad in that he makes Jim feel inadequate; he's revealed at the end to be a perfectly decent person. And the fact that Jim leaves academia in the end for a spot as a personal secretary doesn't necessarily reflect badly on academia; after all, he's simply going to be paid for doing what he already did for free at the college-- he's moving on to a new career as a \\"boredom detector.\\"You could be upset with this book if you respect learning-- but I wouldn't bother. I am hyper-sensitive to that kind of thing myself, and I think that finally this comes down on the side of REAL intelligence, whether you find it in a college or in the private sector.Also, for those who think that Welch is an overdrawn caricature, I can report that I had a class from a man just like him. I used to sing the \\"Welch tune\\" in lecture, just to get through the day."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"&quot;Lucky Jim&quot; is Jim Dixon - who appears to be a most unlucky man. He recently landed a university teaching job, but he's miserable. Terrible at his job, Dixon is left wondering throughout the book whether his position will be continued. In addition to his job woes, he seems to have great contempt for most everyone around him, including his neurotic girlfriend, Margaret. Things worsen when he's invited for a weekend of music at a senior professor's home and he meets the professor's son - Bertrand. A buffoonish artist, Bertrand nevertheless has an alluring girlfriend, the lovely Christine. Dixon unsurprisingly is drawn to Christine, despite her stuffy manner and seeming arrogance. Embarrassing Bertrand and stealing away Christine become him main priority. In the meantime, he still needs to prepare a lecture on \\"Merrie England\\" that will be attended by his superiors and local town dignitaries. Will he survive?The novel is a model of dry British wit - at times laugh-out-loud hilarious. Dixon is a fantastic literary character - a cynic who personifies the scorn we all feel at times. As Amis writes about Dixon, &quot;all his faces were designed to express rage or loathing.\\" In addition to his cynicism, Dixon is incredibly irresponsible and engages in all sorts of mischievousness, resulting in hilarious predicaments. Nevertheless, you cannot help but root for him to succeed.The writing is spectacular - each scene bristles with detail and nuance. In particular, Amis beautifully portrays difficult interpersonal situations frankly and accurately, replete with requisite humor. Although the book drags at times, it's a first-rate read. Most highly recommended, particularly for readers who enjoy novels set in academia."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Kingsley Amis has a brutally acidic wit and he has never employed it to greater effect than when he penned \\"Lucky Jim\\". For anyone in academia who has ever suffered through the nauseating condescension of a \\"venerable\\" colleague or for any reluctant guest who has ever peered in bewilderment at \\"the smallest drink they had ever seriously been offered\\", this book is an absolute joy.It's worth reading this book beside a mirror: Amis' wonderfully, ludicrously specific descriptions of Dixon's facial contortions during moments of irritation will have you twisting your countenance in the most extraordinary way.For me, though, it's the minor characters that really compound this book's status as an all-time classic. Atkinson, Dixon's partner-in-crime when it comes to winding up Johns, the oboe-playing sycophant, is a marvellous figure, whilst Michie's respectful yet slightly sneering insistence on learning more about Dixon's special subject is beautifully done.The scene in the final chapter in which Dixon, splashing at the ears in drink, tries and fails to cobble together a speech about \\"Merrie England\\" is a wonderful set piece, matched only in 20th century comic fiction (what I've read of it), for my money, by Augustus Fink-Nottle's address to the scholars of Market Snodsbury Grammar School in P.G.Wodehouse's \\"Right Ho, Jeeves\\""},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"The British literary theorist Terry Eagleton characterized Kingsley Amis as a \\"racist, anti-Semitic boor, a drink-sodden, self-hating reviler of women, gays, and liberals.\\" Well well! And what is the reader of \\"Lucky Jim\\" to think of such a venomous outpouring of contempt toward the author whose book he innocently holds in his hands? Indeed, Kingsley's famous offspring, Martin Amis, stands accused of following in his father's infamous footsteps. He has had his fair share of literary dust-ups too and is in the middle of a raging and anguished public argument about England's cultural identity. Like father, like son?Certainly, no matter what anyone says about Kingsley, \\"Lucky Jim\\" stands up as a comic masterpiece. For me it's a memorable and complex characterization of British class differences as shown in the myopic world of academia. The tortured reflections of Jim Dixon, lecturer, as he tries desperately to appease the abominable and self-absorbed Professor Welch are at the crux of this classic. Dixon's troubles only begin with Welch. They also involve two women, one who's highly neurotic and rather plain, and another who's very young, very attractive, and very confused. Margaret and Christine are both unfortunately connected to the good Professor, which sets up drawing room comedy of the highest order. Hilarious confrontations and elaborately absurd schemes inundate the action. But what lifts this novel above the rest is the precise and brilliantly realized writing. Listen, for instance, to this passage about Dixon waking up the morning after an excess of drinking: \\"Dixon was alive again. Consciousness was upon him before he could get out of the way; not for him the slow, gracious wandering from the halls of sleep, but a summary, forcible ejection. He lay sprawled, too wicked to move, spewed up like a broken spider-crab on the tarry shingle of the morning.\\" Wow! Then there's this passage about having breakfast early at his lodging house: \\"There was something about Miss Cutler's cornflakes, her pallid fried eggs or bright red bacon, her explosive toast, her diuretic coffee which, much better than bearable at nine o'clock, his usual breakfast-time, seemed at eight-fifteen to summon from all the recesses of his frame every lingering vestige of crapulent headache, every relic of past nauseas, every echo of noises in his head.\\" Yes!I read the Penguin edition with David Lodge's entertaining Introduction (a plot spoiler, by the way, which should be read after you turn the last page of the book). There you can find from Lodge a bit of an apology for Amis' 1950s \\"politically incorrect\\" characterization of women. From Amis: \\"Christine was still nicer and prettier than Margaret, and all the deductions that could be drawn from the fact should be drawn: there was no end to the ways in which nice things are nicer than nasty ones.\\" But Lodge is generous about this rather simple view of things, since Amis later on found the \\"nasty\\" things inescapable. Lodge also places this work in the context of the British literary and theatrical scene of the late-1950s and points out \\"Lucky Jim\\"'s mold-breaking impact on that generation. No question this entertaining work cracked open some stodgily sealed doors and piquantly pointed out British academic and cultural absurdities.O lucky me, to have found this book, warts and all. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"because, most likely, it will provoke loud screams of laughter and you'll embarrass yourself. Lucky Jim is the story of Jim Dixon, a lowly lecturer at an English university. In order to keep his job, he must suck up to the fabulously annoying professor, Ned Welch. He's also saddled with an annoying and not very attractive girlfriend and he's given to playing immature pranks on people he doesn't like. Indeed, he divides all mankind into two great classes: people he likes and people he doesn't. Jim also likes his booze, which occaisionally causes him trouble, particularly after an arty-farty week-end party at his boss's house. If you want to read something that's light but intelligent then Lucky Jim is a good choice."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"There are hilarious moments in this book, particularly when Amis describes protagonist Jim Dixon when drunk or hung over. Starting chapter six, Amis writes: \\"A dusty thudding in his head made the scene before him beat like a pulse... His mouth had been used as a latrine by some small creature of the night, and then as its mausoleum. During the night, too, he'd somehow been on a secret cross-country run and then been expertly beaten up by secret police. He felt bad.\\" At the same time, the social assumptions of the character seemed dated, with Dixon, an assistant professor, wondering, for example, what responsibility he would acquire by kissing a young woman. Bottom line, the humor is timeless in this campus novel. But the book captures the social dynamics of your parents or grandparents-provided they were English."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"In the interests of full disclosure I must admit that I am something of an Amis fan. I do understand, however, that Amis is a bit of an acquired taste. There are some of his works that just aren't written to appeal to a mass market. This is not one of those.Far and away Amis' most accessible novel, Lucky Jim deals in comic catastrophe. The hapless Jim Dixon a newly employed assistant lecturer in history at a small British university, attempts to settle in and make a good impression. He encounters one disaster after another. As events unfold, it's clear that Jim is anything but &quot;lucky&quot;.Not the least of his problems is his eccentric boss Professor Welch, but also contributing are a madrigal gathering at Welch's house, Jim's infatuation with Welch's obnoxious son's girlfriend, not to mention the obnoxious son himself, little wars with the other tenants at his boarding house, and the necessity to deliver a showcase lecture on &quot;Merrie England.&quot; This latter requirement provides the setting for one of the funniest academic spoof sequences in all of English literature.The book was first published in 1954 and some of the language--presented as colloquial in the book, is a bit dated. This doesn't really detract from the story--it really just add a level of quaintness. This is the only real criticism on can put forward, however.This is satire of a high order as rendered by a master. Recognized as one of the 100 best books of the 20th century by whatever group of highbrows it was that put that out in late 1999. This is one that actually deserved to be on it.Lucky Jim proves great literature need not be dull or depressing. This is a truly great read."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Do not buy the Penguin version of Lucky Jim by Kingsley Amis. It contains many errors introduced by the new publisher. One ofthe biggest occurs on p. 250. Four lines down is a paragraph where Jim is thinking of which suburb he should live in whenhe moves to London. In the 6th line down, he thinks to himself \\"Belgrave Square, Wapping, Chelsea. No, not Chelsea.\\"The error is here and it is huge. The correct version should read: \\"Belgrave Square, Wapping, Bloomsbury. No, not Bloomsbury.\\"What makes this error so huge is that Bloomsbury was the favorite enclave of London's writers. So, Jim is refusing to livewhere the writers live, and hence Amis, the author, through Jim's thinking, is taking a swipe at all the pretentious authorsin London. This is a very funny line for those keenly interested in Lucky Jim. It is also a bit of an in-joke. This is all destroyedby Penguin's version which uses Chelsea. There are many other errors, too. Don't buy this edition."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"Kingsley Amis is one of my favorite writers, and Lucky Jim (1954) of course is probably his most famous novel. It's also his first novel, which makes him one of those writers who spent their entire career trying to live up to early success. Despite Lucky Jim's preeminent reputation, several later novels are at least as good: I'd mention as my personal favorites The Anti-Death League, The Green Man, Ending Up, The Alteration, and The Old Devils.I think this is my third reading of Lucky Jim. It remains a very enjoyable book. It's the story of Jim Dixon, a history lecturer at a provincial English university shortly after the second world war. Jim is involved in an unsatisfactory relationship with a drippy fellow lecturer called Margaret Peel, who uses emotional blackmail such as implicit suicide attempts (she took sleeping pills after breaking with her previous boyfriend) to keep him on the string. He hates his job, and he hates his boss (Professor Welch) if anything even more, while worrying that he won't be retained for the next school year. He hates phoniness in general, particularly that represented by Professor Welch, who is into recreations of old English music (recorders and all).The plot revolves mainly around Dixon's growing attraction to Christine Callaghan, a beautiful girl who is nominally Professor Welch's son Bertrand's girlfriend -- but Bertrand is also fooling around with a married woman, and he's a crummy artist to boot. Also, Dixon is working on a lecture about Merrie Olde Englande, which he hopes will impress Professor Welch enough that he can keep his job, but every sentence of which he hates. The resolution is predictable, if rather convenient for Dixon (involving a rich uncle of Christine's), but it satisfies. The book itself is really very funny: such set-pieces as Dixon's hangover-ridden lecture, and his disastrous drunken night at the Welch's, remain screams after multiple rereadings.I should say that some things bother me a bit. Some of Dixon's stunts (such as stealing a colleague's insurance policies and burning them) seem, well, felonious. And of course Margaret Peel really is someone he's better off breaking up with, but the way Christine is presented as naturally good because she is beautiful does seem rather sexist. Still, all this can be laid to accurate description of a certain character -- and if we root for Jim (as we more or less naturally do), it should be with some uneasiness.All this said, Lucky Jim is deservedly a classic of 20th Century fiction, and an enormously entertaining book."},{"Title":"The third galaxy reader","review":"For people who love a certain sort of England, post-war, depressive and near solipsistic - the England of Larkin and Bacon and Osborne - Lucky Jim will stand out as a great achievement; sabre-like humor slashing the pomposity of another sort of post-war England, soft, flatulant, conceited without much reason.Amis' characters are juicy and he is as violent as Wyndham Lewis but more gripping. It will be a rare reader who doesn't escape the odd thrust at his own expense but he should emerge at the end more smiling than wincing, I did. It's only if you have high and mighty principles that you'll really be for the chop. Principles, that is, unallied with genius: a situation that is not discussed in this book.He never lets us lose sight of the important things in life: money and sex, and ultimately his hero is rewarded with both. To qualify that: it's all about the right sort of money and the right sort of sex too, money for independence and comfort (especially of the alcoholic sort) and sex with an attractive sensible girl. It's difficult to argue with logic like that.But all that steady, grounded, laudable stuff is well and good. It's set against a great plot, wonderfully stage-managed that ends with the lecture on Merrie Englande, a literary crescendo of embarrassment as memorable, in its way, as Ravel's Bolero is in another.Much to be recommended to graduates thinking of doing brainy stuff."},{"Title":"The Desert Of Wheat","review":"Zane Grey's The Desert Of Wheat is the powerful story of Kurt Dorn, a young farmer facing a moral dilemma between going to France to fight the Germans or staying in America to protect the woman he loves and his wheat crop grown with the sweat of hard labor.

Author Zane Grey, through his fictional character, is able to go off on a tangent about American women going ga-ga over a uniform and throwing themselves at men. (Like that's never happened before.) Once in the trenches of France, Dorn - who had been so anxious to go kill Germans - suddenly realizes the evils of war and the wrongness of wholesale slaughter.

It is third in a series of mysteries starring Gabriel Du Pr&eacute;, the M&eacute;tis descendant of French Voyageurs and Plains Indians, and it is rabidly anti-environmentalist and pro-rancher.Rabid or not, such is the power of Bowen's writing and the nobility of his characters that even clean, green bunny-huggers (like me) might end up voting for the ranchers and against the re-introduction of wolves into Big Sky Country at story's end.All of the regulars at Touissant Bar are part of the action in &quot;Wolf, No Wolf.&quot; Du Pr&eacute;, master fiddler and part-time brand inspector is cast in the role of peacemaker. With help from his friends, the Shaman Benetsee, Bart the rich-guy-turned-sheriff, Du Pr&eacute;'s long-time mistress, Madelaine, and Booger Tom, the ancient, homicidal cowhand, he braves avalanches, gunfire, and false medicine men in order to prevent open warfare between the ranchers and the Earth First! crowd.There are good ranchers, and there are really evil ranchers who sell dead horses for dogmeat.There are good FBI agents (not very many) who are either Montanans and/or part Amerindian. The vast majority of agents are feeble, clueless, and from out-of-state. Some of them are so dim-witted as to try and arrest the Shaman Benetsee, who plays a wonderful joke on them with his coyotes. (A previous reviewer compared Benetsee to Yoda. Boys and girls, that reviewer was dead-on. Lucasfilm should take Peter Bowen to court for kidnapping.)All of the environmentalists, New Age mystics, and Yuppies in &quot;Wolf, No Wolf&quot; are easily identified by their expensive, crassly-colored, mail-order garments of many pockets. They are even dumber than the FBI agents, and are easily led astray, even unto death, by the book's true evil empire (sorry, Lucasfilm).And die they do, by avalanche and grizzly, by gunshot and knife, and by freezing to death in Alberta Clippers. The ranchers rescue as many as they can, but winter in Montana is truly hell-frozen-over. Some of Bowen's leanest, most vivid prose is devoted to descriptions of out-landers and cattle that venture out into the jaws of a Blue Northerly.Better to stay in the Touissant Bar and drink fizzy, pink, screw-top wine, and listen to Du Pr&eacute; fiddle the sad, old Voyageur songs."},{"Title":"The maritime history of Massachusetts, 1783-1860","review":"One of the most fascinating accounts of sailing, history and economics I've ever encountered, this book is a must if you have an interest in the great age of sail.Certainly more than a dry recounting of historical events, Morrison helps you understand the passions, motivation and impact on the economic development of the western world of those who came and went from Boston and other East coast ports in the early to mid-1800's.The last two chapters, in particular were absolutely rivetting. The era of the clipper ships was not only amazingly brief, but possibly one of the biggest catalysts for economic change in the 19th century. In particular, the extremely detailed description of the activities on the deck of a huge clipper moving into a berthing at a Boston pier, completely through the skill of the experienced captain literally moved me to tears.

When finished you wish for more but alas, these are the only stories available."},{"Title":"Lady Molly of Scotland Yard (Literature of Mystery and Detection)","review":"Baroness Orczy was fully capable of writing first-rate Fair-Play Puzzle Stories. Her 38 short stories centered around her peculiar amateur armchair detective, the Old Man in the Corner, are evidence of that. In LADY MOLLY OF SCOTLAND YARD (1910), however, her female detective relies mainly on intuition--feminine intuition that earns her the respect of her male colleagues throughout the entire British Isles--and we readers are usually not given enough clues to solve most of the eleven \\"mysteries\\" contained in this collection. Instead, as with most of the Sherlock Holmes stories, we are usually supposed to wander around in the dark with a Watson-Figure--the narrator here is named Mary Granard--and then feel pleasure and admiration at the ending of a story when Lady Molly pulls a surprising solution out of the air.The eleven cases, which were published in magazines in 1909-1910, are (1) \\"The Ninescore Mystery\\" (the murder of a young woman and the disappearance of her sister); (2) \\"The Frewin Miniatures\\" (missing art objects); (3) \\"The Irish Tweed Coat\\" (thwarting the Mafia); (4) \\"The Fordwych Castle Mystery\\" (the murder of a servant woman); (5) \\"A Day's Folly\\" (apparent assault and forgery); (6) \\"A Castle in Brittany\\" (preventing the theft of a will); (7) \\"A Christmas Tragedy\\" (the murder of an old man); (8) \\"The Bag of Sand\\" (the murder of an old woman); (9) \\"The Man in the Inverness Cape\\" (the disappearance of a man); (10) \\"The Woman in the Big Hat\\" (the murder of a man in a crowded restaurant); and (11) \\"Sir Jeremiah's Will\\" + \\"The End\\" (a 2-chapter murder mystery that led to Lady Molly's quitting the police force).In my judgment, the best three stories are the fourth, the fifth, and the tenth, which I'd give \\"B\\" grades to; the weakest two are the seventh and eleventh, which I'd give \\"D\\" grades to (both depend on far-fetched lucky coincidences for their solutions, and the eleventh contains sloppy mistakes about the time-line of events). The other six stories seem to deserve only \\"C\\" grades. Incidentally, four murderers in this collection commit suicide to avoid arrest and hanging; while many of Orczy's contemporary mystery writers also used this plot twist at the endings of their stories, I know of none who used it this often.Granting that these stories have a strong, pioneering female protagonist who succeeds where \\"the sterner sex\\" repeatedly fails, the style of narration may occasionally annoy some readers. Be prepared for several dozen passages where Mary Granard gushingly refers to Lady Molly as \\"my dear lady\\" and raves about the beauty of Lady Molly's eyes and face and figure--and wardrobe.Like many other authors--including Conan Doyle--Baroness Orczy occasionally recycled plot gimmicks that she had invented in earlier stories. Anyone who has read any of her other collections of short mysteries--THE CASE OF MISS ELLIOTT (1905), THE OLD MAN IN THE CORNER (1909), UNRAVELLED KNOTS (1925), and SKIN O' MY TOOTH (1928)--will be far more likely to foresee the solutions to the eleven mysteries in this book than people who have not. For instance, the first story here resembles Orczy's \\"The Ayrsham Mystery\\" (1904); the second is a lot like \\"Who Stole the Black Diamonds?\\" (1901) and \\"The Mystery of the Ingres Masterpiece\\" (1925); the fourth and fifth respectively call to mind \\"The Tytherton Case\\" (1925) and \\"An Unparalleled Outrage\\" (1902); and the tenth is basically a sexual reversal of the plot of \\"The Mysterious Death on the Underground Railway\\" (1904)."},{"Title":"Lady Molly of Scotland Yard (Literature of Mystery and Detection)","review":"Lady Molly seems an interesting prototype for women detectives, and displays some early backbone against gender discrimination.

I can't help but think of Molly the way they portrayed her; a kind of Victorian Meryl Streep, tough, tender and whip smart.Orczy has one villain tell Lady Molly with her dying breath to not \\"omit the fact that the accused took the law into her own hands.\\" I like to think the Baroness looked around, didn't see enough strong women in literature, and so took the matter into her own hands. Definitely worth a day's read and rates a:GRADE: B"},{"Title":"Lady Molly of Scotland Yard (Literature of Mystery and Detection)","review":"I like Victorian Mysteries and here's one written close to the time of QV. A DVD called the Rivals of Sherlock Holmes introduced me to Lady Molly and then I had to read all the short stories about her. I throughly enjoyed it and had no problems with the seller nor the shipping of the item itself."},{"Title":"Lady Molly of Scotland Yard (Literature of Mystery and Detection)","review":"Baroness Orczy was fully capable of writing first-rate Fair-Play Puzzle Stories. Her 38 short stories centered around her peculiar amateur armchair detective, the Old Man in the Corner, are evidence of that. In LADY MOLLY OF SCOTLAND YARD (1910), however, her female detective relies mainly on intuition--feminine intuition that earns her the respect of her male colleagues throughout the entire British Isles--and we readers are usually not given enough clues to solve most of the eleven \\"mysteries\\" contained in this collection. Instead, as with most of the Sherlock Holmes stories, we are usually supposed to wander around in the dark with a Watson-Figure--the narrator here is named Mary Granard--and then feel pleasure and admiration at the ending of a story when Lady Molly pulls a surprising solution out of the air.The eleven cases, which were published in magazines in 1909-1910, are (1) \\"The Ninescore Mystery\\" (the murder of a young woman and the disappearance of her sister); (2) \\"The Frewin Miniatures\\" (missing art objects); (3) \\"The Irish Tweed Coat\\" (thwarting the Mafia); (4) \\"The Fordwych Castle Mystery\\" (the murder of a servant woman); (5) \\"A Day's Folly\\" (apparent assault and forgery); (6) \\"A Castle in Brittany\\" (preventing the theft of a will); (7) \\"A Christmas Tragedy\\" (the murder of an old man); (8) \\"The Bag of Sand\\" (the murder of an old woman); (9) \\"The Man in the Inverness Cape\\" (the disappearance of a man); (10) \\"The Woman in the Big Hat\\" (the murder of a man in a crowded restaurant); and (11) \\"Sir Jeremiah's Will\\" + \\"The End\\" (a 2-chapter murder mystery that led to Lady Molly's quitting the police force).In my judgment, the best three stories are the fourth, the fifth, and the tenth, which I'd give \\"B\\" grades to; the weakest two are the seventh and eleventh, which I'd give \\"D\\" grades to (both depend on far-fetched lucky coincidences for their solutions, and the eleventh contains sloppy mistakes about the time-line of events). The other six stories seem to deserve only \\"C\\" grades. Incidentally, four murderers in this collection commit suicide to avoid arrest and hanging; while many of Orczy's contemporary mystery writers also used this plot twist at the endings of their stories, I know of none who used it this often.Granting that these stories have a strong, pioneering female protagonist who succeeds where \\"the sterner sex\\" repeatedly fails, the style of narration may occasionally annoy some readers. Be prepared for several dozen passages where Mary Granard gushingly refers to Lady Molly as \\"my dear lady\\" and raves about the beauty of Lady Molly's eyes and face and figure--and wardrobe.Like many other authors--including Conan Doyle--Baroness Orczy occasionally recycled plot gimmicks that she had invented in earlier stories. Anyone who has read any of her other collections of short mysteries--THE CASE OF MISS ELLIOTT (1905), THE OLD MAN IN THE CORNER (1909), UNRAVELLED KNOTS (1925), and SKIN O' MY TOOTH (1928)--will be far more likely to foresee the solutions to the eleven mysteries in this book than people who have not. For instance, the first story here resembles Orczy's \\"The Ayrsham Mystery\\" (1904); the second is a lot like \\"Who Stole the Black Diamonds?\\" (1901) and \\"The Mystery of the Ingres Masterpiece\\" (1925); the fourth and fifth respectively call to mind \\"The Tytherton Case\\" (1925) and \\"An Unparalleled Outrage\\" (1902); and the tenth is basically a sexual reversal of the plot of \\"The Mysterious Death on the Underground Railway\\" (1904)."},{"Title":"Lady Molly of Scotland Yard (Literature of Mystery and Detection)","review":"This is a highly entertaining collection from the author of the Old Man in the Corner.The Lady Molly stories throw an interesting light on the social mores of the time. Although women would indeed be working with Scotland Yard within a few years of the stories' publication, the reality of the female police officers' work was rather different.Lady Molly is, to begin with, really a lady. Like many of her fictional counterparts she is only working to fulfill her own ends. She doesn't need the money, but she does want to free her unjustly accused husband from prison.There is a good deal of stress laid on the fact that she is a \\"womanly woman\\". Her looks and wardrobe are described (gushingly) by her sidekick Mary. There is nothing of the suffragette about Lady Molly. She works on cases that need a \\"woman's mind\\". And often her adversary turns out to be another woman.There is a good deal about hairpins and hats - both of which were major parts of a woman's wardrobe at the time.\\"The Woman in the Big Hat\\" was filmed as one of the episodes for \\"The Rivals of Sherlock Holmes\\" back in the '70's."},{"Title":"Lady Molly of Scotland Yard (Literature of Mystery and Detection)","review":"As a lover of all mysteries cozy, especially ones that involve British aristocracy from a female perspective between 1800-1950, I was rather surprised that I had never heard of this volume of short stories. Lady Molly (British aristocracy!) works for Scotland Yard (England!) in 1910 (perfect time period!). She solves cases that Scotland Yard can not solve because of their lack of female perspective. Lady Molly herself can be called a female Sherlock Holmes. The stories themselves are reminiscent of the style in which Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote both in narration and the crafting of plots.

It features parts of the Lanzendorf Collection,which is the largest dinosaur art collection in the world. This 160-page book features about 20 per cent of the collection,but it is still amazingly much. Of course,it would be impossible to collect all dinosaur art beeing made today,but if anyone did,John Lanzendorf would be the one to do it. His apartment contains only dinosaur collectibles and artwork - no other decorations!That must be a really amazing home to live in!With this book,I have the option to view some of the work hanging there. Although this book has some pictures of beautifull,triassic dinosaurs and jurassic ones as well,it focuses mainly on the cretaceous period,which is called &quot;A Cretaceous End to A Lost World&quot;. And that is may be because most of the really fantastic dinosaurs lived during the mid-late cretaceous. There are a lot of pictures of T-rex,which is particulary my favorite dinosaur,and the most inspiring one in this book. Some of the other amazing dinosaurs featured here are Sinsauropteryx,Carnotaurus,Lambeosaurus,and many more.It does have some inspiring,peacefull pictures of plant-eaters,although the pictures of theropods are the highlights.Each artist has their own,unique style. John Sibbick has an immidiate sense of detail,and is one of the best. Luis Rey has a little sense of surrealism in his detailed,a little strange paintings. Mark Hallet has the classical style in dinosaur painting. John Bindon is the master of black/white dinosaur art.Donna Braginetz always make it feel so real you believe they are really there!Of course,the bronze sculptures makes a nice addition to the artwork,and they look very real. Must be nice decorations!Over all,the combination of the artists\`s different talents makes this book a wonderfull coffee-table book,and a unique collection of dinosaur art that should be a part of every paleontologist\`s or dinosaur maniac\`s library. I know it is quite expensive,but believe me,it\`s worth every penny you spend on it!It has been very helpfull to me when learning to paint good dinosaurs,and the different talents makes me take little inspiration from every painting in the book.So,if you like dinosaurs seriously,this is a must-have!No dinosaur artist should be without a copy of this book."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Imagery: The Science of Lost Worlds and Jurassic Art (The Lanzendorf Collection)","review":"Dinosaur Imagery: The Science of Lost Worlds and Jurassic Art is as unique as the art collection which it mirrors. Academic Press is to be commended for presenting these images from John Lanzendorf's private collection to an extremely receptive public. This book is a testament to the dynamic beauty of paleo art and sculpture which has allied the dinosaurs of the past with admirers in the present.The high quality photos of the paintings and sculptures are accompanied by substantial commentary on the subject matter either by the artists or by experts on the particular species. Much more than a coffee table book, it can also be used as a reference book, with the works of the finest paleo artists illustrating the science. The groupings and progression make a visual statement as to why John Lanzendorf continues to acquire these images and Academic Press and the Field Museum of Natural History are successfully displaying the collection.Dinosaur Imagery also includes contact information (e-mail/web page addresses) for many of the artists and scientists who contributed to the variety and theme of the book, thus linking scientific imagination with the interactive cyber world."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Imagery: The Science of Lost Worlds and Jurassic Art (The Lanzendorf Collection)","review":"Dinosaur Imagery: The Science of Lost Worlds and Jurassic Art (The Lanzendorf Collection) is as impressive a volume as its title is long. Mr. Lanzendorf has been collecting dinosaur art since 1985 and has now amassed a collection of 420 pieces including paintings, drawings and sculptures. The book presents less than 20% of his assemblage, but the that is enough to make the average dino-buff drool with envy. All the pieces included in the book represent the latest ideas concerning these creatures with the exception of a magnificent bronze recreation of the Tyrannosaurus from the 1933 movie King Kong. While readers will recognize several of the paintings from publication in prior dinosaur books, many are presented here for the first time. This reader found the sculptures in this volume to be even more exciting than the pictures. Particularly stunning are the bronzes of various carnivores such as the 1/8 scale Giganotosaurus and Carcharodontosaurus, each one mounted on a base shaped like the continent on which it was found (South America and Africa respectively). I could go on, but it's better to let others discover the joys of this book for themselves. Hopefully Mr. Lanzendorf allows visitors to come and marvel at his collection as it would be worth a trip to Chicago for that alone."},{"Title":"Dinosaur Imagery: The Science of Lost Worlds and Jurassic Art (The Lanzendorf Collection)","review":"A great overview of life restorations of dinosaurs and other ancient creatures featuring some of the most talented contemporary artists.

This book does a good job at depicting the art in a favorable light.But, if you ever get the chance to visit the Field Museum and they have the Lanzendorf collection on display it is worth taking a look. This book about the Lanzendorf Collection does an honorable job of displaying the art so the masses can see what is in the collection.

All 5 stars. See my reviews.Run Silent Run Deep is a great classic WW2 submarine novel, wrote by the late Captain beech who fought the Japanese from various subs, commanded a WW2 sub, an oilier, skipper of the Titan ( a huge, duel nuclear reactor sub), set a record around the world submerged in the Titan and was a Naval aid to President Eisenhower. Beach was highly decorated with medals of valor. Beach was a man who knew submarines and used his detailed experiences and knowledge to write a fast paced action WW2 submarine novel. No boring parts. I read the book in two days and had difficulty putting it down. The characters Lt. Commander Richardson, XO Jim Bledsoe, third officer Keith, Captain Blunt and others are superbly shown in this great book.We see the heroism attacking and destroying the Japanese destroyer skippered by the infamous Japanese Captain \\"Bungo Peat\\". This Captain was an expert at seeking out and destroying US subs attacking convoys he helped protect. Skipper Lt Commander Richardson and crew on the US sub Eel finally sink the destroyer and Captain \\"Bungo Peat\\". Lots more action but I won't ruin the book for you.I also bought the DVD Run Silent Run Deep staring Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster. The ending was different than the book. 5 star DVD. Buy the book first than view the DVD. Both great!Even though this is a novel of fiction , the reader is drawn into the novel with life like characters and submarine detail. A first rate book.

Of course, this book set the standard, and I'm sure in 1967, this was cutting edge. I am reminded of a screening of Casablanca that a friend and I went to, where we started counting lines/situations that have since become cliches. We gave up at 14 as I recall, and that was only an hour into the movie. This book suffers the same problem, being too much imitated that once you've seen/read Das Boot, Ice Station Zebra, and Red October, it seems like old hat.Further, does anyone else find the romantic subplot stupid? Does anyone else find the rah rah attitudes grating? Okay, I've heard that real submariners are difficult people to get along with, but the characters seem so one-dimensional. I can't give this book the ringing endorsement given it by others, I'm afraid. Again, it may be the fact that it's been ripped off too many time, but when laid alongside other submarine books, it doesn't stack up for me. I'm giving it the benefit of the doubt with 3 stars. My head wants to give it 2."},{"Title":"Run Silent, Run Deep (Curley Large Print Books)","review":"I first read this book in junior high. Apparently, so did Clancy. I had just watched the Clark Gable/ Burt Lancaster movie, and the first thing I noticed was that it wasn't the same guy who died. In the movie, Gable's Rich Richardson is killed in action and buried at sea. In the book, Richardson lives on (to star in two more books; &quot;Dust On the Sea&quot; and &quot;Cold Is the Sea&quot;--but he's more like Wouk's Pug Henry than Clancy's Jack Ryan). I won't reveal what happens to Lancaster's Jim Bledsoe here--that's giving too much away, and as Hitchcock said in the theatrical trailer to the first &quot;Psycho&quot;; &quot;Don't give away the ending--it's the only one we have.&quot;"},{"Title":"Run Silent, Run Deep (Curley Large Print Books)","review":"I decided to read this book because of the excellent reviews. Edward Beach has created a submarine thriller with an atmosphere, although there are some adventures (like the fire on the carrier \\"Enterprise\\" while being in dry dock, or the saving of downed US fliers) that could be erased without affecting the overall story. The characters are ably described, the writer produces some unforgettable pictures of the periscope view and the crucial duel of Captain Richardson with the Japanese destroyer \\"Akikaze\\" (or \\"Bungo Pete\\") comes to crown the drama. Although the reader is led to suspect that such a duel will take place inevidently, I found it to be an anti-climax and \\"Bungo Pete\\" is destroyed rather easily (albeit Beach gives a few interesting tips on submarine tactics).

Part of the reason why the submarine service in World War II, was referred to as the \\"Silent Service\\", their missions and what they accomplished, was never made public. This allow this branch of the United States Navy, to remain very effective during World War II through today. Commander Edward Beach was a veteran submarine officer during the War in the Pacific. His wartime experience allowed him to tell a very effective story about submarine warfare against the Japanese, without violating any security procedures that were in place at the time. The character of Commander P.J. Richardson, was portrayed as any submarine commander would be, during the war. He cared for the men and officers who served under him. As the same time, he wanted and expected their best when it was needed. As any effective submarine commander would do in the time of war, Commander Richardson had to develop new battle tactics against the Japanese. During the time of war, new battle tactics was the difference between life and death! During World War II, the submarine commanders who came up new tactics during battle, were winners of the Congressional Medal of Honor!Run Silent, Run Deep, was an excellent wartime story of a submarine commander and his crew during World War II. Commander Richardson received a second chance to prove a theory about the Bungo Straits. In order to prove his theory correct, meant developing new tactics. The tension between the Captain and his crew and the Captain and his executive officer, added the drama to the story. In the long run, the Captain was proven to be correct. It is very easy to get lost in the pages of this book. The movie \\"Run Silent, Run Deep\\" was excellent movie. Clark Cable and Burt Lancaster did an excellent job in the roles they portrayed. However, the story in Commander Beach's novel, goes into greater detail.If you like stories about World War II in the Pacific or Naval battles, Run Silent, Run Deep, would an excellent addition to anyone's personal library.

Beach concerning Captain Richardson and his crew, and their exploits through the ages of naval warfare. This book starts at the begging of World War Two, with the training of Richardson's crew, and takes the reader up to the defeat of an infamous Japanese destroyer commander nicknamed Bungo Pete. Any potential reader of this book should note that the only resembleance to the movie of the same title is the names of the ships and charactors. This, in my opinion, is because Hollywood was not ready, in the pre-Vietnam era, to end a movie the way this book ended.Beach's writing style probably influenced Tom Clancy, in that there is a lot of technical discussion, as well as strong charactorization and motivation. When one reads the early part of the book, when Richardson and co. are training up, one feels that one could get on a Gato class submarine and help the fire control party fire torpedos. But, the best part is the end, which I won't give away. As Richardson hears of his friends and people he has trained dying at the hands of Bungo Pete, it can only lead to his actions in the final battle. Read it and see."},{"Title":"Run Silent, Run Deep (Curley Large Print Books)","review":"Edward L. Beach, Jr. rolled aspects of several real Navy officers into \\"Rich\\" Richardson, the central character in Run Silent, Run Deep, including \\"Swede\\" Momsen, \\"Mush\\" Morton, Howard Gilmore, \\"Dusty\\" Dornin, George Street and, of course, Beach himself. In the same way, the three fleet boats Beach served in, Trigger, Tirante and Piper, provided models for some scenes in the story.If you've seen the movie, but never read the book, you're in for a surprise. The book covers a much longer period, from late December 1941 until the end of the war. And, while Richardson has two wartime commands in the book, just as in the movie, he is ashore nursing a broken leg, and standing in for Momsen solving the torpedo exploder problem, when Walrus is lost. The conflict with Bledsoe starts much earlier, in the old S-16, when Richardson feels compelled to withdraw his recommendation that Bledsoe get his own command after Bledsoe fouls up and nearly gets the boat sunk during a qualification test. The little detail that both of them are in love with the same girl adds to the conflict. Of course, a major difference is that Richardson survives, though that becomes fairly obvious from the opening words of the novel, which is told in the first person.There are aspects of the undersea battle in the World War II Pacific that get less attention than they might today. Richardson is telling the story from his own viewpoint, so obviously he can't relate anything he doesn't see. Also, these old fleet subs were still primary fleet components when this book was first published in 1955, and many of the details were still classified. Beach provides as much detail as he can, but some processes remain deliberately obscure.Of Beach's three Richardson novels (Run Silent, Run Deep; Dust on the Sea; and Cold is the Sea) this is the first and the best, though I will add that all are excellent.The Naval Institute Press edition also includes an Introduction by Edward P.

You will come to understand them, the function of a conventional submarine and the perils and terrors of warfare.Predating the Tom Clancy novels and later offerings in this genre, Captain Beach fills each page with excitement, humanity and the apprehension of battle only a warrior can depict accurately.A must read for undersea warfare buffs, you will learn much about the tactics of current day submariners and glean where many of today's writers of this category of literature originated their styles and interest in undersea warfare.From beginning to climatic end, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Run Silent, Run Deep (Curley Large Print Books)","review":"This thriller was hard to put down; I read it in record time. Captain (then Commander) Beach grabs the reader's attention early in the novel and holds it tight right up to the end. One is almost sorry that the book is over, and I plan to look for the sequels and Captain Beach's other work.It even has a love interest, but a rather demure, reserved, discreet, indirect, and tepid one by the standards of 1990s popular culture.The climax is shocking.It hadn't occurred to me, but other reviewers' speculation seems apt that Tom Clancy probably read this book before he wrote Hunt for Red October.It's hard to imagine a such a pleasant gentleman, then an officer on active service, not yet forty years old, with a wife and children, banging out such a compelling yarn in his spare time. One has to admire him.I regret having waited 45 years to read this book, though I think I remember my parents reading it much sooner.

Beach. Starting with training at sub school, this book lets us see through the eyes of submarine Captain Richardson as he trains his crew and takes them to war with the Japanese.The submarine warefare sections are excellently written and extremely atmospheric, even in the training sections. Each time the story hit another naval combat section, I found myself unconciously reading quicker and quicker just through the excitement of it all.The only criticism I could level at the book was that is was a little bit anti-climactic. As the story progresses, there are numerous references to the great Japanese sub-sinker called Bungo Pete. Predictably, the climax of the story is when Richardson himself is sent out to duel with Bungo Pete for one last cat and mouse duel. However, the duel is a little disappointing compared to some of the other naval encounters witnissed in the book, leaving the end a little unfulfilling.Overall, an excellent book which I heartily recommend for anyone who wants to read a quick paced, action novel about submarine warfare."},{"Title":"Run Silent, Run Deep (Curley Large Print Books)","review":"I first read Run Silent Run Deep when I was a college senior and a midshipman who had been selected to be interviewed by Admiral Rickover. It is more than a story, more than a novel to us. We went to classes in Submarine School in Groton, in buildings called Morton Hall and Cromwell Hall. Mush Morton was Ned Beach's CO on the Wahoo. Mush Morton had sailed out of the Submarine Base in Groton, and we saw pictures of him on the walls of the school. We read books like &quot;Run Silent Run Deep&quot; and &quot;Silent Victory&quot; in Submarine School and on the boats because we felt that we had to read them to somehow find the courage to make the kind of sacrifices in defense of the United States that Mush Morton had made in the South Pacific.When I read Run Silent Run Deep, I can remember standing watch on the bridge of an attack submarine, smell the diesel fuel, and hear the pings of active sonar on the hull. It doesn't get any more real than this."},{"Title":"Run Silent, Run Deep (Curley Large Print Books)","review":"The Triumph and the Glory is the only war novel in recent years that I've read that can compare to this terrific book.

If I'm not mistaken, Beach served on the boats so he writes in a very accurate, yet engaging style.Besides just being a genuinely good read, Run Silent Run Deep is a snapshot of submarine technology during the 1940's. You'll learn about submarine operation, construction, and tactics. One of the big problems for the U.S. submarine fleet was dud torpedoes. Beach covers this topic also. Tokyo Rose is even brought up in this fast moving book about submarine warfare. All in all, it's very historical and educational.At one time or another, I've read just about every book in print about the U.S. fleet submarines in WWII.

I like Mr. Mayle's writing style, find him very entertaining. That, and positive reviews here, led me to Acquired Tastes. Unfortunately I found some of this book to be not only not as entertaining, but actually unpleasant. For a number of reasons:- Choice of subject matter: I like the concept, finding out the details of luxuries I'll never have. The first chapter is a good example - custom made shoes. Kind of interesting. Chapter 2 is about limousines. Okay, I guess, although high school students take limos to their proms, some people take limos to the airport; the oh-so-fascinating details that there is a bar and a way to raise the barrier between you and the driver fall pretty flat.But wait - Chapter 3 is about... mistresses? Really? I can't comment on all the details of this chapter, because I didn't read it. By the third paragraph I was a little disgusted by the subject matter, the tone and the stereotypes. The very first paragraph includes the words \\"delightfully backward Latin countries where husbands are encouraged to form liaisons with other women.\\" There are so many repulsive assumptions I'm sure I can't catch them all - Is infidelity something particular to the rich? Something that is accepted by Latinos? (Not any of the women I know!)Is the tolerance - no, sorry, the encouragement - of cheating on your spouse \\"delightful\\"? Would everyone cheat on their spouses if they could afford it? Is infidelity a luxury???To be followed by Chapter 4, which seems to be about lawyers and lawsuits. (Again, I didn't read the whole thing.) The fairly juvenile slurs on the whole legal profession are basically a cheap shot to get a laugh. Consider this sentence describing lawyers' motivation: \\"His guiding principle, drummed into him from his first days as a callow student, is never, under any circumstances, to admit to being wrong(....)\\" Set aside the ridiculousness of that statement; what does it have to do with luxuries?- The brevity of the chapters. Reading about the process of being measured for a shoe is interesing, but the 4 1/2 pages (of a paperback, with fairly large print) could have been so much more if, for example, we learned more about the shoemaker - how he got into the field, how he views his customers, whatever.- The complete focus on men. The book was first written in 1986 (although updated a number of times since then), but the male-centric language belongs in 1946. Okay, a chapter on bespoke suits is legitimately about men. But things like \\"a man of your position and refinement,\\" which come up quite often, lose nothing if changed to \\"a person.\\"This is not a book I'll need to keep on my shelf. Skim it once, and it goes right into the giveaway bag."},{"Title":"Acquired Tastes","review":"So, this is how the other half lives? A highly enjoyable read.

Book arrived in perfect condition."},{"Title":"Acquired Tastes","review":"I can't even tell you how much I enjoyed this book. Not just Mayle's delightful style, but the view into a world of low-key luxury. I say low-key because it's in no way about flash and shiny excess. Having a pair of shoes made to perfectly fit your feet and paying $1200 may seem at first glance excessive but if you wear them for 10 years because of their wonderful comfort, incredible workmanship and ageless style, it's not.Each vignette describes some wonderful luxury that is not as far-fetched as it seems. Certainly such things may be enjoyed more frequently by the quietly wealthy, but most are not totally out of reach on a limited scale. I may not be eating Beluga caviar regularly, but once is possible--just to see what it's like. There are sometimes ways to sample such things on a very limited basis. No harm in adding a few to your 'bucket list'.Mayle's opening of this world to us was a luxury in itself.

This how-to-spend-obnoxious-amounts-of-money guide is amusing and I enjoyed the tongue-in-cheek explanations of how costly it is to maintain a marriage and a mistress, the necessity of cashmere to keep warm and the importance of a folding hat. However, it isn't the same type or level of writing as that in Mayle's novels. If you're looking for another romp through the South of France, stick to the above novels or \\"A Dog's Life\\" which is the story of the year in Provence told from the dog's perspective."},{"Title":"Acquired Tastes","review":"Peter Mayle is one of my favorite authors.

I love this book, I bought all of Mr. Mayle's book germane to this subject matter. He is one clever writer."},{"Title":"Acquired Tastes","review":"Readers of A Year in Provence will already be familiar with Pater Mayle's command of the Queen's English and joie de vivre for all things comestible. So for those readers, suffice it to say that Mayle tackles this books subject--the finer, or at least most expensive things in life--with similar relish, and with similar success. You will, as I did, savor each morsel as the author savors the niblets of seared foie gras in the closing segment. For those encountering Mayle for the first time, however, a bit more detail may be helpful.You may hate rich people. You may hate the things they buy. You may be a contented Wal-Mart shopper. But please pick up this book anyway, because the man can turn a phrase. Before embarking on his literary career, the author spent a number of years as an ad copywriter, and when one has to write 100 headlines to see one make it onto a billboard, that level of taskmastered craftsmanship leaves a mark. I will leave you to root up the majority of his linguistic truffles yourself, but can't resist displaying a few to whet your appetite. Describing the transformation that men having an affair undergo, he notes \\"They change their no-nonsense after-shave for a musk-based lounge-lizard concoction that retails for three figures an ounce.\\" Regarding a fellow customer at an antique store, Mayle quips \\"I know he was a decorator by the effortless way in which he spent thousands of dollars in the first ten minutes.\\" Describing the pre-Christmas shopping madhouse, it's \\"Goodwill to all men! Get out of my way!\\" And in the context of cashmere sweaters, he accuses Mongolia of being \\"cold enough to freeze the earflaps off a fur hat.\\" Disparaging overly affected bars, the sentence is \\"the drinks are given absurd names that are an embarrassment to honest alcohol.\\"Second, regardless of one's ability to afford (or not) the items discussed in Acquired Tastes, I found it worthwhile as a thought prompter for some important questions to all of us: what do we really value? It may not be Cuban cigars, handmade shoes, or caviar, but are we willing to pay a lot for? In conclusion, the reason I knocked one star off the review was the comparatively thin research on certain of the chapters; Mayle managed to tour a bespoke tailor, custom shoemaker, and ride limos and a private jet, but with other sections (scotch and cigars, for example) he clearly didn't get firsthand experience and the lack of such details shows. However, a delightful and delightfully lean volume, which, like a good meal, I would both recommend and wish had gone on longer."},{"Title":"Acquired Tastes","review":"\\"Aquired Tastes\\" is a completely captivating book if you love to live vicariously. If you are extremely wealthy then this book could also give you some more ideas about how to spend your money wisely. It seems it is quite reasonable to own your own limousine. Tailored suits are of course a necessity and custom fit shoes very practical. After all the $1,000 shoes will last you twenty years. Peter Mayle shops for cashmere sweaters and his descriptions of shopping will make you long for a life of luxury. While reading I also became hungry for lobster sushi with caviar and croissants with marmalade.I love books by Peter Mayle and usually they are about Provence. What surprised me is how much humor this book contains. I laughed out loud numerous times and generally felt a sense of adventure as I encountered each new chapter. I'm convinced that Peter Mayle could write about anything and when he is writing about flying around in private planes and eating at amazing restaurants he is at his finest.If you are looking for additional books/DVDs by Peter Mayle I can highly recommend:A Year in ProvenceEncore Provence: New Adventures in the South of FranceA Year in Provence DVD~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"Acquired Tastes","review":"This book is a wonderful gift for the holidays.

However, Mr. Mayle's book demonstrated me that living in a \\"third world country\\" has some advantages. First of all, if you can afford some of the pleasures described on this book, meaning you're lucky enough to be within the 5 or 3 per cent of chilean population, maybe you're not a tycoon, but al least you're quite wealthy. That takes us to the second point... few riches enjoying pleasures means everyone else want to be like you, have the things you have, admire you and that makes you exclusive. In Chile if you earn 1.000 US$ a month you're middle class... imagine what happens when you make that 5.000 or 10.000 US$!!! Third point is vernacular. You can buy vineyards for a decent price (in many cases you have acquired it by inheritance), have 5 or 6 servants for 1.200 US$ a month, buy a very nice vacation home for 150.000 US$ and have a drink on a limo for 100 US$ the whole day.

Mr. Mayle's best attribute as a writer is his ability to be witty without sacrificing erudition, and this book delivers on both counts.My favorite chapter, without question, is the one about buying a vacation home; first because I know a few people who own second homes, and second because it's probably the only thing mentioned in the book that I'll ever be able to afford. Mr. Mayle offers an intriguing suggestion of how to savor the pleasures of a second home without any of the potential pitfalls.

The Accords have provoked a large amount of skepticism, due mainly to the simplicity of the model that they are based on, and the rather unrealistic choice of percentile range (99.9 for some business units). The focus of this book though is not the model itself but rather the calculation of economic capital, which as the author explains is still to be distinguished from regulatory capital. Given the extreme volatility in the financial markets at the present time, particularly in the banking industry, capital reserves have taken on major urgency in the minds of risk managers.Basel II allows the calculation of expected (EL) and unexpected losses (UL), with the former being straightforward and accepted by most risk analysts, while the latter has been subjected to more scrutiny. The author discusses some of this skepticism early on in the book, voicing the complaint that an explicit algorithm for computing the UL is not available. He then proposes three methods for finding a reliable algorithm, which are discussed at various places in the book. One of these is called \`internal beta', which takes into account the standard deviation of future returns and marginal contributions of each business unit to the overall risk exposure. In this approach the beta is essentially a weighted sum of the covariances between the returns of the business units, with the result that the degree of correlation of the returns of a particular business unit with the bank as a whole will reflect the economic capital assigned to this unit. The beta approach makes use of the constraint that the UL must be less than the economic capital held by the bank. The beta approach thus becomes a problem of constrained optimization, and the author outlines two algorithms for solving this. The author's discussion is enlightening, but obtaining a good estimate for outlier unexpected losses will be very challenging, due to limitations in historical data. To deal with this, he recommends the use of extrapolation or the so-called \`Delphi method.' Unfortunately, he does not elaborate on the success of these approaches or site real test cases. Indeed, because of the connection of the Delphi method with artificial intelligence, a detailed discussion of how to use it would be very valuable, especially to those who believe that expert systems and artificial intelligence should be used much more extensively in risk management.Another interesting topic discussed by the author is that of \`first-order' and \`second-order' risks, since it attempts to define what risk really is in the first place. There are risk management groups that speak of investments or strategies as being \\"risky\\" without a quantitative or even qualitative notion of risk being in place. The notion that the author has in mind is a risk classification with respect to priorities, wherein a \`first-order' risk can be that due to interest or currency rates, or credit spreads, and a \`second-order' risk encapsulates the risk arising from practices and concepts from financial engineering, such as yield curves, interest rate risk, and the option \\"Greeks.\\" This discussion leads the author into another methodology for the calculation of unexpected losses.The Best Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR) is also discussed in some detail in the book, and this discussion serves as another example of how to deal with unexpected losses. As part of its definition, BCAR involves the \`adjusted surplus', which for Basel II is the \`total economic equity' (the sum of the regulatory capital and economic capital). This concept is the more useful one in the book since it can be mapped onto the adjusted surplus concept, which originated in the insurance industry, where there is much more historical data for validation purposes. This brings up the question as to whether newer strategies for risk management, such as Basel II, can be mapped at least partially to strategies that have a larger amount of historical data. This would give the analyst a better data sample to work with, thus making somewhat easier the validation of the newer strategy.The current liquidity crisis in the credit markets is definitely a sign of poor risk management strategies, especially that concerning capital reserves. Basel II of course is not yet implemented, and so if strategies were in place that were close to it, one can conclude with fairness that the Basel II approach may not be sufficient. Some other approaches may therefore have to be used, possibly leading to a \\"Basel III\\". The author realizes this implicitly, for he argues that a blind allegiance to Basel II may not be of any value to the risk management organization. What is needed is a system that will manage risk through time, wherein a database is created and maintained, and where risk models are calibrated, updated, benchmarked, and stress tested through time. Such a system would be one that can adapt to new information, build models on the fly, validate such models, and then present the information to senior management in a form that is concise and readable. It would replace the cumbersome, time-consuming EXCEL-SAS driven culture existing in some risk management departments today."},{"Title":"ECONOMIC CAPITAL ALLOCATION WITH BASEL II","review":"i borrowed this book from a local library and is very disappointed after reading it. this book is mostly big words and no substance. there is no detailed real life or even theoretical solution to any of the problems he proposed. for example, section 7.4 is captial allocation at Deutsche Bank, sounds very intriguing, but when I actaully went to page 160, author only used less them half page to sum up Deutsche's strategy as Captial and Liquidy, no substance or detail whatsoever.I finished this book in less than 3 hours and learned nothing except a few buzz words, and that is about it.The previous commenter gave this book 5 star. take that 5 star with a huge grain of salt."},{"Title":"Georgie to the Rescue","review":"There is a certain cuteness factor to this and kids love ghosts, even non-scary ones, but the story is a bit long for 3-4 year olds and uneventful."},{"Title":"Book of the Poodle","review":"Huge, HB massively oversized 4to size, s/b priced to account for projected shipping costs, really exceptional breed history and reference by the Queen of Judges, Mrs. Nicholas; 525 pp, color and b/w photos, terrific early history of the breed (by one who was there) in the US, including rare history of Mrs Milton Erlanger and her famous black standard poodle, Ch Pillicoc Rumplestiltskin, and Blakeen Kennels, the Carillion dogs and more!

If it is the new rules, you might want to inquire as to an update from the publisher.New water polo rule changes for 2006 include:* Five meter penalty throw instead of four meter penalty throw* Only allowed one arm up to block shots in the field, with offenders being immediately ejected* Shots that are tipped out of bounds by defensive field players result in a turnover instead of a 2-meter free throw by the offense* Shot clock changed from 35 seconds to 30 seconds* Players fouled outside of five meters can immediately shoot at the goal (changed from being outside of seven meters).Especially this last rule may change much of the strategy of hole play in water polo that is described in this guide.Again... I think this guide is a great idea. I hope the publisher will update their guide with the new rules and offer it here soon."},{"Title":"SportSpectator Water Polo Guide (Basic Waterpolo Rules and Strategies)","review":"I've never really understood water polo even though my sons played it in high school.

The gradual discovery of interconnection (a sense of community) between the characters is done fabulously. Also very funny.A Note on the Type - 4. Another strange story that works. Carlson's good at taking extraordinary situations and making them believable.Nightcap - 5. Maybe I'm just a sucker for baseball.Dr. Slime - 3. Didn't do much for me. The story is about a baker, but it doesn't feel right. It reads like a writer writing in the voice of a baker; I was never able to completely believe the voice.Down the Green River - 2.

Powerful stuff; the retrospective voice works well."},{"Title":"The Hotel Eden: Stories","review":"I found myself very entertained by Carlson's collection of stories, Hotel Eden. A lot of people insisted that I check out his work, and I'm so glad I did. What I found in Hotel Eden was a collection of stories with characters from every walk of life. They were so different, yet so real that I found it hard to believe they lived only on the page and in my mind.Any reader of Hotel Eden will appreciate Carlson's tight and poetic writing that has the ability to snatch you into - at times - bizarre storylines, like the story Zanduce at Second, about a baseball player who has killed 11 spectators with his stinging foul shot and finds an almost blood thirsty thrill in regaining his former playing prowess.In a collection, I would expect to find a few great stories, but in Hotel Eden, I found 12 wonderful stories filled with intriguing characters, fascinating plotlines and a mixture of humor and reality (a sometime sobering thing).I would definitely recommend Hotel Eden to those interested in reading great literature that is ENTERTAINING."},{"Title":"The Hotel Eden: Stories","review":"I usually do not read short stories--never found anything to approach the experience of reading someone like Katherine Anne Porter. However, Ron Carlson has produced his own quirky &quot;magic&quot; with some of his stories in The Hotel Eden. Carlson looks at us and then writes stories about our behavior. So what? Most writers can do this OK. The difference for Carlson's stories may lie in his grace of how carefully he looks at us and reads between the lines of our everyday behavior.

To be honest I was about to give up on the book because the first six stories didn't really impress me. Not that they were poorly written, but because I just couldn't relate to the characters. In \\"Hotel Eden\\" a man passively accepts being tricked into leaving his girlfriend alone for the weekend with a mutual friend. Most men that I know would not tolerate this. \\"Keith\\" was about shallow high school kids. Who cares? I'm glad those mediocre stories didn't keep me from reading \\"The Chromium Hook,\\" because I would have really missed something.\\"Oxygen\\" is a real work of art. It's a deeply moving story about a nineteen year old narrator who tells in the past tense his experiences on a route delivering oxygen tanks. There is an interesting realistic contrast in this story. Most of the people he delivers to are old and dying of respiratory diseases. One such customer is old and repulsive and lonely. He forces the narrator to stay with him and listen to his stories, and he makes him eat cookies and kool aid. The narrator can't stand to be with him. Another customer has a beautiful daughter who seduces the narrator, and they begin having a regular fling. It's a situation that happens often to young people. They'd rather spend time with good-looking peers than with aging grandparents. The theme fascinated me.\\"A Note on Type,\\" \\"Dr. Slime,\\" and \\"Down the Green River\\" were also good.I would like to note one thing. In my paperback edition page 42 is rerun instead of page 47. Also the ink is sometimes of an inconsistant clarity. A print on demand book that I authored (Talk Radio) has a much higher quality production. I would think Penguin could do better than this. Their production was a disservice to Ron Carlson.

Although only 72 pages long, the book is powerful in its argument against the orthodox Marxist view that 'art represents its the interests and world outlook of particular social classes.' Marcuse argues for the importance of art in itself, apart from its source, writing, 'the criteria for the progressive character of art are given only in the work itself as a whole: in what it says and how it says it.' He truly believes that art's place in the world is not to change the world directly but to influence how people perceive the world and thereby lead them to change it.Marcuse also touches upon other aspects of aesthetics, like his belief in a constant standard allowing us to distinguish between high and low art and the question of the 'end of art' as posited by Bertolt Brecht and others. Nevertheless his main argument is most powerful: he ends the book by praising art's role in representing 'the ultimate goal of all revolutions: the freedom and happiness of the individual.'Truly a valuable book for all students of art, aesthetics and philosophy."},{"Title":"The aesthetic dimension;: Toward a critique of Marxist aesthetics","review":"Marcuse uses a critical approach, not to merely argue against a Marxist perspective on art, but rather to highlight the emancipatory potential in art. This is because its form is autonomous relative to a set of social relations, and insofar that \`content becomes form' (p. 8), art is able to represent the prevailing and petrified un-freedom.Against the perspective of a social construction of art, Marcuse capitalizes on the notion of \\"subjectivity\\" as the counter-force to ground his thesis. That is, \`the radical qualities of art ... are grounded precisely in the dimensions where art transcends its social determination and emancipates itself from the given universe of discourse and behavior while preserving its overwhelming presence'. This is to say that art's emancipatory potential lies in its refusal to subjection, in its survival to preserve its subjectivity. Against maybe Adorno, for Marcuse this is the case because \`art's separation from the process of material production' points to some unique qualities of art: its own language and dimension of affirmation and negation.Despite the emancipatory potential, Marcuse is well aware that art cannot change the world but rather change consciousness, so as to hope for change the world: art is a means, and an effective one on condition that the tension between art and radical praxis is kept alive. This, however, should not be understood in a materialist sense, that the more emancipatory pieces of work are produced, the more likely to change the world is. Indeed, speaking of Goethe, Marcuse claims that \`it is absurd to conclude that we need more Iphigenies' (p. 58) to express emancipatory humanism. Rather, this ideal transcends given praxis, along with social changes, hence a continuous need for such emancipatory art irrespective of materialist considerations.If art for Marcuse fights reification, it also fights against the risk of \\"forgetting\\" by making the petrified world speak!This is to say, here is a worthy attempt to remind us of the importance of creativity in making a difference in our society!"},{"Title":"The aesthetic dimension;: Toward a critique of Marxist aesthetics","review":"Give him a \\"5\\" for effort but a \\"0\\" for logic. Marcuse attempts the case for a sort of cultural Marxism - a society in which every single facet of human existence is politicized. I read this work (very short) some time ago and thought that few would take seriously these statements since they seem to contradict our basic beliefs about art, subjectivity and artistic freedom. Marcuse speaks with the conviction of the ideologue. His views of aesthetics mirror his views on the nature of mankind.One must remember that Marcuse interprets other subjects in the same manner as he does aesthetics. For example, education is important only so far as it is political indoctrination. His views on art mirror those of Deconstructionism, the literary component of cultural Marxism. Both language and art are to be divorced from their source, interpreted by \\"experts\\" and judged by the degree to which they affect political thought. And this is the rub - in a Marcusian world, the purpose of art is not beauty or enjoyment but instead is the shaping of a collective, radical consciousness.He calls for \\"standards\\" on judging art but one quickly discerns that those standards are NOT based on skill. style or technique. In other words, art is not judged on artistic but ideological standards. Artistic judgement has always been (except in dictatorships) a subjective act but then Marcuse has never been shy in advocating an authoritarian society that would \\"force\\" people to be free (shades of Chomsky). This is an enlightening book considering its enormous influence in academia."},{"Title":"The aesthetic dimension;: Toward a critique of Marxist aesthetics","review":"wonderful stop read it immediately stop I'm sure it's good, though I haven't actually read it myself stop"},{"Title":"The Futurist: A Novel","review":"A MUST read.

If that sounds contradictory, it is, and that's the source of much of its power. Author James P. Othmer is both witty and gruesome as he moves from death on a South African soccer field to death in a space capsule, to relationships that appear and disappear. He critiques consumer culture and propaganda, continually nudging readers to notice their world's ethical underpinnings. He surfs through mock-ups of the media events and cultural cross-pollinations that define modern times. The novel is set in the present, but it is laced with traces of William Gibson (Pattern Recognition) and the slightest hint of Philip K. Dick (Blade Runner). Beyond recommending this evocative story as a fun, if sometimes dismaying, read, getAbstract suggests it to futurists, promoters and anyone concerned about corporate ethics."},{"Title":"The Futurist: A Novel","review":"I picked up THE FUTURIST because the author was a high school classmate, a funny guy I barely knew, but I've joined the ranks of true fans, eager to read anything written in his unique, irreverent voice. When the main character, a brilliant, globetrotting seller of often contradictory big ideas burns out, he cynically blows the whistle on the futurist industry, only to find his attempt at professional suicide increases the demand for his brand of clueless hokum. But through the fog of alcohol, cynicism, and irreverence a real hero emerges. Although (very, very) flawed, the futurist remains at heart a guy who yearns to do the right thing and appreciate the simple beauty in this world like his small-town dad tried to teach him. Ultimately, he does. This is insightful, fun satire at its best."},{"Title":"The Futurist: A Novel","review":"\\"The Futurist\\" is a fast-paced account of the (mis)adventures of a glib, 40-something man named Yates, who has earned a handsome living as a self-styled predictor of trends, a motivational speaker who will give a speech to anyone willing to pay him enough. As the book opens, however, Yates is having doubts about what he does, and who he has become. Over the course of 256 pages, we follow Yates on a wild ride that takes him from Africa to Greenland to Milan to Fiji and beyond. This book is both entertaining and thought-provoking, and filled with clever turns of phrase. Its weakness, if it has one, is that while we are given endless facts about Yates, we have no reason to care about him. A good \\"airplane book\\" -- light reading that will make the time pass quickly."},{"Title":"The Futurist: A Novel","review":"Halfway through this book I stopped and asked myself why the heck did I give a hoot about this Yates character (fyi, he's the futurist). The answer came simply: because he is me. He's actually all of us, though I'll keep this in appropriate Reviewer-Review Reader terms so as to allow you to judge for yourself.Yates is a globe trotting futurist who is drunk more ofter than sober, has parent issues, has commitment issues ... well, he's got a helluva lot of issues yet somehow has the insight and understanding to determine what's new, what's next, and what's coming for the rest of us. It is that contradiction in Yates' character where the brilliance of \\"The Futurist\\" lies. Yates is a mirror for the reader to see themself, and more often than not as we find in our own lives, Yates' valor loses to Maker's Mark and all his good intentions seldom lead to action.Pacing is a little uneven, and the space hotel drama was more cumbersome than helpful as a sub-plot, but overall the story is a rollercoaster ride aboard Yates' mouth and indiscretions. The journey covers a world of trouble, scenarios that while stretched to the brink of believable, are very appropriate for the satirical and cynical picture Othmer paints in his debut novel.And that's what is best of all. This is but a first novel in a career which using \\"The Futurist\\" as an indicator should be one filled with keen insight; great storytelling; and a fresh, honest perspective. Get to know James P. Othmer now because you will be reading him in the future."},{"Title":"The Futurist: A Novel","review":"It's the kind of novel you start casting as you read: Here is Christian Slater. There goes Kathy Bates. With rare exceptions, the writer keeps it in present tense, third person, which is much the way a movie camera would read it.The Futurist is the story of the ultimate spin-meister, a spiritually frozen motivational speaker who has a crisis of conscience at the height of his powers. It is a dizzying kind of morality play in novel's clothing. In my opinion, this morality play aspect, along with the movie thing, comprise The Futurist's greatest strengths and weaknesses. Think of a post-Millennial *Network* and you're heading in the right direction. Added to this, its lack of a bona fide sex scene (the only scene that could be argued as such really involves kink as opposed to actual sex) probably ensures its entry into the high school contemporary-lit canon, at least for the short term.While not a great book, it is an extremely well crafted debut by an imaginative, gifted storyteller. I was never swept away by the story, yet I was entertained and it gave me much to ponder. Thus, you will probably enjoy The Futurist to the degree that you like being entertained as you ponder the ongoing dilemma of sacrificing America's founding values upon the altar of commerce.The book contains an impressive number of great lines, a/k/a thoughts for further contemplation, some of which I bestow upon you now, just in case you want to drop them at your next party or summit conference, although, as Othmer might warn you, posing as substantial when you haven't done the work behind having actual substance is A Very Bad Idea -- or at least one with consequences you will have to work out for yourself:\\"The philosophical task of our age is for each of us to decide what it means to be a successful human being.\\" [p. 29]\\"We need disaster to validate our existence.\\" [p. 49]\\"People covet the shaman, then they despise him. They hear your name. They blame you. Or see you as a tool to spread the word to blame someone else.\\" [p. 51]\\"To know what the rest of the world is about to need. To know that is to be eternally rich.\\" [p. 59]\\"The global preoccupation is, what horrible thing is going to happen next? What, not why.\\" [p. 66]\\"It's okay not to know what you want, where you want to go, who you want to become. It is okay to wonder. To ask. It is normal not to know. We all felt it before, Yates, but we felt like we were the only ones who ever felt that way. What's not okay is to stop wondering, right?\\" [p. 73]\\"Once you get one big thing right, people tend to forget all the previous things you got so very wrong.\\" [p. 87]You want more, go buy the novel. Hint: the best metaphor in the book is on page 218. IMHO.The Futurist takes place around the globe and aboard the first hotel in outer space. Greenland is a metaphor for timeless permanence, the literally glacial movement of the cosmos, yet it also situates one character's inability to create movement in his lonely, spiritually frozen life. Milan, by contrast, is a metaphor for transformation, yet it also represents the ephemeral and superficial, and thus by extension, the instability and dysfunction of contemporary life. Which is spiritually frozen. And so on.One thing that this book purports, in the way of increasing spiritual health, is to experience the epiphanic moment and then to move on. Not to linger, not to try endlessly to recapture it, for doing so takes you out of the now and fixates you on the past and the future. This is timeless ancient wisdom. Why, with all our advanced technology and the wisdom of the ages still at our fingertips, do we have such a hard time remembering this? It seems more difficult now than ever.The moral crux of the novel arguably occurs on page 90:Yates: \\"What's the most courageous thing you think a man or woman can do?\\"Boss: \\"Easy. He overrides his fears and his ego by acting to preserve the liberties and freedoms of his country and family. His courage is greater than his fear. His actions are not fueled by desire, they're fueled by love.\\"There is, of course, no \\"easy\\" answer to this question. One could just as easily argue that the most courageous thing a human can be is true to himself, before all others, and to keep that self-respect alive regardless of the cost. Perhaps it boils down to how much abuse or neglect (same difference) one suffered as a child.Thus, not surprisingly, this \\"easy\\" answer turns out to be part of an elaborate sham, while ironically it also turns out to be Yates the Futurist's ultimate guide to action. In an era of shifting, vaporous institutions, when the very notions of \\"country\\" and \\"family\\" are in upheaval, commitment is often synonymous with entrapment, and maintaining loyalty to anything greater than oneself can be tough to justify.Whether you believe that Yates is a hero or a coward (and Othmer presents a compelling argument for the latter as part of the novel's climax) probably says more about your own values with regard to these concerns. A novel about the moral ambiguity of contemporary life could do much worse."},{"Title":"The Futurist: A Novel","review":"The Futurist is a fresh, smart, current and hilarious new novel written by James P.

Othmer's message is delivered with dark humor and the subtlety of a punch-in-the mouth - a hard edged page-turner that continually builds suspense and spins mystery when not simply violent.With protagonist Yates - \\"the futurist\\" - the author cleverly sets up a larger-than-life consultant cult hero - a first class champagne and caviar-only jet setting talking-head who flies around the world spewing canned speeches to eager governments, corporations, and conferences.

In fact, like Dos Equis' annoying ads, Othmer builds Yates to near-legend status through a series of chapter-opening anecdotes chronicling our hero's dubious exploits: \\"He once fired a man on take-your-daughter-to-work-day\\", or \\"He once was asked by the New York Times to write an op-ed on literacy in America and had it ghostwritten.\\" But Yates in anything but annoying, especially when he experiences his own awakening and, finally sickened with the hollow flimsiness of his message and the fools who lap it up, Yates comes clean. And then finds his empty prognostications in even more demand. Stalked and threatened by a creepy e-mailer quoting Nostradamus and recruited by a pair of black operatives working on some fringe between government and private interests, Yates struggles to escape the fate he's created as he skips between continents and ever-deepening crises.Anyone who's ever worked in a large corporation, in PR or advertising, in government, or who's simply paying attention will smile inwardly at Yates' rise, attempted fall, and final awakening. Yet the story of Yates' self-discovery and personal reformation is less interesting than Ohlmer's razor-edged grasp of human nature and the way things really work, honed with a darkly cynical insight that would border on self parody in the hands of a less talented author.Like life in the 21st century, Othmer is provokingly ambiguous. Nothing is good, nothing is evil and all is relative, and everyone is ultimately clueless. Superbly written and painfully insightful, this is top-notch reading, and not surprisingly soon to be a major movie."},{"Title":"The Futurist: A Novel","review":"Yates is a futurist. That is to say, he flies around the world giving speeches to marketers, governments and other organizations, telling them basically whatever b.s. they want to hear to support their delusions about their righteousness or make them feel optimistic about the future. Yates has a flair for talking, and at the beginning of this novel, he is at the top of his game on his way to Johannesburg to deliver another speech when he finds in his jacket pocket a letter from his wife telling him that she is leaving him for a history teacher. Once in Johannesburg, in mental disarray, at the recommendation of a South African hooker, he gets up to give his speech and does something unfamiliar to him--the equivalent of career suicide. He tells the truth. He says that he just as clueless as everyone else. Thus begins the tailspin that lasts for another 200+ pages, taking the reader on a wild ride from South Africa to Greenland to Italy to Fiji to Pennsylvania to the fictionalized Iraq stand-in, Bas'ar.Throughout the first 25 pages or so, I just kept thinking what a brilliant, dead-on send-up of the marketing, future-thinking business world this was, and Yates was the perfect globe-trotting blowhard anti-hero. There is very little to like about Yates, whose main talents include lying, being cynical and raiding minibars. But the book is full of surprises, and as the plot thickens, a couple of surprising things happen. The first is that the satire becomes much darker and unsettling as it delves into the geopolitics of the United States. And the second is that, for some reason, I found myself growing fond of Yates, even relating to his moral ambiguity. Especially in his more human moments, sitting on a beach staring at the stars, or returning home to his family, he is at odds with himself. He knows he's a sellout.There is one element of the book that felt hokey to me. Yates finds himself in a kind of James Bond-eque entanglement with government spooks. Although this device is necessary to drive the plot forward, it feels contrived in a book that is otherwise incredibly smart, hilarious and, surprisingly, moving."},{"Title":"The Futurist: A Novel","review":"The book's writing makes it move along at an international pace. But its greatest strength is social satire. It is a commentary on globalization, and the corporatizing of everything, from war to terrorism to the publishing world. It's funny, but agenda funny. Radically, anti-corporate actually. Not for everyone, but if you're politically minded and can laugh about really horrible things, it's for you."},{"Title":"The Futurist: A Novel","review":"What is left with whe you unstrap the bomb from the stomach of the suicide bomber? This addictive story attempts to answer that question by peeking into the life of \\"The Futurist,\\" a technology salesman who lives extravagantly by selling people the futures they want to buy, in the brief and ultimate moment of his life when he fully realizes what he is selling. This is a page-turning mystery that earns this rating not so much because it is an intriguing story, but more because the author leaves the reader constantly wondering what will befall the Futurist next. Looking back, the events leading to the futurist's tragic demise seem rather predictable given the theme, yet the Futurist's graceful fall from the heavens is very memorable. Final thought: Regardless of whether or not the Futurist exists, whether his cynicism is justified or his story about the interdependent machinery of power, technology, and warfare describes reality, the perception of American Government and Enterprise as being self-serving entities is one that is and has been commonly adopted throughout the non-English-speaking world."},{"Title":"The Futurist: A Novel","review":"This is a quick and engaging read that is at turns--somewhat disconcertingly--cynical and sincere. As a consultant myself, I appreciated the send-up of that most unaccountable of pundits, the futurist.It isn't going to make anyone's \\"Great Literature of 2006\\" list, but it's great for a flight from Chicago to New York."},{"Title":"The Futurist: A Novel","review":"The Futurist is by far one of the best books I have read in a long time. All at once Othmer successfully navigates a solid, fast-paced plot, a tongue in cheek flip-off to the world of advertising, tech, and silicon valley, and a poignant cultural summation of the current state of the union. All of that while walking an incredibly fine line between fiction and reality. So much so that you are left wondering how much is really fiction and how much is true. Oh yeah, and i don't think I have laughed out loud so hard in years as I did with this book. Othmer's turn of phrase is unequaled. \\"That's the button, button man!\\" (you'll see)."},{"Title":"The Futurist: A Novel","review":"I thought knowing the author would somehow prejudice my opinion of this highly-entertaining novel. However, within a few chapters I forgot who the author was and became engrossed in the adventures of this man Yates. It appears to me that Yates is like a lot of us -- How did I get here? This is not my beautiful house, this is not my beautiful wife. My God! What I have I done? My generation has been striving for success at all costs and throughout the journey some of us have lost our perspective on how our actions can affect an entire planet. The only disappointment I have with this novel is that it ended too quickly and Yates' life-after was too nicely wrapped up, albeit with some good snapshots. I liken Yates journey as the Futurist to climbing a mountain, not seeing what he thought was there, and then taking a leap of faith. In the end, we are part of a bigger community and not all of us get a second chance to be who we really want to be, and are. I applaud Mr. Othmer for this somewhat autobiographical (to me) tale and hope to see many more works by him. You are the man Jim, but please be careful with the Maker's Mark!"},{"Title":"The Futurist: A Novel","review":"After reading this very funny book, I searched for other reviews. Many agreed with me and found this to be pleasingly absurd. I'd like to believe every word was meticulously placed and every character intentionally developed in an unconventional style that was refreshing. Not only was the main character a blank canvas of physical traits (place your photo here) - we never even got a first name.

Buy it for all your educated friends who've ridiculed a foundation that you're still fond of."},{"Title":"The Futurist: A Novel","review":"The Futurist is on one level a very compelling book. Yates, the protagonist here, carries on a hyper thought narrative where he breaks down our contemporary society in a precise and thoughtful manner. Sometimes this occurs in conversations with others ala 'My Dinner with Andre', and sometimes it is Yates himself ruminating for the reader. When you come across these passages that are bountiful throughout the book, the pages fly by as new ideas come forth.However, it is apparant that Othmer does not have a masters grasp of the written word as of yet. The character Yates and the events that unfold while holding the story together become tedious. Yates is perhaps one of the least likeable characters that I have ever come across. Think about it for a moment. He is falling apart, his life is in a moral shambles. I guess as a reader I was supposed to feel a little sorry and somehow emphasise with him. However, while Othmer is fleshing out his tragic character, I couldn't help wish that I were in his shoes. Here is a guy that is capable of pulling in a seven figure sallary, he has interesting jobs pushed towards him from right to left, interesting women chase him around. He is encouraged to travel anywhere and has an unlimited expense account. Sounds like the perfect life to me. After a while I started to resent Yates' \\"me\\" attitude and really did not like him at all. The worst thing is that half of this book is made up of this and trust me, you really only need a few pages of it to have had enoughWhat made this book enjoyable was the almost stream of concious narrative on our worlds society. Questions of who we are and what it means to be alive today are engrossing and I wanted more.So this book is a huge mixed bag."},{"Title":"The Futurist: A Novel","review":"I have ordered the book before the WAIS Confernce at Stanford (31 July-1 August, 2006) and it has arrived in time to be used in my scenario workshop on the Future of the UN.

The book is a caricature, but a realistic one, with a hopeful ending -- I wish the UN General Assembly would read it and apply it to UN reform!Steve Torok"},{"Title":"The Futurist: A Novel","review":"The Futurist serves up a wickedly funny success named Yates. He is a world famous prognosticator dealing out glowing, enthusiastic reports to an image driven world. It follows this self-serving forecaster through a globe-trotting cathartic nightmare. Yates may have the future cornered but the present is another story.Faced with the everyday absurdities,international terror, and a family crisis he reviews his life in ways he could never have predicted. The Futurist has a renewal of conscience in Johannesburg. But his journey has just begun. By the time Yates has returned home for his father's funeral in Pennsylvania he has visited Milan, Fiji, and even Greenland. What he sees isn't pretty and maybe explains the need for rose-colored glass predictions. Can this really be the progress of our new global community? What have we really brought to the rest of the world? Maybe Yates is needed. Like mindless TV, or a good bottle of bourbon, or religion.I loved this read.From the opening line (The Futurist never saw it coming) to the closing chapter on Yates' later years. I found myself alternating between laughter, outrage, and recognition. Then I grabbed a beer,turned on my TV, and watched Hardball and O'Reilly.DK"},{"Title":"The Futurist: A Novel","review":"This was an excellent read! Yates is a man you can't help but like.

Today's un-American conservatives pay the protagonist of The Futurist to go around and make people feel better about Outsourcing. In the end everybody makes a lot of money, but nobody really wins."},{"Title":"The Futurist: A Novel","review":"I came into my reading of the THE FUTURIST expecting witty, biting satire, and an overall intelligent send-up of contemporary American Culture, politics, terrorism, media, and everything in between. What I got was a mildly interesting book that was short on wit and any original insight, full of clunky prose, repetitive scenes, a HEAVILY contrived plot, and overall, not very funny. Additionally, the book is already quite lean at 229 pages, and it still felt about sixty pages too long. It reads like a novella, or even a short story, that some editor advised the author to pad to attain novel length. I am a huge fan of Kurt Vonnegut, George Saunders, George Orwell, Haruki Murakami, and all the great satirists of our time. This book is a pretender to the throne. Be forwarned."},{"Title":"The Futurist: A Novel","review":"I was really looking forward to this book based on a review in the Wall Street Journal. The book begins promisingly enough but quickly devolves into a series of unrealistic, outlandish little episodes (some of which are amusing, hence 2 stars instead of 1) without any rationale. Lack of character development is the driving weakness to the book, undermining the credibility of every event. Having read the book, I'd be hard pressed to describe the protagonist's physical appearance, age, professional or personal history. Muddling matters is the 3rd person style of writing which actually 'feels' like the protagonist describing events in the 1st person. If you're looking for a good summer book, try something else."},{"Title":"The Futurist: A Novel","review":"The Futurist is written by a budding Tom Wolfe but with less cynicism and a bit of soul searching. Nevertheless, it is the ice pick in the cake rather than the icing on the cake when the writer dons his scuba gear and flippers and guide us to the deepest bottoms of moral turpitude and brings us to the brink of the surface before our oxygen tanks run out of air. The experience is harrowing enough that the reader would breathe a sigh of relief that even if we almost ended up drowning and floating to the surface with the life and viridity of virals infested turds in a towel bowl, there is alway hope that we could be much, much, more than that."},{"Title":"The Futurist: A Novel","review":"The Publisher's Weekly review (above) does a great job summarizing the plot of the first part of the book. I can't do better, so I'll quote it quickly here before adding my two cents:\\"Famed pop pundit J.P. Yates, having emptied his hotel minibar, experiences an epiphany: he's a fake. After years of peddling insights to any group willing to pay him well--one week he assures a Bible college's graduates that God has a future, the next he assures adult video distributors that porn has a future--he stuns attendees at a Futureworld conference in South Africa by declaring himself 'founding father of the Coalition of the Clueless.' Ironically, his career takes off: he's more in demand than ever and is even recruited to travel the world asking why everyone hates the U.S. Othmer takes amusing swipes at the likes of (real-life) futurist Faith Popcorn, New York Times columnist Tom Friedman and billionaires Ted Turner and Bill Gates.\\" (Publisher's Weekly)After this strong start, however, the book simply fizzles. Having realized he's a fake, Yates wanders the world trying to figure out what to do with his life. Nothing much happens, and Yates remains ambivalent. Which maybe reflects the author's own ambivalence. It's as if the author felt he had a lot to say in the first third of the book, and then had another two-thirds of the book to fill but wasn't really sure what he wanted to say. There's a half-hearted attempt to make some kind of statement about U.S. involvement in Iraq, but even that episode is feels like a picture only half-colored in.My recommendation: Take it out of the library, read up until Yates leaves Johannesburg, and then put it down and move on to the next book on your list."},{"Title":"The Futurist: A Novel","review":"This is a damned entertaining book. Very funny, very well-written characters, a believably-rendered world stageset of airports, boardrooms, hotel rooms, etc. But between out-loud laughs are stretches of air-sick realism that unsettle and disturb, and give the book a kind of chilling subtext that doesn't feel at all like summer fun. The book feels like sincere cultural criticism delivered by a manic, almost soul-less white-collar drudge, the twinges of whose remaining conscience are drowned-out by hysteric laughter.I downgrade to 4 stars because I don't see why the author resorted to such drastic, almost slapstick juxtapositions: the main character consults Bible churches and the porn industry, for example. His cynicism is evident without such hamfisted hyperbole.I noticed frequent similarities to David Foster Wallace's fiction, certainly a promising association, but Othmer kept needlessly augmenting an already forceful story, to the point I felt manipulated and disrespected as a reader. I am happy to forgive him these overindulgences, since the book is so fun, but I do feel that he missed the oportunity of writing something truly excellent. Describing a person and a culture that eschew constraint needn't require storytelling that eschews restraint."},{"Title":"The Futurist: A Novel","review":"While reading The Futurist, I used words such as clever, hilarious, and insightful to describe the experience of reading such a fun and intelligent novel. The truth is these words do this book little justice. Its set pieces alone are worth the price of admission. It is laugh out loud funny. And its many characters contain great depth, and even their own tales. (Perhaps in Othmer's second novel...)\\"Oh, shit. I've given back tens of millions. Some of these guys, these billionaires, make me sick. They think that now they're rich, they can satisfy their egos, alleviate their guilt, by thinking their accidental windfall somehow means they are geniuses, cosmically ordained and therefore eminently qualified to solve the world's problems -- AIDS, loose nukes, illiteracy. They're delusional enough to think that they matter more than others in a larger sense. They think, Now that I've made billions on a search engine that can locate highly specialized subgenres of kiddy porn at thrice the speed of light, I'm going to teach the world to read. When in truth they're rewriting history to say that their original business models, the ones that made them obscenely rich, were driven not by greed and hubris but by some larger calling to transform the world.\\"William Faulkner once instructed that good fiction is \\"about the human heart in conflict with itself.\\" Author James P Othmer seemingly knows especially well this writerly commandment. Othmer conflates the personal and professional conflicts that rage in the heart of his protagonist, Yates (the eponymous Futurist) with his, and our, attempt at understanding \\"why they hate us (Americans).\\"It has been a long, long while since I devoured a novel as voraciously as I did The Futurist. Its sheer exuberance, its epigrammatic style, and its wit and irreverence are a hoot! More to the point, however: I believe you would enjoy this novel every bit as much as I did. And still do. Yes, it is that memorable.Check it out!David M Gordon"},{"Title":"The Futurist: A Novel","review":"While much of what I read about The Futurist seems to be aimed at jaded corporate players and expats, this book struck me as just as relevant to the dormroom Stewart/Colbert fans who, without knowing the specific machinations behind the world that Yates existes in, that has been shoved down their throats since infancy, clearly feel that something is amiss. The heart of this book, encapsulated by Yates' admission of being a \\"founding member of the Coalition of the Clueless\\" should resonate with anyone who not only seeks the truth in a world programmed to cloud it, but has enough humilty and respect for it to throw their hands up every once in a while and say \\"I don't know\\". Therein lies Yates' likeablilty. His selfish pragmatism, obnoxiousness, and warped moral compass fittingly push that likeability to the edge, in a way only the best written anti-heroes can, but ultimately couldn't squelch it. That conflictedness of Yates' character, along with Othmer's spot-on satire and just plain witty prose made this book for me, and I'd highly recommend it to just about anyone else who comes across this review. In the immortal words of Yogi Berra, \\"the future aint what it used to be,\\" and there is no better or more entertaining example of that today than Yates and The Futurist."},{"Title":"The Futurist: A Novel","review":"As usual, some people just don't get it. This book is not to be read on a literal level. No, this is not a \\"realistic\\" novel, but there is plenty of realism in it just the same. Having just finished Imperial Life in the Emerald City (nonfiction), it wasn't hard to recognize all the details of Iraq and the Green Zone in \\"Ba'sar\\", both now and in the near future. Why do you think there is the whole scene in Greenland with the ice breaking away? Global warming maybe? There are plenty of lines that made me laugh, but it was a two-edged laugh, because they were so true. The corporate and government spin couldn't be better done. The book even starts with a nice piece of irony on the first page: the futurist's girlfriend has left him for a history teacher. The futurist is supposed to be finding out why everyone hates Americans and Westerners, and this is turned upside down in Fiji, where someone says, \\"What I wonder is why they hate us?\\" This book has many levels, and makes a lot of sense. It's certainly a good analysis of the present and a reminder that the near future is likely to be pretty scary."},{"Title":"The Futurist: A Novel","review":"This novel is all about a globetrotting pundit named Yates, who journeys from conference to conference dispensing whatever prognostications and shibboleths his corporate sponsors require to stimulate their local economies and, at every stop, elevating mini-bar-raiding to a grotesque art form. Whether this book connects with you will probably depend on your interest in the author's cynical take on the future direction of our global economy and your tolerance for self-absorbed protagonists who have lost their way in blind pursuit of professional success. Think \\"Bright Light Big City\\" meets \\"Jerry McGuire,\\" with a William Gibsonian, cyberpunk veneer.Much of it worked for me, though I had some difficulty buying into the conspiratorial framework of the story, especially the plausibility of the Johnsons' recruitment of Yates to serve their amorphous geopolitical agenda. While adding an element of danger and intrigue to the story, it compromised the believability factor.James Othmer is a talented writer, with a finger on the global pulse and flair for satirical humor. I look forward to his future offerings.-Kevin Joseph, author of \\"The Champion Maker\\""},{"Title":"The Futurist: A Novel","review":"It must be because I actually identify with Yates, which maybe makes me deplorable, that I love this book. Uncomfortable, but true.First, there is the fascinating plot. I keep meaning to stop reading and take a break at the next lull in the action, but there isn't one. The story just keeps charging ahead. I end up closing the book at arbitrary places, wanting to get back to it as soon as I can. I want to know whether the gay Brit has something sinister in mind, despite his good-natured breeziness; or whether Marjorie is actually going to show up; and if she does, why? Who are Johnson and Johnson, really? And who is Nostradamus?But it's more than the absurd but weirdly believable storyline that keeps me in thrall. The characters are as real (and therefore as fake) as the people I actually know. (Maybe I should reevaluate my current station in life, but that's not of interest to readers of this review. The point is, these are very real people, even if they seem exaggerated.)Anyone who has traveled the world, not quite knowing where to go next or why, but going anyway, can feel kinship with Yates. The thoughts he thinks while making his decisions feel so familiar. The moments Yates is alone with his thoughts are so intimate, so real, that I can only have respect for Othmer for hanging it out there. As a writer, he knows how to pay attention to his own internal dialogue and get it all down.Sure, Yates is cynical. I wish I came up with as many hilarious one-liners to the inane remarks made by whoever is close at hand. It's maybe a little too scripted, but then, do we read a book in order to hear the main character utter the predictable?I suppose the book has a small audience because it is so anti-formulaic. It is undeniably desultory at times. That's how it feels when you're wandering.The hook, if there is one, is the chasm between the truth of what Yates is feeling and the bulls**t he deals. If you have even spun the people you know and felt that unpleasant tickle when you flash on the double deception that they are just playing you back, that together your mutual house of cards is stable, but *honest* is suddenly out of place, then you know what this book is about. And also what you need to do about it.So, folks, if you don't care for this novel, well, BFD. I admire James Othmer for what he has put down on paper. It just may be that this book is still in print years after most of what came out last year has been forgotten. Who knows? This might actually be \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" for the 2000s. Then, like the people who initially loathed Yates's speech in Johannesburg but changed their minds when they learned how popular it turned out to be, the other reviewers on this page will say they always loved \\"The Futurist\\", too.Feel free to tear up this review.

I prefer characters that I don't want to slap."},{"Title":"The Futurist: A Novel","review":"Having stumbled across the title in the local public library and, even before I read a page, the Wall Street Journal ran a piece on this book as an example of focused, niche marketing, a new author trying to find an audience in a highly competitive market. So I looked forward to the book and even devoured it quickly.I was disappointed. Sure, there is a great start and a wonderful premise: A highly paid, \\"expert\\" on the future who, enjoying the lavish global lifestyle of a rock star celebrity, gets good and drunk and admits that the emperor wears no clothes, that he is better understood as the leader of the Coalition of the Clueless than as some great seer. After the expected physical retribution from his highly disappointed sponsors -- who pay Yates, the futurist, to tell the world media that the future is wherever the sponsors want him to say it is -- he becomes an even bigger celebrity and star, simply for telling the truth.Blending elements of Nelson DeMille's wisecracking retired cop and Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt, along with the same sort of facile gee whiz grasp of the world we have come to expect from Thomas Friedman, Othmer takes Yates and the reader on a wild, extravagant ride around the world, from South Africa, to Greenland, to Italy, to the South Pacific, back home to Pennsylvania, and then off to some forlorn, war-torn country, all under highly suspect assumptions and conditions.The 'get' in this book appears to be the obvious namedropping (Friedman, Faith Popcorn), corporate and government apparatchik's, and the prostitute with the proverbial heart of gold, golden beauty, and a dark past. And the off-stage, cybervillain, you could see who he was after about the first one hundred pages.If you like descriptions of wasteful, wanton spending, Othmer offers enough. There's a realtively lengthy, inexplicable riff on surfing, tossed in for good measure. Othmer opens most chapters with brief stories of the futurist's past, a enviable but misguided life littered with contradictions, hypocrisy, and simple dishonesty. There's some fun, global color, sarcasm and irony, but not much emotion or reality in the presence of the futurist."},{"Title":"The Futurist: A Novel","review":"This should have been a very good book. If you read the blurb, read the plot, or even try to summarize it afterwards, it comes out as a good book.But. The writing style is overly stylized and becomes taxing and dull about halfway through the book. The lack of character development and character insight is frustrating -- as Othmer adds more color and strangeness to his characters throughout the book, he makes them more superficial and unbelievable. And the storyline, such that it is, gets horrendously convoluted before leading everyone to the conclusion that they knew was coming all along."},{"Title":"The Futurist: A Novel","review":"Reading this book reminded me of lots of consultants I have met who state the obvious and then look around a crowded room expecting everyone to applaud them on their breakthrough insights and wisdom. The story of Yates, a futurist suddenly disenchanted by his own hypocricy, just did not do it for me, even if it had bits of interesting sarcasm and irony scattered through the text.

I am a futurist, so my reading of this book was not necessarily objective. Having said this, I did try to like the book. After all, it is publicity for my profession, and, as the old saying goes, any publicity is good publicity as long as they spell your name correctly. And the author, to his credit, does spell futurist correctly.The hero is unappealing -- self-pitying, morose, bitter, whiny. Not a good role for Johnny Depp. Apparently, as he looks back at a very successful career, he feels he was not honest. So he decides to become honest, and then he becomes even more successful. Right.The premise is not credible, and therefore the book is not believable.Arnold Brown"},{"Title":"Understanding Dispensationalists","review":"Poythress provides a very thoughtful, honest look at dispensationalism from a reformed perspective. It is a short and easy to read book, and should be required for all dispensationalist (or anyone who has fallen in love the Left Behind series). Before I read this book I read Keith Mathison's book Dispensationalism: Rightly Dividing the Word of God? and couldn't help but think that he used huge over-generalizations and was more content to attack dispensationalist that open a dialog with them. Poythress avoids this trap with a fair interpretation. He points out that dispensationalism has a very high degree of internal coherence. While many reformed theologians point out the problems with dispensationalism, they do so from within the reformed mindset. As Poythress points out, dispensationalism makes complete sense when viewed within a dispensationalist theology. He does, however, point out why the dispensational theology is flawed and, ultimately, incorrect. Finally, he is careful to observe the distinction between classic and progressive dispensationalism. Since there are, as Poythress points out, many areas of agreement between reformed and progressive dispensationalists, he directs most of his critique towards to more radical classic dispensationalism."},{"Title":"Understanding Dispensationalists","review":"If one wants a very scholarly and irenic book on the problems of dispensationalism, then this book is it. Poythress examines the characteristics of dispensationalism, the presuppositions of dispensationalism, the hermeneutics of dispensationalism, the social forces behind dispensationalism, and problems associated with dispensationalism. He also pursuasively argues why dispensationalism is biblically and inherently problematic as he examines the &quot;literalistic/flat&quot; hermeneutical method used by dispensationalists. He also offers alternative ways of reading biblical prophecy that make the biblical message of God's redemptive plan coherent. He also uses passages like 1 Corinthians 15:51-53 (chapter 7) and Hebrews 12:22-24 (chapter 12) as test cases when examining the biblical faithfulness of the dispensational system. His chapters on OT intrepretation (chapter 10) and typology (chapter 11) are very insightful and interesting. These two chapters are a must read if one wants to understand the problems associated with dispensationalism. The only problem I have with Poythress is his insistence that Jesus Christ is the &quot;fulfilled&quot; or &quot;ultimate remnant&quot; Israel (pp. 126-9). Though he makes an interesting case here, I did not find it pursuasive. The Bible makes it clear that the new covenant (cf. Jeremiah 31:31-33) will be brought in by Christ's death. Believers participate in the new covenant through faith in Christ. As a result, they become the true Israel (cf. Galatians 3:9). Another interesting point Poythress brings up is on the matter of conditional/unconditional promises of the Bible. Poythress argues that dispensationalists have always tenaciously held onto the gracious and unconditional nature of God's redemptive purpose, and that this affects their hermeneutics (p. 63). Here, Poythress touches a little bit on the whole &quot;lordship salvation controversy.&quot; Poythress is right to maintain that though the salvific promises of God are unconditional, that does not exclude the necessity of obedience and discipleship. God's promises are unconditional in one sense (Christ fulfills all the necessary requirements), but they are also conditional in another sense (these blessings are received by a faith that produces fruits). I would highly recommend this book for those wanting a short, scholarly, and thoughtful critique of dispensationalism. This book does not include the harsh polemics and irresponsible name-calling contained in other works critical of dispensationalism (i.e., Gerstner, Mathison, North, etc.). Poythress acknowledges that dispensationalists are also brothers and sisters in Christ who are striving to understand what the Bible teaches about God's dealings with humankind. This book will enlighten you and make you understand more clearly what dispensationalists believe. Thus, it is not a book you will regret picking up if you're interested in this subject."},{"Title":"Understanding Dispensationalists","review":"There is no doubt that Dispensationalism is fatally flawed, but Poythress manages to avoid any nasty confontational language and attitudes towards those who hold this belief.Giving credence to his thesis is the fact that he spent time at Dallas Theological Seminary doing research for the book. In fact, he thanks the staff and students for their help! Given the often dogmatic and unloving attitudes that persist on both sides of the interpretive divide, Poythress is very effective and genuine in his style.Poythress has a number of arguments against Dispensationalism that can't all be summarised here. He does, however, point out that Dispensationalists often paint themselves into corners - they believe the Bible is the literal word of God (which Poythress believes as well), but are unable to cope with basic exegetical problems that contradict their theology. Rather than allow their theology to be changed by the Bible, they interpret the Bible via their theology - thus removing a central part of their belief system that the Bible determines theology.I challenge any Dispensationalist to read Poythress' work and still remain committed to their theology. But, like Poythress, I do this in the spirit of love, recognizing their faith and love of Christ."},{"Title":"Understanding Dispensationalists","review":"This book was instrumental in my leaving Dispensationalism. It is clearly presented and yet it does so in a very respectful manner. Most books pro or con are not very kind in their presentations. Mr. Poythress gives a reasoned approach concerning the core tenants of Dispensationalism (and there are only two---read his definition to find out: It surprised me too!). He then works through scripture in context to show how the writers of the New Testament do not look at the Old Testament the way in which Dispensationalists say that they do. Other reviews go into more detail on this, but let me say this: If you are in the Dispensational camp and would like to read a reasoned, but very kind review of your theological system, this is the book to read."},{"Title":"Understanding Dispensationalists","review":"Dr. Poythress has written an excellent book seeking dialogue over confrontation. Such is a rare approach between the two camps covered here! Steering clear of bombastic rhetoric and overdrawn characatures towards dispensationalists, this book actually stands a chance of being read by them and advancing discussion and understanding."},{"Title":"Understanding Dispensationalists","review":"In this short, scholarly work, Poythress argues ably against the traditional Dispensational position, especially in the area of hermeneutics. The work itself is concise, well-written, irenic (which is few and far between when dealing with this subject), and accurate in its portrayal. As a dispensationalist, I found his arguments fair and on target when dealing with the classical position from within my tradition. As Poythress states in his book (especially in his biblical critiques of Disp. in 1 Cor. 15, and Heb. 12), this book is more of a critique of traditional Dispensationalism and will find its arguments better-suited against this classical understanding (Chafer, Brookes, Scofield, etc.).As a Dispensationalist who's followed more of the Revised/Modified tradition (of Ryrie, Tan, Walvoord, McClain, Pentecost, etc.), most of the arguments had a smaller impact on me, as most from this later movement of Dispensationalism between the 1950s and early 80s would find little trouble responding to Poythress' hermeneutical (which in-turn become applicational) critiques. However, his work was very solid and I certainly do not want to downplay it in my response. Above all, Poythress clearly shows the foundational problems within the classical tradition, specifically, the dualistic issues seen from its earthly/heavenly dichotomy. However, Poythress tends to show his own interpretive issues as he signifies all the Mosaic Covenant (along with much of the other OT covenants) as originating in the 'Heavenly reality', showing a slant towards the metaphysical.However, with that being said, he carefully observes the modifications of others within Covenant Theology pertaining to the earthly character of God's promises, especially Anthony Hoekema in his, 'The Bible and the Future'. Though Hoekema does not contribute towards the development of earthly promises within an understanding of a Millennial Kingdom, he does contribute to the earthly character of the promise fulfilled in the New Earth in the final renovation (a nuanced Amillennialism). I found Poythress' comments on these modifications very helpful.Other than the inherent dualism prevalent throughout early Dispensationalism (see also Ronald Henzel's 'Darby, Dualism, and the Decline of Dispensationalism'), there is, without a doubt, some problems in the expressions of Dispensationalism (even of the revised sort) on how they express the relationship of the two peoples of God, especially within the Millennial Kingdom period, yet future (to us). I find his critiques well-deserved and needed, though Ryrie, Walvoord, and Pentecost have dealt with many of these problems over the course of their distinguished careers, especially in view of the final state and how both people groups will inhabit the New Heavens and New Earth, co-existing as the Redeemed.This movement of Dispensationalism has made the 'Two Peoples of God' view much less apparent, though they still hold to it. I think part of this is because they do see a clearer relationship between the two peoples than older Disp. did; this is welcomed. They have also completely set aside the 'Two New Covenants' view from older Disp. (thankfully) and have articulated a view that sees only one New Covenant, yet not inaugurated in any sense until the Millennial Kingdom (Prog. Disp. sees it as already inaugurated). In the end, Dispensationalists still need to work on this articulation, though it is a difficult area in every system's understanding. Yet this concession does not mean that we should abandon the earthly, political/social aspects that we view as so pertinent from the OT Covenants with Israel. This is where Poythress fails to engage thoroughly enough to convince me to leave the Dispensational hermeneutic, though I do commend him on his solid contribution.Overall, Poythress has written one of the best critiques of Traditional Dispensationalism, and does so with a congenial attitude towards the Dispensational community. Thankfully, Poythress doesn't make the faulty arguments/straw men based on poor scholarship that so many still make today about Dispensationalism, such as two ways of salvation, it doesn't believe in the entire bible for the church, etc.; I commend him for this. Dispensationalism and Covenant Theology have been listening to each other's critiques for the past 60-70 years (though not highly publicized) and each has made revisions to their systems. The inherent problems will always be complex and there will always be a tension in the Promises of God between the earthly/heavenly, material/immaterial, and eternal/historical. These will remain with us till the fullness of His coming. Thankfully, men like Poythress have the ability, and irenic spirit, to lead the church in these dialogues, even if some still disagree or others have yet to reach a conclusion. An excellent read."},{"Title":"Understanding Dispensationalists","review":"I have to say, as a Dispensationalist, Poythress' critique of Dispensationalism certainly bears the distinct mark of Christian LOVE. I cannot thank him enough for that, as I've grown SO tired of being labeled everything from \\"wrong\\" to a \\"heretic\\" to \\"unsaved\\" to a \\"member of a cult.\\" Poythress never goes there. He is as much as gentleman as Ryrie and others are within Dispensationalism.I gave this book a four because of that attitude he displays, but in my view, Poythress misses a number of things that are important to my particular understanding of Scripture. For instance, referring to Romans 11, Poythress states, \\"Romans 11 tells the story [of position in Christ vs. apostasy] very effectively. Some dispensationalists construe the olive tree in Romans 11 as a symbol for being in the place of spiritual opportunity and privilege. It certainly involves that. But it also implies being holy (Rom 11:16). To be part of the olive is thus similar to being part of the \\"holy nation\\" of 1 Pet 2:9. It is similar to what Peter means by being \\"a chosen race, God's own people\\" (1 Pet 2:9).\\" His comments here are a bit confusing. On one hand he seems to be saying that the Dispensationalist is incorrect in viewing the Olive Tree as the place of spiritual blessing. Yet, immediately prior to this, he also seems to be saying that what has taken place with the Jew who were cut off from the Olive Tree is that they apostacized, but can be grafted back into the tree. He does not explain what he means by \\"apostacized.\\" Does he mean losing one's salvation, or does he mean, backsliding far enough so that outwardly, the Christian's life looks nothing like what a Christian life should look like?The other stickler in just this one spot (at least for me), is his explanation of various sections of Peter's epistles and the use of the terms \\"Israel\\" and the \\"Church\\" in various places throughout the NT. In the case of Peter's epistles, I'm not convinced that he was writing to Gentiles at all. In fact, if he was writing to Jewish believers (in the majority), then much of his language is completely understandable. If he was instead writing mainly to Gentiles, it seems perplexing since they would not necessarily have understood terms such as \\"you yourselves like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ\\" and \\"But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. Once you were not a people, but now you are God's people; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.\\"This type of terminology equates to Jewish readers, but not necessarily to Gentiles. In fact, with the amount of quoting Peter does from the OT, it seems obvious that he expected his readers to be very familiar with what he was talking about. However, Gentiles would not have been familiar with it at all. Even the part of about \\"once you were not a people, but now are God's people\\" is predicated on the fact that though Israel as a nation was God's chosen nation, they rarely acted like it. It is only through Christ that the wall of partition has come down; that which separates man from approaching God boldly.I am not sure I see the problem that Poythress maintains is there in the Hebrews 12:22-24 passage. If I am not misunderstanding him, Poythress seems to forget that the name of the book is Hebrews. This is an obvious reference to the fact that the writer of Hebrews was writing mainly to Jewish Christians, who would have had a decidedly firm grasp of the OT and the typology found therein.Poythress seems to be saying that since both Jewish Christians as well as Gentile Christians have arrived at the true Mt. Zion, this then represents the fulfillment of the Abrahamic Covenant? So then, since Abraham and the Patriarchs have inherited the \\"heavenly land,\\" the promise made to Abraham by God beginning with Genesis 12:1-3, and repeated in Genesis 13, 15 and 17, has been fulfilled. But what is the reality NOW?For instance, Paul states in Ephesians that I am presently seated with Christ in the heavenlies (cf. Ephesians 2:6). Is this my reality now? Certainly, in some sense, yet at the same time, I am still fully human and I am still alive on this planet and I still possess the sin nature. While I have the fullness of Christ potentially, in actuality, I am not really there yet; I'm certainly NOT experiencing it in my daily life perfectly by any stretch. So, in reality, it is the promise of being with Christ that I know I will one day experience in actuality. What keeps me from enjoying that fullness now is this \\"body of death.\\"It seems that what Poythress is doing then is going to the END of the journey so to speak, and pointing out from Hebrews that we are already THERE (technically), so in that sense everything that was promised to Abraham has been fulfilled. While it is true that WHEN we get there, everything will have been fulfilled, for NOW, while I am HERE, God still has a will and plan for my life that will yet unfold over the remaining time of my earthly life.Satan is alive and well and creating havoc all over the earth, yet he has been beaten and condemned. How can that be? On one hand, he is allowed to continue to roam, accuse and cause problems within the confines of God's will (as it has always been), yet a day will come when he will be a problem no more. In that day, his power will in actuality, be destroyed. In the meantime however, that has NOT come to pass. It is like a check that has not been cashed yet. It is POTENTIALLY cashed, but not ACTUALLY cashed.I'm not sure how Hebrews 12:22-24 somehow negates the concept of Christ's physical, future reign over a political Kingdom for 1,000 years. Yes, Christ reigns NOW from His Father's throne, but there is a very good LEGAL reason as to why Christ MUST reign on earth, physically and from David's throne.What the writer of Hebrews is pointing out is the ultimate fulfillment which WILL become our ACTUAL experience with the start of the Eternal Order. Poythress seems to agree when he states, \\"Dispensationalists nevertheless have an important point to make. This fulfillment in Heb 12:22 is \\"a\\" fulfillment, but not the greatest, broadest, most climactic realization of the promises to Abraham. That is still future. We err if we minimize this.\\"Regarding the alleged problem with 1 Corinthians 15:50-53, I don't see the problem at all. First of all, Paul uses the definite article \\"the\\" in reference to this Trumpet, and I see Poythress' point here about it being the VERY LAST EVER trump. While both midtribulationists and posttribulationists believe this is related to the seventh trumpet of Revelation, it cannot be. The people in the Corinthian church would have had NO knowledge of the book of Revelation since it had NOT been written yet!But sadly even Poythress misses the Jewishness of the situation here and I think it is extremely obvious what Paul is referring to. But since most Gentiles think in Gentile terms, it is very easy to miss as Poythress seems to have done.Paul MUST be referring to the Feast of Trumpets in this passage. It is very likely that because of his previous teaching for the Corinthians, he may well have spoken of it before.According to Fruchtenbaum, \\"During the ceremony there are a series of short trumpet sounds concluding with one long trumpet blast which is called the tekiah gedolah, the great trumpet blast. This is what Paul means by the last trump. As such, it says nothing concerning the timing of the Rapture; only that the Rapture, whenever it comes, will fulfill the Feast of Trumpets. This trumpet is the same as the trump of God found in 1 Thessalonians 4:16. In that passage, at the sound of the trumpet the dead are raised as incorruptible and we, the living, will be changed.\\" (Footsteps of the Messiah, page 148)So this \\"last trump\\" is the last trump of the Feast of Trumpets, not the last EVER trump. This is at least PART of the problem with many interpretations today. The Jewishness has been obliterated from the Bible, by us Gentiles, who see everything through Gentile eyes. Yet, the Bible was written BY Jews and essentially FOR Jews, at least to start with (and ultimately of course, by God). IF we would put the Jewish context BACK into the Bible, that the Roman Catholic Church and others have removed, most of the meaning would become obvious. Thank goodness for people like Arnold Fruchtenbaum!Overall, as I said at the beginning, Poythress' critique of Dispensationalism is honest, worthwhile and extremely charitable. He has put a tremendous amount of work in his book and that is obvious. This is the type of person I could sit down with, enjoy a dinner and dialogue. I'm sure I could learn a great deal from him regarding Covenant Theology was well.The trouble though is that his own interpretation of Scripture is questionable at various points and he assumes the position of the Dispensationalist at times without meaning to do so. These aside, this is one book that I am very glad to have in my library!"},{"Title":"Understanding Dispensationalists","review":"When it comes to theological discussion, few topics stir up more controversy than eschatology. One thing at least seems certain to Christians of all eschatological persuasions: What we believe about the \\"End Times\\" is extremely important! As Christians, our hope is based on our understanding of Christ's victory and future return in glory, and so our interpretation of how and when this return will be manifested has a tremendous impact on how we articulate and practice our faith.So why are there such widely varying accounts of the Biblical account of the future? How can theologians and laypeople read the same Scriptures yet interpret them so differently? Why, when two Christians are in total agreement about nearly every other doctrine of the faith, might they disagree so vehemently on the topic of eschatology that -- in some instances -- one might even cast doubt on the other's salvation?These are some of the questions Vern Poythress -- an amillenialist -- hoped to address when he took a sabbatical from Westminster Theological Seminary in 1983 to spend a semester studying at Dallas Theological Seminary, a school founded for the propagation of dispensational theology.Unlike so many books on eschatology which are written to promote or discredit a system of interpretation, this is a book written to unify believers. Poythress seeks to promote understanding and gracious dialogue between Christians with varying beliefs. The fact that many of this book's endorsements come from stalwart dispensationalists proves that this was a discussion long overdue, even when it was written more than twenty years ago. It is a much needed addition to the canon of theological discussion, and I'm so thankful to have read it!Poythress begins by pleading with dispensationalists and non-dispensationalists to listen to one another. He acknowledges that \\"both sides cannot be right\\", but proposes that, rather than argue over which side might be right, both sides consider the possibility that no one has eschatology completely correct; that all might have something to learn from trying to see things from different points of view.He models this type of understanding by listing many of the merits of dispensational thought, among which are an End Times-driven zeal for evangelism and defense of the inerrancy of Scripture. This is followed with a summary of the history of dispensational theology, beginning with its creator, John Nelson Darby, and tracing its development through the teachings of men such as C.I. Scofield, Lewis Sperry Chafer, Charles Ryrie, and others. This section closes with a look at some modern variations within dispensationalism.Poythress follows this with a similar summary of the teachings and developments of covenant theology, the primary evangelical alternative to dispensationalism. This chapter is written primarily for the benefit of dispensational readers, as the author focuses on things the two views share in common (\\"the inerrancy of the Bible, the deity of Christ, the virgin birth, the subsitutionary atonement of Christ, the bodily resurrection of Christ, etc.\\") and on common misunderstandings or misconceptions of non-dispensational views such as historic premillenialism, amillenialism, and postmillenialism. Many of these wrong conceptions stem from misrepresentation of these views in the writings of dispensational theologians. The most prominent of these misconceptions are that covenant theologians (1) do not interpret the Bible literally (more on this later); (2) do not believe in different dispensations throughout redemptive history; and (3) believe that the church replaces Israel as the recipient of God's promised blessings.After these introductory chapters, Poythress gets to the crux of the matter. The differences between these views are much more complex than most people realize, and this makes simple refutations nearly impossible. Unfortunately, few from any side of the debate are willing to dig deep and address the real issue, which is hermeneutics. Rather than focusing on the interpretation of specific passages -- which is where most eschatology arguments begin and, abruptly, end -- Poythress investigates the entire interpretive system of dispensationalism, comparing it with a covenantal viewpoint at every step.One of the primary reasons dispensationalism is so attractive, says Poythress, is that it is completely consistent within its own system. In other words, given the presuppositions with which dispensational theology approaches Scripture, it \\"works\\". All of the various interpretations of Scripture passages line up. Challenging a dispensationalist on the interpretation of a single passage would require a reinterpretation of a host of other passages as well.Instead, Poythress focuses on one of the largest presuppositions of dispensational hermeneutics: the concept of \\"literalness\\". In what is probably the book's best section, he devotes two chapters to showing that \\"literal\\" can have several different meanings, and that dispensationalism as a system relies on the ability to frequently change between some meanings of \\"literal\\" while excluding others. Poythress advocates avoiding the use of the word \\"literal\\" when dialoguing with dispensationalists, instead favoring more descriptive terms such as \\"grammatical-historical interpretation\\" and \\"plain interpretation\\".The remainder of the book does break down a few specific interpretive differences, illustrating how various systems of interpretation deal with certain passages or ideas. These include typology and the interpretive viewpoint of Israel in the Old Testament, as well as how much and in what way God's promises to Israel were fulfilled in Christ. The two passages of Scripture Poythress does address are 1 Corinthians 15:51-53 -- which he says offers particular difficulties for dispensationalists -- and Hebrews 12:22-24, which he shows can be a fruitful passage to begin a dialog with dispensationalists about their understanding of the separate parallel destinies of Israel and the church.The book closes with a list of areas not explored in this book, but which will be necessary points of discussion for dispensationalists and covenant theologians seeking understanding and unity.While nothing is covered exhaustively in this relatively short book, it's a refreshing approach to discussion of a critical doctrine. As one of the very few non-dispensational members of my church, I'm quite motivated to promote understanding in this area, and am indebted to Poythress for his work in this area."},{"Title":"Understanding Dispensationalists","review":"I admire Dr. Poythress and his attempt to present a case for covenant theology and against dispensationalism. He is a brother in Christ and his tender spirit is evident throughout his work. The divide between covenant and dispensational theology is not critical and only God knows for sure who is right!That said, his argument is weak. For the purposes of this review, I will simply present one of his arguments, his case against Romans 11. His short argument is as follows:_______________Why are the two separate terms, \\"Israel\\" and \\"the church,\\" usually used for Jews and the church in the New Testament? Superficially, this might seem to point to the idea of two parallel peoples of God. But one must remember that theology is not to be deduced directly from vocabulary stock (cf. Barr 1961; Silva 1982). In fact, the NT usage is rather complex, since many instances of the use of \\"Israel\\" refer to the people of God before the transition which took place at the resurrection of Christ and Pentecost. Some uses are OT quotations. But, beyond this, several terms are needed in a complex situation where some of the Old Testament people of God have been cut off from their fellowship with God (Romans 11). The obvious and convenient decision to use \\"Israel\\" and \\"the Jews\\" (hoi Ioudaioi) most of the time to designate the Jewish people need not entail any denial of the deeper conceptual and theological unity between Old Testament and New Testament phases of existence of one people of God (cf. 1 Pet 2:9-10).________________This is a weak argument that beats around the bush, avoiding the obvious with verbose prose. He resorts to saying its \\"rather complex\\" and \\"complex situation\\" without systematically presenting why. The fact that Israel refers to the people of God in the OT and during Christ's life is entirely irrelevant to the fact that Israel continues to refer to physical Israel. Dispensationalist and covenantals concur that Christ is the only path to salvation, and the present-day remnant of Israel are Christ-believing Jews, and there is only 1 path to salvation for Jews and Gentiles - trust Christ. This is besides the point! Poythress doesn't present a case against the dispensational framework here.Finally, by saying that it is an \\"obvious and convenient\\" choice to use the word Israel makes it seem almost like the Bible were the product of man, instead of God. I feel uncomfortable with Poythress' language here. No, God is deliberate in His choice of language, convenient or not convenient, and God communicates to us in plain, simple, normal language, not \\"complex\\" - I believe Poythress is making a simple conclusion complex in order to attempt to present a straw-man case.I hope this helps. For anyone who wants to dig deeper, I ask them to simply read through the OT. God plainly promised physical Israel. And then read Romans 9-11, as well as Revelation, where the word church doesn't appear after the 4th chapter where it is raptured. Why would the church appear throughout the NT and then suddenly disappear in the Tribulation?"},{"Title":"Understanding Dispensationalists","review":"For a dispensationalist, reading this well-intentioned book is a bit like hearing someone describe a significant event in your life, in your presence, although the speaker wasn't remotely involved in your life at the time of the event.

All in all, this is a good book for both covenant and dispensational believers who are interested in reading what covenant theologians think dispensationalists believe, and what, in their opinion, are the impassable contradictions of the dispensational system of exegesis.

It is suspensful, funny and also romantic at times. Fun to read."},{"Title":"The Redheaded Outfield & Other Baseball Stories","review":"Written almost a century ago, these baseball stories are very much a flashback to how the game was played back then as well as to how writers expressed themselves. The game was much simpler then, although the players were much rougher. Most of the players were largely uneducated, baseball was their life and if they could not play, most of them would end up working as manual laborers. There was no pension plan and players were property, to be bought and sold based on the needs of the ownership.Shortly after the beginning of the twentieth century, baseball was truly the national pastime; it was the only major national sport. The professional players formed teams in the off-season and barnstormed everywhere, in the era before television, it was the only way most people could possibly see their heroes in action.These stories capture all of those features of baseball in that era, from the struggling minor league teams to the crippled boy with an extraordinary understanding of the game to the mega-fan that will risk death to root for his favorites. There is also mention of how the owner of the team can force the players to play an exhibition game even though they are dead-tired from their grueling schedule.While the stories are fiction, this book is very much an accurate rendering of how baseball was integrated into the American social structure as well as how the players approached the game. They are a bit simplistic, but at the time that was the level of the readership."},{"Title":"The Fountain of Delight","review":"Despite the negative review from Publisher's Weekly, I enjoyed this sequel to All My Worldly Goods. I enjoyed reading about the characters' lives in the first book, and I wanted to hear what happened next.There are several story lines in Fountain of Delight, all of them involving people connected with the Carlyon's home. The story jumps from one story to the next, often in alternating paragraphs even, which was rather distracting sometimes when something significant was happening in one story line, and it skipped to another line after only a couple paragraphs of the first, and then back and forth, but it did give a sense of the simultaneous progression of the people's lives. Each person is treated as a whole person, with their individual histories explaining why they talk and feel as they do. Being part Asian and part white myself, I particularly liked the parts dealing with mixed relationships.I was reviewing what else Amazon had by Weale because I was hoping to find a book about these characters' further adventures. I didn't want the story to end, because people's lives don't end neatly and cleanly, and I still wasn't satisfied that I'd read all I wanted to when the story ended.Weale gives enough of past history so the reader doesn't have to have read All My Worldly Goods to understand this story, but it helps to understand why the story starts out as it does."},{"Title":"San Francisco Bay: Portrait of an Estuary","review":"I bought this book as a fan of David Sanger's photography. I was pleasantly surprised to find that Sanger and Hart were able to show me parts of the area I've lived in for 20+ years that I did not know existed. While San Francisco Bay is an exceedingly urban area, it also abounds in wilderness and wildlife. I was particularly taken with the descriptions of several ways of daily life in and on the bay.The tone of the book is factual without being dry. John Hart's writing style felt like a wonderful conversation with someone I've known a long time. I learned a great deal about how the bay is changing and why those changes are occuring. There are several very detailed maps of the bay that correspond to the areas discussed and I referred to them often. The photographs are exquisite. The bay is always beautiful in those golden hours before sunrise and sunset and David Sanger must have spent a great deal of time to capture so many evocative images.After reading through the book and spending time with the images, I felt like I wanted to participate in the restoration of this unique area. The appendicies are helpful, offering a list of 20 places to visit and a comprehensive list of agencies and organizations that are central in the preservation and restoration of the bay. All in all, a very satisfying book."},{"Title":"San Francisco Bay: Portrait of an Estuary","review":"I love the Delta and have been a fan for a long time. For most people in the Bay Area it is an undiscovered area. The Delta is a fascinating place to explore. I have been traveling and searching around for more than 30 years and I have barley scratched the surface. Unfortunately there is very little written about either the human history nor the natural history. On the surface this book looks like a glossy medium sized coffee table book full of first class beautiful photography of the natural environment but it is a lot more. It is broken down into sections or vignettes of modern life on the Delta, from the huge tankers and commercial ships that squeeze through the rivers to the operating farms and the people who are working fishing and preserving the fisheries. Great book of artful photographs which are actually useful illustrations for the informative text instead of the other way around. If you are interested in the San Francisco Bay or even better if you have no interest in the bay this book may spark a life long interest in it and make your life in the area that much richer. Buy it, you'll like it."},{"Title":"San Francisco Bay: Portrait of an Estuary","review":"San Francisco Bay: Portrait of an Estuary does a good job covering much of the Bay Area and not just the most accessible, well-known features.

It is not aimed for the biomedical scientist interested in protein and enzyme or whole tissue analysis. References are adequately listed."},{"Title":"Prague Pictures (The Writer and the City)","review":"Lovers of Banville's fiction will appreciate the same feel for language and beautiful writing which is this writer's hallmark. His knowledge of Prague spans more than 20 years of both pre- and post-communist rule, and very nicely gives the flavour of these two very different periods, without reverting to clich&eacute;s about the Cold War, etc. Filled with wondeful personal anecdotes as well as more general interesting knowledge, the book may to some seem incoherent. However it not only makes you want to visit Prague, but gives much appreciated sections on Czhech art photography (I fell in love with the cover - especially the back), astronomy (perhaps not too surprising, given some of Banville's novels), and the strange behaviour of European royalty. Its wide span is to be applauded rather than seen as a shortcoming - it is after all not *meant* to be a traditional travel guide. I finished this book while on vacation (regrettably not in Prague), moved on to some currently popular crime novelist, and almost immediately threw that book away in disgust when comparing the prose to what Banville (true to form) serves up in this little gem."},{"Title":"Prague Pictures (The Writer and the City)","review":"John Banville, in many of his novels, conjures up the alchemical and scientific wonders of early modern Europe: Copernicus, Kepler, Newton, Dr Faustus. His prose always has daunted me from taking on his dense, serious fiction, but perhaps, after this wonderfully self-deprecating, nimbly observed, and precisely rendered collection of thoughts inspired by events and people in Prague, I will try his novels! As Banville prefaces this small but pleasingly compacted assemblage of ruminations, it is not a guidebook but (my words) a momento urbi, a reminder of this city.He avoids post-Wall sightseeing (contrast Myla Goldberg's Time's Magpie), limits his Kafka citations wisely (compare nearly any other journalist!), and steers clear from tiresome dynastic recitals (unlike Peter Demetz' City of Black & Gold). Out of his travels there, starting in 1975, he instead opts to build slightly interrelated essays. The first, \\"Sudek's City,\\" tells of the Professor and Marta, who show him and his companions prints by Josef Sudek, a photographer (two of which I presume grace this book's covers), who reveals tangibly yet tangentially the post-war era. Banville links the dislocation of the jet-lagged traveller in the hotel room with the wider struggle by a people to overcome alienation in their home city, yet such connections are left subtle, for us to tie together. The description in a page or so of the Professor, who himself threatens to become effaced after so many decades of having to blend in to such surroundings, is one of the most powerful depictions in print I have ever read of summing up another human in a few well-chosen words.\\"Threshold,\\" from which the name for Prague was derived, merges the background on the city with its monuments, even as Banville insists that they do not make Prague what it is, this essence too elusive. Fittingly, such fluidity blends into an account of Rudolf and the intellectual climate that lured some of Europe's most creative minds in the later 16th c. to study magic, astronomy, the occult, and the rational, or mixes thereof.\\"The Prague Orgy\\", while never mentioning Philip Roth, starts with Banville's teenaged longing for a minor Czech actress, Eva Bartok, and his longing for such dark beauties, often with (sans makeup!) pale plum-hued shadows under their eyes. He segues into his friend Phil who boasts of \\"The Company,\\" the Havel era, the \\"putative parents\\" of his hostess at a doomed dinner party, to conclude, paraphrasing another Philip (Larkin) that \\"nothing, like something, can happen anywhere. Banville again evokes psychological dislocation marvellously, keeping control of his shifting scenes while hiding from we his readers his manipulative strings. He's too good a writer to let his craft show so nakedly.From one who wrote a novel called \\"Kepler,\\" the chapter \\"Great Dane, Little Dog\\" relates the long story of Tycho Brahe, his unfortunate death for the sake of royal etiquette, and his somewhat unwilling apprentice Johannes Kepler. Prague itself fades a bit even more than in the rest of the book, but Banville keeps the tale engaging. I found this segment of the volume readable, but since I do not share Banville's obvious love of this period, its comparative detachment from the city itself made it too tangential. On a related note, he incorporates references to a far more obsessive text, Angelo Maria Ripellino's \\"Magic Prague,\\" nicely into his volume, so you feel you get the gist of that admittedly appealing but immensely detailed study without all of its laborious asides. Their common concentration on the hermetic, the mathematical, and the malcontent does show why Prague thrived as an asylum and a laboratory for so many ambitious quacks, mad scientists, and rogues.\\"Snapshots\\" takes Banville out of Prague to Bratislava, but not for the sights. He conveys here being out of place as a modern intellectual at a conference where his ignorance (so he assumes, though we readers might disagree) his unmasked before the restless native audience. The tale of an old communist, Goldstucker, and the saga of the Golem and the Jewish ghetto is recounted to sum up the condition of the latter-day dreamers and thinkers in a more recent regime that reigned over the Castle.Finally, in two brief codas, \\"The Deluge\\" tells of the 2002 summer floods, with a marvelously apt quote from Eliot's \\"Four Quartets,\\" and \\"After-Images\\" leaves us with Banville's fading scenes from his Prague travels. A short bibliography adds to the value of this short but elegant and never predictable meditation.Pg. 83 sums up his motif for this volume, except for its covers devoid of visual \\"pictures\\" that rather he brings out of his mind's eye into our receptive faculty: \\"These are the things we remember. It as if we were to focus our cameras on the great sights and the snaps when developed all came out with nothing in them save undistinguished but manically detailed foregrounds.\\" The unreliable and capricious state of memory, then, is Banville's true souvenir that he shares with us from this city."},{"Title":"Prague Pictures (The Writer and the City)","review":"This book gives so much insight into Czech history and culture, anybody interested in Prague or Czech Republic will gain much from reading this.

Not only does the author feel everyday experiences more acutely than most of us, but he is able to maintain the depth of his poetic explorations from the beginning to the end. Having been there myself before and after the Velvet Revolution, and having also witnessed the cultural highs and lows he so perfectly describes, I almost feel like I know him. (I wish I did). This is so special a book that I almost want to tuck it into a private place on my bookshelf where no one can find it, and snobbishly, I suppose, lend it only to those I feel are perceptive enough to understand."},{"Title":"Nine Plays","review":"Most moderns tend to think of Eugene O'Neill (1888-1953) as a great realistic playwright on the basis of such remarkable works as Long Day's Journey Into Night, The Iceman Cometh, and Moon for the Misbegotten. It may therefore come as shock to realize that O'Neill actually won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1936--long before any of these titles were staged, much less published.O'Neill began writing poetry at an early age but soon turned to drama. By 1916 he began to make a reputation with The Provincetown Players, and in 1917 had several one acts produced by New York City's Playwright's Theatre. His leap to fame came in 1920 and 1921, when his plays Beyond the Horizon and Anna Christie won back-to-back Pulitzer Prizes. He would reign on the New York stage as the great American playwright of serious drama throughout the 1920s.But in the early 1930s O'Neill--who struggled against poor health, alcoholism, and a host of private demons--became reclusive and fell silent. By the time of his 1936 Nobel Prize most critics assumed he had written himself out, burned out, that his career was over. NINE PLAYS, with an introduction by Joseph Wood Krutch, was first published by Modern Library in 1941--at which time O'Neill had not offered material for either publication or production for close to a decade. In a very real sense, the public and very likely O'Neill himself considered this volume a &quot;summing up&quot; at the end of a distinguished career.The titles included in NINE PLAYS were selected by O'Neill himself as representative of his work, and in an extremely brief note he indicates that his selection was based both on personal preference and critical response. The titles collected here are: The Emperor Jones, 1920; The Hairy Ape, 1921; All God's Chillun Got Wings, 1923; Desire Under the Elms, 1924; Marco Millions, 1923-1925; The Great God Brown, 1925; Lazarus Laughed, 1925-1926; Strange Interlude, 1926-1927; and Mourning Becomes Electra, 1929-1931.The selection is interesting in a number of ways. Although O'Neill first made his reputation with realistic drama, virtually every title included here is &quot;experimental&quot; in some form or fashion. True enough, critics of the era fell over themselves to describe O'Neill's work with various &quot;isms&quot;--expressionism and naturalism among them--but in a general sense the titles here are intensely theatrical in nature, and they all broke with then-popular notions of what a play ought to be like.The Emperor Jones contains remarkably little dialogue at all. All God's Chillun Got Wings challenges racial notions through a then-shocking tale of a love between a black man and a white woman--a subject truly taboo at the time. Desire Under the Elms seems to be realistic in tone, but in terms of visuals it is anything but. Characters literally put on and take off masks in The Great God Brown and action grinds to a halt while they speak directly to the audience in the lengthy Strange Interlude. And then there is Mourning Becomes Electra, a mixture of symbolism and melodrama that actually requires three nights to perform.Also interesting is the fact that O'Neill includes two titles that were absolute disasters when they appeared on stage: Marco Millions and Lazarus Laughed, both of which might be described as pageant-like dramas that include choral readings in direct echo of ancient Greek dramatic forms. Clearly, O'Neill did not intend NINE PLAYS to be a sort of literary &quot;greatest hits&quot;--the very popular Beyond the Horizon, Anna Christie, and Ah! Wilderness are conspicuous by their absence--and at the time this volume was first published considered his more experimental work of more significance.Casual readers will likely find O'Neill a challenge. On the page, his dialogue has an unnatural quality that doesn't exist in actual performance--but at the same time it is often extremely difficult to envision how an O'Neill script plays, how it actually lives when it is &quot;on its feet&quot; in front of an audience. Consequently, I do not really recommend anything by O'Neill to someone who hasn't seen much theatre or who is unaccustomed to reading playscripts. I think such readers will find it too much of leap to be enjoyable. But if you are a play reader or playgoer, you will likely find him a very rewarding experience.Fortunately, O'Neill began to write seriously once more in the 1940s, and if anything the power of his final works is even greater than those of his earlier ones, with the posthumous 1956 Pulitzer Prize-winning Long Day's Journey Into Night considered his great masterpiece. If you are looking for an overall O'Neill collection with scholarly annotations, you would really do better with the exceptional three volume Library of America collection, which covers virtually every play he wrote from 1913 to 1943--but this less expensive volume would serve as an excellent introduction for those who aren't quite ready to make such a serious financial or academic investment. For no matter how it is published, Eugene O'Neill is still Eugene O'Neill: the great American dramatic voice of the 20th Century.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Emotional Disorders and Metacognition: Innovative Cognitive Therapy","review":"This book is an excellent piece in informing us the latest development in applying metacognitive principles in anxiety and depression problems.

The patterns he describes are very much in concert with my own Anglo-Catholic tradition. Some of the issues he addresses in his first chapter are of particular relevance to Old Catholic jurisdictions, which strive to maintain a balance between responsiveness to current culture and a commitment to historical patterns and theological beliefs. These issues are also true for mainline churches (and seminaries!) that are facing falling numbers while certain other churches seem to be growing.In exploring the history of liturgy and liturgical reform, Watkins addresses recent efforts such as the COCU liturgy and the Lima liturgy, explaining why these have not found more widespread use. He also addresses efforts at reform within particular denominations, as well as bilateral discussions and agreements of intercommunion among churches. One issue that Watkins does not address (and one that I have personally experienced, both inside and outside Old Catholic circles) with regard to intercommunion and eucharistic hospitality, is the problem of bureaucracy and (often defensive) hierarchy of the church - just how much of the problem really rests in theology and worship practice, and how much in very human limitations of personality and politics?Watkins sums up his ideas of the theological norm for worship as: \`Thankful praise generates the church's full cycle of celebrative actions and serves as the criterion by which we measure all that we do in worship.' (p. 60) While this is true, it seems to me an insufficient statement. In discussing distinctions between mainline and evangelical churches, Watkins seems to point out a loss of the eucharist centre to worship in mainline churches has caused them to lose religious power present in the evangelical traditions. My experience shows a difficulty. In Bloomington, the Episcopal church, which has maintained a cycle of daily eucharist for many decades, has been losing members bit by bit each year, whereas the non-denominational \`mega-church' on the south side of town, which has communion no more frequently than quarterly, has gained thousands of members in less than a decade. What keeps a eucharist centre means is different to the two churches; one seems to hold the pattern without the spirit, and the other is reaching for the spirit without the pattern. Each church tends to be suspicious of the other in many respects theologically.In the second section, Watkins explores the shape of the liturgy (borrowing from Dom Gregory Dix's title), how the prayers, the service of Word and the service of Table fit together, and the significance of the Great Thanksgiving. Watkins introduces some new emphases to me - the idea that offering is the beginning of the service of Table, and the change of emphasis that this can bring, gives new life to the portion of the prayers that offers our sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving. Watkins also argues for a balance in the liturgy:\`The liturgy needs to be full enough that it can genuinely be called celebration. It needs to be spare enough that we can move through it with full attention and unflagging energies. The challenge to people who plan and lead worship is to establish that balance between simplicity and fullness of detail. (p. 73)'My tradition often has a tug-of-war between high and low church liturgical styles; sometimes those who seem to have the strongest ideas about Sunday morning worship have the least tendency to connect it to anything beyond Sunday morning practice. Such worship can become an idol, a game, a performance, or even an escapism from life. None of this does justice to the liturgy.Also in the Anglican tradition, there are members who recall the days when Morning Prayer was a standard Sunday service - I don't get a strong sense from Watkins what can be done to educate and include people in a revised practice of weekly eucharist when their emotional attachment is still to the Morning Prayer model. Historical and theological arguments, in my experience, rarely seem to win over emotional and \`traditional' attachment. Even if lip-service is paid by them to acknowledging the history and theology behind the decisions, how does one reach them on the levels that are going to make them feel included in the service?I'd like to know more about how Watkins is received by those who have not had the same liturgical and eucharistic background I have had. Where are the points of disconnection with them? In many ways, Watkins is \`preaching to the choir' with me - there are minor points, to be sure, but nothing major."},{"Title":"Hamster in a Handbasket (Animal Ark Series #16)","review":"My son and I chanced upon the Animal Ark series at his elementary school's book fair.

Small in size but not in scope, it less delves into his life and work with hardly a wasted word. Short but very insightful discussions of the character and occasional shortcomings in his compositions, with very level-headed and perceptive opinions (and a more positive reception of the composer's Late Period than I would have thought from a work of that time). The discussion is not watered down, but never gets over the head of the average listener. Many pieces are quickly dealt with, but the writing is direct, the insights sharp, the points well-taken. What's most impressive is how Scott has advanced many a theory I've rarely heard since, but which make such good sense. One wonders why she wasn't take more seriously, her insights not more frequently cited by others in their works. (Was it because she was a woman in a man's world?) She speculates, for example, that the \\"central three\\" of the last five Beethoven quartets were likely culled from aborted attempts to write masses; this not only describes their spiritual quality\\" better than the modern cliche about how they initiated \\"the avant garde,\\" but it also explains Beethoven's famous cyptic note to his publisher about Op. 131: pilfered together from this and that. If indeed much of the material came from the three masses that comment would be justified. Furthermore, she claims the last quartet, Op. 135, short as it was, would have been even shorter because it was originally intended to be only three movements. But while many critics believed the slow movement to be the added section, she doubts this because that would have meant every movement in the quartet was in F Major. Rather she posits that the scherzo is actually the extraneous movement, and even claims it does little to advance the quartet. We've been so blinded by its bold audacity that we've failed to see that this is quite true. If you doublt me, try playing the work without the scherzo: in some ways it's even more interesting.I'm surprised this book isn't better-known today, and has not recently been reprinted. I got more out of this slim volume than out of many biographies or analyses that go on for 500 pages or more. Worth looking for. Highly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Beethoven, (Master musicians)","review":"The original Beethoven study in this series dates back to 1899. However in 1934, Dent Music Masters replaced that early volume with an entirely new study by Marion M. Scott. This particular edition enjoyed great popularity and was reprinted nine times between 1934 and 1974. Scott (1877-1953), an English music critic, musicologist, violinist and composer, untook a completely new study of Beethoven's life and work. Her insightful comments on his music are based on her own interpretations and careful study of each score. She visited Beethoven's birthplace and immersed herself in his world. The result is an extraordinary classic study of the man and his music. Scott was a metaphysician who probed deeply into the spirital aspects of Beethoven's music and created a text that is both stimulating and profound. &quot;Beethoven's last quartets are not the justification of modern music,&quot; Scott observes, &quot;but modern music has reached the point at which it justifies the quartets and proves Beethoven's genius to have been transcendental.&quot; Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Blonde Countess : An Exciting Novel of International Intrigue","review":"Herbert O. Yardley's novel \\"The Blonde Countess\\" had me staying up late turning the pages to see what new event would happen. The first edition I picked up at an antique store in Annapolis was published in 1934. The magazine blurb that was pasted inside the front cover of my book references Yardley as a Major and well experienced in espionage and cites his nonfiction book \\"The American Black Chamber\\" as responsible for the removal of an international cabinet officer and that the United States Congress passed a law preventing publication of his nonfictional sequel to that book, presumably on the grounds of national security. He then followed with this novel which purportedly draws some similar scenarios as his unpublished nonfiction sequel.The story follows Nathaniel Greenleaf, the head of an evidently real-life secret service government agency called \\"the Black Chamber.\\" Joel Carter is the young lovely secretary who apparently has an unrequited secret crush on her boss. Coded messages reveal the Germans to have enlisted a female spy named \\"J-37\\" who has infiltrated government levels and is feeding good intelligence to the Germans about American troop strength and movement. Into the office walks the wife of a Scandinavian ambassador, the Countess Thorlund, a woman whose dazzling beauty bewitches most men and alienates most envious women. Events quickly unfold with the assassination of a Black Chamber expert in invisible ink and coded messages and the uncovering of a German spy. This follows the Countess being put on the American payroll. But suspicions remain as to whether she is a double agent or trustworthy. Kidnapping, forgery and suicide bring the novel to its crashing conclusion at the opera. The very last chapter fast forwards to recount the result of the espionage, the actual battle with German submarines, depth charges and steel nets cast in the sea. The characterizations serve the story without a lot of frills that help you to get to know the inner workings of their minds. All in all, this is a gripping story, the work of an author who has obvious first-hand knowledge about the subject matter.

We would probably need a geologist, a mythology expert, a historian, a marine biologist, a physicist, a Biblical Scholar and his counterpart, an expert on Darwin's theories, an astronomer, a marine engineer, a seer or two, and last but not least, an explorer. Amazingly enough, Peter Freuchen is a sort of one man committee who fulfills all of these requirements and incorporates all of these viewpoints into his BOOK OF THE SEVEN SEAS.Freuchen devotes chapters to a wide range of ocean related subjects such as the geological history of the earth from the time it was a flaming ball until it became the planet we inhabit today, then on to all aspects of the ocean ranging from currents to tides to to winds to the animals and plants that call the oceans home, ad infinitumn. Other chapters address the history of seafaring from rafts and sailing ships to submarines, discussions about great voyages from the early explorers to the Kon Tiki, great sea battles, and mysteries, mythology and marvels of the sea.One discussion that I found particularly interesting revolved around the idea of the &quot;seven seas.&quot; In reality, in Freuchen's own words, &quot;there are at least seven times seven seas (or alternately) only one.&quot; The term was first used by ancient mariners of the Mediterranean world who knew only seven large bodies of water which they thought were the seven seas of the world. They also thought that the world was mostly land, between 85 and 90% in fact.With the coming of the age of exploration, it was discovered that the ancients had made a rather serious error. There was a lot more water than had been thought, and many new seas were discovered. Because of these explorations and discoveries, the term &quot;seven seas&quot; was dropped and largely forgotten for several centuries. Then, in 1896, along came Rudyard Kipling. In looking for a title for one of his works, he rediscovered the term and incorporated it into his title.In Freuchen's terms, &quot;(Kipling) was a great man, and a popular man, (so) the world had to make his words good.&quot; To do this the geographers figured out a way to divide the ocean into seven parts. Again, according to Freuchen, it isn't a very good way, but we can get along with it &quot;even if few of us can remember what the seven are.&quot;For information purposes, the ancient and modern lists follow:Ancient: Mediterranean, Red, China, West African, East African, Indian Ocean, and Persian Gulf.Modern: Arctic, Antarctic, North Atlantic, South Atlantic, North Pacific, South Pacific, and Indian.To summarize, and again quoting Freuchen: &quot;The whole thing is a triumph of poetry over reality.&quot;Freuchen's books have gone out of print and, in my estimation, that's a shame. All are worth reading both for the learning experience and for pure enjoyment."},{"Title":"Letters from the Dead","review":"This novel is amazing.

Unlike Western astrology which had its cultural rise and fall, Indian astrology is an intact tradition that has been an essential part of its society for many thousands of years. We Western astrologers can benefit by learning from this amazing tradition.Linda Johnsen is an American who is steeped in Indian culture and spirituality. Many readers will know her as the Vedic Astrology editor of the Mountain Astrologer. I've particularly enjoyed her clearly written and astute columns, so when I saw this book it went straight to the top of my to read list.A Thousand Suns is a good beginners books on Indian astrology. It is worthwhile reading for the dedicated Western astrologer seeking to expand their knowledge and for students of Indian astrology. She covers the basics like how to convert your Western chart to Indian and the meanings of the planets, signs and houses. Most important is the spiritual foundation of Indian astrology. This foundation, admittedly lacking from many of the medieval European texts, informs the entire practice. A large portion of her book is about Upayas, or remedies, with a focus on mantra and other spiritual practices. For those without an Indian bent she includes ideas and prayers from other traditions. Anyone seeking to integrate spirituality and astrology will find many inspiring ideas in this clear and soulful book. Recommended."},{"Title":"A Thousand Suns: Designing Your Future with Vedic Astrology","review":"Linda Johnsen is the greatest living woman writer of Jyotish (Vedic Astrology);her numerous and award-winning books been instrumental in bringing the timesless wisdom of the Indian Sages (a 6000+ year tradition) to the West. A Thousand Suns is the quintessential introduction for beginners (Linda makes the material easy, fascinating, exciting and immediately available) as well as more advanced students and professionals, who will find Linda's clear and lively explanation of the core principals of Jyotish to be refreshing, rejuvenating, and invaluable help in their daily practice. Her writing style is perfect; beautifully conceived and executed with great precision, offering an easy personal rapport with the reader and an expression that is at once understandable, yet deeply thought-provoking. Linda Johnsen is writer, editor and contributor to The Mountain Astrologer and International Yoga Magazines, where her articles shine like A Thousand Suns.I will never be without this nor any of her other books! Order A Thousand Suns Today! Your life will be greatly enriched!"},{"Title":"A Thousand Suns: Designing Your Future with Vedic Astrology","review":"Extremely well-written book which provides information unavailable in other Jyotish books. A Thousand Suns isn't the best for mechanics of casting or interpreting a chart, Bloomfield's book is best for that. But after reading Svoboda, Frawley, Levacy, and Bloomfield, I can say this book is extremely well-written and presents interesting background material you won't find in the other books. I wish I had read this book BEFORE some of the others as it is more concise. A Thousand Suns makes plain certain subjects (like house rulership) which were confusing and poorly explained in other books.This book won't serve as a stand-alone if you want the actual mechanics of chart interpretation (Bloomfield wins on that score) but I highly recommend it for the mythological and historic background material which is essential to a deeper understanding for Westerners. Also, Johnsen's writing style is so clear it will save you hours of trying to understand other writers who explain the same topics, but not as clearly. I found A Thousand Suns at my local library. I don't know why it never came-up in the Amazon search engine? I wish it had so that I might have read it sooner!"},{"Title":"A Thousand Suns: Designing Your Future with Vedic Astrology","review":"I was so disappointed. Not nearly as well organized, logically presented, or well-edited (no index either) as the author's \\"The Complete Idiots Guide to Hinduism\\" that I absolutely loved. Instruction sequence (and gaps) makes it difficult to complete even a simplistic Vedic chart. It has undefined terms, continual \\"commercials\\" for websites, unrealistic recommendations for daily practices, unabashed Anti-Republican political agenda, and poor examples of applying even a simplistic chart to real events of daily life. I SO loved the Hinduism book; I am so disappointed in this one. It's difficult to tell whether the author knows the topic and just had a poor editor and review feedback OR that she really doesn't know and is merely a believer in Hinduism trying to make a dime."},{"Title":"The God Factor: Inside the Spiritual Lives of Public People","review":"Good food for the mind & the soul. Ms. Falsani is skilled & has her heart, common sense & funny bone at work."},{"Title":"The God Factor: Inside the Spiritual Lives of Public People","review":"This book is outstanding. Falsani demonstrates what depth of insight is available when we allow so compassionate a mind access to our most cherished--if not guarded--pieties and further allow the encounter be told by her equally light hand. Every reader will feel the world a little more reenchanted for the experience. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The God Factor: Inside the Spiritual Lives of Public People","review":"I read a lot of books on religion and faith, and most leave me without much to chew on.This book is quite different.You might not think celebrities would have much to say of interest about faith.But these interviews drew me in. Even celebrities I could care less about say something thought provoking.Maybe it's the author's choice of subjects, or more likely it's her interviewing skills, but this is a must read for people on a journey of faith."},{"Title":"The God Factor: Inside the Spiritual Lives of Public People","review":"Finally, a book that gets the most taboo subject out there without blushing or politicizing. People certainly talk about sex more openly than they talk about how they really feel about Jesus and they'll talk about their psychiatric health with Dr.Phil before they'll talk about their spiritual life. Here, Falsani, makes the metaphysical, the existential, and the personal... tangible. I don't think Hugh Hefner has been as intimate with a woman as he is with Falsani in his interview. He is so shy, but when she reveals that her idea of a spiritual pop-culture cannon includes the cult favorite Harold and Maude, he virtually gushes with excitement and proceeds to divulge the most intimate of spiritual details about this own life. I never thought that I would learn something about God from Hugh Hefner, but as Falsani talks openly, without judgment, to these mostly American icons, we learn that God's truth permeates every pore of our culture. How inspiring and uplifting to know that God is that big!Great stories from Studs Terkel, Tom Robbins, and Sherman Alexie. Best moment in the book, however, comes from Irish poet, Seamus Heaney. Moved me to tears.Falsani is funny, self-depricating, and searching for truth not in an \\"I'm okay, you're okay\\" kinda way, but through a deep faith that God is good and just and loves us all - even if we don't know He's there."},{"Title":"The God Factor: Inside the Spiritual Lives of Public People","review":"I wasn't crazy about this book as a whole, but there were some gems within that moved me deeply.First, why I wasn't crazy about it: \\"God\\" shouldn't be the first or second word in the title; \\"Celebrity\\" should be. The premise of the book is that famous people talk about their take on God.There are a few problems with that. One is that many of these folks aren't much interested in God, and aren't the most interesting people when talking about God.The other problem is that if you are attracted to a book that talks about celebrities' take on God, you'll probably want bigger name celebrities. There are quite a few folks here who aren't all that famous. So, if celebrity is what draws you, you might not be drawn by the celebrities here.The other factor that didn't work so well for me was Cathleen Falsani's extremely gentle interview style. Falsani lets her subjects say pretty much whatever they want, and does not press them when another interviewer, a Terry Gross, say, might.For example, performance artist and practising Jew Sandra Bernhard rants against non-Jews who are attracted to Kabbalah. She also condemns those who claim to follow Kabbalah and who get tattoes.Bernhard's ranting has its value, but I wish Falsani had pressed her a bit harder. Bernhard, after all, is an openly gay woman who posed for Playboy and who speaks, especially in her interview here, in four letter words.There are many Jews who would object to Bernhard's word choice, her Playboy photos, and her orientation. (For the record, I do not.) How does Bernhard reconcile her own departures from what many regard as Jewish orthodoxy, even as she inveighs against others whom she identifies as inappropriately unorthodox in their following of Jewish tradition?I'd like to know the answer to that question, but I didn't find the answer in this book; there is no record of Falsani asking.But I loved a few of the interviews here.The interview with Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel was outstanding. I've read Wiesel's books, and heard him speak, and read others work about him, and, even so, I cherish his interview in this book.As ever, Wiesel, who survived the worst hell on earth, talks about how and why someone who has suffered profoundly can continue in a life of faith. This is very, very worth reading.The interview with U2 lead singer and political activist Bono astounded me, mostly because of Bono's beautiful and unique language use. Example: \\"The idea that some love and logic would choose to describe itself as a baby born in [dung] and straw and poverty is genius. And it brings me to my knees.\\"Seamus Heaney, Nobel Prize winning poet, politely declined to be interviewed, but sent along a lovely poem instead. His brief poem is as good as any other lengthy interview in the book.The interview that surprised me by bringing tears to my eyes was with John Mahoney, the actor we all remember from the Cher movie \\"Moonstruck,\\" where he was so memorably dating younger women who threw drinks into his face, and as Kelsey Grammer's father on the NBC sitcom, \\"Frasier.\\"I don't want to say much of anything about this interview; I don't want to reveal its details so as to spoil it for you. I will just say that I've been watching, and appreciating, Mahoney for years, and this interview offered me a glimpse into this celebrity's, and human being's, life, that gave me pause, and made me think, and really touched me.It's worth the book to read the Mahoney interview."},{"Title":"The God Factor: Inside the Spiritual Lives of Public People","review":"By way of disclosure, I have never met Ms. Falsani in person, but we have corresponded via email on various issues. Now-on with the review!One of the joys for people living in Chicago is the vibrant writing found in the city's newspapers. Cathleen Falsani is on the religion beat for the Chicago SunTimes and she brings a new and fresh and dare I say \\"fun\\" perspective to writing about religion. She does the same in the \\"God Factor\\". Her style of listening and careful questioning brings out unexpected insights from people you might be surprised to find out even think about issues of faith.Originally, I was going to give this book only four stars. I wish she had been a bit more challenging of some of the answers to her questions. In her shoes, I would have gagged on some of the replies given by interviewees. However, that's not her style and that's why Falsani could bring us a book as good as this. In constrast, I will only bequeath book reviews to posterity.If your view of religion extends beyond the stained glass stereotypes, Falsani is going to be one of your favorite reads."},{"Title":"The God Factor: Inside the Spiritual Lives of Public People","review":"It seems that reporter (and theologian, and pop culture maven) Cathleen Falsani can put anyone at their ease--and simultaneously provoke them into saying the most unusual and evocative statements I've heard these most public figures ever say. \\"The God Factor\\" is an incredible walk through a varied landscape--rappers, rockers, moguls, and senators--speaking candidly not just about \\"God\\" with a capital G but about morality, spirituality, and their place in the world. At a time when religion makes big bucks and guides presidents, and Americans continue to fight over what, exactly, \\"our values\\" are, Falsani's deft walk through the minds of some of the people who most define our culture is brave, adventurous, and completely compelling."},{"Title":"The God Factor: Inside the Spiritual Lives of Public People","review":"For all those who like a good page-turner and have a basic curiosity in what famous people are really like, this is a fascinating read. Falsani just gets people. She has a way of bringing all the important details to life. You come away from this book knowing something intimate about these people you've otherwise studied from a distance. She gets them to open up about big things - their faith or lack of faith, and how they answer big questions - but there's even more to it. She has real conversations with them. Billy Corgan is smarter than you thought. Sandra Bernhard is sweeter than you thought. David Lynch is stranger than you thought (yes - it's true. STRANGER than you thought!) and Hugh Hefner is surprisingly shy, really down to earth once he starts talking about his favorite movies.Reading this book is like sitting in a coffeeshop and eavesdropping on a really good conversation at the table next to you. You'll finish reading and want to pass on so you have someone to talk about it with."},{"Title":"The God Factor: Inside the Spiritual Lives of Public People","review":"Whatever your spiritual bent (or even if you are bent about spirituality), this wonderful work is valuable in its wide-ranging subjects, as well as the respect, curiosity and non-judgmental way in which Cathleen Falsani shares these 30-plus people's stories.There are numerous gems in here...Sandra Bernhardt is a riot---and truly fascinating. Leading off with Bono was a good choice---it hooked me into the next one, and the next one. With more room than her customary newspaper space, Falsani allows the reader into the setting...how an individual carries himself or herself, little moments that reveal so much.The essay on Hugh Hefner was beautifully done, with sparkling moments, including the one when Hef discovered he was not toe-to-toe with a stereotypical fire-and-brimstone Christian, but an intelligent, thoughtful person yearning to understand what makes others tick, on a spiritual level, and its impact on their public works and whatever remains of their private lives.Perhaps more than anything else about Falsani, I admire her courageous honesty. When Jerry Falwell died a few months ago, in her Chicago Sun-Times column she admitted that her first reaction to the news was something along the lines of \\"Good!\\" She then goes on to explore why that was, and delve into more of her thoughts on Falwell's legacy.Like Falsani, I am Christian, and like Falsani, that happened to my own initial (but not overall, I should note) response to news of Falwell's death.But you need not be Christian, or of any particular faith, to benefit from reading The God Factor. As Falsani probes people about such a significant aspect of their lives, any reader paying even a bit of attention can gain important insights into their own choices, the common ground that so many of us share as well as the many differences that go a long way toward making life so interesting."},{"Title":"The God Factor: Inside the Spiritual Lives of Public People","review":"I enjoyed this so much I bought a second copy for a friend. Inspiring, entertaining and honest."},{"Title":"The God Factor: Inside the Spiritual Lives of Public People","review":"In The God Factor author Cathleen Falsani has brought together the thoughts and life directions of some 32 famous, or at least publicly known, people from all walks of life and many different religions. Ms. Falsani interviewed these people, usually in their own homes or places of business, attempting to get beyond labels with often surprising results. Each short interview is headed with information about the religion the person was raised in and which they currently espouse.Examples of the philosophies include (with the current religion and occupation):Tom Robbins, (cosmic lounge lizard) writer: We're all agnostics...even the prophets of old.John Mahoney, (Catholic) rector: Religion means being charitable.Annie Lemay, (no religion) singer/songwriter: I ask myself \\"Am I being kind?\\"Jeffrey Sachs, (secular Jew) economist: We should end poverty and hunger now, because we can.

Audrina's story brought me a safe-haven from the reality of my world, as I got sucked into the emotional whirlpool of hers. I have since read the story over and over - now being 8 years later! My Sweet Audrina is the story of a young girl who comes from the most disturbed family situation that I have ever read about. It goes to show that although people may appear to be 'normal' and 'happy', that something quite awful and horrible may be shadowing their lives. Sure, there are questionable parts of the story, parts which have only become questionable to me since I have 'matured' over the years, but this is truly an excellent story. Despite being a fictional piece of writing, the story challenges many insecurities and issues that we have to deal with, and often choose to ignore. I highly HIGHLY suggest reading this story - but when you start reading it, be prepared to have a good many free hours to finish it!

I don't remember much of the novel since I read it 14 years ago but I do remember the numerous clocks in their house with varying time settings &amp; Audrina living a quite abnormal life.

I read it 14yrs. ago when I was preg. with my daughter. It moved me so much that I named my daughter Audrina. Just last week she read it for the first time and now she's hooked on VC Andrew books too."},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"This book is truly captivating until the very last word of the very last page. This is my favorite story of any in my collection of books (and not just V.C. Andrews books) because of the dark chaos that you feel as reading it, the danger and mystery that makes you get jittery and want to read more. It's not one of those books where you say, &quot;Did the ghost writer write this or something?&quot; It's one of those books that you know V.C. Andrew has definatly written.Vera, the so called cousin, is a very disturbing and strange person. She's like a pest that is slowly becoming a major problem. Or is that happening quickly? It makes you feel sad at times because Vera was mistreated a lot and should have been given the same rights as the First and Best and Most Perfect Audrina did. Yet the fact is that it happened, and because of that Vera was an awful, spiteful, and venomous child that eventually was so far from reality that she really did get what she deserved (if you read or have read this book, you'll cheer along, right?).Damian Adare, or Papa, was the sole problem I believe. If he had given a care to Vera, I think all of this would never have happened. But if he did that, we would never have an interesting story. None the less, he is the character that you will love a bit in the beginning, and dearly hate towards the end as you see his &quot;suffocating and powerful&quot; love for his daughter(s). He says he loves Audrina, but if he did he wouldn't force her into the chair like the first Audrina did willingly. I really do hate him as much as Vera for those reasons.Aunt Ellsbeth and the mother were two very interesting characters in this story, because of the conflicts of love and blood with those harsh words they often shared. And lets not forget Aunt Mercy Marie, the picture frame, who was a substitute for a person they believed was eaten by cannibals because she never came back from her trip to Africa. Aunt Ellsbeth was a very tough yet gentle character, due to the facts that she was cold towards every body but warned Audrina several times to get away and to stay away from true love and Vera. Momma was a gentle and caring person, though she has had her moments that make me wonder if she really was a good person.Sylvia is one of my favorite characters because of her curiousness and her vague love for Audrina. She does care and does know how to talk, but is so shy that everybody thinks she is still stupid. Audrina is put up with the burden but you can see the bond the sisters hold. Audrina has a better friendship with a handicapped person then she does with Vera, which makes me wonder, once again, how did V.C. Andrews come up with this story? So many strange and twisted tales and characters!Now for Arden's family. Billy, I believe, is a very generous and good woman. The only moments I hated Audrina was when she 1) Let her father put her in that rocking chair 2) Let Arden cheat on her with Vera 3) called Billy a whore for sleeping with Damian, even though Damian lured her in his bed and put on a phoney mask that made Billy naive to Audrina's warnings. I felt sorry for Billy towards the end, since Vera was being a total slob and...Arden was a cheat, a lyer, and somebody that makes me mad. Audrina trusted Arden dearly, and when things got tough he left Audrina for Vera. It makes me so angry! I loved him the first time I read this book until the middle, when he started getting side tracked by buisness and other things.The piano teacher, I forget his name, was a good character. He was very interesting and Audrina was a good pianoist because of him. Too bad Vera came along and ruined things as she always does.And last but not least, Audrina. I feel very sorry and sympathetic towards her because of the things she had to endure: the deceit, lies, forbidden passions, and the burden of a handicapped woman who still acted as a child. But most of all the truth that was stuck underneath the tower of lies and hate was the thing that made me amazed at V.C. Andrew's true talent.I really liked this book because of its fight inbetween evil and good, truth vs. deceit, and how love fought desire.Truly, a very good book."},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"The book was really good I read it in like half a day.

As with all V. C. Andrews' books you always know something is not right. No one has the &quot;perfect&quot; life, these books always start out as. This one is more intriguing than all the rest of her books because it is the only solitary work. There is no &quot;the rest of the story.&quot; The families in the Andrews' works are always so disfunctional that you feel better about your own when you put it down. This book really makes someone want to start snooping into family secrets. It makes you question reality. You wonder could something this low really be pulled of. It also makes child hood a little less precious because you realize everything a child knows someone has told them. Their whole entire view of reality could be one enormous lie.It is one to make you wonder, for sure!"},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"Granted, I read My Sweet Audrina before I read any of the rest of her books, although I have subsequently read all of her works, up until the conclusion of her &quot;Heaven&quot; series (at which point, the &quot;ghostwriter&quot; had botched things up and smeared her legacy so much, I no longer cared). This book rules! I was totally lost in the way Andrews weaves the fantasy world in which her heroine unwittingly lives. The characters are somewhat archetypal, but that adds to the power of the book. Vera is a class A witch. One wants to make Audrina take her and shake her, but Audrina, archetypal herself, is almost depressingly willing to be run over again and again by Vera, by her true love Arden, by her parents' lies. Although I wished Audrina would develop more of a backbone, I still rooted for her throughout. This book definitely stays with you.

Now in 2009, after reading the book some half a dozen times over the years, I am convinced that V. C. Andrews was prophetic in what some would do to protect those they love---or keep what they wanted for themselves.Audrina is the poster child of how some are completely at the power of those charged with protecting them, and what can happen when that power is abused.A novel that will haunt you long after you finish it, one has to wonder how the innocent little girl we meet would fair in our world today."},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"This is probably my favorite of Andrews's books.

Well, that is exactly how VC Andrews portrays her book \\"My Sweet Audrina.\\" Whether it be the plot that takes place or the house with twisted stairs and dark shadows, almost every aspect of the book is creepy. Audrina is brainwashed into thinking that she has a sister born years before her that died (her sister had the same name as her). As soon as I read the ending and the secret of Audrina's childhood is unraveled I got goosebumps. I've never had a book make me feel like I was watching a scary movie, but this book definitely did. I won't give away the ending because it is such a good book and I would recommend it to anyone who loves to read twisted tales. This book got four stars from me because of the fact that I can't usually find good, Gothic, horror stories. But, this is definitly a good read.

Its also a heart-felt romance as well.When you start reading this, you must understand that nothing is what it seems. This is what made the VC Andrews books before she died so incredibly amazing and this is one of her very best. I read this once about every five years and I still enjoy it every bit as much as that first time as a kid. Simply put, amazing!"},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"I love this book! It's just so creepy, so engrossing, so much fun. It also has an odd and compelling beauty and powerfully evokes the passing of time, the dynamics of a deeply dysfunctional family, and the fractured character of a young woman who must come to terms with the bizarre reality of her life-if she can find out what that is. Audrina is a strong, sympathetic, interesting character, and all the characters in the book are well drawn and very intriguing. Audrina is one of the most admirable characters Andrews ever created-she is compassionate, courageous, and a true survivor. I think she's also the nicest of the Andrews' characters. I really like her.I first read this book at 13,and I didn't guess the ending, and was utterly shocked, but I've reread it since and I think adults would. Actually I know adults would-I lent it to some, and they figured it out, but still enjoyed the story. I won't give it away here though.This book tells the story of Audrina, who is a beautiful child born to a ruined Southern aristocratic family (they never explain how it was ruined), living in a run down mansion with her older cousin Vera, her father Damian, her mother Lucietta and her aunt Ellsbeth. These are the characters in the beginning, although more come into the story over the course of 400 pages. As usual, most of the characters are in possession of movie-star looks, except aunt Ellsbeth, who is somewhat frumpy, but mostly by choice.My favorite character is Vera, which may surprise readers. Hey, I'm not excusing her actions, and I would not want to know her in real life, but I love her! She is the most perverse, bizarre, cruel, violent, unrealistic character in all of Andrews' books. For that matter, in a lot of books. There cannot possibly be anyone like this in real life. Come on. It was a little silly.But the fact that she's not credible doesn't take away our interest in her. How can there be anyone like this? You enjoy watching her obsession with sex, (she definitely gives us some of the weirdest sex-scenes to grace an Andrews book), her inexcusable torturing of Audrina, her gory miscarriage scene, her vicious acts against just about everyone she meets, but also, somehow, Andrews' also makes us feel bad for her. That's a real accomplishment. And, Vera's kind of funny. In a disgusting way.She had been completely neglected and abused from her earliest days and made to feel inferior to Audrina in every imaginable way, so as Audrina says, her father \\"made her what she is.\\" We don't blame her for resenting Audrina, although as I said, most of what she does as a result is just too dramatic for me to buy. But, I still feel sorry for both her and Audrina. No one is paying proper attention to these girls and they are living in a mad house!!!After Vera, I most enjoy the character of the bitter yet sensible and ultimately kind-hearted aunt, Ellsbeth. She, like Vera, also has a weird gallows humor, but we admire the way she stands up for Audrina. At first she appears to be only self-interested and scheming, but then can't help but admire the persevering Audrina's attempts to disengage from her father's pathological and smothering control. I don't think we've ever seen anyone like her in Andrews', and it's hard not to sympathize with her getting the short end of the stick in life while her sister, the greatest beauty on the East Coast, gets all the attention. (this symbolically duplicates the Audrina/Vera relationship-although Vera is described as very pretty and sexy, Audrina has the \\"unearthly\\" beauty that all Andrews' heroines do, plus, she's acknowledged by the family, while Vera is constantly told she's unwanted.)Lucietta, another likeable character, fights with Ellsbeth a great deal, though she too has been cheated out of what she wanted most-in her case, a music career. Her \\"Tuesday Tea Times\\" are some of the funniest episodes Andrews' ever created. During these times, Audrina's mother and Aunt get dressed up, channel their dead sister, and \\"invite\\" her photo to tea while they insult each other and get drunk. Pretty fun, eh?Then there's Arden, Audrina's long suffering suitor. A lot of people don't like Arden, but I do. He makes a lot of mistakes, but they are all human and understandable under the circumstances. He truly loves Audrina, but isn't sure how to help her. Although, we all have to wonder why everyone doesn't just tell her what's up and get her some real therapy. However, since no one will do that, Arden does what he can.Arden's handicapped mother, Billie, is also an extremely lovable character and one of the warmest in the story. She's a nurturer and we're glad someone is treating Audrina to some real attention.Sylvia, Audrina's developmentally disabled younger sister, is another likable character. Although her problems seem so drastic that they doubt she will be able to ever take care of her own most rudimentary needs, she turns out to be a fiercely loyal and willful character.Damian, Audrina's father, is also a very well-drawn, very well-developed character. He's also the only character I really despise. A controlling narcissist, he is a womanizer who neglects his responsibilities, feels the need to completely control the women in his life, stifles their hopes and aspirations, beats Lucietta, and may be responsible for Sylvia's disabilities. Physically, he is a handsome, tall, commanding man; he is also charming and seductive. Ironically, he is the most \\"crippled\\" of the family, although his problems don't manifest themselves overtly like Billie's, (she lost her legs), Sylvia's, Vera's (one leg is shorter than the other due to repeated fractures), etc.I enjoyed Damian's character, though, even though I was pretty disgusted with him. A lot of women like jerks,(I'm not one of them), so his control over the women around him seemed plausible. But after awhile, everyone's obsession with getting Damian's approval gets tiring-Ellsbeth wants him to praise her cooking, Arden wants him to admire his business skills, Vera wants him to praise her, Billie wants the same, blah blah blah.That's why Audrina is the true heroine of the book, because ultimately she doesn't care about pleasing her father, just about healing herself. Whether or not she physically separates from him is irrelevant-emotionally, she has fought for real knowlege of herself, and won it, and she has learned to stand on her own two feet. It's the most complex character study Andrews' has ever done."},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"Never having read any of V.C. Andrew's work I was both skeptical and curious when her name kept appearing during searches for \\"gothic horror\\" type literature. What I found in My Sweet Audrina was something terrifying, engrossing, and very psychologically complex; to the point of having teh story stay with me long after I finished the last page.Audrina Whitefern is a young girl who doesn't go to school, has no friends, and is constantly under the watchful eye of her overprotective father. Secondly, Audrina is not the first young girl in the Whitefern family by such a pretty name--but the second, after her older sister, the much reverred \\"First Audrina\\" was killed in the woods near their home.Everyone in the family knows the secret surrounding the First Audrina' death. In addition to the second Audrina and her father, they are also joined by her mother, aunt, and cousin Vera. Each of them also knows the secret, something so horrifying and unbelievable you won't want to be spoiled until you discover it for yourself.And as the second Audrina begins to question her past, her life, and the strange happenings around their gloomy victorian mansion, the secret is unveiled, and nothing will ever be the same. This tale of stifling parental love, rape and abuse, and lies and deceit all comes together in the end, leaving the reader with a haunting conclusion that ensures the legacy of Whitefern will continue."},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"This is the real thing. V.C. Andrews herself wrote it and you don't want to miss this one! I find myself reading it again and again over the years. The story is haunting, mysterious, and full of interesting characters. In recent years, Andrew's books have been written by someone else...but this book was penned while Andrews was still alive and has her skillful writing in it &amp; you get hooked into the story. Sensual, cruel and dowdy women can't keep Audrina from the truth about herself. Reminds me of a Stephen King book, except not so long and from a female point of view."},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"This book and &quot;Petals on the Wind&quot; are V. C. Andrews' absolute best, and as far as I'm concerned, the only ones worth purchasing. Some of her series books, such as &quot;Garden of Shadows&quot; are worth checking out of the library, while some (&quot;Flowers in the Attic&quot;) are mediocre at best, with few redeeming qualities other than a couple of interesting characters. Everything after the Dollanganger series (&quot;Heaven&quot; and so forth) are simply unreadable, they are so badly written. (Note to ghost-writer: quit while you're miles behind; V. C. Andrews' fans are not fooled.)After all of the insipid plots of sweet young maidens who are so breathtakingly beautiful that they get sexually attacked by their brothers and fathers, &quot;My Sweet Audrina&quot; is a breath of fresh air. True, our heroine Audrina is another beautiful girl with &quot;glorious&quot; hair that changes colors, and yes, she is going to discover a well-guarded family secret, but her character is much more developed than, say, Heaven Casteel's. As the story begins, Audrina is a young innocent seven-year-old with the inability to recall past events. She is kept insulated in her family's secluded mansion and rarely ventures outdoors. Her lack of contact with the outside world makes her feel desperate and lonely. Even such routine activities as going to school are denied her for mysterious reasons. At night, Audrina is haunted by nightmares, in which she replays visions of her dead older sister in the woods. Her sister was left for dead after being sexually attacked by several young boys. Her father compounds the situation by demanding that Audrina be just like the older sister (also named Audrina), who was perfect in his eyes.For all of Audrina's frustrations about having to live up to the memory of her sister, she is still given a lot of love and attention from her parents. Her cousin Vera (who will later become another V. C. Andrews &quot;Street Tart&quot;) is envious and spiteful toward Audrina, and often lashes out at her, calling her &quot;spoiled&quot; and a &quot;baby&quot;. Vera and her mother, Aunt Ellsbeth, live with Audrina and her parents, and Aunt Ellsbeth is one of the most fascinating characters. Her personality is a great deal like the young Olivia Foxworth in &quot;Garden of Shadows&quot;: someone who was idealistic about love at first, and then became disillusioned and bitter. Because of this, she does not allow herself to love anyone, even her own daughter. Audrina is often the target of Aunt Ellsbeth's disdain, but Vera incites her rage. Vera has learned very well how to get attention in the Adare household: she is the &quot;problem&quot; child, the tarty &quot;bad&quot; girl who is the very opposite of Audrina's innocent, child-like &quot;good&quot; girl.In this story, the first-person narrative by Audrina works very well, because the reader is able to become Audrina, and get inside her thoughts. As Audrina gradually unravels the deep, dark secrets of her memory loss, so does the reader. She is also capable of being strong-willed and fighting back when her father attempts to repress her, even when it is obvious that &quot;pleasing Papa&quot; is very important to her.The drawbacks: Vera is too one-dimensional. Only rarely are we given a glimpse of her vulnerability, and she seems too calculating and clever to inspire much pity, even as badly as Aunt Ellsbeth and Papa treat her. Arden Lowe, as the Perfect Handsome Boyfriend, is a cardboard cut-out; bland and boring, he is more or less interchangeable with Logan, the boyfriend in the &quot;Casteel&quot; series. We never learn exactly what is wrong with Sylvia; at times, she seems like Chief Bromden in &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest&quot; since she is obviously capable of retaining SOME knowledge. Nevertheless, V. C. Andrews has never been more effective at storytelling than she is here; she is careful not to reveal too much about the protagonists at once and leaves the reader guessing until the very end. Overall, I recommend it."},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"Even though Petals on the Wind and Dark Angel tie for 1st place on my charts on best V. C. Andrews book, I would have to say that My Sweet Audrina is #2 all the way. I could believe it!!! I remember when I found the hardcover in a used book store and was shocked at the cover, I realized that this was the only V. C. novel that was published as a hardcover first and then a paper back, rather than paperback originals like all the others. I was glad to find this book, I cherished it as a rare treasure, but strange enough, I never really read it for two years. I've read all her other books, and the dollanganger and casteel series over and over because that's her real books, not those silly cutler, landry books. But anyway, I knew this was a 100% genuine Virginia Andrews novel, so I know it would be great. Boy, I was so shocked!!! It was superb! Usually V. C. tells a horror story that has the heroine (except if there be thorns is narrated by boys) telling the story about family secrets and lies. My Sweet Audrina has all that as well, but it has something else that no other V. C. Andrews novel has, it just is different. It has more sex, much more violence, more swearing, it a lot more creepy and hold forever to it's gloomy atmostphere. Vera was one of a kind, she was a great villain, and I loved the character Lamar Rensdale, You never here a V. C. Andrews novel describe sex in so much detail, but this one is so different, that characters a SO weird, Vera, Lamar, Damian, Ellsbeth, Arden, and of course, Audrina. Audrina was different too, she didnt' posess the fire that Heaven and Cathy had, but she had her own sense of strength. END"},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"As a high school student I am taking a contemporary novel class. The book \\"My Sweet Audrina\\" was one of the books this year that I decided to read. It was a little slow toward the beginning and confusing, but as you keep reading you will began to understand in full detail. Audrina was a beautiful young intelligent little girl whose past is confusing and to jumbled up to comprehend. Her father treats her as if she is made of glass, and her mother and aunt and cousin seems to be hiding something very important from her.Her father convinces her that the first Audrina( her older sister) had a gift, but since she died she doesn't need the gift anymore and that she (the second Audrina) should try to catch it and only then \\"will her pitcher be filled\\".She struggles to be accepted by her strange family as she was not the first Audrina, but the second; she strives to please her father and to find out clues to who she really is and her age and why she can't go to school like her \\"cousin\\" Vera. She can't understand why Vera doesn't like her and treats her inferior to her. As she gets older her fear becomes another obstacle that she and her husband try to conquer.Other strange and loving twist happens that would strain the soul as mysteries began to unravel. Overall I give this book a ten from beginning to middle to end. I would gladly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good book that would maybe lighten the load of today's world by showing that love conquers all."},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"This is, without a doubt, the best V.C. Andrews' book. II read a few reviewers had suggested that this book may have been written by the infamous ghost writer (I must admit, I do still read the books written after her death in 1987, but anyone who knows anything about V.C. Andrews knows that A) the books were not ghostwritten until the late 1980s, and B) stylistically, this absolutely must be her book.) I'm appalled that someone would be so irresponsible as to claim that the book was ghostwritten. It's brilliant, and I hardly think the &quot;V.C. Andrews Empire&quot; would take the trouble to write a single book rather than go with their series franchise, which has to be a better money maker. To those of you who haven't read this book yet: go buy it, and don't read ahead! For the rest of you, read ahead.About the book itself: My Sweet Audrina transcends popular fiction and is in fact a work of art. I first read this book when I was 13, and I'm 27 now, but it hasn't lost any of its appeal. I just read it. I admit, I was floored at 13 when the book's secret was revealed: I have no idea if I would've figured it out now ahead of time, given that I'm older and more sophisticated. However, some things remained the same: the book has the rare talent of making you feel that time is really passing, that you're really living through the years with this bizarre and extraordinary family. And although it is clearly a very unusual family, and although there are dramatic things that occur in it that don't ordinarily happen, it is still a very realistic story in other ways. I loved the other V.C. Andrews' books, but few of them gave me the feeling of providing rare insight into the failings, weaknesses, and quirks of individuals. The characters in this story have a lot of qualities, flaws, and virtues I've seen in others, and they are richly drawn character studies. I think that although some people have called characters such as Vera &quot;a typical V.C. Andrews tramp&quot; those who take the time to notice will see that she isn't typical. We learn quite a bit about why she acts the way she does: and although her behavior is exaggerated for dramatic purposes, anyone who has been rejected by a parent knows the insane behavior that can cause. The advice given by Audrina's Aunt Ellsbeth, and Billie, are perceptive pieces of information about human life, something we don't often see in Andrews' other books. Furthermore, I don't believe Arden is a boring character, nor should we reject him for what he did to Audrina. He felt rejected and cast away by her. Someone else brought up some of the plot lines as unnecessary, E.g. the strangely named Lamar Rensdale, but I think that was a necessary story to move the general plot along. Finally, about the ending, I don't think Andrews' was in any way condoning the smothering and abusive behavior of Damian with that particular ending. Pay close attention to the book, which is so hauntingly beautiful it deserves to be read several times over: Damian is repeatedly condemned for his behavior by all characters in the book and by Audrina herself. I think that, rather, she recognized that she owed it to Arden to work out their marriage, and that she loved Sylvia, whom she couldn't leave behind. As for her father, she was starting to realize that he would never change and to accept that. But the house was rightfully hers, and the point was that she thought she could run away from her past by running from the house, and at the end she realized that she couldn't run from her past. So it was more symbolic of her acceptance of herself and her past, her ability to heal and rise above what had happened to her, than anything we should take as Andrews' condoning &quot;Papa's&quot; selfish, dysfunctional behavior."},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"When I was in high school, all the girls used to read Andrews' books, but this was my very first 25 years later. I have to say this is one of the weirdest, darkest books I have ever read, but I mean that as a sincere and mindblown compliment. If you think your dysfunctional family is weird and abusive, give the clan of Whitefern a try. You may find this is your chicken soup for the freaky family escapees' soul. I loved every dark and twisted moment of it, and now can't wait to get my hands on more of this delightfully dark author's creepy works.

I was sorely disappointed.I had a difficult time getting into this book as it seemed there was no action for the majority of it. Just a mediocre read except for a couple chapters towards the end where everything exciting is dumped. But then even the last couple chapters are boring so it ended and left me irritated I had read the entire thing.There are some \\"secrets\\" and little surprises thrown in other parts of the book but they were predictable and pathetically led up to. Like when you have to sneeze but it goes away - you know it would have felt so good to get that sneeze out and you are mad that you didn't get that satisfaction. That's how I felt after reading this book."},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"Favorite book in the V. C. Andrews canon, and a perfect description of a Southern Gothic tale. Though Audrina Adare is very weak and exists on a favored plane with her father, Damian, she is very empathetic: you feel her confusion, her immaturity and her diffidence. Audrina is controlled and tormented by the reminder that nine years earlier, her older sister, also named Audrina, superior to her every way, ventured into the woods, and was raped and murdered. Her father is intent that Audrina retain her older sister's gifts - rocking in a chair, though she is afraid, and with constant visits to the first Audrina's grave. Audrina lives in a large house called Whitefern, in the Tidewater section of Virginia with her father and mother, Lucietta, and also with Aunt Ellsbeth and daughter Vera. Lucietta and Ellsbeth are step-siblings and foils of each other - Lucietta being beautiful and talented, and Ellsbeth, a schoolteacher, terminated for hitting a child, is tall and plain. Vera is a vindictive beast, whose sadism against Audrina is very specific. SPOILER - If I could change one thing about this book - I would have had Audrina break her ties with Whitefern and move away. I hate that she stayed - not just at the house but also with Arden, who failed her repeatedly, and worst of all, cheated with Vera. (The cheating does not bother me as much as that it was with Vera.) Vera is a hurt girl, shunted by her father. I'm sure she was jealous, but that doesn't justify the intensity of the savagery against Audrina. The book is perfect - just remove the last few lines, and let Audrina live her own life."},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"I am changing my view of this book. At first I didn't like it but now come to find out the truth behind this novel I enjoyed it 100%. It was sad to see so many people die throughout this novel but in the end Audrina realized that she was needed at this house more than she knew it. I always thought that Vera was Audrina the 1st. Hopefully we'll see more novels like this. The plot kept me in suspense throughtout the whole novel."},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"I thought the book was good but I couldnt give it a five star cause i did'nt like the ending.The book is about a girl who lives in her dead sisters shadow and is always seeing memories of her sisters death.

And in the end she makes a choice after learning a terrible secret.I think she makes a bad choice."},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"This book really was &quot;a breath of fresh air&quot; as another reviewer put it. It was very enchanting I think, one of the few books I've read in a while where I actually got lost in the book. It was very haunting the beginning of the book, and very very very well written. Sometimes ( as a writer myself ) its very hard to develope a good character when writing in first person tense, but V.C. Andrews does it very well in this book. I got lost, I actually did not know what time it was, how old Audrina was, etc. The beginning was VERY well written.As the book developed though...well I dunno...Whereas I was very glad and happy to see that Audrina was not some passive sad haunted girl, and was happy to see that Audrina would rebel against her father, I was very dissapointed with Vera. V.C. Andrew's antagonists are always soooooo similar. Vera reminded me of every single antagonist in the Orphan series, Helga, Meg, etc. Andrews tries to make us pity Vera, but at the same time the actions of Vera just get annoying and repititive, its to the point where we all go &quot;ENOUGH!&quot; because the actions are so predictible.I really did not like Audrina's boyfriend/husband in this book at all. Though he was well developed, very well described, and had great character, he was just as much a villian as Vera or the guys who raped Audrina. Andrews does a good job of making us see that no one is perfect, in fact she made it CLEAR in this book. Though I did enjoy the fact that this book wasn't so sexually oriented as the other V.C. Andrews books seem to be, I really did not see how the music teacher thing fit in, what the hell does it matter? And I think the younger sister was just as unnecesary. This book had A LOT of potential at the beginning, but through it all it sort of dragged...Audrina's mother is a big mystery too. How could the cruel mother who scrubbed Audrina's skin to a pulp be the same loving mother who later on died? The characters do NOT mix at all, and there is no explanation of how Audrina's mother switched over.When I got to the end of this book I thought: Oh god, THAT IS THE MOST STUPID THING IN THE WORLD, HOW STUPID IS SHE?????? Audrina's decision at the end could be seen as stupid as stupid can get or it can be seen as the true cross over into adulthood. Audrina's decision to keep trying at her marriage no matter what the heck comes in the way can be seen as something unimaginably possible. So many people these days do resort to divorces, they walk away from anything that doesn't work, they don't have the patience or forgiveness to keep working at it until it does work. What Audrina did took a lot of faith, a lot of hope, a lot of STRENTH, something a lot of adults lack today. In a way Audrina's decision was very fitting, and after a while I did understand it. I really wish that there was more of an explanation or something at the end. I really related to this book, because it expanded SO much on how much the love of a parent can hurt. I know how it feels to feel like you have to work up to certain expectations, and THAT is the power this book has. A l ot of teenagers these days feel like they have to meet certain expectations from their PARENTS, their friends, their enviroments and society itself - and this is Audrina's struggle to meet this expectations, only to find out that the only expectations she really needed to meet were her own. Audrina was GREAT realistic ( key word there REALISTIC ) character who had a lot of strength, and i admire that a lot. *nods* READ THIS BOOK! it's definately worth it!"},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"I'm still reading 'My Sweet Audrina&quot; and I think it's excellent! I recommend you all to read it!"},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"If you've read any of her other books - this is not a whole lot different. Because of the way V.C. writes, I found the story predictable all the way until the very end!! In fact, due to the predictability of her works I have no desire to read any more of her books. She seems to enjoy the same general plot line and simply twists it with each new series. I'm disappointed and have chosen to explore other authors."},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"But at least it's entertaining. This is the story of a typically dull V.C. Andrews-type heroine who lives with her gorgeous mother, handsome, overprotective father, bitter aunt and evil cousin in a victorian mansion somewhere in the south. The aunt and mother drink tea all day, the father spends most of his time at his job, and Audrina plays with paper dolls while cousin Vera torments her and masturbates while reading romance novels. A long time ago, Audrina's perfect, beautiful sister was raped and killed. Since then, her parents have devoted thier lives to protecting Audrina from the outside world. One day, Audrina wanders outside and meets a boy named Arden and his mother, Billie, who live in a cabin behind her. They become friends, and Audrina starts sneaking outside to see him. Daminan, the father, soon catches her, and is angry at first, but after meeting the boy, lets the friendship continue. Audrina's life changes from there. Tragedy and romance ensue. As the title suggests, this is one of the worst books I've ever read. The story does not contain one shred of plausibility. It also suffers from dull, unlikeable charectors, just like Flowers in The Attic did. You know things are bad when your rooting for the evil cousin. Audrina is so beautiful, perfect and inncocent and most off all flat that you can't stand her. Arden came off as being just as annoyingly perfect. Things start off very slowly, with mainly descriptions of the charectors, \\"creepy\\" mansion and the tragedy of the death of the \\"first\\" Audrina and Damians obsession over it biding our time before something finally happens. Things start rolling once the mother dies, and I admit that I couldn't put it down after this heartbreaking development, even though I was able to predict nearly every twist it had to offer. The book jacket plays up on the whole idea of Damian wanting to turn Audrina into her dead sister, and generally makes it seem likes its going to be alot more creepy than it really is. This wanting-to-turn-Audrina-into-her-dead-sister horror story-type thing only takes up a short amount of the book in the beginning. The rest of the story is a rather average, though addictive family & romance drama. I reccomend it if you want a entertaining, trashy drama/romance novel tinged with mystery and horror and charectors you love to hate."},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"This story was so obvious it was a boring read. V.C. Andrews (if she really wrote this or if it was her 'ghost') wrote this story to stand on it's own. It is a complete novel, not part of a series. If you are not familiar with V.C. Andrew's or her masterpiece 'Flowers in the Attic', you may enjoy this dark tale between a father and his daughter.

All I want to say is, about half way through the book you'll &quot;know&quot; whats gou=ing to happen, but you won't really. This book leads you down the wrong path and drops you off at a dramatic conclusion.After reading this book, you'll never look at life the same."},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"I actually like the novels that were written by V.C. Andrews herself a lot better than the ghostwriters later series because it's more gothic and horrific. MSA is a book that way more deeper and darker than the teenybopper books that are out now with her name on them. This book has so many twists and turns, one surprise after another and I like the fact that there's no incest involved being that VC Andrews was right in the middle of the Flowers series when she wrote My Sweet Audrina. Audrina's father fabricated her past after something tragic happens to her and he must've done a really good job because Audrina doesn't remember what happened to her in the woods. In the book you meet Audrina's friend Arden and his eccentric mother Billie. And her cousin Vera is a trip and you see a lot of people dying easily and in the weirdest way. This is a weird book and that why I like it so much. It reminds of a weird dream that you just have to tell someone.

I knew there was a hidden secret. That was obvious. What the secret had to do with was pretty obvious, too. But what the secret actually was was not what I expected.

Audrina, the Second,competing for the place in her father's heart Audrina, the First and Most Perfect, held before her untimely death. Vera the cousin lying and cheating for the very same spot. And Arden, the new love, trying to stay out of the middle where he is uncontrollably caught. The perfect story of how one's home is the hardest to leave behind.

Her writings develop her characters fully whereas the newer books steal something from her plot style (think daytime TV) and that's about the only similarity. All of her books deal with some pretty serious issues and this one is no exception, but it stands in a category by itself. I for one did not figure out the twist in the first paragraph :o)... it took me a lot longer although it did become clear to me before it was actually revealed. It didn't matter! It still managed to send chills up my spine. This book is a lot more intelligent than you would expect in a supermarket paperback with the typically tacky graphic on the front cover.

V.C Andrews life story is a very sad one but her writing is amazing she was a strong woman and a very generous one to give her books to the world to enjoy."},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"Audrina Adare is the young girl who lives at Whitefern with her mother (Lucietta), father (Damian), aunt (Ellsbeth), and bastard cousin (Vera). For as long as she can remember, Audrina has always lived in the shadow of her dead older sister, also named Audrina. In fact, Audrina was named after her sister so she might gain her \\"gifts\\". The pressure is so intense on the seven-year-old that she feels like she'll never be able to be as perfect as the First Audrina.Because Audrina is expected to be like her sister, she has no real memories of her own. Her sense of time is also out of whack; days, even weeks, can go by and she doesn't remember what's happened. She's also kept from school and from having any friends because her parents insist she's too fragile.The mystery of her older sister's death is also a nagging reminder of what happens to girls who disobey the rules and visit the woods anyway. (The First Audrina had been raped and killed there.) Nevertheless, Audrina decides to go one day, and she meets a boy her age named Arden Lowe who will eventually become her husband and her key to her own past.&quot;My Sweet Audrina&quot; is the only V. C. Andrews book that doesn't belong to a series and is quite successful on its own. I would have given it five stars, but the ending was much too disappointing. How could Audrina demean herself by staying with Arden after what he'd been involved in? (I can't elaborate without giving away the plot.)Besides that, this is one of V. C. Andrews' best books, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes psychological suspense or is already a V. C. Andrews fan."},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"In my opinion &quot; My Sweet Audrina&quot; was an excellent book about life and what some children may go through. I truly felt sorry for Audrina in the sense that she deserved to know what happened in her past in order to get on with her life. In the story Audrina lives a life full of lies. She doesn't know that what happened to the first Audrina really happened to her. She is constantly hearing her cousin Vera and her aunt talking about all the secrets they have to keep from Audrina. Every night Damian, Audrina's father, makes her sit in a rocking chair in the first Audrina's playroom and try to catch her thoughts and dreams. He basically wanted her to be more like his so called first daughter. I enjoyed this book because of the way it kept me coming back in order to find out what happened next to Audrina. I would recommend this book to any friend or stranger looking for an interesting book to curl up on the couch and read. I promise you will not want to lay it down!"},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"Where can I begin describing how fantastic and descriptive &quot;My Sweet Audrina&quot; is? First of all, this book takes you back to Audrina is a child and she has no memory of her life at all. She has an evil &quot;cousin&quot; named Vera who chastizes her and made me want to go inside the book and kill her. Not only that, she has a sick and twisted father who wanted her to sit in a &quot;dead girl's&quot; rocking chair so she could possess the First and Best Audrina's gifts, whatever that meant. And let's not forget her crazy and jealous aunt and naive mother who would have &quot;Tuesday Teatime&quot; with a woman in a picture frame who had died years ago. Man, with all these wierdos in the Adare household, I see why poor Audrina felt alone and sad. I was happy when she met Arden and their friendship bloomed into love. Even though later on, he decieved her and slept with Vera...blah blah blah, I don't care what anyone else says, you could really tell he loved her and he was just alone and hurt. He made a big mistake, but wound up regretting it. This book had a lot of great moments in it, but I got bored with three people dying from a flight of stairs and Damien's obsession with the rocking chair. It was also a very predictable ending, unfortunately. I knew all along from the beginning when Audrina could not remember the past events in her life, what the big shocking secret was. It was pretty obvious. But besides all that, this novel had a lot of descriptive and escapading situations. I couldn't put it down. The ending was on a very positive note, and I felt relieved that through it all Audrina decided to be strong and stay with her family. This is the best book written by V.C. Andrews, besides the Dollanganger series!"},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"...Man, am I glad I read it. And at the same time I regret it. The book creeped me out. Next to Flowers in the Attic, this one deserves to be nominated for the Sick & Twisted Plots Awards.Although parts of it were predictable, I still found myself gawking at the treatment of poor Audrina throughout her life by her nasty sister Vera and the twists and turns as the story unfolded before me. By the time I finished it, I was angrily asking myself how idiotic can a man be as to brainwash his daughter ... it felt that real.I give this book 3 stars because of how much it freaked me out too much.

The story could have been told a lot more effectively in fewer, fewer pages. It all just makes you wonder how many people can die and how many tragic and cruel things can happen to the one sweet, once innocent young girl in one whirlwind of a lifetime.No one is 'bad' or 'good' in this book - the one realistic thing about it is that it really delves into how the best of us can have our hateable sides and vice versa. You can evil feel sorry for the evil, evil Vera at times.It is a good thing that there are no sequels to this book - VA could've gone on on forever with this one, but to leave it where it ended was really a wise move.

Oh well."},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"A timeless, very weird, Gothic, mystery, romance novel. Very much (for me) like Marlys Millhiser's The Mirror, but without time travel. Something happened to the first Audrina when she was only nine years old. And because of this, her younger sister Audrina #2 is terribly messed up. She can't remember what exactly happened to her older sibling, but whatever it was took place along a short cut in the wildwood and possibly involved a group of boys. How old is Audrina #2? When is her birthday? Why can't she go to school like the first Audrina or for that matter her first-cousin Vera who very well may be her sister? Come, imbibe some high-octane tea, play the piano, and speak the truth with Audrina #2, cousin/sister Vera, Lucky (mother to Aurina #1 and #2), Aunt Ellie (Lucky's older sister), and ghostly family freind Mercy Marie (who while as a missionary may have married an African Chieftan or may have been eaten by cannibals; no one knows for sure). Met Arden, son of former Olympian figure skater Billie, boyfriend to Audrina #2, who possibly may have been present in the wildwood when something terrible happened (under the rainbow tree) to Audrina #1. Why won't Billie invite Audrina #2 into her and Arden's cottage? Does Billie think Audrina's not good enough for indoors, or does Billie have a secret she is reluctant to share with Audrina? And how many years must Audrina #2 wait before her father (and Audrina #1's father)brings home baby sister Sylvia from the hospital/home? Is Sylvia really damaged goods as cousin/sister Vera claims she is? Will Audrina #2 allow herself to be held at Whitefern forever to care for Sylvia? Will Sylvia ever speak? Can she be potty trained? Will she ever walk normal and be able to care for herself? Can Audrina somehow manage to slip her father's (mother's, and Sylvia's) bonds and start a family of her own with Arlen or will Vera steal Arlen away from her by performing certain wifely duties that Audrey #2 is incapable of performing? And who is pushing people down the stairs to their death and how long will they continued to get away with it before the police catch on? Will Audrina really leave Sylvia with her father, and leave Arden behind too, and never return to Whitefern ever again?

Audrina believed she had a namesake named Audrina. But then she remembered the most horrible moment of her life. She actually had her ninth birthday and some mean boys assaulted her. It was the ugliest thing Vera did to set Audrina to be attacked. I believe the worst part about it was nobody should have to be afraid to go to school. Everybody has a right to learn what he or she wants and needs to know."},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"My Sweet Audrina was a great book.I am so mad, all the secrets came out at the end because you can't understand why she never knows her birthday. I haaaaaate Vera!!! She was such a mess. Poor Audrina had to be better than her first sister, &quot;the angel.&quot; Audrina was the only one out of the family who wasn't selfish or jealous. She couldn't leave, they had her trapped. She couln't leave Sylvia her aunt would make her more damaged. There was so many untrue things told to Audrina. So many deaths. I am so mad at her dad for making her go to the rocking chair inside the room that should be her room.---I have read My Sweet Audrina--- All my friends who would make excuses for reading, I hooked them on V.C. andrews and they read them.

I'll make this short and sweet. Unlike the shitty &quot;ghost writer&quot;, the plot isn't redundant and unoriginal, it's definitely more twisted, mysterious and V.C Andrews herself, explaining all the rest. I thought the book had great moments as well as some boring ones. Vera was a good character but an annoying bitch. Audrina, was a believable character and I liked her a lot. The men were alll pathetic.

I read this book after finishing the complete dollanger collection. When I had previously read Garden of Shadows, I remember feeling as if the book had in no way been written by VC Andrews because of the wording and technique. Then when I started reading this book, the same feeling came over me again. I guessed the ending not too far into the book which is not usually the case when reading these books. I have to be honest. I found it boring and couldn't wait to finish it! Even my two teens who had both swiped the Flowers in the Attic series from me with delight, turned their backs on this book after a couple of chapters. I hope the rumor about a 'ghost writer' is not true. Read it yourself and see what you think!"},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"I read the reviews on this website thinking this book would live up to all the other series that I've loved since a child. But now I see why this book has no companions... because it's by no means in league with the rest. There are only 2 basic plot twists and they're predictable from the very beginning and are hardly as twisted or interesting as most in Andrews' books. It seems like the only reason people on this list are attached to it is because it was the first they read, but it pales in comparison to the Dollanganger or even the Casteel series. So if you don't want to be sitting up all night waiting for something intriguing to happen that never does, buy one of Andrews' others instead."},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"This book is hilariously bad!

I mean, come on, it is SO sending the wrong message to people who may be trapped in an abusive relationship."},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"by LillyWhen I read Twlight, I was almost sure that Stephanie Meyers couldn't have created such an amazingly disappointing and boring book all by herself. And, as it turns out, I proved myself right. Ms. Meyers borrowed a page from V.C. Andrew's My Sweet Audrina, a melodramatic family saga starring the beautiful-and-jaded Audrina Adare.Audrina is sweet, loving, and terrified of the First and Best Audrina, the deceased older sibling for whom the second Audrina is named. However, everyone around Audrina knows the truth about the First and Best Audrina, for which they've done everything possible to keep the Second Audrina from knowing. Through both romantic and emotional tribulations, Audrina is faced with her apprehension of the First and Best Audrina, and her fear of what she herself is capable of.Although the concept of the story is very nice, the story itself is rather drab. There isn't really anything special about it that makes you want to hop right in and read it. It's the same four or five scenarios repeated again and again, interspersed with tragic deaths and forbidden marriages. You begin to get the feeling around page three that Audrina isn't really as scared of her sister as she says she is. In fact, to me it just seems like she suffers from OCD.Communication between the characters is practically non-existent, as evidenced by the fact that Audrina makes it through nearly the entire book before realizing what everyone else has known all along. It takes until the last page to finally see Audrina get some closure, and after she gets it she decides that she'll give up and stay at home for her whole life! Which is fitting--what better way to end a story like My Sweet Audrina than to see your only chance of a good ending fly out the window?In the end, I didn't really like this book. I respect Ms. Andrews for putting in the time and energy to write this book, for there most surely is someone out there who enjoyed it. However, that person wasn't me."},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"I can't believe how some of the other reviews portrayed this book as good!

Andrews that I'm afraid to read any more of her's. I didn't like that fact that Audrina's dad had to compare her to the 1stAudrina and also put her in a rocking chair to try and be like Audrina the 1st.

While reading it, I became Audrina, seeing the world as she saw it, feeling what she felt. The descriptions are crystal-clear.The book tells the story of a young girl, Audrina, and the woman she grows to become. She struggles with a number of problems at home, all stemming back to a time before she was born. From her issues with her mean and conniving cousin, Vera, to the seeming indifference and sniping nature of her mother and Aunt Ellie, and problems with her memory and sense of time, everything goes back that time before she even existed. It is not until the end of the book that everything comes together in a crazy twist.Not wanting to include any spoilers, I won't say anything else about the plot, but I will say that this is a must-read, in my opinion. It is in my top five favorite books of all time, and I read a lot of books - at least a hundred a year!"},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"At first I was a bit confused about the 2 Audrina's, then as I delved into the book further I understood more and more. I don't want to give the ending away but it is defiiitely worth the read. Very dramatic and rather sad, but very compelling. V.C, Andrews does a great job with this one as well as all the others I have read. I am beginning to feel like somewhat of an addict; good reading. Rita Seavey"},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"A confused girl in a strange world, Audrina Adare knows there's a huge secret in her past, and if only she could figure out what it is then she could begin to understand herself. She doesn't attend school, though her cousin-sister does. There are lapses in her memory, her sense of time is impaired. None of the clocks in her house chime the correct hour, nor are there calendars or birthday celebrations. Never, ever is she allowed to venture into the woods, where her older sister is said to have met her end.Always Audrina has been made to feel as if she doesn't measure up to her dead sister, the first, best Audrina. Her father forces her to sit in a special rocking chair, in hopes she'll catch the first Audrina's \\"gift\\". All she catches are traumatic, scary visions of a sexual assault. This is far from a normal life, in more ways than the ones I've mentioned, and that's what really made this such a memorable book. The bizarre world it describes does take on more outward conformity as the story proceeds, but that first impression haunts the whole of the tale, much as it still haunts Audrina as she grows into a young woman.If you've read other V.C. Andrews books and enjoyed them, it's pretty safe to say that this one won't be a disappointment. In fact, I'd call it one of the best. Over-the-top, yes; plausible, no-- and that's just what makes it my cup of tea.

Audrina's character is developed in a very confusing way, so it's a little frustrating when you try to make sense of the book, yet it kept me hooked until the very end. I like how the book takes place in a gothic setting where time seemingly has stopped. It has a great plot and keeps you wondering up until the end of the book. I took off one star because I didn't really like Arden towards the end of the book. He developed into a weak, incompetent guy who was nowhere near good enough for Audrina. And I absolutely HATED the ending of this book!! It was a major disappointment for me. It left me feeling INCREDIBLY sorry for Audrina.

Although I could pretty much guess what the ending was the whole time I loved it. I especially liked how Audrina could become a mother to Slyvia instantly when she could have resented her. I am glad that there was no sequel to the story though because My Sweet Audrina is a one book series. It would have ruined the whole thing I think if they would have continued on with it. All the questions were answered by the end of the book that had the reader questioning from the beginning. The only thing I was confused about was Audrina's true age.I do reccommend this to anyone who is a V.C. Andrews fan."},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"I happen to love VC Andrews books and think that she was a very special and unique writer that could spin a marvelous tale and keep the reader enthralled like no other.This story is particularly gothic, dark and satisfying. Even after you have read through it once and understand what is going on it is still exciting to reread it because you are looking at it from a different angle.So what did VC Andrews have before? She could make modern times into something from a fairy tale until you weren't sure which century the book took place in. A gingerbread victorian house lit only with gaslamps. (Because they were more flattering to Lucietta Adare's complection.) A house surrounded by woods. A strange and intriguing family. A dead older sister, an illegimate half sister, two feuding sisters, a charming and charismatic father, and a young girl that tiptoes through the house avoiding the colors cast on the floor from the stained glass windows, with smeary memories and no sense of time. Oh yeah, and a ghost that came every Tuesday for teatime.This book is amazing and fascinating. VC Andrews takes people that are unordinary from the beginning, with strange medical disorders and secrets and puts them all together and let's the drama play itself out. It was her way of saying that maybe life itself is seldom ordinary.No one in that story was normal. I have also noticed that that is a pattern she has. Blue blooded bones, a no legged woman, a weak hearted woman, a child who can't remember, an autistic child. Bart, in the Dollanganger series had a disorder where his nerves did not reach all the way to his skin and he couldn't feel any kind of pain. Physical and physiological disorders. Claustrophobia, insanity. In all the books that she originally wrote, no two characters were the same. They all had their own motivations, even if they turned out to be &quot;bad seeds&quot;.Everything that she wrote showed an incredible amount of imagination. She could look at the ordinary and turn it into something different. I think she was very gifted. I have to say that this book is amazing, and so was Heaven and Flowers.VC Andrews also has a remarkable knack for portraying abject poverty. Heaven's reactions to movies, MCdonalds, eating out in a restaurant, you could almost understand it completely, and it was as strange to you as it was to her when you were reading it. She was excellent at showing you exactly how little Heaven had, and how close wealth and poverty can exist beside each other, even though they are like two different worlds.Anyway, this book is amazing, and so was VC Andrews."},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"This is, by far, the best book by V.C. Andrews! It isn't part of a series, so you don't get tired of the characters, confused, or miss parts of the set. Andrews uses dark imagery and brings up old family secrets to make the book interesting. Never a dull moment in this book! Read it!"},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"This has to be one of the most creative, eerily, hauntingly beautiful stories I have ever read. Every character is multi-layered, with the multi-hued haired Audrina, who is simply part of the crazy world called Whitefern (which sounds like a decaying plantation without the slaves) that enshrouds her. Definitely gothic horror at it's finest.I wish not to give anything away, this book is such an artistic (if not intellectual) treat, but the only problem I had with the book was Arden, a lonely little boy who grew up to be a selfish, sex-crazed man, who couldn't understand (when he should more than anyone) why Audrina couldn't \\"bear to be handled\\" (to use the words of Tippi Hedren as \\"Marnie\\"). Because Arden's stupid male ego was bruised, he turned to Vera, Audrina's nemesis, who tries to kill the girl he loves.So, while Audrina is, let's say, \\"out of commission\\" (you can use your imagination), Arden is screwing Vera, who I could have felt sorry for if she hadn't been so wicked, and then when Audrina's eyes are opened, so to speak, he insists it is her he truly loves, and Audrina says if they fail the second time, they can try again a third, a fourth...But, this was such a fascinating saga, this is forgivable. I think Audrina could have done so much better than Arden, and as for her father, I cannot hate him or condemn what he did, for he was only trying to protect his daughter.This book inspired me so much, I wrote a little sequel to it just for fun with Lamar Rensdale being alive after all (you'll have to read the book) and he and Audrina getting together. But then, the real story has already been told, like I think Margaret Mitchell's was.It's unfortunate Ms. Andrews hadn't starting her writing career sooner, but then, perhaps her wisdom (which comes with age and life experiences) is partly what made her great, and I am grateful for the few, powerful novels/legacies she left behind."},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"I can't seem to say enough about this book. From the time I read it at age 15 until the present, I still rave about it! This was her best book ever! Gripping, scary, and very worth the time and money, she was super! It was started and finished all in one book, which was nice for those of us who HATE waiting for the next book to come. This one and the Dollganger series were my faves!! V.C. Andrews died in 1987 after Heaven was finished. Since that time, all of her material is poor. Whoever thought that they could fill her shoes was sadly mistaken. The books of today are simple, so much so that my ten year old cousin can read them. I'm disappointed with everything after Heaven. It's hard for someone 27 years old to read such juvenile books. My advice: Quit while you are ahead. Read My Sweet Audrina!!! It's the best!!!!"},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"My Sweet Audrina is just as demented as I remember it being. Now in a VC Andrews book, that's not a bad thing. There are varying degrees of Andrews dementedness, and this book is pretty low on the scale, all things considered, especially since there's none of the incest Andrews is so famous for. It's kind of the literary version of a soap opera. Poor Audrina is so screwed up in the head. She doesn't know what day it is, how old she is, or why her parents will never love her as much as they did her older sister, also an Audrina. The first Audrina, who died nine years before the second Audrina was born, is better than the second at everything, and Audrina #1's shadow covers the whole house in darkness.In terms of a cast of characters living in the Whitefern house, we have: Audrina #2; her dad Damian who forces her to rock in a chair and try to \\"catch\\" her dead sister's gifts; her aunt Ellsbeth (Ellie) who an unwed mother and basically the maid in residence; her mom Lucietta (Lucky) who gave up her career as a musician to be with Damian and holds tea parties with Ellsbeth and a dead relative, whom they take turns speaking for; and finally Vera, her spiteful evil cousin who breaks bones constantly, lies, teases, and causes trouble everywhere she goes.Audrina suffers from \\"swiss cheese memory\\" and struggles to discover why she cannot remember her past, while dealing with members of her family, and later, people in the outside world. There is no one she can trust, and nothing seems to make sense. What I like best about My Sweet Audrina is that it is a standalone book. All of Andrews' other books are in a five book series format, and this is the only solo book. It's trashy, it's juicy, it's a mighty fun read!"},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"This book tells the tale of a very unusual young girl who begs for her fathers' love.He father,however,gave more love to her dead sister that her.This book reveals so much that it is difficult to put in words.All I can say is that it is a tale of love,fantasy,lust,desire,romance,drama,suspense and the techniques that the writer uses is brilliant it would definitely blow you away.It clearly shows how she grows up and what she faces while doing so...enjoy...Nigel"},{"Title":"My Sweet Audrina (Center Point Premier Fiction (Large Print))","review":"My Sweet Audrina by V.C.

Charlie is in charge of little sister Lola and decides to play a trick on her. With Charlie giving silly names to foods that Lola claims she doesn't like, Lola plays along and tastes foods she has insisted she will never, ever eat. My 6-1/2 year old loves this book; it's a bit too old for my almost 3-year old.What I like best about this book are the real photographs of the foods (peas, carrots, fish sticks, etc.) that are incorporated into the fun cartoon illustrations.This is a engaging, slightly offbeat story which makes it stand out from the zillions of other children's books out there."},{"Title":"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato (Charlie and Lola)","review":"Lola is a VERY picky eater. Carrots are for rabbits. Peas are too small and too green. She won't touch potatoes or mushrooms, spaghetti, eggs or sausage...the list goes on and on. And, she absolutely will never not ever eat a tomato. Her big sister Charlie has got to give her dinner and decides &quot;to play a good trick on her.&quot; Carrots become orange twiglets from Jupiter and Lola is so intrigued that she just has to try one. Peas turn into green drops from Greenland, mashed potatoes, cloud fluff from Mt Fuji. And though Lola would never touch a fish stick, she's willing to eat an ocean nibble since mermaids eat them all the time. Pretty soon, dinner is over and Lola has eaten everything, even a nice round red moonsquirter. You know, they're her favorite. Lauren Child has written a funny, witty, imaginative story, told in hip kid-speak, all picky eaters will identify with.

Very imaginative and well done."},{"Title":"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato (Charlie and Lola)","review":"It has great pictures, and the book is about a little girl named Lola who is a very fussy eater. Lola learns about fruits and vegetables. Her sister Charlie tells her that they are different things and from different places. Lola tries everything and ends up liking them all. I would suggest this book for kids under the age of 7."},{"Title":"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato (Charlie and Lola)","review":"\\"I have this little sister, Lola. She is small and very funny\\" These opening lines set the sweet and gentle tone for a tale about two sisters. One (Lola) with a very long list of foods she will not eat, and the other (Charlie) with the task of feeding dinner to her fussy little sister.It could be a recipe for disaster -- I'm certain this situation would have played out quite differently with me and MY little sister -- but Charlie's creativity and sense of fun save the day.My seven-year old fussy eater nearly fell out of his chair laughing when we read this book. He clearly identified with, and enjoyed, Lola and her reasoning (for example, peas are \\"too small\\" and \\"too green\\"). While I'm pretty sure my son will not change his eating habits because of this story, it did give him a sense that he is not alone in the world with his funky tastes while reinforcing the idea that his tastes may change.Great story, cute illustrations, good lesson."},{"Title":"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato (Charlie and Lola)","review":"Thanks to the mealtime antics of Charlie and Lola, my kids now ask every day if they can eat carrots, tomatoes, potatoes and peas. It's magic!The books' pictures, typesetting and storyline are all fantastic, whether you are a child or adult. This and 'My Uncle is a Hunkle', also by Lauren Child, became instant favourites with the pre-schoolers and the adults the minute they entered our house."},{"Title":"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato (Charlie and Lola)","review":"Many young children don't like tomatoes. Some retain that distaste into adulthood. This story shows that stated fussiness about food can simply be a way of getting attention. Parents: Pay attention to this story! The colorful collages of photographs and childlike drawings bring excitement and freshness to the story.Lola is a &quot;small and very fussy&quot; eater. Charlie is assigned by their parents to feed Lola.Lola begins to expound her theories:&quot;carrots are for rabbits&quot;&quot;peas are too small and too green&quot;Lola goes on to list peas, carrots, potatoes, mushrooms, spaghetti, eggs, sausages, cauliflower, cabbage, baked beans, bananas, and oranges as banned items. She also notes her reservations about apples, rice, cheese, and fish sticks. &quot;And I absolutely will never not ever eat a tomato.&quot; Sounds like peanut butter and jelly are coming up to me.Then Charlie attacks directly by putting out some carrots. Lola looks at them and says, &quot;Then why are those carrots there, Charlie?&quot;&quot;Those are orange twiglets from Jupiter,&quot; says Charlie.&quot;Mmm, not bad,&quot; Lola replied, &quot;and took another bite.&quot;Charlie puts out peas and describes them as &quot;green drops from Greenland&quot; and Lola finds them &quot;quite tasty.&quot;Mashed potatoes become &quot;cloud fluff from the pointiest peak of Mount Fuji,&quot; and Lola decides &quot;I love to eat clouds.&quot;Fish sticks become &quot;ocean nibbles from the supermarket under the sea -- mermaids eat them all the time.&quot; Lola wants to know if she can have more.Suddenly Lola turns the tables, &quot;Charlie, will you pass me one of those?&quot; Lola continued, &quot;Yes, of course, moonsquirters are my favorite.&quot; &quot;You didn't think they were tomatoes, did you, Charlie?&quot;Obviously, Lola knows that they are playing a game, and she likes it. The new game seems like more fun than laying down the law about what she will and won't eat. The game puts her in charge by letting her name the foods, as well as her usual game of saying what she will not eat. Charlie makes room for Lola to assert herself, and all is well.With children, there is a tendency to treat them like subjects of a King or a Queen. Actually, they feel quite grown up at a young age and want to have some autonomy. Choice of foods can simply be a testing of limits. But all children would rather have fun, and can easily be distracted by making the potential confrontation into a game, instead. This book eloquently makes that point, and ensures many more peaceful hours in many households.After you finish reading the story, you should think about where else you can kid your child out of her or his bad mood. Come to think of it, when will that approach work with adults as well?Look for the potential to improve every communication!"},{"Title":"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato (Charlie and Lola)","review":"We purchased this book for our 3 year old after enjoying \\"I am not tired and will not go to bed.\\" We have enjoyed reading this book as much and it has an added perk....our very \\"fussy eater\\" now eats cloud fluff and green drops.

I hope all you people that are looking at this page buy it!"},{"Title":"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato (Charlie and Lola)","review":"I have no affiliation with the author or publisher. Just picked it up in a bookshop.The prose lilts along as perfectly as Judith Kerr's \\"The Tiger Who Came to Tea\\". Its (nearly) as funny for adults. My boys (ages 3 and 5) have requested it daily since it arrived in our house last week.I'm not quite sure if it has the desired effect: the boys now swear they will never eat a tomato. But there's been a lot of smiling at bedtime."},{"Title":"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato (Charlie and Lola)","review":"My four year old loves it. He's even reading it to himself. But I still can't get him to eat his veggies. I got the book because I knew tomatoes were my son's least favorite food. It is incrediably creative and funny though in traditional Charlie and Lola fashion."},{"Title":"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato (Charlie and Lola)","review":"This story is my grandson's favorite of Charlie and Lolas. I was very impressed with the intricate pop ups on each page----very nice!!"},{"Title":"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato (Charlie and Lola)","review":"Charlie has to look after his little sister and give her dinner. Unfortunately, Lola is a very picky eater, and we have to sit through the entire list of things she won't eat. ESPECIALLY not tomatoes.So he decides to \\"play a good trick on her\\" and tell her that all these foods she \\"won't eat\\" are really *different* and exotic foods that she's sure to love. (Are you sure you don't want these green drops? I'll eat them, then, they're very rare!)Predictably (to us grown-ups), she gobbles all these foods up, and then turns the table on her brother by asking for the tomatoes (These? Are you sure you want THESE?) declaring that they're \\"moonsquirters\\" and saying \\"You didn't think they were tomatoes, did you Charlie?\\"What's interesting is that this technique is actually recommended for both child and adult picky eaters. Oh, not the trickery, but the use of pleasant sounding names to make foods sound appealing. (And really, Lola wasn't tricked at all, was she?)"},{"Title":"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato (Charlie and Lola)","review":"Cute illustrations and clever text.

The sparse text and colorful pictures made reading less intimidating for her, and for a paperback, the book is very sturdy and well put-together. Great book - I definitely recommend!"},{"Title":"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato (Charlie and Lola)","review":"This is my favorite from the Charlie and Lola collection and our Kindergartener loves it too. Charlie could teach a parenting class based on this book! It's written very well and the characters continue to entertain (and teach) or Son."},{"Title":"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato (Charlie and Lola)","review":"We were first introduce to this story via the Playhouse Disney webpage. My son was ever so fascinated by the interactive storybook at the website that we ended up buying this book. Although the book is slightly different, it still is true to the idea that it's silly to not try foods you think you may not like. My son, age 25 months, LOVES to eat peas, carrots, fish sticks and cherry tomatos (a.k.a. green drops from greenland, orange twiglets from jupiter, ocean nibbles from under the sea, and moon squirters)! In fact he can't get enough of these healthy items! It has also made him more open to trying various foods. Perhaps it's just his age... but, having Charlie and Lola around sure helped! Worth a try with any fussy eater... or child who has a great imagination and sense of humor."},{"Title":"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato (Charlie and Lola)","review":"My 3-year-old loves the Charlie and Lola books - this one and the I am Too Sleepy one are her favorites.

We have two of the theme pop-up books and they're a part of our bedtime library."},{"Title":"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato (Charlie and Lola)","review":"I fell in love with Lauren Child's Clarice Bean books and was delighted when she came out with books for younger children. I don't know if this book is the first of her Charlie and Lola Series, but it was the first I read. I was thrilled, years later, to see Charlie and Lola as a TV series for children (produced in Great Britain). When one of my grandaughters indicated that she didn't like tomatoes, I immediately remembered this book and decided to get it for her. My hope is not that it will make her love tomatoes, but that she will see some humor in her situation."},{"Title":"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato (Charlie and Lola)","review":"Carrots carrots do you like carrots? Lola hates carrots so much. I Will Never, Not Ever Eat A Tomato is written by Lauren child. This is fiction because it doesn't have real characters. Lola, Charile, Mom, Dad are the characters in the book. Lola's house is the setting of the book.My favorite part is when Lola doesn't like vegetables. Lola doesn't like carrots, peas, potato and tomatos. My other favorite part is when Lola likes mermaids. Charlie tricks Lola to eat mermaid food. Mermaid food is fish sticks. At the beginning, of the story she didn't like fish sticks.The positive thing is the characters are funny because they say funny stuff like Lola is a fussy eater. The negative thing is when Charlie tricks Lola to eat peas. He says peas are from Greenland. I recommend this book with 5 stars because I like the characters."},{"Title":"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato (Charlie and Lola)","review":"This is Charlie and Lola at their finest - a book that will make your children WANT to eat their vegetables. It is very funny and a fantastically done pop-up. We have our own copy and buy more for gifts."},{"Title":"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato (Charlie and Lola)","review":"Wow, my children love Charlie and Lola, and it doesn't get much better than this pop-up book for them. They love the character & their british accents & I try to (sort-of) mimic them with I read the book. Add to that Lola's quirky personality as she lists off all the foods she will not eat, and then throw in pop-up, 3-d creations of Charlie's imaginative re-creation of mundane table food and they beg for this book alllllll the time."},{"Title":"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato (Charlie and Lola)","review":"I love this book. Charlie gets his little sister Lola to eat foods she won't normally eat by renaming them - peas are 'green drops from iceland', mashed potatos are 'cloud fluff', fish sticks are 'ocean nibbles' that mermaids eat, etc. My kids (ages 3-5) love this book, and it has gotten them to try new foods - they try and think up names themselves, and this amuses them enough to at least get past the initial aversion..."},{"Title":"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato (Charlie and Lola)","review":"My three year old loves the entire Charlie and Lola series and this book is no different. The pop-pages are beautiful and intricate and the story is delightful and sweet. As an added bonus, I have taken Charlie's example when trying to get my daughter to eat her veggies and it really works! The only issue is that the pop-ups are so intricate that it is difficult for my daughter to maneuver them herself- it is definitely a read-together book, otherwise you run the risk of the pages getting torn."},{"Title":"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato (Charlie and Lola)","review":"This book is one of the most amazing pop up books I have ever purchased for my four year old. It's very interactive and creative and just an all around must if your child is into Charlie and Lola!"},{"Title":"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato (Charlie and Lola)","review":"I bought this for my granddaughter when she was about two. She starts kindergarten this year and it is still a favorite. Kids love it and if you are the designated-reader-of-stories you will too! Lola gives you an excuse to emote to your hearts content. I will keep this book forever (and buy a new one if it falls apart!)."},{"Title":"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato (Charlie and Lola)","review":"Get the non-pop up, the story is really wonderful and funny - not a boring read for mom and dad. I'm very disappointed, though; I love this book and we used to get it all the time from the library (non-pop up). We could only find the pop up hardcover online and it doesn't work well at all. The flow is hard to follow, too, and I'm always missing part of the story as I read, and having to go back."},{"Title":"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato (Charlie and Lola)","review":"\\"I have this little sister, Lola. She is small and very funny.\\"Charlie and Lola are two siblings who live in a flat in London with their Mum and Dad. Charlie is the older of the two, he is responsible and quite a clever chap. Lola is the younger sibling, she is small, funny and proves to be quite amusing. In this particular story Charlie uses his creativity/ingeuinity to get \\"picky eater\\" Lola to eat her dinner. The story is fun for both grown ups and children. Lauren Child is both the author and illustrator of this series. She combines mixed media for the illustrations, which are just fantastic! There are three books in the series \\" I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato, I Am Too Absolutely Small For School and I Am Not Sleepy and I Will Not Go To Bed\\". Charlie and Lola are also the stars of their own television show on Playhouse Disney weekdays. Charlie and Lola are the best British import since Harry Potter!"},{"Title":"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato (Charlie and Lola)","review":"I recently started watching a really great cartoon on the disney channel called 'Charile and Lola'.

Topping that list are tomatoes, which she \\"absolutely will never not ever eat.\\" But big brother Charlie hits on an ingenious plan to get Lola to eat the things on her \\"veto\\" list. The carrots, he says, are not carrots but \\"orange twiglets from Jupiter.\\" Intrigued, Lola tries them and likes them. Charlie turns peas, mashed potato, and fish sticks into similarly imaginative things, with the same result. Child uses mixed media to illustrate the humorous interaction between the siblings-a successful combination of photographs and hand drawings. Different fonts indicate emphasis and highlight the despised food items. Wavy and colored lines of text provide variety and added interest. The language is suitable for reading aloud to preschoolers. Child presents an amusing take on picky eaters, and the ending shows that Lola might not have been completely ignorant of Charlie's ploy."},{"Title":"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato (Charlie and Lola)","review":"My kids and I love this one. It's funny, imaginative and well-drawn and pokes fun at one of my daughter's hangups (she is a very picky eater). The story it tells is funny and I think it really captures the imagination of young children. A young boy tells us about his picky sister and how one night, he gets her to eat all the foods she hates by telling her they are magical foods (as an example, mashed potatoes are snow clouds from Mt. Fuji). All his ideas are really funny. As a narrator, I can really get into telling this story and it has my kids in hysterics. It also enables my picky eater to see how silly it is to be a picky eater. Maybe it's just that she is growing up (almost 5), but I do think that this book is helping her be less picky. We imitate what the boy in the story did by making up exotic names and sources for food she thinks she doesn't like, and it works! I recommend this book highly. It's yummy. You will have a good time reading it and your kids will enjoy hearing it and looking at the terrific illustrations."},{"Title":"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato (Charlie and Lola)","review":"My daughter received this book (paperback; no pop-up) as a gift for her fifth birthday and we love it! I immediately ordered three in the pop-up version for gifts for friends. We received the books and the pop-ups did not work. Their placement in the book also made the story sound choppy. We sent them back! Great book. Just don't purchase the pop-up version."},{"Title":"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato (Charlie and Lola)","review":"This book is really neat for a kid's pop-up book. For example, on the page where Lola will not eat peas, the bowl of peas folds down to reveal the \\"Green drops from Greenland\\" scene. Rather than being a traditional pop-up book, the creators of this book have come up with different ways to make each part of the story its own.We will have to protect this book from little hands, but it will be a great story to read together."},{"Title":"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato (Charlie and Lola)","review":"My \\"almost\\" 5 year old loves when I read her this book, especially with a (granted fake) British accent.

This is a great book! Charlie is such a lovely big brother and reminds me so much of several of the children I cared for when I lived in England.

There's no need for Supernanny with these two, they are sweet, respectful, charming, imaginative and delightful.My 19 month old daughter doesn't watch the television version, but is always asking me to read this book and several of the other C&L; books to her.

If you are familiar with the tv show, each episode is based on a book by Lauren Child and addresses some issue with Charlie's little sister Lola and how Charlie deals with having a little sister who can be quite a handful. Lola is funny and Charlie is sweet. This book is about Lola's being a \\"fussy eater\\" and how Charlie gets her to eat foods she says she doesn't like. The illustrations are an unusual mix of the author's illustrations and patterns from fabrics. Some of the wording may be new due to the fact that they are written by a British author, but all in all, we LOVE these books.

Lauren Child, who writes and illustrates the enormously wonderful Clarice Bean series, also writes this series about Charlie and her little sister LolaThey are appealing characters both in their illustration (large eyed, slightly cross-eyed as well, and warmly done) but they are funny and approachable in their relationship and language.Lots of nice words illustrated and constantly repeated for new readers to relate to - even my 18 month old tries to read along with the pictures helping now.The story is basic, Charlie has been left to try to feed her little sister Lola, but Lola is a very fussy eater, she does not like Carrots, cauliflower, mushrooms, sausages,,,,etc etc, and she will not EVER NEVER EAT and tomato.

But at the end you will find out what Charlie does."},{"Title":"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato (Charlie and Lola)","review":"When Charlie's little sister Lola refuses to eat, he invents imaginative scenarios to persuade her to eat foods she'd rather not. Carrots become orange twigs from Jupiter and mashed potatoes become cloud fluff from the pointiest peak of Mount Fuji in this precocious romp through dinner time with a finicky eater. The text builds on a patterned list of foods that Lola won't eat until Charlie counteracts each item and Lola herself gets into the act. Child's vivid collage illustrations layer colored pencil people over wallpaper, tile, wood, textiles, photographs, and simple sketches to create scenes as silly and precocious as the characters themselves. Excellent for use in food-based story times or classroom activities. A delight for picky eaters of all ages!

I have used this book in a program to encouage 4 and 5 year olds to be &#34;Fit Foodies&#34; with great success."},{"Title":"I Will Never Not Ever Eat a Tomato (Charlie and Lola)","review":"The pop-ups in this book are cute and creative. While the writing is kid-friendly and entertaining, it is makes a big deal about what children don't like and encourages them to refuse food on general principles. Normally, children push themselves along to learn to like the food their parents eat. Since a friend's son, who is a good eater, saw this video, he announces, \\"I will never not ever eat a tomato!\\" Reading this book, children learn that 1) their refusal to eat vegetables is a big deal and 2) to get around their refusal, people they respect will lie to them. Why does Lola list vegetable she won't eat? To get others to BACK OFF, that's why. Undoubtedly, someone is all worried about her vegetable refusal and trying to GET her to eat them. In the story, it is Charlie--probably shown by his parents that part of feeding Lola is getting her to eat vegetables. How does Charlie do it? By lying to her. Carrots are orange twiglets from Jupiter, peas are green drops from Greenland. I could go on. So naturally, Lola eats--and likes. In your dreams! How dumb do we think she is? Like any other self-respecting child, she will see through this subterfuge in a flash! And become even more insistent about refusing to eat vegetables. Leave the kid alone! Lola will learn to eat her vegetables as long as her parents eat and enjoy them and stop making an issue about it!

Written by George Selden (famous for penning The Cricket in Times Square), the author knew how to mix the exuberance of youth with the anything-goes quality of Gotham to create a most clever tale (with a happy ending). A great read for smart kids with broad interests poised for adulthood."},{"Title":"The Genie Of Sutton Place","review":"\\"The Genie of Sutton Place\\"by George Selden----------------------------------------This is a lesser-known novel by George Selden, who wrote the beloved classic, \\"A Cricket In Times Square\\" (and its many sequels...) In this book, a young tweenage boy named Tim discovers the ancient secret to bring a genie to life, but finds that even having supernatural magic on your side doesn't necessarily solve all of life's troubles. This is a lovely, low-key story, which is best appreciated as a character study of the precocious boy as he narrates his tale -- the book was written in the early 1970s and provides a charming glimpse at the lighter, more innocent side of hippie-era nonconformism, as seen through the filter of New York society, circa 1973. The cast of kooky characters includes a fake (but optimistic) fortune-teller, an aspiring opera singer who works as a live-in maid, Tim's uptight rich aunt and her waspish attorney, and Tim's dog Sam, who is magically and enchantingly transformed into a human, in order to get him out of the dog pound. As with all Selden's books, the writing is delightfully well-crafted and the characters are subtle and surprisingly multi-faceted. Definitely recommended -- a forgotten gem from decades past.

Re-read? I found this gem at my local used book shop The Paperback Rack in Tallahassee. I'd recently read \\"The Cricket in Times Square\\" also by George Selden and was intrigued by the original cover art and the brief description on the back. I brought it home and started reading and began having a sensation of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu. I'm thinking I read this in elementary school. The fact that I had a prescient sense about where the story was going only added to the magic and wonder of the story. Selden obviously loved New York City - it comes through on every page in every paragraph. Tim was a fine character - wise beyond his years because the majority of his time was spent with adults who treated him as an equal. His depth of knowledge, range of experience and use of language exceed others of his age. Many will complain that this is a contrivance on the part of Selden, but I was one of those kids and thus it rang true for me. The narrative is fast, funny and enormously entertaining.

And, although some projects seems very complex, the fine and good diagrams, leads you to achieve a great and vivid animal."},{"Title":"African Animals in Origami","review":"For all you John Montroll fans out there, buy this book. For everyone else, buy this book also! It is one of the best books for animals, with a wide variety of difficulty levels. From simple 'grass' to complex striped zebras, this book has it all. I enjoyed making some of the more unique models, like the bee-eater and rhinoceros. Another nice thing about this book in particular is that the models are much different than what are in many other books. Because the theme is Africa, a lot of the animals in this book I have never seen made in another book. (Some however, have been made elsewhere, and quite honestly, better, such as the elephant and gorilla).The Bottom Line:If you like Montroll, animals, or semi-complex models, buy this book. If you are a beginner, there may be better choices, likewise, if you are an expert, there isn't a lot to whet your appetite. For everyone else, a great book for your collection."},{"Title":"African Animals in Origami","review":"This is my most favoured book in Origami. I have done all the models from the zebra, giraffe, elephant. All models are par excelance. Montroll is my best folder. I think folders who like folding animals should try Racoon from Inside our Origami book by Montroll."},{"Title":"African Animals in Origami","review":"This is one of my favorite books by John and I would highly recommend it to any intermediate to advanced folder. Like most of his books, it gives you some fairly simple models to start out on (grass, tree) and then move to some more intermediate ones (various African birds, snake, crocodile, etc.) Getting into the more difficult animals you have things like a hippo, gorilla, chimp, aardvark, etc. Next you will tackle models like the elephant, rhino, gazelle, plain giraffe and lion. Finally when you are ready to tackle the hardest models, you have his \\"multi-colored\\" animals which make full use of both side of traditional origami paper, the striped zebra and the spotted giraffe. You can see John's developing skill as one of the premier origami authors in this book. The diagrams are all wonderfully done and easy to follow for any experienced folder, and the models themselves are all quite detailed, even some of the easier ones are beautifully representative of the real animal. John clearly puts effort into making a number of these models capable of standing up and often having 3 dimensional aspects such as the lion and hippo in this book which have large bulky heads similar to the live counterpart. If you love animals and love origami, this is definitely not a book to miss!"},{"Title":"African Animals in Origami","review":"My son loved this book, he already did all the projects and all are perfect, clear and with easy to follow instructions."},{"Title":"African Animals in Origami","review":"I think that this is one of John Montroll's best books. It is amazing how he thought of making several pockets and spreading the edges to form stripes on a zebra, or using squash and mountain folds to make spots on a giraffe,still having enough paper to make ears and horns. This is a great book particularly for intermediate origamists.If you buy this book, you won't regret it."},{"Title":"The Stone: A Persian Legend of the Magi","review":"In 1271 Marco Polo began his famous journey that eventually led him from the port of Venice to the magnificent court of the Kublai Khan in China. On his journey east Marco Polo visited the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, where he was shown a lamp that had been burning continuously for over 1,200 years; he took some of oil from that lamp as a gift for the Kublai Khan. While passing through the Persian town of Saveh the traveler saw three tombs that the locals said was the final resting place of three men named Balthasar, Melchior, and Jasper. Marco Polo wrote down the story that they told him and Dianne Hofmeyr retells the tale as &quot;The Stone: A Persian Legend of the Magi,&quot; with watercolor illustrations by Jude Daly, the pair having worked together previously on the picture book &quot;Do the Whales Still Sing?&quot;The tale beings with the three astronomers gazing up at the heavens and witnessing a star like no other star, that fills the night sky with its fiery light. Consulting their charts and scrolls they can across the legend of a baby whose birth would be announced by such a star and who would grow up to become a king that brought justice, healing, and peace to the world. The three astronomers set off to find the child and honor him, bearing their gifts of gold, myrrh and holy incense. Most readers, young and old, will be familiar with the story up to this point. But when the three men find the simple shelter on which the star shown they find something other than the baby that they have come to see. More importantly, when they give their gifts, they receive one in return.That simple gift and its significance make up the final part of the story, which nicely compliments what little is said about the Magi in the Gospels. The point of the legend also makes a simple point, which is usually the type that people need to be reminded of from time to time. &quot;The Stone: A Persian Legend of the Magi&quot; should come to the attention of new readers at Christmas time each year as an old way of taking a new look at the ancient story."},{"Title":"The Stone: A Persian Legend of the Magi","review":"This moving story that tugs at our heart strings reminds us of the important values we base our lives on.

D","review":"Surely this is &quot;The Biography&quot; in the same sense that to the Scholastic thinkers, Aristotle was &quot;The Philosopher.&quot;More to the point, it is an endlessly fascinating book, one of those rare works that can be opened at random with consistently rewarding results. Johnson, of course, is one of those rare characters who demonstrates that life is not necessarily less rich than fiction, and Boswell is an entertaining (and amusingly exasperating) chronicler. The &quot;Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides&quot; is also well worth reading and randomly revisiting.However, I'm somewhat alarmed by the comments below about the accuracy of this version. I bought this because it was a decent-looking hardback version--I had actually read a library copy (some long out-of-print edition). Could some reviewer please explain the deviations?

D","review":"I have read alot of biographys until a recently a Cambridge graduate friend recommended the first great biography-Life of Johnson. My British friends have a much better view of literature at large than I do so I listening and purchased this piece. I only appreciated Samuel Johnson for his work with the first English Dictionary which a first edition now retails for over $35000. James Boswell his biographer deplicts his life with such vivid respect and admiration so as to make me better understand what a true friend can be. They obviously had a great relationship for more than 40 years. Samuel Johnson is captured with all his great and abundant humor and deep insight. I love this quote\\" One man may lead a horse to water but twenty may not make him drink\\". All in all it is 1400 pages worth reading because its insight into 18th century life in London is so heart felt. Additionally alot of the their conversations took place at a Pub called the Mitre. It is located on Mitcham high street in Tooting, UK. I lived near by and spent a few nights their with friends. Little did I realize I was in the very pub where so many infamous conversations took place some two hundred years ago. A great read."},{"Title":"Life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"For those interested in a reliable text, I suggest the &quot;World's Classics&quot; paperback edition. The hardcover edition, while attractive, is somewhat suspect."},{"Title":"Life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"James Boswell's Life of Samuel Johnson is often called the greatest biography of all-time and may well be. Perhaps such a work can get no higher praise, but it is also highly notable as the first true modern biography - the first really resembling what we think of as biography today. Boswell set new standards for thoroughness, accuracy, and research, greatly expanding the very concept of what a biography could be. He was also very far ahead of his time in anticipating what was later called gonzo journalism - writers inserting themselves into real-life stories; it is of course not done in the same way as later writers, but the concept is similar. Most remarkable of all, though, is that the book is immensely readable, entertaining, and edifying over two hundred years later, which can be said of very few biographies. It is absolutely essential for anyone even remotely interested in Johnson, Boswell, or the late eighteenth century European intellectual circle.Johnson was perhaps England's best known writer during his last several decades and one of the most famous in the world besides being widely known and renowned for lexicographical and other accomplishments. However, this book's greatness and fame are such that he has long been known primarily via it. Many read it who have read very little or none of him, showing that, unlike nearly all biographies, it has earned a life of its own. There are many reasons for this, not least the fine writing. Even more fundamental is that the book vividly brings an exciting, integral, and profoundly influential era to life. It covers the late Enlightenment when many of the most important people to ever live were prominent. In addition to Johnson, we get first-hand glimpses of such illustrious personages as Adam Smith, Oliver Goldsmith, Pasquale Paoli, David Garrick, and many, many others. Numerous other heavyweights - Voltaire, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, King George III, etc. - are only slightly in the background. We also get contemporaneous accounts of major events like the American Revolution and the lead up to the French Revolution. In short, though ostensibly the biography of one person, the book is as vibrant, lifelike, and memorable an account of a supremely important era as any history book.Yet Johnson is always the focus, shown literally from birth to death. Anyone interested in him will find a wealth of information about all aspects of his life as well as his thoughts, feelings, influences, intellectual background, and far more. There is also a great deal of information about his work. Unlike nearly all biographers, Boswell actually knew Johnson well; he was his friend for many years and spent several months annually in his company, essentially interviewing him and making voluminous notes of his conversation. This last is indeed the book's heart and by far its most famous element. Johnson was perhaps his era's most famous conversationalist, revered for wit and argument; Boswell heard many hours of his conversation and reports faithfully. His style here was again innovative. Rather than sprinkling isolated quotes anecdotally, he went to great pains to reproduce full conversations, not only describing the setting and others present but even using drama-like name headings for full verisimilitude. We thus not only see what Johnson said but where, how, and usually why he said it. Many world famous Johnson sayings that would otherwise be lost - i.e., \\"Patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel\\" - are immortalized here, as well as some quotes by others. This alone would make the book of great value.Much has been made of how Boswell's presence affected this; knowing he would write the biography, or at least thinking it possible, he undoubtedly orchestrated much, drawing Johnson out when he might have otherwise been silent. Much of this would have been done in any case as he clearly admired Johnson and loved his talk, but there is no denying the question's importance. Some have condemned Boswell as a shameless celebrity whore or otherwise questioned his motives and veracity, but nearly everyone will consider this nitpicking, fascinating as the question is. For nearly everyone, it makes the book better - far more personal and engaging than biographies are usually even capable of being. Also, for what it is worth, such things mean the book in many ways tells us nearly as much about Boswell as Johnson, making it a sort of hybrid biography/autobiography.Boswell understandably focuses on the years he knew Johnson, meaning the book is greatly lopsided in favor of the later years after Johnson became famous and nearly all his major work was done. This will annoy those who want a more balanced overview, especially as Boswell makes short shrift of some important early events. Those wanting a more conventional balance should get one of several later biographies, especially as Boswell makes a few errors and, at least according to later sources, leaves out some highly interesting - if not necessarily essential - facts. He openly admits doing so at the start in order to protect Johnson's reputation, though much of what he says elsewhere is unflattering, but some of it may have been unknown to him. For most, though, this is the only Johnson biography that will ever be needed - and its greatness, influence, and importance are such that it is required for all readers with even the slightest interest in English and European literature and history and the art of biography even if they care little or nothing for Johnson or Boswell.As for this edition, it has a wealth of supplemental material, making it ideal for serious readers. An excellent, lengthy introduction gives substantial background on Johnson, Boswell, and the book plus some critical insight. There is also a worthwhile bibliography, a chronology, and a supremely useful index. As with other Everyman hardbacks, the book itself is also very high quality - clothbound with very strong binding and even a built-in bookmark. This is one of the best versions available."},{"Title":"Life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"I enjoyed reading this biography very much, finding Boswell an amazingly adroit reporter and his subject fascinating and wise. Johnson was full of shrewdness and good sense, along with amusing biases and unusual mannerisms, just the sort of person to ask to liven up a dinner. The book is both humorous and moving, written in a lively style, and good for repeated readings through the years."},{"Title":"Life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"I had heard since many years about Johnson, i had visited the museum in London, but only now I found the courage the read 'The Life of.....'. It was worth it.Boswell, to my knowledge, seems to be the first biographer in the modern sense of the word. He tries to give a rounded picture of his subject and also a structured account, structured by time but also structured by focusing on the body, the mind and the sould, usually in that order. What a time to have lived in London, to meet Johnson, Adam Smith, Burke, Gibbon. Johnson emerges as the central sun around which all other planets circle. This also makes for one of the weaknesses of this autobiography, that Johnson crowds out all around him. Yes, a biography should put the subject in the center, but not exclusively so. Boswell also neglects to explain the historical context. Like so many writers on contemporary history he assumes his subjects to be of such universal importance as to make them also common knowldge 300 years after publication. Clearly it is not so, and Boswell could have been helpful by putting more of what he is writing into context rather than leaving it to the footnotes of future editors.Delightful rather than annoying are his fights especially with Ms. Thrale about who might be the superior biographer. In 18th century style he does not shy away in calling the competing biographer names and casting doubt on her motives and moral rectitude.All in all a fascinating document, though for modern readers often tedious and only recommended for 'hardcore' readers."},{"Title":"Life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"James Boswell met Johnson when he (Boswell) was 23 and Johnson was 63. As a result, the emphasis of Boswell's biography is on Johnson's later years, but oh, what a record Boswell has left us. Boswell provoked Johnson to comment on a wide variety of topics, and recorded Johnson's doings with his circle of friends and colleagues. Boswell was a pleasant companion for Johnson, who usually accepted Boswell's constant probes (and even accompanied Boswell on a tour of the Highlands in 1773). Through it all, Boswell took notes, and jotted down everything Johnson said, recording many of Johnson's most famous comments. As a result, Boswell's biography of this great man of letters was a landmark biography, different from all biographies which came before, and still a point of comparison for biographies today. If you can get past Boswell's rather (in my opinion) obsequious tone, you will enjoy the ride very much. This Oxford World's Classics edition, edited by JD Fleeman, has a wonderful set of notes not found in other editions. It is a very affordable and thorough edition."},{"Title":"Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.

D","review":"Boswell's Life of Johnson is an essential read for students of the period. Unfortunately, because of it length it's likely to be read in its entirety after one has retired. Abridgments will serve until then."},{"Title":"Life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"If you feel obliged to wade through the canon once in a while, this won't be a waste of your time, though these days Gibbon's roughly contemporaneous history is a much better read, Boswell's extreme formality being a bit wearing over 1200 pages (in the edition I read).On the other hand, Boswell's telling of Johnson's life is sprightly and certainly not so tedious as the writings of Johnson himself. People who choose to read the Life will not be disappointed.On yet another hand, I can easily understand why the library copy I borrowed, though purchased in 1949, had not yet been read (the uncut pages showing me so): except to specialists, I would not recommend this book in lieu of, say, 1000 or so others.I guess this actually is a useless review: if you have already decided to read this, you shan't have gone wrong; if you're looking for a good read, you're probably not looking here."},{"Title":"Life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"Haven't read it yet. But the processing job on the book itself was faulty...several pages were bent over and thus not trimmed properly."},{"Title":"Life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"Boswell was not the obvious choice to write the best biography about Samuel Johnson, much less one of the greatest biographies in world literature. He had much less contact with Johnson than Mrs. Thrale, for many years a close friend of Johnson who spent much more time with him than did Boswell. In fact, Boswell spent perhaps 400 days with Johnson over a period of many years. He also was not Johnson's literary executor. Finally, Boswell was regarded by many of his day, and afterwards, as something of an 18th Century celebrity hound. He made a point of meeting every famous person he could (Voltaire, Rousseau), and went to great efforts to make himself famous. Nevertheless, in his Life of Johnson, Boswell succeeded in portraying Johnson and his circle so vividly that more than 200 years later they come across as real human beings. He did this by breaking the convention of concentrating only on the most favorable aspects of his subject's life, and instead describing Johnson's eccentricities of dress, behavior, etc. Moreover, Boswell did not neglect to include incidents that make himself appear ridiculous. The book is both extremely funny and moving. If you read this, you will want to immediatley get a copy of Boswell's book on the trip that Johnson and he took to the Hebrides."},{"Title":"Life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"Ah, Ol' Sam, the Great Cham as somebody called him (it's an 18th century misreading of &quot;Khan&quot;, fact fans). My opinion of Johnson the writer fluctuates over the years; sometimes he seems a long-winded authoritarian, at other times his juggernaut sentences seem possessed of a superhuman vitality. Whatever. This isn't Johnson the writer we're concerned with, so much as Johnson the talker - the gruff, ridiculously prejudiced, gloomy, scrofulous clubman, holding forth from the biggest chair in the room, wisecracking, bullying, brooding and sulking.Johnson was as lucky to have Boswell, as Boswell was to have Johnson. The conversations of great men tend not to be much fun; Eckermann's &quot;Conversations with Goethe&quot; is fascinating, all right, but Goethe's mixture of gossipy cattiness and Olympian pomposity gets to you after a while (Donald Barthelme wrote an evil parody of it). With Boswell's Johnson it's different. He seems at once painfully real and a caricature of himself. Boswell captures both the readiness to pontificate about anything under the sun and the panicky vulnerability. Eckermann's Goethe leaves the room when he's upset (nothing must ruffle the patrician facade) but Boswell's Johnson stays in his chair - we can see his reaction.Of course there are drawbacks, in that half of the book covers the last ten or so years of Johnson's life, but there really isn't that much hard evidence about Johnson's early life beyond what Boswell himself collected. I reserve my doubts about Johnson's cultural politics, but the rolling, rumbling figure that Boswell sets down is one of my favourite characters in literature. Swift has a darker and more perplexing fascination for me, but you wouldn't have got the 44-year-old Swift out of bed at 3AM for a ramble. He'd have hurled his bedpan at you.Why is it a great airport book? Because there's a lot of it, it's unfailingly entertaining and informative, and it's guaranteed not to include a description of an air crash."},{"Title":"Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.

It is a great book (also great is W. Jackson Bate's SAMUEL JOHNSON [1st published 1975]which is a MUST for anyone interested in Johnson). But although I love the Everyman's Library, I do not recommend this edition of Boswell. Unlike the usual quality of the Everyman's Library, its Boswell is rife with typographical errors (there's even missing text!). Though it's the only edition of Boswell I've read, I regret that a correct edition is not on my bookshelf.

The book had a nice heft to it, and the print was large enough for a comfortable read. My only major beef with this edition is that Boswell's text is replete with quotations from a variety of languages including Latin, Greek, French, Italian and others, and very few of them are translated into English. Whether the editor assumed that the average modern reader is a polyglot, or was unable to provide the translations for some other reason, I feel deprived at not having had access to this portion of the book's material, particularly as the quotes are most often used to gild the lily of one of Johnson's witticisms. Nevertheless, the book rewards the diligent reader with a wealth of intellectual stimulation, and offers a fascinating look into the England of the period including: polite London society, Oxford University, and jaunts around the British and Scottish countryside. Johnson's somewhat eccentric life and personal habits are lovingly and affectionately relayed by his close friend Boswell, who somehow managed to preserve a vast amount of Johnson's conversation without the aid of a tape recorder. With everyday life as a backdrop, we see how Johnson, a self-described lazy man, managed to produce such an abundant literary legacy, not the least of which was his groundbreaking dictionary. I recommend this book highly to people with an interest in 18th century England, the literary society of the period, or who simply love a great biography."},{"Title":"Life of Samuel Johnson, LL.

D","review":"I'm no expert on 18th-century English literature, or on the famous work I'm being so daring as to review. I did, however, read every line of it, and I can say, I liked it.I started reading this work---oft cited as the greatest biography in the English language, and surely the one where the subject was most un-objectively represented by his fawning chronicler---when I was a sixteen-year-old sophomore in an honors seminar. I finished it literally today, some eleven years and perhaps twenty-two starts and stops later.What remains most strongly in memory, above the man about whom this was penned, is the era itself, which was captured in full dimension here by a scribe whose entire being seemed concentrated upon gulping down those scraps of notice sent his way by the movers and shakers, the \\"A-listers,\\" of his century.As a straightforward biography, this work is oddly paced, anything but impartial, and since it concentrates most of its scope on a relatively brief period in Johnson's life and career, curiously uneven. This is not unusual in biographies, of course, which tend to select moments that most closely define the subject's celebrity, but the pacing in the coverage does stick out at me. It also surprised me to find out that Boswell was around the great Johnson about a year's time, and the rest of his work, in all its ever-excusing hero-worshipping, anecdote-dribbling glory, is the result of his being privy to gossip, to making use of the facts known about Johnson, and by his, frankly, inventing whole sections in a kind of \\"non-fiction-fiction.\\"What forgives all that (if forgiveness is needed) is the thing I mentioned above; namely, no other writer from any era does quite so complete a job of making a person centuries in the future feel THERE for the scenes he's describing. To have wrung as much as he did from Johnson, the greatest \\"talker\\" of his time, shows that Boswell had the reporter's gift for conversation as a means of LISTENING. And all that is why this is the 18th century's finest life story, and also why I came to like this book so much in the years between when it was assigned to me, and when I finally finished it as a pleasure read in the year 2006."},{"Title":"Life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"Boswell took as his subject, the person called ' the greatest talker the English language has ever known'. He went around with him, goaded him here and there, and allowed him to talk.In return Johnson said countless wise, provocative, interesting, and offensive but above all humorous things. Boswell wrote down these , and also wrote down , or reconstructed conversations of Johnson with his friends. All of this helped make his subject ' alive' to his readers in a way no detailed recording of his every action from minute one of his life to minute zero at the end of his life could. He had the sense and intuition to help bring out what is most interesting in his subject. And so he presents the subject not only in a realistic way but in a sense in a most appealing way. This made Boswell the pioneer in a form of biography , or in one of the techniques of biography which is central to it. Boswell himself with all his much self- regretted dissolution was also an interesting apprentice, a writer too after all who learned from the Master. Johnson is a great and central figure , for many the greatest critic the English language has ever known but he is too an acquaintance and friend of Garrick, Hume others of distinction .Boswell listens to them also .Johnson was something of a curmudgeon a lovable kind of character who in his anger and outbursts amuses us. He was also a moral teacher although apparently he did not give much attention to the stricture regarding the wrongness of needlessly defaming others.Together these two are one of literature's great teams, not equal to the Knight of LeMancha and Sancho but up there on the top.Like all works of genius this work has its fanatical followers and its petty demeanors. It is better in these cases to trust the first .For a work like this enriches our common humanity as all the truly great books do."},{"Title":"Life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"'No man but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money,' Samuel Johnson.Sorry, it is a hobby.Samuel Johnson the writer of the first comprehensive dictionary of the English language, which was a very big deal in his day as the elite felt the English language was in decline due to it being influenced by so many foreign influences and the marvel of Samuel Johnson's efforts and method of writing made him, according to Lord ChesterfieldLord Chesterfield's Letters (Oxford World's Classics), as someone to be deferred to as the \\"Caesar\\" of the English language. Samuel Johnson, along with his friend and former pupil David Garrick, helped place Shakespeare as the permanent king of the English language; further, Johnson was a great and singular essayist and has an eternal place as a minor poet of the English language. His dictionary shot Johnson into the inner circle of elite in English society.Boswell's \\"Life of Samuel Johnson\\" is a fascinating read as Boswell traces Johnson's life story. Samuel Johnson and Edmund Burke, a friend of his, and together the center of English political and cultural life with the 'Literary Club' that they had both started were big players in forming the English reaction to the major liberal events going on in their day and could be said to be the fathers of modern conservatism. They were alive to face the genesis of modern liberalism, in the form of Jean Jacque Rousseau along with the American Revolution, theirs was the conservative response. 'What hypocrites are the drivers of negroes to be demanding liberty,' Johnson in reference to the Americans. (It is funny that Samuel Johnson was against slavery while the more liberal Boswell was for it). Although, I know Edmund Burke felt England to be in the reconcilable wrong with the American RevolutionEdmund Burke's Speech on conciliation with the American colonies,: Delivered in the House of commons, March 22, 1775; ed., with notes and a study plan ... I. Crane (Twentieth century text-books)the Doctor, Samuel Johnson, did not and felt the Revolutionaries hypocritical ingrates. What is good about conservatism lays with these two fellows, Burke and Johnson. It is also amusing that Johnson's conservativism included the observation that countries should be judged by the condition in which their poor lived, disapprobation given to the worse.Samuel Johnson came from very humble roots and his early life was spent in modest means, fortunately he was surrounded by books. His first years in London were quite a struggle, near pennyless, sometimes sleeping on the streets. The money he ended up getting for writing the dictionary wasn't much in the end, it was the fame that got him some wealth.A marvelous read. Giving advice about the legal profession, education: his advice - just do it; habits form early and habits are hard to break... lots of interesting views from how to conduct oneself socially (Boswell seemed in constant search of this) to political commentary (one of my favorite was his advice on being weary of those that wrap themselves in the flag)... too much to write about. Boswell, when he first meets Johnson is so filled with awe and reverance but it mellows out some, he even starts playing games with the Doctor; however, he always greatly respects him but the idolitry disipates.Although Samuel Johnson's conservativeness and strong opinions might turn people off I find it refreshing compared to the stealth tactics of politics today. Politicians don't say what they mean and that is also probably why the Doctor was discouraged from entering politics in his day by some close friends with ties in that area, somethings change only by degree. James Boswell, the author, didn't agree with the Doctor all the time but appreciated the hard, realistic way of looking at things and amusingly delivered (mostly by quirky analogies) that Samuel Johnson did.Then Boswell is a story in himself. Boswell's Rousseau-ist fever for the notions of the 'Noble Savage, Natural Man'The Noble Savage: Jean-Jacques Rousseau, 1754-1762was interesting also; his generation caught it and he had strong sentiments towards it despite Johnson's arguments against its reasoning. This fever also, at the least, lent cover to the American Revolution.Johnson could only afford one year of college. Received an honarary Doctorate for his dictionary.One of the books one should read before they turn 20.The best synopsis of Rousseau and in his own words is probably 'Creed of a Priest of Savoy'The Essential Rousseau (Essentials)"},{"Title":"Life of Samuel Johnson, LL. D","review":"I own the Penguins Classics edition but no matter. The story is wonderfully rich. Boswell really is a master story teller because at no point did the story become dry. I literally read and savored every single word.All I knew of Johnson is that he wrote the first English Dictionary. But I had no idea this man was full of wit. He had a temper no doubt and definitely went through periods of what sound like moderate to severe depression followed by periods of bursting with energy, joy and wit and incredibly prolific and productive in those bursts, enough so that he surprised most people with his abilities in those bursts of creative genius. I am biased as I am a psychiatric physician but it sound like bipolar disorder to me.Whatever the case may be, I drank this book up.

How he tries and what he discovers in his pursuit make a good Geoffrey Household story.

Ingelram returned to Europe with the South American passport and arrived in Berlin to pose as a Nazi sympathizer. Ingelram's attempt to stay in Sweden failed. After he returned to Germany he was arrested, as the Gestapo had learned of his false passport. Luck let him escape from prison, then make his way into occupied Poland to escape to the middle East. There are style differences from his earlier work. This story has more adventures and events, but seems more fictional that way, or, designed for a film script (the cast of contrasting characters). But by this time the market for WW II adventure dramas was gone.This book also describes life in the wild for a lone hunter, living without human comforts. Those who have spent weeks in a jungle can best comment on these pages. In the end \\"Bill Smith\\" finds the death that he seemed to be seeking in these stories.

At the end of it, I still had questions to resolve about becoming Catholic but I felt a real desire to become a Jesuit like Campion, ready to sacrifice all and defy anyone for the sake of the Gospel. Whatever your background, if you can read this story without being moved and challenged, beware the state of your soul!It is a powerful story, thoroughly researched and skillfully told. I've often wondered why Waugh didn't write more like it; a life of More or Fisher from his pen, or even of an ambiguous and frustrated figure like Gardiner, would have been a great treasure. His life of St. Helena is excellent in its own way, but a very different sort of book.The reason, it turns out, is very simple. The Campion book was not Waugh's idea in the first place. He wrote it primarily out of gratitude to the priest, Fr. Martin D'Arcy SJ, who had instructed him in the faith and received him into the Church five years before. One of D'Arcy's fellow Jesuits had done a great deal of research for a new biography of Campion but had died before he could actually write it. Not only is the book dedicated to Fr. Martin, but Waugh declined to profit personally from the book. He quietly signed over all royalties from the biography to Campion Hall, the Jesuit house at Oxford University that was just then beginning to be built."},{"Title":"Edmund Campion: Scholar, Priest, Hero And Martyr","review":"Evelyn Waugh's Edmund Campion is about the making of a martyr in 16th century England. It will appeal most obviously to Catholics. But it is equally a picture of the politics of the time leading from Henry VIII to James I--with implications beyond, with occasional snapshots of unbelievable coarseness of manners: Queen Elizabeth accepting the hospitality of unsuspecting families and ordering their arrest when they try to honor her as she leaves; her ordering a performance from a courtier, who falls, with her roaring in laughter and kicking him, dubbing him Sir Ox.There is the torture and beastly punishments, etc. But there is in the great changes things we might recognize from our own time. Vast resources were changing hands at the will of the \\"government,\\" ending the tenure and foundation of religious enterprises. It was, you might say, past time for it. But it is hard to argue that the public benefitted. In fact in the short run the public lost by the change. The support the public needed and was used to from the foundations vanished. The charities and schooling were cut off at their source. Oxford itself became unfunded.Still, one might think it was time to end the medieval pattern and to assert change that would tend to secular control of the people's business. But the reality was, from Henry to Elisabeth, the plunder went to the ministers' cronies and supporters, creating big establishments to ennoble and enrich them--thus not only paying for their support, but binding them to it. On the other hand, the engine of reform, the public factions agitating for supremacy and the elimination of Catholics and their foundations, were easily steered. There were competing Protestant views. It was only a question of appropriate reinforcement depending ministerial choice: punish those deemed too extreme; the others would feel supported by the government actions of disestablishment. Such turns of events are not unknown in politics at other times.About Elizabeth: \\"All her life she had been surrounded by plots; plots to implicate her in Wyatt's rebellion, plots against her life . . . many of them real enough . . . plots that had no existence except in the brains of Walsingham and the Cecils [p. 19 EC].\\" Waugh says this only in reference to her dying. From his narrative a reader can see that she led an uncertain life, with every reason to be afraid: of judicial death at the hands of her half sisters or their supporters, for one thing. (She reluctantly condemned two of her half sisters to death at the instigation of her chief minister.) Henry VIII had officially declared her illegitimate and blocked her from the succession--later reversing this. Waugh's picture of Elizabeth needs a further level of generalization to register the totality in which her danger grew up with her and stayed with her to the end. She was brilliant, gifted person: but the sense of danger must have been central in her life. I think that she could see that there was no safety for her to try to live an ordinary life: she couldn't even marry without crown permission (very, very unlikely).Elizabeth could see the likeliest safety was for her to be queen. She would have the power of government behind her. I think that she saw marrying as queen would be a threat to her control, and a merry dance she led them on this. But it made her, too, susceptible to manipulation by her principal minister, William Cecil, Lord Burghley. Neither of them were actuated by fervent religious motive. Elizabeth had to sense the danger potential of the religious disorders; Cecil loved power. He may have called it something else, but the reality for him was his ability to be in control and to build a new power structure based on his sense of what could work. The definitive shift in power between Crown and Parliament would grow out of such interplays of actual power.In the end I can recommend this book to anyone interested in any these things, or their romance, whether Catholic or not--with the warning that it is the story of Edmund Campion, martyr and saint.Edmund Campion"},{"Title":"Edmund Campion: Scholar, Priest, Hero And Martyr","review":"Drags a bit, but it is a good read overall."},{"Title":"Edmund Campion: Scholar, Priest, Hero And Martyr","review":"\\"My charge is, of free cost to preach the Gospel, to minister the Sacraments, to instruct the simple, to reforme sinners, to confute errors-- in brief, to crie alarme spiritual against foul vice and proud ignorance wherewith many my dear Countrymen are abused.I never had mind, and am strictly forbidden by our Father that sent me, to deal in any respect with matter of State or Policy of this realm, as things which appertain not to my vocation, and from which I do gladly restrain and sequester my thoughts.\\"-- the courageous martyr and \\"seditious Jesuit\\" Edmund Campion in his famous \\"Brag\\"Kudos to the good people of Ignatius Press for introducing new generations to Waugh's masterful biography of St. Edmund Campion. The brilliant Oxford scholar was destined for any career he chose in Elizabeth's Protestant England. Instead, at a time when being Catholic meant persecution and an uncertain future, Campion chose not only conversion, but ordination as a Jesuit and near-certain death.Ignatius' new hardcover edition is superbly done, with a tight binding, attractive dust jacket, high quality paper, and a very readable font. It also includes remarks by modern Waugh aficionados like Joseph Pearce and George Weigel and a new introduction by Fr. Joseph Fessio.Readers might enjoy excerpts from Percy Hutchison's 1936 review in the New York Times:\\"For several years Campion, of the Jesuit order and ordained priest, had been on the Continent. Then Rome ordered him to England to give what mental and religious sustenance he could to the persecuted brethren. Though he knew that sooner or later his life would be forfeit, Campion, ten years before the defeat of the Spanish Armada, landed once again on English soil. From that moment on his days might fittingly be described as a progress toward the cross.He was a marked man. Doubtless it is true, as Evelyn Waugh adduces documentary evidence to show, that Campion was falsely convicted. He was charged with sedition; he had incited no rebellion. He was charged with treason; he had not committed treason. But he had given heart to the English of his faith by surreptitious preaching and surreptitious administrations of the sacraments. At his trial a great show of disputation of doctrine was made, but all this, according to Mr. Waugh, was camouflage.\\""},{"Title":"Edmund Campion: Scholar, Priest, Hero And Martyr","review":"It is always good to read about the saints, but the writing of those who write on the saints is not always good. It is no surprise that one of the great writers of the last century such as Evelyn Waugh would turn out a great book.Edmund Campion is a biography of the Jesuit Saint Edmund Campion who was martyred in the aftermath of the Protestant Reformation and the increasingly severe penal laws in England. This book was written in 1935 only five years after Waugh's conversion into the Catholic Church. It is a straightforward biography based on the best historical research available at the time. The author does not inject himself in the book in that he tries hard to stick to the historical narrative of what can actually be known and any dialogue in the book is straight from the historical record. This is in no way some syrupy hagiography that diverges from facts with flowery stories or that tries to inflate the actions of Edmund Campion. Though considering the subject this is not much needed when you look at his amazing life.The book running at a little more than 200 pages is divided into four very appropriate chapters: The Scholar, The Priest, The Hero, The Martyr. I wonder if you have to give a spoiler alert when you are talking a martyr. Evelyn Waugh provides the necessary historical background of the state of the Church and of the politics involved and you fast become involved in the biography as if you were reading a novel. Every time you read about the recusants and those in Church history who were persecuted for the faith it always gives you a greater appreciation of what most Catholics in the modern world take for granted. When we go to Mass we aren't worried that somebody is going to turn us in or that we don't need guards to warn is people are coming so that the priest can hide in the priest-hole.The first two chapters deal with his academic life and his early career as he initially leaves England because of the growing persecution of Catholics and his decision to become a priest and then a Jesuit. The biographic then moves to his returning to England. Like many saints he was not specifically making decisions that would lead him on the road to martyrdom. In fact circumstances could have left him teaching in Vienna and Prague since the Jesuits at the time had no chapters in England. But also like many saints when it became apparent that he would indeed be traveling down that road it was done with joy.As Waugh chronicles Campion's year of attending to the Catholics in England you again get caught up in the drama as he and other priests continue to minister to the flock for the good of souls. It is a measure of Campion's genius that his \\"Brag\\" that he wrote in a half-hour's time to defend himself from charges of treason was printed and reprinted across England. Or that his famous Ten Reasons would provide much annoyance to the authorities at the time. So annoying that once he was captured and tortured they brought him to a series of debates to try to counter it. Waugh does not dwell much into St. Campion's grisly martyrdom that will be familiar to those that saw Braveheart, but it is quite interesting the stories he describes by those who were converted by Campion in his last days.Highly recommended and one of those rare biographies that is indeed a page-turner."},{"Title":"Edmund Campion: Scholar, Priest, Hero And Martyr","review":"This biography of the English saint and martyr Edmund Campion won the Hawthornden Prize in 1936, and I read it because of that. It is very well-written , tho it lacks a bibliography and footnotes. Campion was executed Dec. 1, 1581, after being sentenced to &quot;be hanged and let down alive, and your privy parts cut off, and your entrails taken out and burnt in your sight, then your head to be cut off and your body divided into four parts.&quot; It surely makes one grateful for the 8th Amendment against cruel and unusual punishmnet. This is a fast read and eminently worth reading."},{"Title":"Edmund Campion: Scholar, Priest, Hero And Martyr","review":"Often, when reading a biography of a saint, one is struck by a certain dissonance: the heavenly heights of the subject matter do not correspond to the writing level of the book. The saint biography is one of my favorite genres, but it is at times a chore to get by the substandard writing to penetrate the beauty of the life of the saint.Nothing could be further from the case in \\"Edmund Campion\\" by Evelyn Waugh. Here we have a combination for the ages: the story of a magnificent saint told by one of the great authors of the 20th century. In many ways, it reminded me of Mark Twain's excellent book on Joan of Arc. Waugh's use of the language allows the story of Campion to come alive in ways a lesser author could have never conveyed. One is swept up into the time of Campion, and allowed to experience the persecution he experienced first-hand, as well as understand the motivating love behind his actions.Highly recommended for all lovers of literature and the saints."},{"Title":"Edmund Campion: Scholar, Priest, Hero And Martyr","review":"Foxe's famous book of martyrs gave the impression that England's troubled past ended with the martyrs of \\"Bloody\\" Queen Mary. But martyrdom continued at the hands of the Protestant soveriegns that followed including the hundreds of priests tortured to death under \\"Good Queen Bess\\" (Elizabeth I). One of those priests was the beloved Edmund Campion who gave up a lucrative career as a scholar to follow a calling that would lead to the ultimate sacrifice for love of his homeland.Mr. Waugh brings his literary skills to bear in the biographical genre to tell us this moving story of this great hero of the faith. Campion had all the promise as a young man in England and Ireland to make a renowned scholar. Mentioning a fellow English scholar of that time, Mr. Waugh makes the profound observation, \\"Tobie Matthew died full of honours in 1628. There, but for the Grace of God, went Edmund Campion.\\" Campion's life would not end with mere honors of man but the the great honor God gives to those who give their lives for others. Campion's ignominious and gruesome death won him a far greater honor than he might have accomplished as a renowned scholar. He is venerated today as a canonized saint with good reason. His life was one of service and love for his fellow man to the point of facing death in order to encourage those under the brutal persecution of Elizabeth's reign.When the sovereigns of England attempted to squash the Catholic faith, a school for under-cover priests was founded on the continent. Campion attended and took on the austere life of a Society of Jesus eventually teaching at seminaries far from his home. But always his heart ached for his own country. But, as Waugh observes, \\"Campion could help the English Mission best by realising his own sanctity.\\" And so he did, eventually landing under cover on his home island to pray for and preach the Catholics denied freedom of worship there. But his capture, long torture and brutal martyrdom were not a defeat. As Waugh says of Campion and the martyr priests like him, \\"We are the heirs of their conquest, and enjoy, at our ease, the plenty which they died to win.\\"The final chapter conveys the story of one man present at Campion's death. This man, literally splattered with the blood of the martyr, left England to follow the same path of study to priesthood to return and a common end. The blood of the martyrs are indeed the seeds of the Church. Saint Edmund Campion, pray for us."},{"Title":"Edmund Campion: Scholar, Priest, Hero And Martyr","review":"This was an amazing book. It was difficult to read as it is of any wholesale murder and suppression of a people. I had never been able to study the effects of the anti-catholic legislation and brutal suppression of the Church in England. I had alway studied it from the Irish perspective. I think that Saint Edmund Campion lived for as long as he did because he spent 10 years in Europe. Otherwise, he would have had a much shorter life, like Man-of-God Father Michael McGivney. He was already well-known in England for his writings, and oratory as a student and Deacon at Oxford University.I was struck by a few items in this book. The first was Queen Elizabeth I's remark to her bishops and clergy as she neared death, calling them \\"hedge priests\\", meaning not being actually ordained and shooing them out. The other was the shear emptiness of the English people's lives created merely to satisfy the political and power ambitions of the English Government and ministers as opposed by the people at large who were generally sympathetic and preferred to remain Catholic. Evelyn Waugh commented about the Queen's Government doing all that it could to \\"removing the people from the Sacraments of the Church so that it would die out in a generation\\" was quite striking and saddening to picture. How desolute were their lives already, but to take away the one thing that they had for hundreds of years? Mr. Waugh also points out the destruction of the abbeys and great places of learning, \\"...that flowed to and from Europe, suddenly cutting off England from the rest of the Church\\", and the greatest minds and service of the monks and priests of the Church from the English people.In Ireland, it was well known to us in America that there were safe houses and secret rooms to hide the priests and the vessels and vestments for Mass. I was surprised that this also occurred in England. I think that in many areas of history, Americans hear an \\"anglicized version\\" of the event and we see that prejudice in our books and common history.I highly recommend this book. It can be painful to read, but should be read. I would recommend some research first on the creation of the Church of England by King Henry VIII, and the Penal Laws, the Law of Supremecy, and the Catholic Faith in England first. This system of suppression remained in force until the middle of the 19th Century!

Not a light read, but if the era or the subject interests you, the book will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Edmund Campion: Scholar, Priest, Hero And Martyr","review":"Evelyn Waugh earned his place in letters as one of the 20th century's great acerbic wits, yet an undeniable cynicism in him was tempered by his Catholic spirituality. His \\"Edmund Campion\\" is an early testament to his religious identity, but fails to bring much of his literary gift to bear.A promising Oxford student whose talent for debate won him many Anglican admirers, including Queen Elizabeth, Campion's life took a U-turn when something in him rebelled against the primrose path set before him. At a time when faith in old religion cost Englishmen their livelihoods if not their lives, Campion joined the Green Berets of the Catholic Church: The Jesuits, where the goal was the gaol, and grisly martyrdom.\\"...there was that in Campion that made him more than a decent person; an embryo in the womb of his being, maturing in darkness, invisible, barely stirring; the love for holiness, the need for sacrifice,\\" Waugh writes.Published in 1935, after Waugh had published his first four scathing social novels, \\"Edmund Campion\\" examines a different kind of social transgression. The central problem of the book as I see it is Waugh's respectful handling of the Campion story leaves little room for the voice that Waugh had tempered by this point to such a sharp edge.Another issue with Waugh's tone is it leaves little room for imaginative reconstruction. He's writing a pure history, just the facts, and except for two bookend episodes, neither of which feature Campion himself (one presents Elizabeth at the end of her life, the other a pair of street performers at the site of Campion's martyrdom), there's no color in Waugh's account. Often he will write something like \\"we cannot know what hopes stirred in Campion's heart\\" and leave it there, or else relate some fragmentary comment with some note of its historical dubiousness. It's frustrating, distance-putting reading.Two sections of the book stick out as memorable. At the English College of Douai, in Holland, Campion prepares for his martyrdom knowingly and gratefully, a very surreal sequence read at this remove in time. In the other, Campion is tried, ridiculously, by a kangaroo court where he is tortured nearly to death between court sessions but still manages to make his case, puncturing the trumped-up charge of treason and calling attention to the fact his real crime was holding to the same faith that Englishmen and women lived under for centuries.\\"He and his fellows were to die, but the world must know the cause,\\" Waugh explains.But there are long arid stretches between those two sections, and much of the rest has Waugh discussing the Campion story as if the priests he wrote it for and already knew the tale were its only audience. A worthwhile endeavor, \\"Edmund Campion\\" doesn't quite hit the mark as a Waugh must-read, but is worth checking out for those who admire Waugh and want to know more about what made him tick."},{"Title":"Edmund Campion: Scholar, Priest, Hero And Martyr","review":"I chose the rating because,for me,that i could understand British religions and the humans killed all in the name of GOD.I liked the work of the Author.I would recommend this to the serious minded student in Religion."},{"Title":"After effects master class (1 livre + 1 CD-Rom) (French Edition)","review":"We're the authors of this book.

I think every one should have this helpful little guide at their side when ever they work a ritual or spell!!!"},{"Title":"The craft companion: A witch's journal","review":"When Morrison's \\"The CRAFT Companion\\" was first given to me as a gift, I was delighted to have simple spells for daily matters. I typically write all my own spells, and while I thought this treasure would possibly make me a lazy Pagan, I also realized it has its place.I could not have been more wrong. LOL It not only has not made me lazy about writing my own spells, it has motivated me to write spells for each occasion/page!! Each spell is now replaced with my own. It helped me make my own Spellbook! I printed graphics I wanted to use or thought were appropriate from the internet and wrote my spells around them in Word. This is a most excellent spellbook in its own right, but when used as a guide for your own, it becomes an irreplaceable benchmark.This work is not geared around any specific path, but -does- have \\"green\\" influences from cover to cover.I highly recommend its purchase, use, and giving as a gift to -any- Pagan in your life. The gift-giving Season [Samhain-Yule] is nearly upon us, afterall."},{"Title":"The craft companion: A witch's journal","review":"I found that this can be a useful tool for someone who is just getting started. The chants and spells can at least give you ideas as models in creating your own. However, I was disappointed that it really is nothing more than a spellbook (no theology or philosophy), and most of the spells are mostly exercises in positive thinking."},{"Title":"The craft companion: A witch's journal","review":"A Wonderful Book with lots of spells ,and a lot of information on the past present and future of what witches, and other eitchcraft religions are to look forward to if the are into this kind of stuff... anyways i absolutely love this book and it is definitely a must have for any witch.I recommend it for beginners of any age. It teaches you the basics to the advancedlessons of witchcraft.I Bought 3 for my friends Ashley, and Celeste.They love it also."},{"Title":"The craft companion: A witch's journal","review":"I am a new solitary practicer and this really got me started.

This book fell short and it is very choppy to read. However, the art is nice."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"This book has the worst grammar of all my kids' books and the poetry is terrible. I find it painful to read.

Cute story, easy to read, easy to follow."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"My 22-month-old boy is in love with this book. We bought it because he liked the author's previous book, Chugga Chugga Choo Choo, so much. This author/illustrator pair has done it again. I wish it came in a board book, because he is pretty hard on the pages, especially because we have to read the school bus page over and over. Great book, be sure you buy Chugga Chugga as well!"},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"We borrowed this book from the library for a few weeks. Months later my 4 year old son asked me to get this book for his home. He asked out of the blue. \\"Remember my truck is stuck?\\" That's a sign of a good book. It's got fun repetition and rhyming like \\"What luck, a big tow truck\\" It doesn't get old either. I recommend it for the 3-5 age group."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"My 3 year old son found this book in the library and after checking it out twice, I decided I should buy it. The pictures are beautiful, the story is short enough to hold his attention, and the rhythm has provided him the ability to remember some of the lines in the book. This is definitly one of those books that can make a reader out of a child!"},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"This book both engages my son, who got it when he was around 2, and also is fun for the adult reader. Watch for the subplot as the truck's cargo is quietly unloaded by some crafty creatures who take advantage of the many attempts it takes to get the truck rolling again. We read this book over and over and it never wears thin."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"My gandson got this book for his birthday and just loves the book he likes big truck's any way's because grand pa drives one all the time and he just loves story's about them.

A must for your home library."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"We LOVE this book. It is an account of a dump truck which gets stuck in a hole, and all the vehicles which try to get it out. The twist: the truck is driven by a dog and carries a load of bones. Praire dogs have dug the hole in order to steal the bones, which they procede to do as the driver and helper vehicles, and text, all focus on getting the truck out of the hole. So the truck eventually gets out but the bones are gone! The text rhymes, the pictures are fantastic, the story is funny (at least both myself, my husband, my 5 year old daughter who isn't even into trucks, and my 3 year old son think so)and of course it's full of trucks and cars. Guarenteed to delight toddlers and preschoolers who like things that go, and their parents."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"This book is so funny. My 3 yr old has a good sense of humor and loves that this Truck got stuck in a pothole that is dug out by some very naughty ground hogs. Even funnier the truck is carrying bones. And as the truck driver stops several vehicles to help pull him out the naughty ground hogs are carrying away the bones. Finally, a tow truck arrives to save the day. \\"Help!!! My Truck is Stuck!\\". My husband loves reading this book to my son. Great illustrations and several colorful vehicles make this a great book for even a very young child."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"Concerned that our two year old was never going to slow down to listen to a story, we ordered this book because it was about a subject near and dear to his heart...trucks. My husband and I were instantly impressed by the bold, colorful illustrations. We opened the book and started reading it and our son stopped what he was doing to come sit and listen and look. After only two readings, he repeats many of the rhyming lines as he flips through the book on his own and asks us to read the book every night now. This book has it all, rhyme, reinforcement of numbers, great pictures, a subject matter that is of special interest to most boys (though I think girls could love it too), and the neatest part is that the illustrations tell a story that the words do not point out. I love the fact that this allows you to talk with your child about why the truck got stuck. This is truly a neat book and I think Lewis and Kirk deserve an award for this one. Can't wait to get Chugga Chugga Choo Choo."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"My son, almost 3 now, has been helping us read this book to him for most of the past year now. He loves to count the vehicles and pick out the details-like the dog blowing bubbles. It has been his favorite book since the day we got it. I recommend this book to anyone with a little boy who likes his trucks."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"I purchased this book 6 1/2 years ago for my first son! It has gone through 3 children and it was a favorite for all of them! What a brilliant book! It is now starting to fall apart (after reading it over 1000 times I'm sure) and I want to replace it!! We still read it at least a couple of times a week. It never gets boring!"},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"Our 2 1/2 son seems to really like it (he likes all cars/trucks), but the rhymes are very choppy plus my tongue gets stuck reading it. I compose my own verses for our son, and cannot believe this book was even published. Its grammatically incorrect verses do not impress me. The illustrations are also a bit crude. If your child likes cars, choose another book like \\"Good night, good night construction site.\\""},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"Why I hesitated on buying this book for my 20 month old is beyond me. The vibrant colors used on each and every page are worth the purchase alone. I didn't realize that the book would also teach counting from 1 to 5 since it takes several different vehicles to get the truck unstuck. It is sure to nuture the love of reading in your child and you won't mind reading it over and over either."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"I got this book because we have Chugga Chugga Choo Choo!

He has memorized many of the rhymes so we truly \\"read\\" together. This is the perfect book for toddlers (especially 2-3 year old boys) who love big trucks. The rhymes are rollicking and the pictures are bright and clearly support the text. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"This is my 2 year old sons absolute favorite book. He grabs this book every time we sit to read.

Its an adorable lil book for any lil boy."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"My son loves this book, hence so do I. We read it every night. However, for a toddler his age (15 months), the board book he already had is much sturdier. We bought this one as a replacement in case the other one broke or got lost... That's how much he loves it. The first day we got it he got a paper cut in his finger, the next day he tore a page. It's adorable and bigger than the board book, just not age appropriate."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"My 18 month old daugther loves this book but only if I improvise. She will not sit through the entire book but she is a bit young for it. She loves trucks and the dogs driving the trucks and other vehicles."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"My 2 year old knows all the words after 2 weeks and can practically read it to me.

For any little one that is into books and truck noises it is great"},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"This book was purchased as suggested for emphasis of final k sounds for my son with articulation problems. He ADORES this book! It is a large book with paper pages. My son even uses his cozy coupe and wagon connected with a rope or chain in the back yard to reenact the story line.

It is being handed down from child to child in my family. Kid are loving it and I am gaining points for being a cool aunt."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"This is a great book. I bought this for my son when he was 3.5 years old. He loves trucks and cars and TOW trucks (his dad owns a towing business) The book is very cute rhyming and repetitive. The tow truck saves the day which is perfect for my son. It is sometimes hard to find books that engage boys but this was perfect. Illustrations great too!"},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"Great book. Just like Sheep in a Jeep but for boys about trucks being stuck, not much else to say."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"This story delights young children (especially truck lovers!) with the tale of a stuck truck. The rhyming pattern engages kids in the story and they love to repeat the line &#34;My truck is stuck!&#34; How the truck finally gets &#34;unstuck&#34; is a perfect ending. This is a great little board book for toddlers who love stories&#34;"},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"I had been searching for books for my two year old little boy who adores anything having to do with trucks, cars, buses etc. He loves to be read to but is pretty picky about the books he will actually sit through! He LOVED this book from the first time I read it to him and he brings it to me multiple times a day! Or... I will find him just sitting quietly \\"reading\\" it by himself! The illustrations are great (with a funny little story all to themselves about the bones the big truck was hauling slowly being taken throughout the book!) and the rhyming text is wonderful! The only thing I wish is that it came in a board book since I have had to tape a few small rips in the pages already from my son turning the pages too roughly. Other than that, I highly recommend this book to anyone with a little one with a love for all things with wheels!"},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"Funny and nice book.Our son loves it and red it tens of times."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"I purchased this book for my 2-year old son and we just received it today.

In the meantime, some sneaky gophers are emptying the load out of the back of the dump truck.As an elementary education major, I am impressed with the repetitive phrasing that gives my girls a chance to \\"read\\" along, and even to \\"read\\" the book to each other. Although my girls don't yet have the higher level thinking skills to enable them to see some of the humor that is shown in the pictures (a constant stream of gophers removing bones from the dump truck, the driver's assistant busy at the pay phone calling a tow truck while the driver flags down vehicle after vehicle in a frantic attempt to get his truck out of the pot hole), they enjoy hearing the story.The illustrations are brightly colored and have many details, allowing my girls to discover something new each time we read the book.I recommend this book, and I recommend this author."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"My almost 3 yr old grandson loves this book. We have read it many times. He knows most of it by heart. Often he will say \\"Round and round, the wheels they roll. Round and round into a hole!\\" This is the start of a game with his Pappy. Pappy will then say the beginning of another line from the book such as \\"No need to panic!\\" and our grandson will reply back with \\"Here come a tow truck with a mechanic.\\" Geat fun!"},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"We originally found this book at a little girlfriend's home and my son absolutely loved it.

My son (2) even learned the word \\"help\\" from this book, (finally he asks for help instead of just whining, it was worth every penny just for that sanity).

My son has rated it as a great book. My son is 18 months old and it has become his favorite book since we gave it to him. I got it because I like Lewis' Chugga Chugga, Choo Choo book (also a great book). My son likes trucks already, but this also has a car, a jeep, a bus and a moving van in it. He likes to read with me by providing the sounds that the vehicles make (Beep! Beep! or Honk! Honk!).The graphics are great and there are some hidden items - like the ground hog type animals that are stealing the \\"great big load\\" that my son will enjoy as he gets older."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"I bought this for my son when he was an infant.

It is so-so. Doesn't flow as well and not as fun to read."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"I had high expectations for this book based on other reviews and was disappointed. The \\"simple rhymes\\" were a bit awkward to read and not particularly funny. My 3 1/2 year old son (who loves trucks) enjoyed the pictures but quickly lost interest after only a few reads. In my opinion, this book is not in the same league as \\"Duck in the Truck.\\""},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"This book is mildly fun and quick to read, although I do get a little tired of reading this one. My 2 year old seems to enjoy the repetitive words, I on the other hand find it gets old in this particular childrens book. The pictures are nice and the story is good, just not one of my favorites. I would buy it used but wouldn't recommend paying full price new."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"The shipping on this book was longer then the other books I had received. It did come in excellent shape. It arrived in time for Christmas and my nephew is enjoying it."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"My two year-old loves the book. He loves trucks and any moving vehicle. The pictures are very nice and he is able to find cute little things to point out. That being said, I was disappointed in the text. I loved Chugga-Chugga-Choo-Choo, but couldn't get into the rhythm of this book. I kept thinking it was me, but it doesn't work. Also, my husband finds the ground hogs removing the bones creepy - shouldn't they have been dogs?"},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"I bought this book because my son has 2 others written by this author and loves them. I was a little disappointed in this one because it does not hold his attention. I do think the artwork is great, as in the authors other books. The story is cute, just a little boring. I'll keep reading it to my little boy though and hope that as he grows older, it will grab his attention. All in all a cute book and very nicely put together."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"My 3 year old received this book as a gift for Christmas and already (in just 3 weeks) has it memorized! The delightful rhyme and pattern of the book have made it pure pleasure to read, and since we read it many times a day, that's a must. We love the colorful pictures and the inclusion of so many vehicles. That makes it a hit for our truck loving boy. The counting (even though just to 5) is good reinforcement. The hidden story in the pictures has been fun to discuss and adds humor. The underlying plot they create are another way/perspective for us to tell the story. Very clever."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"I have a grandson who really enjoys machinery of any kind. From tractors to bulldozers, he loves them. This book has great illustrations and a simple story with repetitive text. At first he didn't understand how the prairie dogs tied into the story since he is only 2 and a half, but after several readings and explanations of prairie dogs, he got the point and just loves this story. He likes to act out the story with his own toys. I am a teacher, and I can envision my 5th graders enjoying this book!"},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"My wife and I bought this book for our 20-month old son the same time we bought \\"Chugga Chugga Choo Choo\\" (both books were written and illustrated by the same folks).

The pictures are colorful, the rhyming is charming, and the story is fun."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"I recently bought this book for my son's third birthday. After the first reading my son said, 'do aden Mommy'. He rarely wants to read a book 'again'.

So not only are we enjoying a fun story, but we are working on counting skills as well ~ double bonus!!"},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"It has been hard to find books that my almost 2 year old grandson will sit and listen to, but he loves this one. I highly recommend!"},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"My 3 year old really likes this book. It has some fun characters, bright pictures and cute rhymes. It is a simple story of a dump truck stuck in a hole. Several vehicles pass by and all try to help. There is some simple counting in the story for each vehicle that helps. The gophers are cute little thieves and a great addition to the book. Just a fun book for any little! Not a board book, so we have to be a bit more careful with this one."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"If you are looking for books for your boy toddler's library -- ANYTHING by Kevin Lewis is a hit. We have worn these books out -- LITERALLY! We can recite them from memory and they are taped together just so we can read them once again. Brilliant -- they hit the heart of my little boy! I have to admit that I hide My Truck is Stuck and Tugga Tugga Tugboat, just so I won't have to read them 52 times a day."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"My four-year old and I love this one!! Highly recommend for a sing-songy, fun, rhyming book that's easy for younger kids to memorize and \\"read\\" along."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"I concur with my neighbor in Johnston (RI). My two year old has loved this book ever since he was one. It was his first book and he quickly developed an insatiable appetite for it, asking us to read in four, five, six times consecutively. Admittedly, I grew tired of it after the first 9000 times but I only recently figured it out what REALLY happened. Kudos to Kevin Lewis and Daniel Kirk on a job well done. The illustrations are vivid and delightful. The story is a compelling journey counting from one to five. I wish Lewis and Kirk the best on the expedition together and highly recommend their masterpiece, My Truck Is Stuck."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"I knew my 3 1/2 year old would love this book, but I had no idea just how much. We sit down to read at least once daily, more when possible. This book has been in the rotation since I introduced it and I usually have to read it more than once in each sitting. He's walking around the house mumbling \\"Rotten luck. Can't go. My truck is stuck.\\" Well worth picking up for a young car/van/Jeep/bus/truck lover."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"Both of my kids enjoy reading \\"My Truck is Stuck!\\". The repetition from page to page helps them follow the book, plus the adorable illustrations tell a whole different story if you pay attention.

My grandsons ask to hear it over and over again!"},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"This is another fun book to read out loud. The illustrations are very original. My son loves this book. I also like it because it helps me to teach counting (we count how many vehicles are helping the truck). Highly recommended."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"My son (2 years old) and I checked out this book at the library and he wanted me to read it several times each day. I figure it was worth the purchase. Several weeks later, he still gets a thrill out of listening to the story. The larger print words allow me to involve him in the reading. He has begun recognizing those call out words like \\"beep! beep!\\" and \\"honk! honk!\\" and \\"Help! Please, help!\\" And, of course, \\"Vrooom! Vrooom!\\" He loves it and as much as I might tire of it, I get excited watching him get so animated about this book. Keep in mind that my husband and I call our son, \\"The Secretary of Transportation.\\" He seems to be interested in all modes of transportation. This book is definitely a good choice if your child is like mine in that respect. It also invites counting and color recognition."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"If your child loves trucks, this is a great book. It has a funny little story with good sound effects and great illustrations. My son really liked the dogs in the story and all the different types of trucks and sounds.

The rhyming, and various vehicles it depicts keeps his interest. He asks for us to read it over and over again!

Beep! so he can help to read along.This is a good book to pair with various voices of the handful of characters that appear, and while it doesn't have the rhyming cadence ofLittle Blue Truckor the extravagant, over-the-top artwork ofThe Goodnight Train, I (we) still put it on par with those two favorites.Great fun and constantly something new for me and the curious little guy to expand upon."},{"Title":"My Truck is Stuck!","review":"I ordered this book for my 2 yr old son and he loves it!

In A Stone of Hope I see a fresh perspective, a stone that has not been turned before. The role of religion,especially the &quot;old time religion &quot; of southern Black people has now been elevated to its proper height in the analysis of the success of the movement for equality and freedom. God's voice was echoed by the leaders of the movement and an evil system was dismantled. Faith gave them the fire that moved a race of people to stand up for what was theirs and the world is better for their having believed that God would not allow the Oppressors to continue in their sins. It was truly a prophetic movement. I think that all who are interested in the history of the struggle for justice in America should read this book"},{"Title":"A Stone of Hope : Prophetic Religion and the Death of Jim Crow","review":"\\"Approaching this story as an atheist, I was surprised and skeptical to hear so many of my subjects-- whom I admired from afar--expressing what Bayard Rustin called \\"fundamentalist\\" views. Even had I been a believer in the sense that most educated folk use the term I doubt that any isolated testimony of miracles could have struck me as worth copying down in my notes. But it was repeated so much and perhaps because it was so foreign to me ..I kept copying it down and ultimately it appeared a key to the beliefs... and strategic choices of my sources\\"David Chappell, author of Stone of HopeFaith in God allows a man to see more clearly into the reality of things but apparently it has taken Atheist Chappell to write this penetrating book defining the civil rights movement as a religious revival. He plays the righteous pagan Virgil in guiding Christian Dantes through the biblical prophetic theology and working of the Spirit which signaled the civil rights movement as the third American Awakening.While Chappell is obviously more comfortable with the reasoning and rationales of the Bayard Rustins of the movement, he is also an honest man. All those miracles and fundamentalists kept intruding in his story. He takes religion seriously enough not to study only the protesters but to analyze the inability of the segregationists to mount a serious religious argument against integration. His look behind the \\"southern white mob\\" reveals 1) a divided white church, 2) respectable opponents of integration trying to distance themselves from the rabble, and 3) politically potent segregationists unmatched by a similar certitude among religious authorities.American churches are bellwethers for the nation. In the 1840's the Baptists and Methodists split into northern and southern churches. In 1861 the Presbyterians did the same. When the Civil War came, a white man could go to a southern church and hear why a Christian had a duty to fight northern tyranny. When a soldier was buried, his death was seen as part of the Christian tradition of male sacrifice for the community. This kind of religious sanction never became such a force in the South during the sixties. Before the Supreme Court Brown decision on school desegregation (1954), the PCUS (Southern Presbyterians) had passed resolutions supporting desegregation. Just after Brown, the Southern Baptists overwhelmingly did the same. Since 1954 Billy Graham never allowed segregated sitting at his rallies. All of his rallies throughout the South were integrated and he once complained that national news stations chose to never report that fact. The chapters in Chappell's book that look seriously at the intellectual and religious movements supporting segregation support his thesis that the \\"The historically significant thing about white religion in the 1950's and 1960's is that it failed in any meaningful way to join the anti civil rights movement. The white southern churches never lived up to the militant image that southern politicians had shown.\\"There was in the post WWII era a more pressing evangelical development being led by such men as L Nelson Bell intellectual leader of the Southern Presbyterians. \\"Bell was part of a conservative insurgency within southern Protestantism known as Evangelicalism. The evangelical movement emerged during WWII as an aggressive effort to reestablish the popularity, legitimacy, authority and institutional strength of conservative doctrine.\\" Educated Protestant conservatives felt neither the Bryan fundamentalism at the Scopes trial nor the theological liberalism of the Social Gospel adequately proclaimed the Gospel in America or in the foreign missions. That Chappell can see all of this as well as understand that Martin Luther King was not a product of the Social Gospel nor Tillichian Ground of our Being theology shows a remarkable clarity for any reporter. It is downright miraculous from an atheist. There is an especially insightful notation that Rev King rejected the flattening of religion into \\"ethical religion\\". The whole anthropology of religion as ethics led to an unwarranted optimism about the nature of man and the struggle needed to confront evil with a more powerful force. Education was NOT the key to prophetic religion. God, judgment, conversion, sin, demons and miracles constitute the vocabulary of the prophets. King's God was a highly personal God--the God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob not the god of the philosophers. He could be trusted in times of travail and prayed to in times of danger. Andrew Young was quoted, \\"the civil rights movement brought a resurgence of religious feeling in the South. When folks start shooting at you--- you do a lot more praying.\\" When Bayard Rustin was asked if King believed in the fundamentalist active personal God, he answered \\"Oh yes profoundly, it always amazed me how he could combine this intensely philosophical analytical mind with this more or less fundamental-well I don't like to say fundamentalist --but abiding faith.\\" As Thomas Gilmore another civil rights veteran said--\\"the Holy Spirit guided us. I got strength facing the sheriff he was the biggest man in the county but I felt we were walking next to someone bigger. God is real, man. Years later Gilmore became the first black sheriff of his county.Chappell has little time for the flatteners of history who in the name of \\"people's history\\" try to paint the civil rights struggle as the ever present but under reported fight of the common man against oppression. Chappell argues that something happened here that was extraordinary indeed and the people who stepped out of the routines of their everyday lives to enter the political arena and national historical narrative were extraordinary people. He found the source of their courage and hope (that \\"stone of hope\\" they somehow chipped from the mountain of despair). What is unique about his study is that he does not stress the easy lesson that the biblical prophetic tradition was a foe to racism. He instead contrasts prophetic religion as a more effective and truthful actor for justice than position paper rationalistic liberalism. What did those Baptist preachers; Ralph Abernathy, Martin Luther King and Fred Shuttlesworth know and do that eluded Gunnar Myrdal, John Dewey, Arthur Schlesinger Jr. and Lionel Trilling. Chappell's answer is that the civil rights movement was not the inevitable maturation and triumph of philosophical liberalism. It was not education for progress. Rather it was a Spirit driven melding of characters and events living out the biblical narrative by confronting the soul of a nation. This prophetic witness employed a \\"coercive non-violence\\" necessary to confront evil and men wedded to evil. Such nonviolence is much more like war than pacifism and is grounded in a realistic Christian anthropology which saw both struggle and an embrace of \\"unrequited suffering\\" as the redemptive route to justice. It was a stunning paradox of this fitting time that there was no group more convicted by this witness--not into joining the cause but chastened to inaction--than Southern evangelicals who were also seeking a renewal of lived out religion in the daily life of the nation.Returning military veterans of WWII and Korea as well as preachers infused the civil rights movement with the intersecting language and claims of religion, patriotism and righteous warfare. The charismatic soldier-preacher Fred Shuttlesworth of Birmingham said in 1958, \\"this is a religious crusade, a fight between light and darkness, right and wrong, fair play and tyranny. We are assured of victory because we are using weapons of spiritual warfare.\\" In 1964 the fire still burned in the man whose eloquence was only surpassed by his courage. \\"We have faith in America and still believe that Birmingham and Alabama will rise to their heights of glory in race relations. And we shall be true to our ideals as a Christian nation.\\"The civil rights movement \\"carried the Constitution in one hand and the Bible in the other.\\" This crucial book by an atheist historian should challenge American Christians to distinguish the great religious awakening of the civil rights movement from the contrary spirits of black power and the sexual revolution. These profane pretenders have hobbled our national gait. Black and white evangelicals are now religious brethren separated into the voting army \\"bases\\" of two opposing parties. How long asked Elijah can Israel hobble on divided between Baal and Yahweh. Can the third great awakening stir American Christians to be one again promising a second reconstruction more just than the first? Chappell's book gives no answer but he has led us to the question."},{"Title":"A Stone of Hope : Prophetic Religion and the Death of Jim Crow","review":"If you don't have a subscription to the magazine, you will not be able to read the review, but here is the first paragraph.New & Noteworthyby Benjamin SchwarzChappell's is one of the three or four most important books on the civil-rights movement, but because its conclusions will unsettle, or at least irritate, much of its natural constituency, it will surely fail to gain the attention it deserves.

Quite simply though, this book won instant recognition as the best field guide available for Europe - and perhaps a model for field guides everywhere. Its authors are well known experts in their field having spent many years studying and publishing on the birds of the region. However, the key to the guide's success is the fact that so much more useful information has been condensed into a guide which is much the same size as existing books. The book boasts excellent illustrations, succinct text and handy maps, all presented on a the same page. Small enough to fit into a pocket (about the same size as the National Geographic guide) and cheap, it is a must for anyone visiting Europe. As one reviewer has already pointed out, it is indispensable in Alaska too - not just for Palaearctic vagrants, but for regular shorebirds and some residents.

That edition is not only cheaper, it also has a more suitable name. Its contents is exactly the same, despite the different name.At any rate, the long awaited second edition of this excellent field guide is finally here. Improving on the world's best bird field guide is almost certainly a task that will disappoint a few. However, the authors and illustrators are to be commended for their achievement. Despite an addition of almost fifty pages, compared to the first edition, this is still a very field-worthy book. The text, range maps, and many illustrations have been throughly revised and updated. Particularly noteworthy are the many new owl illustrations, and the page of \\"Atlantic\\" pigeons. Many \\"new\\" species have been added due to splits from previous subspecies. Thus, many island races from the Canary Islands are now full species. Some taxonomic groups got a particular revision, such as the wheatears and the \\"Herring Gull complex\\". The treatment of the latter has been expanded from less than a double page to three full spreads. With Caspian Gull being fully illustrated in various plumages, for example. The taxonomic sequence got some changes in the first parts of the book, with geese and ducks now at the front. The same confusing fashion as in field guides of North America and many other areas of the world. There is actually no need for a field guide to follow the latest taxonomic insights. Rather, there needs to be a sequence that allows for quickly finding a group of birds. And that would be best served if the basic sequence were kept constant.Unfortunately, non-native species got a rather worse coverage than in the first edition. Some were relegated to the back of the book such as the locally well established Wood Duck and Mandarin Duck. And even for the European native Ruddy Shelduck, the range presumably due to human releases is not shown on the map. Personally, I consider such omissions a lack of recognizing reality. The same problems, unfortunately, are found in such leading works as the Handbook of the Birds of the World, and likewise for the mammal equivalent.A welcome change in the range maps is the use of more detailed regional maps for very localised species. Despite the time span of about ten years since the first edition, and the repeated postponement in the publication of this edition for about two years, it seems that there must have been a certain rush at the end. Thus, there are relatively many typos or other minor oversights. No big thing, but somewhat of a bother nevertheless. Hopefully, a large part will be corrected in subsequent printings.Despite the various points I have criticized here, the book fully merits its five stars. It is just SO good! However, if you already own the first edition, and you use it mainly for local birding, you might want to just keep that edition."},{"Title":"Bird Guide: The Most Complete Field Guide to the Birds of Britain and Europe","review":"Probably the ultimate identification guide, packed with concise and useful field information.It is very hard to find any flaws to this book, but here it is: the illustrations, while being of good quality, are a little too small. The fact that each species has several, showing different postures or activities, enhances the ID value, although there comes a point where the page begins to look too crowded."},{"Title":"The ransom of Red Chief and other stories (Armed Services edition)","review":"I have read many books by O.

Thanks to Francis Durbridge's tight plotting and the magic of BBC radio, after the disappearance has been explained to Paul Temple and his wife Steve, within 5 minutes we are sharing cocktails with them on the terrace of a country hotel, then 5 minutes later we are with them when they stumble on a body in a deserted house, and after another 5 minutes we have flown with them to Munich and are approaching the prestigious \\"finishing school\\" in a hired car.The pace is even hotter when they return to London six episodes later. Steve barely has time to utter, \\"Oh, Paul, I'm exhausted. I've never known such...\\" before the chase continues through hotels, nightclubs and cars with time bombs in them.A meticulous production and highly-skilled actors ensure that this piece of 1950s escapism can still entertain and enthrall. It can bewilder, too. After repeated hearings I still cannot always understand who caused what to happen where. Is that the way of good mysteries?"},{"Title":"Berserk, Vol. 5","review":"With each volume of this manga we witness how the story grows, the characters gain depth, and the link between the human world and that of the gods / demons become clearer. The main focus of this installment is to show the importance of Griffith; the way he is perceived by the rest of the Hawks, his influence on Guts' life and his thirst for power, are essential pieces of the puzzle. My main question at this point regarding Griffith is if he was already a demon when he met Guts and was acting according to his plan or if he changed later in time.There are also many enlightening developments relating to Guts personality and relationship with others. He is starting to feel a sense of belonging and to care about others. He still has trouble dealing with affection and admiration. For example, he does not know how to react to a young kid that idolizes him. On the other hand, there are some of the Hawks that despise him and want to see him dead. Casca is a case apart; she is clearly conflicted by the fact that Guts is extraordinary, but she hates him due to his impact on Griffith and for achieving what she cannot.At this point there is not much more I can say about the graphics, they are simply outstanding. I imagine how hard it is for Miura to improve on the fights volume after volume. This time around, he introduces the Immortal Nosferatu Zodd, a legendary warrior that poses an extremely tough challenge for Guts. Especially since Zodd is a demon, and even though we have seen Guts face demons before, you have to remember that in terms of the storyline, this is the first time guts has to confront one.The violence and gore of this manga continue to be proficiently complemented by a compelling story. In this volume the author introduces politics into the mix, since as the Hawks gain prestige and become the most feared army of mercenaries in the area, Griffith starts to be respected and considered at the status of a knight, which several nobles do not appreciate. We also get further information regarding the Behelit, which is not only a key to another dimension as we previously thought, but also: \\"The one who possesses it and sacrifices his own blood is destined to rule the world\\".Fans of this series will be rewarded by this volume, and as you probably know by now it will contribute to the addiction."},{"Title":"Berserk, Vol. 5","review":"Berserk by far has been one of my all time favorite mangas. The ANIME was good but in the Mangas they dive further into how GUTS becomes the &#34;Black Swordsman&#34; which is where I really wanted the original Anime to go. Although now with the new Anime movie set coming out, I hope that is where they will take the story, to follow more of his transformation into the Black Swordsman.If you haven't read it, get the series and enjoy."},{"Title":"Berserk, Vol. 5","review":"The tv show destroyed my heart and these novels take the experience even deeper and of course theyve once again ripped out my heart chewed it up and spit it out..YES ITS THAT INDEPTH OF A STORY"},{"Title":"Berserk, Vol. 5","review":"I have to say right away that the fourth volume of Berserk put a terrible taste in my mouth. The opening chapter had a molestation scene that really stole a lot out of the series for me, and the truth is the series didn't even need it. With the way the third volume ended, we already knew what was going to happen. Here, I think implication is key, yet Kentaro Miura and DMP decided to publish such an ugly scene anyways.Thankfully, this series gets into the lighter moments and allowed me to forget about the ugly episode in the last volume. What's found here is the beginnings of the anime, and almost everything in that anime is interpreted to the word from the manga. Though I will say that I felt like I was watching a repeat, it was interesting to see some of the characters in manga format as I read. Plus, these are the lightest moments in all of Guts's dark tale, and you can't help but enjoy it as Guts slowly works himself into the Band of the Hawk. And, like always, the scenes of action are as intense and bloody as expected, only in this volume Guts has a little more at stake than he does in the past volumes, which adds some emotion.Berserk, though now it's in the story well-known to fans, is probably the best fantasy manga around, and though at times it may seem a little too graphic, it does warn you ahead of time with a sticker on the front and an 18+ age suggestion on the back. If you're a fan of fantasy and can handle some very mature situations, then I'd recommend this series for you. Just be careful, because sometimes the content may surprise you."},{"Title":"Berserk, Vol. 5","review":"Berserk (both anime and manga) put me off at first, I didn't think that I would like it; from what pictures I had seen it looked to be a very violent and bloody manga, not that I'm bothered by those things, but I really prefer a good story and the little I had seen of it lead me to believe that it lacked substance. I have never been so happy to be wrong, as Berserk has now become my favorite anime/manga series.Truth be told Berserk is quite violent and bloody, but that is where it catches you off guard; hidden beneath all of the blood an gore is a great story that you can't help but be caught up in, with characters that are realistic, and have convincing relationships (both platonic and romantic).I'll be honest if you're looking for a lighthearted adventure Berserk isn't for you, but if you want an intense and well written story with original and intricate characters and plots, and don't mind violence you're bound to love Berserk; you can't help but become engrossed in it.It tells the story of Guts, a hardened swordsman on a quest for vengeance against a group of demons known as the Godhand that destroyed all he held dear, and marked him for life with a brand that marks him as their sacrifice, a fate which he is determined to escape.He is accompanied by an elf named Puck, who provides Guts with much annoyance and the manga with a bit of comic relief.This particular volume is part of the Band of the Hawk arc, which details the story of Guts' past with the legendary mercenary group leading up the events that set him out on his quest for revenge."},{"Title":"The Thorn Boy","review":"She's baaaaaack...Any Storm Constantine fans who were hooked by the Wraeththu novels and have been disappointed in her other works will be overjoyed to realize that she hasn't lost it, it's just been lying dormant a while, and in this novel it has returned in full force. &quot;It&quot; being her marvelously lyrical, poetic prose and deliciously decadent and aesthetically fascinating worldbuilding. And, for those who are fans of it, the homoerotic element is powerful and prominent (and explicit) in this book.This story takes place in a fantasy realm where two countries---one that's similar to ancient Persia, another similar to ancient China, although these comparisons are too crude---have just completed a war. The king of Mewt is dead, and the king of Cos lays claim to the dead king's &quot;boy,&quot; a beautiful and strange young man named Akaten who, to everyone's shock, actually grieves for his lost king. No one is more horrified at this---actual love between a king and his boy---than Darien, the favorite boy of the kind of Cos (until Akaten comes along). In Cos, kings often take beautiful young men as concubines/sex slaves, but they would never dream of actually *loving* such boys, and the boys know better than to expect love in return. But Akaten does, and he turns the entire palace and the very order of Cossic high society upside down because of it. In the end, no one will escape unscathed.Several things made this story unique. Many novels have explored past societies in which young men served as sexual objects for other men, but few have done such a wonderful job of incorporating desire and sensuality into these worlds without somehow emasculating the boys. This one doesn't. And there is an almost holy quality to this story; both Darien and Akaten are motivated by far more than lust and love. Patron goddesses, spiritual epiphanies, and rigid traditions all play a powerful part in this story. And the story is simply beautiful. Cos is beautiful, the characters are beautiful, and the writing itself is beautiful---as befits a story about a decadent, hedonistic ancient society. This is the closest allegory to the Japanese &quot;yaoi&quot; literary model that I've ever been able to find in the English language---closer even than Wraeththu.My only complaint is that it's painfully short. This is one-day reading (actually only took me a few hours), here, and that's a true shame because when I find a good book, I like for it to last a while. But that's just my impatience. The story didn't feel truncated, to me---sometimes a story is just meant to be short, and to extend it would dilute its power. In this case, the story was short, bittersweet, and *very* powerful. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"The Thorn Boy","review":"I think there would be a lot more reviews of this if only it were easier to find! There are far too few copies of this exquisite novella, alas.An elaboration of a historical event mentioned in Crown of Silence, the second book of Storm Constantine's Magravandias trilogy, Thorn Boy is a tragic love story with elements that are rare -- chiefly its focus on kings and their boy lovers, lovers who are not only willing but devoted...these boys have not been emasculated but are whole beings with their own masculine will and passion, albeit tempered by fate. Storm's rich, seductive imagery is here in full force and there are wonderfully evocative passages of love and sex as well as grief and pain. Splendid from beginning to end.For a much richer review, check out one written by Kris Dotto for Inception, the Storm Constantine fan zine I edit."},{"Title":"The Thorn Boy","review":"This was originally intended for one of the \\"Bending the Landscape\\" collections of gay-oriented SF/fantasy, so it should come as no surprise that it has LOTS of gay and homoerotic content.

That's my only serious beef with the book; it's a novella published as a single work and at US$13 or so, it's quite pricey. It has since been reprinted by a domestic press with additional stories to \\"flesh it out\\" as a collection of short fiction, and that edition is easier to find, cheaper, and a better overall buy."},{"Title":"The Thorn Boy","review":"Introduced by Poppy Z.

For one thing, it is amazingly incomplete. Franklin is, of course, one of the most famous Americans who ever lived, and his accomplishments in a wide array of endeavors are a part of American lore and popular history. A great deal of this lore and many of his accomplishments are missing from this account of his life. He never finished the autobiography, earlier in his life because he was too busy with what he terms public \\"employments,\\" and later in life because the opium he was taking for kidney stones left him unable to concentrate sufficiently. Had Franklin been able to write about every period of his life and all of his achievements, his AUTOBIOGRAPHY would have been one of the most remarkable documents every produced. It is amazingly compelling in its incomplete state.As a serious reader, I was delighted in the way that Franklin is obsessed with the reading habits of other people. Over and over in the course of his memoir, he remarks that such and such a person was fond of reading, or owned a large number of books, or was a poet or author. Clearly, it is one of the qualities he most admires in others, and one of the qualities in a person that makes him want to know a person. He finds other readers to be kindred souls.If one is familiar with the Pragmatists, one finds many pragmatist tendencies in Franklin's thought. He is concerned less with ideals than with ideas that work and are functional. For instance, at one point he implies that while his own beliefs lean more towards the deistical, he sees formal religion as playing an important role in life and society, and he goes out of his way to never criticize the faith of another person. His pragmatism comes out also in list of the virtues, which is one of the more famous and striking parts of his book. As is well known, he compiled a list of 13 virtues, which he felt summed up all the virtues taught by all philosophers and religions. But they are practical, not abstract virtues. He states that he wanted to articulate virtues that possessed simple and not complex ideas. Why? The simpler the idea, the easier to apply. And in formulating his list of virtues, he is more concerned with the manner in which these virtues can be actualized in one's life. Franklin has utterly no interest in abstract morality.One of Franklin's virtues is humility, and his humility comes out in the form of his book. His narrative is exceedingly informal, not merely in the first part, which was ostensibly addressed to his son, but in the later sections (the autobiography was composed upon four separate occasions). The informal nature of the book displays Franklin's intended humility, and for Franklin, seeming to be so is nearly as important as actually being so. For part of the function of the virtues in an individual is not merely to make that particular person virtuous, but to function as an example to others. This notion of his being an example to other people is one of the major themes in his book. His life, he believes, is an exemplary one. And he believes that by sharing the details of his own life, he can serves as a template for other lives.One striking aspect of his book is what one could almost call Secular Puritanism. Although Franklin was hardly a prude, he was nonetheless very much a child of the Puritans. This is not displayed merely in his promotion of the virtues, but in his abstaining from excessiveness in eating, drinking, conversation, or whatever. Franklin is intensely concerned with self-governance.I think anyone not having read this before will be surprised at how readable and enjoyable this is.

Franklin was a scientist, philosopher, statesman, inventor, educator, diplomat, politician, humorist and man of letters who led a very full life. He was also a moralist and humanitarian who was happy to be considered unconventional by doing things the way he thought they should be done. His was a life well lived and a model from which we can learn much. In the introduction we are told: \\"Himself a master of the motives of human conduct, Franklin did not set out to reveal himself in his autobiography. Rather, he intended to tell us (insofar as we, the nation, are the 'posterity' to whom he addressed himself) how life was to be lived, good done, and happiness achieved - how the ball was to be danced.\\"Franklin did not have an easy life as the tenth son of a candle maker whose education ended at the age of ten. But by hard work and careful planning he was able to retire from business at the age of forty-two and devote his time to science and politics. He was sent to England in 1764 to petition the King to end the proprietary government of the colony. Soon after the Revolution began he was sent to France to negotiate an alliance with Louis XVI. He was a member of the committee that drafted the Declaration of Independence. It is difficult to image anyone not coming away richer from reading this book."},{"Title":"The Autobiography and Other Writings","review":"This book was a very good choice if you would like to learn about Benjamin Franklin and his trials and tribulations. Who better to read from then the actual person themselves? I enjoyed reading his autobiography as well as all the other readings. Benjamin Franklin being the illustrious Founding Father he wrote \\"The Autobiography\\" to ensure that people had the right view of what he had done in his life, instead of the opinions of others clashing with the true hard facts. This primary documents were so compelling to read because he explained every one of his complex thoughts in such detail. My favorite selection is \\"The Sayings of Poor Richard\\" because Franklin writes out a list of quotes and saying to live by. Also after reading his autobiography, it is obvious that his personality shines through his writings. It is essential that people read some of his writings because his accomplishments are so grandiose and they were so life altering to the Americans of the colonies and the present-day Americans. People take so much for granted and we know so little about the history that laid out the path that leads our everyday lives that it is a shame if we do not try to understand our past, because from this book you learn that our past makes our present, and our present makes our future, so why not have a clearer outlook on the future?"},{"Title":"The Autobiography and Other Writings","review":"The print is small and hard to read, but the information about and by Benjamin Franklin is incredible that one man could be that involved and informative, inventive and so unique."},{"Title":"The Autobiography and Other Writings","review":"I can think of many reasons to read the Autobiography.

Although the information is great, the order in which it is written is somewhat confusing. This is mostly due to the fact that the autobiography wasn't written in one definite period of time, but throughout the years of Franklin's adult life. Another occurence in the book is the absence of any information on perhaps what was Franklin's most spectacular achievement: his role in the Declaration of Independence the the Revolutionary War era. In spite of these things, I still think that this book deserves four stars because of the simple historic significance and insight of a great American founding father.The book covers much of Franklin's life as a child and as an adult. He describes many events in his life such as his short time as a military colonel and his work in discovering the origin of electricity and dabbling in politics. In the \\"other writings\\" portion of the book, there are several letters that Franklin had written himself to various colleagues and friends.

He was a remarkable man with a remarkable story to tell."},{"Title":"The Autobiography and Other Writings","review":"For many this is this Letter of advice from Franklin to his son is the perfect embodiment of wisdom of American business success. For D.H.Lawrence however it showed the 'shop-keeping ' lack of soul, of Franklin and he mocked him in his 'Classic Studies on American Literature'.In this work Franklin creates and promotes the legend of himself. He is a great inventor, a fabulous pragmatist. He also tells the story of his own rise , and shows how hard work and going through times of difficulty with determination and strength are important.The work contains much of the kind of pithy wisdom Franklin made himself known with in America through 'Poor Richard's Almanac'It is not a full biography, and it of course omits many other sides of the mind and character of this complex genius."},{"Title":"The Autobiography and Other Writings","review":"Personal letters of Franklin to his son which recounts his experiences in the fledgling republic which became America.

The lineage of so many developments, including government, science, industry, business, personal growth and policy can be traced back to Franklin's impact on the world. His thoughts on character development are still relevant 200 + years later."},{"Title":"The Autobiography and Other Writings","review":"One of the great icons of American history, Benjamin Franklin is a fascinating and timeless individual. Through the pages of his autobiography, he teaches the value of character, the satisfaction of constant improvement and basic financial lessons that are as applicable in today's world as they were in the eighteenth century.While he is perhaps best known for his experiments with electricity (most remember the kite) or his involvement in the formation of the United States of America (the only person to sign the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Treaty Alliance with France and the Treaty of Peace with England), Benjamin Franklin's autobiography is of a much less grandiose nature than his myriad of accomplishments. Benjamin Franklin: the Autobiography, is the 171 page musing and recollections of a great man about the specific path and choices he took that ultimately led to his success. While not a single one of the choices made was large enough to make a lasting impact on his life and legacy, Franklin instead imparts a mindset that, when followed, is destined to create nothing short of lasting excellence.FAVOURITE TAKEAWAY: Lexus gets it. So much so that they've branded their entire business around the idea: Lexus, the pursuit of perfection. The pursuit. Not the attainment. The journey, not the final destination. Franklin not only spends a great deal of time discussing the pursuit of perfection (both of morals and of reputation), but truly embodies the spirit of the chase. Every major accomplishment for which he is remembered is the outcome of a desire to improve - to improve himself, his community and the world at large. By his own admittance, he fell short on most (if not all) occasions of attaining perfection but, as he realizes in later life, the pursuit was all that really mattered anyway. In his constant, daily determination to make himself and his world better, he accomplished more than most of us could ever imagine. And he did so with a sense of humility, service, and adventure.\\"Benjamin Franklin; The Autobiography\\" has been referred to as the original personal development book and, having now read it, I can say I fully understand why. In addition to (and perhaps the cause of) his many varied and splendid accomplishments, Benjamin Franklin was a man dedicated to improvement, starting with his own character. His book is filled with tangible personal development activities and programs he created and tested; programs that would be worth exploring today. That a man's self recollection would live on this long, in the popularity it has, is a testament to the public's respect for Franklin's character and the timelessness of his message.

King had grouped it with the likes of Grace Metalious's &quot;Peyton Place&quot;. Indeed it is very similar and like a modern soap opera.King's Row is a fictional, small town in the rural south. The story starts in the 1890's with the main characters Parris Mitchell and Drake McHugh in early high school. They are best buddies. Drake is a happy go-lucky boy who chases women and loves to party. Parris is more reticent and sober.The long novel (almost 700 pages) follows their lives until their early 30's. They go through various romances (with very unexpected consequences), business operations and changes in their lifestyles. Drake starts off wealthy and the scourge of the town, however, he is bilked of his money and must start over. Parris studies to become a doctor and is well regarded throughout his career. Many of King's Row citizens have a quirk about them. Some are honest and upstanding, but there are others who have neuroses about them (including a doctor who likes to inflict pain on the sick rather than heal).This book appears to have caused quite a stir when it first came out. Parris and Drake have sexual escapes that rival the &quot;bad boys&quot; of the fifties. Instead of the hot rods they cruise around in &quot;rubber wheel buggies&quot;. Quite a change indeed from the proper southern women portrayed by the likes of Glasgow and Margaret Mitchell. There is also mention of homosexuality and incest. Like Peyton Place, there are sobering moments that the characters go through. Parris is very moralistic and easy to look up to and there are lessons to be learned about character in the book.This was a breath of fresh air. Fun to read, and yes long. At times the action was a little light, but near the end I couldn't put it down. A movie was made based off the book (starring Ronald Reagan no less) and a sequel was written."},{"Title":"Kings Row","review":"I read this book when I was 15 or so and was entirely captivated by it. It has often been compared to Peyton Place, because both stories are long narratives set in small town America that convey a soap opera-type story. I feel that Kings Row is superior to Peyton Place and has been overlooked. Admittedly this is not great literature and cannot compare to Dickens or Thackeray. Nevertheless it is an intrigruing story of young people coming to age, attempting to understand the adult world, and is packed with great characterizations. There is a certain mystery and power to this novel that will capture the hearts of certain young readers, those who are dedicated readers and love long involved stories of infatuation, loyal friendship, teenage confusion, scandal, forbidden love, cruelty, and tragedy."},{"Title":"Kings Row","review":"Discovered Kings Row years ago, while scoring some good deals on old books at a library book sale. Two authors have moved me in all my years on this planet. And Henry Belleman, because of Kings Row, iss one of them! I often ask people, if you were going to travel around the world and could only fit two books in your backpack, what would they be? Mine would be Fountainhead and Kings Row. &quot;Nuff said. This book is brilliantly written, the characters have such incredible depth, and the story line is awesome."},{"Title":"Kings Row","review":"Kings Row is one of my 2 favorite books (the other is &quot;A Tree Grows is Brooklyn&quot;). I read it a few months ago, shortly before I turned 15. Henry Bellamann shocked me with his good characteriation of all the characters, major and minor. Everything in the book was intwined with everything else. So many things happened in this town, which is based on Fulton, MO, that I wonder what sort of things are happening in MY town. Read it. The last 10 pages are sad and suprizing. I cried at a few parts. The movie is good too, but the ending is somewhat different. Anyway, read Kings Row."},{"Title":"Kings Row","review":"I read Kings Row about 12 years ago and became a huge fan of Henry Bellaman. Kings Row is the kind of book that lives long in your mind and heart. He breathes life into the characters and you feel as though you know them each personally and would recognize them on the street. He knows the pulse of human emotion and the author is a psychologist, a man of spiritual depth and insight, and his words sing. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in what it means to be human and how we fare in terms with the world around us and the inhabitants we come in contact with. I will never forget this marvelous book and have recommended it to many. Beautiful!"},{"Title":"Kings Row","review":"I had heard of KINGS ROW since the movie made from this 1940's bestseller featured Ronald Reagan as Drake in what Reagan considered his best role and the famous \\"where's the rest of me?\\" scene has been shown on television many times. I found an old paperback of the novel at a used book sale and was not expecting much but was very pleasantly surprised. The book is the story of two young men coming of age in small town Missouri in the years between 1890 and about 1910. There is enough scandal and \\"the sap of life\\" (as a New York Times review says on my old copy of the book) to satisfy the modern reader and Bellamann brings the entire town to vivid life as he peoples Kings Row with believable townspeople of all ages and walks of life. The author was sixty when the book was published in 1940 so he was a contemporary of his characters and the book is believed to have many autobiographical elements. At times the book is a bit slow paced and ponderous but Bellamann draws his characters so well and sympathetically that the reader is compelled to keep reading and there are some truly memorable and dramatic events in the story. I couldn't help but think how little has changed in the over one hundred years since the setting of the book and that perhaps the good old days and the people that lived them were not so good after all."},{"Title":"Kings Row","review":"I read Bellaman's books in reverse order -- my first one was PARRIS MITCHELL OF KING'S ROW -- that was the one we had at our home at the time. I read this one later. But order of reading notwithstanding, I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, although some parts were disturbing. This is a realistic view of human nature in a small town (based on Fulton, Missouri, a location that could be considered both southern and midwestern).This book is a series of interconnected events connecting a lot of characters and situations. There are many characters but most of it centers around Parris Mitchell and Drake McHugh. The book shows evil as well as good, and I'm guessing that at the time it was written, the sexual matters were quite shocking to read. But most readers will know that this sort of thing has been going on for a long time, even in the more so-called \\"hushed up\\" times when this book was written.It's been compared to PEYTON PLACE, and I can understand why. Although the circumstances in each book were different, the character of Fullmer Green in this book is similar to Leslie Harrington in PEYTON PLACE in that they were both power-hungry people who wanted to dominate others. In fact, a good friend of mine, when she was describing PEYTON PLACE gave a description of Fullmer when she was trying to explain Leslie Harrington! (She got them mixed up)Bellamann is a master of realism as well as good at creating characters real-life challenges. When I finished reading this book, I felt like I could find my way around the town of King's Row! Above all, he shows that King's Row, like any town, is probably neither good nor bad; it's a town; a place, and the people determine what it is. When you finish the book, you get the idea that the author still loves the town -- it's his own.This book will grab your attention, for sure!"},{"Title":"Kings Row","review":"There's a great movie, Kings Row, which I adored and after reading the reviews here, I was excited about reading the book. I found it well written but melancholy. For me it dragged on with not enough action and too much psychological meandering. My mind wandered often while reading page upon page of Parris Mitchell's thought processes as he wanders a field sorting out events of his past. It seems his life was destined to be filled with tragedies such as his best friend's amputation of both legs by a vicious doctor and his parents' and grandmothers' deaths. Even his romantic interests had sad demises. In between these tragic events, there are very few positive events detailed of good times that any normal human would experience. The town of Kings Row contains a mental institution vaguely described yet clearly a central location of the story. The entire book seems to be told with a certain hopelessness. Thankfully, it seems Parris' story has a hopeful ending with some resolution. I DO like the author enough to read the follow up novel, Parris Mitchell of Kings Row, in hopes of further resolution. What I gained from this book was the meaning of true friendship and loyalty."},{"Title":"Kings Row","review":"It's been A heck of a long time since I read this book but I have actually read it twice and plan to a third time. It's one of my 'Keepers' a book so good that I keep it and re-read it on occasion.The novel is about the authors home town of Fulton,MO. I lived there from 1974 to 1983 and I still live in the same county that Fulton is in. The author changed the name of the town in his book to Kings Row. The streets he mentions in the book actually exist but with different names. There is a State Mental Hospital in Fulton but it's no longer called the lunatic asylum. It opened in 1850. It was the first hospital of it's kind West of the Mississippi River. Henry Bellaman the author would not recognize it today because all of the old 1850's buildings except for a barn have been torn down. The hospitals administration building burned down in 1957 destroying many old records.There are geographical locations mentioned in the book. Fulton's main street is called Court Street and many of the old homes are still standing there.The Dr's house is now located at Bluff and 5th street. There is no sign that proclaims it as such probably because it's a private home. It's original location was near Westminister College. The College needed to tear that house down to expand. The house was purchased, town down,and moved board by board to it's present location. They did it that way because the City of Fulton charges two arms and both legs when you try to move a home by truck in their town. That's because a few electrical lines have to be moved and it don't matter if it's a historical home or not.Kings Row was banned in Fulton ans adjoining Callaway County. I imagine that the law is still on the books now, but nobody enforces it. Fulton used to have a street fair called Kingdom Days where you could find this book for sale at different vendors. They still have their street fair but to be honest it's present name escapes me because I have not gone to it for many years.I have grown to like Fulton and Callaway County. We have always been described as clannish and hostile to strangers but I have not seen that even when I first moved here. I could go to Court Street in 1974 and have several complete strangers say Hi to me. I have found the people here friendlier than they were in my home town."},{"Title":"Kings Row","review":"Another book that a movie was made of. I enjoyed both the movie and the book.

The novel is divided into three parts - 'Preface', 'Face to Face' (about three-fourths of the novel), and 'Volte-Face' - indicating the three stages of the main character Ludvik's 'Journey' of self-discovery. It's a familiar story based on familiar themes (philosophical, biblical, historical) but Germain's work remains fresh, lively, and thought-provoking throughout.

It explains that racism does not persist because of ignorant, uneducated white people, but because the capitalist rulers of America find racism too useful and profitable to part with. To prove this thesis, Camejo goes into fascinating detail about how Radical Reconstruction began to transform the American south, as Blacks, armed with guns and the right to vote, began to direct their own destiny. He then shows how the Republican Party abandoned Blacks as the Party consolidated its economic grip on the south, and \\"reconstructed\\" it in their own capitalist image. His analysis of the \\"Myth of the 1877 Compromise,\\" which historians have mystified for so many years, is particularly helpful.

Mount Aurum station is at the end of the Skippers Road, an old goal-mining road built late in the 19th Century. It still exists, as does the old Mount Aurum homestead - now a historic building and one which I visited a few years ago. It's a hair-raising drive in, albeit incredibly spectacular. It's a remote area, and forty to fifty years ago it was even more so.This book, and it's predecessor, \\"Beyond the Skipper's Road,\\" tell the story of the author's association with this rugged, islolated and historic area of the South Island high country. Terri Macnicol tells stories of her neighbours and the generations of roadmen and goldminers, farmers and shepherds, who along with their wives and families, have lived along the road and at the Mount Aurum station. It's a well-written and very readable account of an isolated and rugged way of life which has all but disappeared.

However, this book won't help you knit a set as wonderful as the one pictured. Many of the patterns are missing vital details, like the pattern for the ears or tail. Additionally, the patterns have been dumbed down from the versions in the pictures. Many of the photographed animals are knit using short rows, yet the patterns are for simplistic animals with log shapes for the body and legs just stitched together to look vaguely like an animal. Kids can make animals just like that by stitching together their icord from their knitting spools!Overall, I'm very dissatisfied with the patterns in this book but still in love with the photos. I intend on giving away the failed animals I made following the patterns in this book and then design my own critters to more closely match those in the photographs."},{"Title":"The Knitted Farmyard","review":"As an avid Waldorf crafter, I really wanted to love this book. It hints at a novel approach to creating knitted play toys for children. The problem presents itself in various forms: awkward British English translation, interpret-your-own instructions and poor printing quality.1. Yes, American's can read British English, but it is difficult when dealing with measurements and certain terminology. Also, it read like a literal translation of the German text, so some references are awkward and the reader left wondering what was really meant.2. This is NOT a book for a beginner crafter or knitter. There are precious few diagrams and casual references at best to stitches used. I had to pull out my own stitch dictionary to figure out what some of the stitches looked like much less how to apply them. Very few measurements are given. At best, this is a casual guideline to build your own ideas from but far from any instruction booklet on how to recreate one exactly yourself. The instructions that are given are unnecessarily complicated to create such simple shapes. (For simple and easy directions of almost identical looking animals try &#34;Knitted Animals (Education S.)&#34; by Anne-dorthe Grigaff and Bjarni B. Jacobsen).3. A final note is the images and printing quality. The cover is a blurred image that smacks of poor print-on-demand quality. Thankfully the images of the finished products inside are crisp, clear and close-up. However, many of the given patterns don't create what animals are in the pictures! There is an author's note at the beginning warning about the changes. But my point is this: I want to make what I see in the photos, that's why I bought the book! If you are going to change the patterns, then make a sample and include that photo instead of the original pictures! It's even more frustrating because when you study the pictures, the way the animals were originally created in the German version are more logically constructed than the adapted pattern given. But if you were not a moderate to advanced knitter you would not know this.In the end, while the idea IS a great starting point, try to find this in a library, buy second hand or borrow from a friend to flip through once or twice. But in my POV not worth the $10 or space to keep on my bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Knitted Farmyard","review":"Several people asked me to direct them to a copy of this book after they saw it.

The primary action occurs in Sri Lanka and southern India. The story is relatively fast moving and dramatic considering it is a novelization of a spiritual journey. The prose ranges from elegiac and elegant with occasional lapses into more forced and convoluted descriptions, yet the overall impression is of a remarkable piece of work.

Anyone who is looking for understanding with regard to marriage, relationships, or sexuality will find much wisdom here.Pope Paul presents the Catholic case against artificial birth control with precision and sound logic. Eerily, he forsees how easy access to birth control will corrupt man and society:\\"Let them consider, first of all, how wide and easy a road would thus be opened to conjugal infidelity and to a general lowering of morality. One does not need much experience to know human weakness and to understand that human beings--especially the young, who are so vulnerable on this point--have need of encouragement to be faithful to the moral law, and must not be offered an easy means to evade its observance.\\" You wonder how things would be if schools taught this point of view instead of sex education that facilitates and reinforces immoral actions ...\\"Consider also the dangerous weapon that would thus be placed in the hands of those public authorities who have no concern for the requirements of morality.\\" While China is notorious for forced birth control of its population, you wonder if we are not far behind when schools and other public institutions pass out condoms and our government legislates against life.\\"Consequently, if one does not want to see the mission of generating life exposed to the arbitrary decisions of men, one must of necessity recognize certain absolute limits to the possibility of a human being's dominion over his or her body and its functions...\\" With stem-cell research already here and cloning and other advanced methods of genetic engineering on the horizon, I think this point takes on even more importance as a warning.Two points stood out to me in this brief but powerful document. First, Pope Paul reminds us that sexual relations have a physical and spiritual dimension. Sex cannot be reduced a mere physical act. Second, he explains how self-control with regard to our sexual impulses is a good thing, not a punishment:\\"Such discipline bestows upon family life fruits of serenity and peace, and facilitates the solution of other problems; it fosters attention to one's partner, helps both spouses drive out selfishness, the enemy of true love; and deepens their sense of responsibility.\\" Amen.These words fly in the face of modern secular thinking, where sex is equated with love. Pope Paul was a realist: he mentions a few times that his teaching will be hard for people to accept; in fact, he almost concedes that society as a whole may well reject the teaching. It has, and we can judge for ourselves where it has gotten us since 1968."},{"Title":"Humanae Vitae: Encyclical Letter of His Holiness Paul VI","review":"For the way His Holiness was vilified when this document came out in 1968, Pope Paul VI should be known as Paul the Confessor. He truly suffered for the Church over this encyclical letter. And that is quite a shame, for his teaching in Humanae Vitae has turned out to be prophetic. A must read for anyone interested in life issues today. With the state of much of the world in our time( about 70% of all conceptions in Russia end in abortion) Paul's wisdom is sure help and a much needed path to a more caring and holy world. The sanctity of life is paramount."},{"Title":"Humanae Vitae: Encyclical Letter of His Holiness Paul VI","review":"Few teachings of the Church are so challenged as the teaching on artificial birth control. Yet few who malign the Church have made the effort to read this monumental but brief document that explains the beauty that underlies that teaching. Those who would malign would do well to read and understand this great work first. Better to understand than criticize with false assumptions concerning what it contains. It is not, as some contend, an enslavement to blind obedience but an affirmation of the dignity of man. Not a shallow assertion of political sound-bites but real food and real medicine for a wounded human condition. Read it and see the higher calling to which you have been called. Not as mere beasts driven and enslaved by their passions and selfish desires, but as men and women created in the image of God for good works. The brevity of the document and simplicity of the foundational principles it contains make it an easy read. Every Christian, Catholic or Protestant, will find a wealth herein. A must read also for any seeking to understand the later development of the Theology of the Body from Pope John Paul II, the great. Do not presume to understand a Christian view of birth control without first understanding the content of this encyclical. Read it as many times as it takes to grasp the deep beauty and profound significance it contains for our day."},{"Title":"Humanae Vitae: Encyclical Letter of His Holiness Paul VI","review":"What this Pope has written all those decades ago has proven to be prophetic in that he told us what would happen if things didn't change direction. Well, they didn't change direction and now we are getting ready to inaugurate a President who is in favor of infanticide, abortion, euthanasia. How much killing can one person support? I highly recommend a prayerful reading of this amazing document.

The people who considered themselves the most informed, who thought they possessed the keenest minds agreed that Pope Paul VI got it all wrong. How could he be so out of touch with reality?This 30 page teaching to the Church and to the world could not have been more correct. It presents the truth of Church teaching and it tells us what would happen if the teaching was ignored. Well, the teaching was largely ignored. Guess what? The dire predictions actually came true, we have seen all the evil consequences that were foretold more than two generations ago.If you want to help save the world, then get this and give it to as many young couples as possible."},{"Title":"Humanae Vitae: Encyclical Letter of His Holiness Paul VI","review":"When something is designed to work a certain way, then that's the way it works.

Adherance to natural law keeps all things in their proper place."},{"Title":"Humanae Vitae: Encyclical Letter of His Holiness Paul VI","review":"Probably no other teaching in the history of the Church has been vilified as Pope Paul VI's encyclical, \\"Humanae Vitae\\". Theologians and laity were recommending relaxing the teachings on artificial birth control; and Paul VI caused quite a furor when Humanae Vitae came out. Growing up Protestant, I was well aware of birth control, but as a Catholic, I didn't know what to do. I decided that a real Catholic would take the time to try to understand the Church's teaching, so years ago I read Humanae Vitae, and then I saw the beauty of marital love. Before 1930, ALL churches forbid artificial birth control, citing the \\"sin of Onan\\". If people would only take the time to read this encyclical, they, too, would see the beauty of marital love and see how artificial birth control frustrates the will of God and tarnishes the beauty of the marriage act; and they would see why it is a grave sin to introduce something artificial. They would also see how artificial birth control has cheapened human life, which has lead the way to abortion through all nine months of a pregnancy, has opened the door to infanticide and euthanasia. Catholic or Protestant, all should read this short, well written, beautiful encyclical on Human Life. Only then will you understand why."},{"Title":"Humanae Vitae: Encyclical Letter of His Holiness Paul VI","review":"Much like Rerum Novarum, I read in this encyclical words that may be used in any age.

Membership Series)","review":"&quot;What we think and what we eat - combined together - make what we are, physically and mentally, (Edgar Cayce reading 288-38) When &quot;Nourishing the Body Temple&quot; first arrived in my home, I placed it on the bottom of my reading pile, and sighed, &quot;another book on nutrition.&quot; I have read many, and have a good collection in my personal library, so I was in no rush to read yet another. It was a few days later at our local (Edgar Cayce) Search for God study group, that the book was brought back to my attention. It was the talk of the group. &quot;Wonderful book, beautifully executed, fantastic collection of nutritional insights, easy to read, everything I always wanted to know,&quot; were a few of the excited comments. Well, with that introduction, I had to elevate the book to the top of my reading pile. And as I have discovered, well it should have been. The Cayce readings gave the world an unprecedented source of insights on how food energies interact with body, mind and spirit to create health or illness; Simone Gabbay has assembled these for us in this wonderful collection of nutritional guidelines and cooking instructions and complemented them with her own expertise as a professional nutritionist. Simone has given us a comprehensive diet and nutritional guide explaining topics such as enzymes, pH balance, vitamins, minerals, food combining, vegetarian diet and food as medicine. She has included helpful information on fats and oils, cooking methods and the alkaline diet so often referred to in the Cayce readings. To quote from the book, &quot;The task of sustaining the body, through proper nutrition and other measuers, thus becomes a spiritual responsibility. It becomes a goal fueled by the sacred purpose of empowering the soul --the God-self of each individual -- to more perfectly express and experience the full spectrum of its divine attributes&quot;. The Cayce readings tell us that we should have reasonable concern for our diet, as in reading 1909-2 &quot;The diet - as the body sees and understands - is as necessary (an) element as any that may be chosen. As the body builds mentally, so may the body build physically by the choice of those foods or valuations from same that will sustain or maintain - that proper relationship between mental, a spiritual, and even physical forces in same.&quot; I personally wish to thank Simone for giving us this wonderful spiritual and practical guide to nutrition. Now, when a discussion arises in our family about foods and methods of cooking, we have a standard quip, &quot;What does Simone say?&quot; Then out comes the book, now our kitchen bible, and we look it up. Recently, our family had a great debate about what solid food our baby grandson should be started on. In unison came, &quot;What does Simone say?&quot; Simone gives us a whole chapter on &quot;Nutritional Needs for Special Times and Circumstances&quot;. Wonderfully insightful and, surprise; one of the first solid foods for baby is the yolk from a soft boiled egg. I never would have guessed that one. This is a book that you have to read for yourself to appreciate its value. It has something for everyone. Thank you Simone for &quot;Nourishing the Body Temple&quot;, your gift to all of us.

Psychiatry chair follows after a ten year stint in London where he wins the heart of the glamorous psych. student the limping Lucy. He returns to Adelaide, beau in matrimonial tow; reaquaints old stomping grounds, prioritsing college buddy, Felix. While Martin has aspired to the elite, Felix, born into gentry and forever a step or so in advance - a status he maintains in death - has been trajecting in the opposite direction,fast-tracking via a stint in a desert community of Australia's vast and sparsley populated, Aboriginal interior; a rebirth at the most exacting cost. From their advent into Felix's Edenically fruited property in the hills, all three are inexorably propelled to the Walpirir country's(in Aboriginal Australia there are many countries recognised by respective marriage groups and language bonds) Budgerigar Dreaming(a small, irridescent green and yellow parrot). Felix gifts Lucy with a painting of the birds' dreaming, made by his Aboriginal 'father'thereby netting her attraction and their unravelling, as surely as the small birds are hard-wired to their 'vaginal' sinkhole in the desert where Felix's grab-bag of Walpiri law and Socratic musings terminate a few months later. By insisting on his arduous fugal trek to the site of the abandoned bugerigar dreaming, Felix makes of his death a sacrificial offering, simultaneously delivering his 'father' his long lifetime's wish, his chauffeur, a Toyata, and his white 'brother', Martin, Eden in the hills and painful self-knowledge through patient insight. At this point, with the imputed confluence of two knowledge systems, you either accept Goldsworthy's concilatory gesture or reject him as an aesthetic dabbler. With the contemporary Australian attitudes, as espoused in the book, Goldsworthy's project is as daring as I have encountered.The romanticised thrall of things Aboriginal, say by Xavier Herbert,is revisited courtesy of viral ethnopornography and the pragmatic entertainment of Aboriginal law. As his wife jumps ship, Martin goes one down, his anger and jealousy swamping his rationality. Now, with her endistanced, a rent and chastened Martin scores the sheet music, biding his time in Eden, whiling through the forbidden fruit of Felixs tobacco stash, thereby keeping him within range. Goldsworthy presents his knowledge with economic grace. Dignifying indigenous Australia and its exquisitely painted landscapes, mineral and vegetable, where carnal breathing and winged beatings resound, this literature is of significant moment. See my site>rodmoss.com for more Aboriginal stuff"},{"Title":"Three Dog Night","review":"Seedy tosh with intellectual pretensions, based on a garish midday movie concept.But Goldsworthy wouldn't put himself in company with the comparable \`Indecent Proposal' - this isn't just about titillation for the punters. I suspect he sees himself as a champion of asking brave questions. However, as with someone about to leap off a roof wearing a superman cape, there's a fine line between brave and stupid.Oh, and offensive - something that's become his hallmark. He was deliberately, if in a soft-target way, offensive in his \`Honk if you are Jesus'. In Felix we have another shallow, bitter turd who, like Mack in KISS, we're somehow meant to find robust and endearing because of the no-nonsense way that they abuse anyone with the foulest language who might try to befriend them; at some point, weirdly, actually using the swearing to show how unaffected these characters are becomes pretentious.But the real offensiveness comes from his \`brave' questions (don't call me stupid). This from the man who thought it was worth reopening this bestiality hangup so many of us mindless conformists seem to have: c'mon, let's get it out there - is having sex with animals really such a bad thing? Sure, I'm all in favour of being aware of the assumptions of one's culture and challenging them where appropriate. You know, it's cool, man, for teenagers to question their parents and the values they've been handed - but incredibly stupid if they just throw the lot away. Sure everyone's old man has got a few blind spots, but it's not that likely that they have got everything totally wrong. So, call me a hide bound conservative if you like, but if somebody throws up the question, \\"Um, is it OK to get with a baboon,\\" I've got no qualms at all in saying, \\"No.\\" Some questions actually have answers, and even if the answers have been around for a while they might still be right.So what's our challenge in Three Dog Night? Well, you know all this stuff about fidelity, trust, marriage, intimacy - could that all be a con? But this isn't just the old playboy philosophy: Goldworthy would probably rather see himself as Peter Singer than Peter Swinger (ugh! Puns can turn up in the strangest places). No he deliberately pulls out a formula dream couple so we know it's a profound issue he's addressing, and not some standard Jerry Springer (no, not Singer or Swinger) style ugly infidelity from people with the loyalty and self-control of an insect. So here's our discussion topic around the table: devil's advocate Goldsworthy says, maybe this \`forsaking all others til death do us part' thing is a crock. And then he falls back on the standard dodgy technique of trying to create one exception to justify a raft of clearly unjustifiable actions.But, blimey, his extreme case argument is embarrassingly weak. \\"What if somebody's got cancer and they fancy your wife.\\" Well, gee, Pete, that's a real stumper. What would I do if a mate of mine had a terminal disease, and as part of his palliative care asked if he could borrow my Mrs for a while. And not just for sex, no, you could get a prostitute for that: no, straight up, it's for intimacy because, you know, he's really in love with her.Riiiiiight. Well, I think after less than a second's careful deliberation I'd come back with the sensitive response, \\"Keep your goddam hands off my wife.\\" Really, is that the best he can come up with? \\"It's not just for sex.\\" Oh, that's OK then - it's not like I'd have a problem if my wife turned to someone else for a special intimate sexual relationship, just so long as it wasn't just the sex, and maybe they didn't actually make the beast with two backs. Pete, betrayal in a relationship does not merely mean intercourse.Whatever, I dumped the book a little over half-way with the supposedly intelligent couple agonising over a dead simple question as if it was Schr?dinger's cat. What does Goldsworthy want me and my wife to do: to start wondering seriously if it's really wise and compassionate if I lend her out, and she lends herself out, now and then to anyone who might be infatuated by her - just as long as they've got a terminal disease (and a vicious tongue). How does this even start to be a dilemma? Uh, I heard the question, the answer is no. That would be a betrayal of trust. Maybe we can hang out together, but, gee, who would have thought it, I don't want you hitting on my wife - even if you are sick. Like that's the only valid compassionate response. Sheesh, give me a break - yet super-intelligent hyper-insightful respected straw-man idiot psychologist Martin is left speechless: \\"Oh, um, well, I suppose you should go off together on a holiday without me. Nothing else for it really.\\" And supposedly wise and sharp and equally in love Lucy just resignedly being handed around to unquestionably vile Felix as comfort woman. Give. Me. A. Break.Do I dare risk a Goldsworthy again? I loved Maestro, but maybe I shouldn't read it again through the ugly lens of his later work. There's nothing of that sort of charm or honesty in this book. There are some Australian references, but they felt contrived. Like I said, I dumped this just before the trip - maybe I missed something better (not hard) later, but I seriously doubt it - the whole premise of the book just stank. I have really liked some of the authentic people in other books of his, Australians I could recognise - but the company here is just plain unpleasant. I've tried - c'mon, to pick up a book of his after the appalling Wish shows enormous faith and forgiveness - but I think it's moved beyond not agreeing with his \`brave' questions. I think Goldsworthy has shrunk, he doesn't even seem to be good company any more."},{"Title":"Three Dog Night","review":"I, like many, have been a fan of Peter Goldsworthy since 'Maestro,' and Three Dog Night did not disappoint. This is by no means an easy read, and it does tackle some difficult issues, issues to which some readers might take offence (see previous review). But to me, Goldsworthy's insight into his characters is the work of someone who is a master of their craft. His depiction of the Australian landscape is superb, and his prose, to me, is something to be admired.Goldsworthy is one of those Australian novelists whose books I always look for as soon as they are released - like Kate Grenville, Tim Winton, and Peter Carey."},{"Title":"The Silent Duchess","review":"Dacia Maraini is celebrated in italy, where her books are bestsellers and win important prizes, but she hasn't yet caught on in the United States, where translated fiction gets slighted and there's room for only two or three writers from each foreign country. I hope the Silent Duchess changes that. It's an extraordinary book -- a historical novel set in 18th century Sicily, whose heroine, Marianna Ucria, the deaf and dumb aristocrat of the title, manages, in small and subtle ways, to become an independent spirit despite a forced marriage to her uncle at age 13. The writing is piquant and evocative-- Sicily has never seemed so intense and alive--sights, smells, food). This is a book with everything you'd find in a historical potboiler-- sex, love, violence, family, incest, spectacle, tragedy. But it's a serious word of art, moving, sensuous, thought-provoking. One of the best novels I've read all year!"},{"Title":"The Silent Duchess","review":"I had to read this book for a literature class, and I completely adored it. If you know even a little bit about the social situation of women in the 18th century, you'll soon understand what a remarkable character the Duchess Marianna Ucria is. Although I had figured out, really early into the novel what the 'childhood trauma' was, I was pleased to see that it wasn't a book about coming to terms with trauma (yawn, yawn). Instead The Silent Duchess is more a novel about silences, both physical and metaphorical, it gives a voice to women who have been ignored by both society and history.Dacia Maraini has created a gem of a book, which deal with many women's issues, some of which still exist today, but does so in a way that's not off-putting. Thought provoking, not boring."},{"Title":"The Silent Duchess","review":"I was attracted by the romantic presentation of eighteenth century life in Sicily, reminiscent of The Leopard.......however this leopardess has her own den. I'm still sorting the pieces of what could have been a pot-boiler with the nuances which made this book cling to me. In very small experiences akin to the heroine, I have spent some days in silence and am astounded at the view I have of my world and my colleagues. As was depicted by Maraini, people filled in the blanks for the Duchess (or for me) without considering or verifying assent or denial. As the story forms and is given to us (that is my description of the subtle powers of the author), the Duchess changes. We are almost not aware, and then we see that that was the story all along. Change isn't the right word, that's too dramatic. It's more like she 'comes to be'. The unpackaged ending is so hopeful, and so unconstrained. I'm tired of being told what I should be, in life and in print. I'm already an overachiever with freedoms Mariana never dreamed of. Oh, thank you Dacia. I'm going back for more."},{"Title":"The Silent Duchess","review":"This was one of the best books I have read. It will stay with me for many years. I read in Sicily and it helped give me a \\"living color\\" understanding of history and culture of Sicily. It is fiction based on accurate fact and an entertaining way to learn about Sicily. Initially I thought it was a women's book but my husband who is normally addicted macho mysteries loved the book also."},{"Title":"The Silent Duchess","review":"Through the story of a deaf and mute duchess, author Dacia Maraini describes the stultifying culture of Sicily in the early 1700's. There is a strong class system with nobles living well, but precariously. They control the lives of those below their rank and on a whim they can pluck someone from miserable poverty and \\"elevate\\" them to servitude.Noble women, who are well dressed and well fed, are similarly moved around, but their fate is determined more by strategy than by whim. The sons are not always pleased with the match made by their parents, but beauty can help the ease a loveless marriage... in the beginning. In this culture, everyone is vulnerable, and no one is happy. Mosquitos and the disease are ever present.The people are preoccupied with ceremony and rank. The culture looks inward: \\"To confront other minds, other ideas, is considered in principle an act of perfidy.\\" (p.49). The Duchess is an exception, in her physical isolation, books are her communication. While she has a life of the mind, she cannot escape the culture. While she performs acts of kindness, she understands and uses the tools of control for those she outranks. She will not or cannot follow her heart.This book is beautifully written. Characters and the tension they inject are poetically drawn, be they major characters such as Don Pietro, who in every scene exudes his technical status as \\"uncle husband\\" or minor characters such as that of Guiseppa of whom it is said to be \\"inconceivable\\" that she is not married at 23. Many scenes are exquisite depictions of time and place such as the complex upstairs/downstairs relationship of the Duchess and Fila who has been gifted to her, the funeral of Don Pietro and the business matters that follow it, how Marianna seeks a wife for Saro, and the picnic in the vineyard to name a few.There is an Afterward by Anna Camaiti Hostert. But for the revelation of one plot element, this would have been better as a preface. Its information on author's background and Hostert's interpretation of how Sicily's 1700's inwardness and social structure impoverished the island can better inform the text if they are read first.This is an excellent novel and I highly recommend it to those who appreciate historical fiction for what it says about place and time."},{"Title":"The Silent Duchess","review":"I have read other very interesting books of Dacia Maraini, an Italian writer who deserves to be much better known in the US. This novel may be my favorite among her works. One becomes attached to the heroine as she develops over the years. The story is at times tragic, funny, touching. By the way, the villa described still exists in Bagheria (Sicily). Read it!"},{"Title":"The Silent Duchess","review":"There's not much interaction between the characters in this long slow-moving novel. The heroine, who is mute and deaf after an early childhood trauma, is cut off from her world to such an extent that the novel lacks all immediacy. Too bad, because the descriptive prose about Sicily is interesting; there's just a great lack of emotion."},{"Title":"The Silent Duchess","review":"Unfortunately, this book is doing nothing for me. Not only is it very slow and the minute details are so painstakingly expanded on, but I feel so distant from the main character, and find myself not caring about anyone in the story, when I really want to. I'm not really sure where this book is going, and the &quot;mystery&quot; behind the duchess's silence is really down-played. Of course, I'm not done with it yet, but so far, the book hasn't really addressed the mystery or expanded on it to make you want to figure out what happened to her. I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to finish this one, and I'm the type of reader who wants to finish every book I start! It's really too bad, because I had such high hopes for this novel!"},{"Title":"Collins Complete Works Of Shakespeare","review":"I needed to get a book of complete works of Shakespeare, and portability was of key importance. So I went to a theater bookstore where I compared several different collections, including ones by Arden, Stratford, Pelican, and Gramercy. And this collection by Harper-Collins was hands-down the best in terms of readability and portability (and affordability).The Arden and Pelican ones are the most comprehensive in terms of glossary, essays, and other scholarly stuff, but they also are the heaviest and the priciest. The Illustrated Stratford Shakespeare is surprisingly light (especially for a hard cover), but presumably to save page space, it abbreviates the characters' names before their lines (which I hate), and its font is pretty horrible in legibility. Gramercy's &quot;William Shakespeare - The Complete Works&quot; is the worst, being quite heavy while being extremely hard to read (abbreviated names and no indentation).Harper-Collins' &quot;Complete Works of William Shakespeare: The Alexander Text&quot; is one of the best in terms of readability, with its good paper, font choice, fully spelled character names, and appropriate indentations to help legibility. It also has a decent glossary in the back for hard-to-understand words. I would have loved to have footnotes at the bottom of each pages instead, but hey, you can't have everything, I suppose. In terms of portability, this one is the second lightest of the five books (Stratford is the lightest). And the price is certainly right.If you need complete Shakespeare on the go, this is the one to pick."},{"Title":"Collins Complete Works Of Shakespeare","review":"This is an edition of the complete works of Shakespeare that I keep next to my bed. No heavier than a large fashion magazine and absolutely readable, it is my favorite. The glossary is useful, the commentary is brief, and the cover folds back for comfortable beach reading. This edition brings Shakespeare into focus as an intimate whose work and life and suffering are not in any way distant from ours. Given the genius of the work, this particular edition encourages an easier relationship because the book itself is so easy to use.(When no one's around, pull it out and read a speech or two aloud) An excellent any-occasion gift that will be used and appreciated, especially by students, because it is so very convenient!"},{"Title":"Collins Complete Works Of Shakespeare","review":"While the Harper-Collins edition is nicely laid out and a comfortable size, it is incorrectly called a &quot;complete&quot; collection. It is based on the 1951 Alexander text, which does not include either Edward III or The Two Noble Kinsmen. This edition contains the orthodox canon of yesteryear. With a limited selection of support material included, the reader will have to choose whether it's not worth spending the extra for a more comprehensive edition with expanded notes, glossary and supporting descriptions."},{"Title":"Collins Complete Works Of Shakespeare","review":"This is a very reputable one-volume Shakespeare book edited by the late professor Peter Alexander, chosen by the BBC as the basis for its major production of the complete Shakespearian plays. The book has an excellent introduction on William Shakespeare (who he was, his family, his writings & performance of his plays in his life time including the cast in some of his plays)! The book contains all his 36 Plays (catalogued) & 6 Poems (including all his Sonnets), appendix & glossary with 2 500 items (giving meaning to obsolete & difficult words and phrases). Footnote glossary would have been better than the glossary being at the back of the book! The book has been a \\"gold standard\\" since its first publication in 1951, a highly recommended reading."},{"Title":"Collins Complete Works Of Shakespeare","review":"Shakespeare requires no introduction -- he is \\"the Bard,\\" the most imposing playwright and storyteller in the English language. And \\"William Shakespeare: The Complete Works\\" brings together every one of his 39 plays, ranging from harrowing tragedies to airy little puffs of comedy -- and even the lesser plays are still brilliant.The plays basically are divided into comedies, histories and tragedies. The tragedies are pretty much... tragic, the comedies are not always funny but end semi-happily, and the histories... well, dramatizations of history.And everybody has heard of the greats here -- the Scottish lord who murders his way to kingship, young lovers divided by a feud, a Moorish general who is driven mad with jealousy, an elderly king whose arrogance rips his life apart, a very cleaned-up version of Henry VIII's split from his first wife, the goofy Prince Hal and his growth into a great king. There are feuding fairies, bickering lovers, romantic tangles, Julius Caesar's demise, gender-bending, an exiled duke/magician on his island, and the infamous \\"pound of flesh\\" bargain.But Shakespeare also wrote a bunch of lesser-known plays that often can't be so neatly categorized -- a rotten love affair during the siege of Troy, a Roman general attacking his own city, an Athenian gentleman embittered by humanity, Richard III's Machiavellian plot to become king, two sets of twins separated at birth, a corrupt judge obsessed with a lovely nun, Falstaff's doomed efforts to make money, and so on. Some of these (\\"Troilus and Cressida\\") aren't nearly as good as his \\"main\\" body of work, but they're still excellent.For all Shakespeare's plays, it's best to read them AFTER you've seen a good performance. Otherwise, it's like reading a movie script to a movie you haven't seen -- easy to get lost, and the dramatic effects aren't easy to connect to. But if you've seen performances of any/all of Shakespeare's plays, then his vibrant stories and poetry leap off the page.There are long eloquent speeches, puns, clever linguistic twists, and evocative language that soaks the play in atmosphere (\\"With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine/There sleeps Titania sometime of the night/Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight...\\"). In fact, his plays are diamond mines of quotations -- some are infamous (\\"To be or not to be\\") and some of which have floated into public knowledge without labels (\\"Cowards die many times before their deaths/The valiant never taste of death but once\\").And while some of his plays are basically fluff, he manages to weave in moral questions, criticism and explorations of the human soul. And his characters range as far as his plots -- kings and princes, teenage lovers, proud but doomed men, bratty queens, the witty but combative Beatrice and Benedick, and even the puppet-master mage Prospero.Shakespeare's \\"Complete Works\\" is a must-have for anyone who loves the English language -- his writing was unparalleled, and even his lesser plays are a cut above the rest."},{"Title":"Collins Complete Works Of Shakespeare","review":"I ordered this book for a Christmas present and just now ordered another one for another friend for a Christmas present as well, because of the excellent response in receiving the book (in two days!) also the packaging was wonderful and the condition of the book absolutely beautiful!!

She, her friends Tess and Trudy, and their mothers must travel hundreds of miles, with her fifteen year old brother to lead them, to the houses their fathers have already built on the frontier.

I believe that those who are supposed to come into our lives will do so by whatever means God intended. John's book, Taking Care of Dad was so profoundly affirming to me(I am my mother's caretaker)~ and my sisters are now reading it. I have also emailed all my caregiving friends encouraging them to own this book. John's tender way of relating his story of the 5 years during which he cared for his father with Parkinson's is heartwarming and encouraging. And John writes with a sense of humor that every caretaker will understand and relate to. One of my favorite stories is &quot;Good cop, bad cop.&quot; John also writes with great honesty even when it meant going out on a limb, sharing very personal family relationships and how they each play out in the caring of his father. No two caretaking situations are the same, but I feel certain that all caretakers will understand John's feelings, raw emotions, and intentions. Caretakers will find a &quot;spiritual&quot; connection with John. I surely have. I, almost daily, recommend this book to someone with whom I come in contact .... even strangers who I may notice are caretakers. This book is that good."},{"Title":"Taking Care of Dad","review":"John's book is a straight from the heart book.

They went to Mass every day of the week, even though the father, for some time, had no religion. This probably saved their lives. The act of leaving their house and getting fresh air did the job because, unknowingly, their furnace was leaking toxic carbon monoxide.One day, John's father was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. At first, the father did not have the proverbial \\"shakes\\". John appreciated the irony of Parkinson's being called a progressive disease even though the term \\"progress\\" implies improvement, not steady worsening.The author was prepared for the eventual death of his father, but was doubly shocked when his apparently healthy mother died suddenly instead from a heart attack. What to do with the father? He could not live alone. A permanent nursing home was not their answer. Caring for the father at home was difficult for John and his wife Gail.The Parkinson-afflicted father sometimes needed a wheelchair to move around, and at other times not. He had to receive medications several times a day. The father could sometimes make it to the washroom, and sometimes not. At night, he was incontinent. John felt the painful irony of changing the diaper for a father who had once played with him as a child. Other role reversals became obvious. At one time, the boy John had watched as his father unclogged a pipe. The boy John had watched his father choose the Christmas tree. Now it was John doing these things and the father watching.John successfully obtained an unpaid 3-month leave from his long-term job in order to have more time to care for his father. For a time, the father's condition seemed to stabilize. After the 3-month stint, John made the bold decision to quit his job so that his only full-time, permanent job would be to care for his dad.Still, John managed to have a form of a normal life. He found time for such things as travelling, long-distance running, writing, and watching his daughter ice skate.Then one day, John's father suddenly collapsed and apparently stopped breathing in the cold outdoors. But it was not yet his time. He resumed breathing.So John's dad had his good days and bad days. One day, John's dad fell and broke his hip. At another time, John's father stopped breathing again. At still another time, the father broke his nose.Then came the final, obvious decline, and the end. For some time, John found his caregiving habits hard to break.I know John B. Reynolds, the author. We both go to the same church. I knew beforehand that you do writing, and that you took English-literature classes at a local university, but I had never realized that your own writing was so good.

It is both a history of philosophy text, highlighting Dewey's thought and subsequent Pragmatist scholars, liberalism, and Confucianism, and a polemic about the limitations of liberal thought in China. Although some acquaintance with the texts interpreted by the authors is recommended, the authors' synopses are trustworthy and ably and judiciously given. There are also generous quotes and and a and a nine-page bibliography provided.Admittedly, I was skeptical about the authors' project, which seemed like a desperate attempt to bridge two subjects, pragmatism and Confucianism, that are both equally unprofitable, with a popular item in the news, China. I wanted an appealing interpretation of Confucianism, that would allow me to understand the cultural divide between east and west more easily. I was also interested in any study about pragmatism, which, as the authors also argue, deserves more respect. Last, I wanted a framework to understand Korean and western dialogue, since Korean interpretations of Confucianism are also relevant to Chinese reform historically, and are also a factor in Korea's relations with western countries. The book satisfied my demands more than satisfactorily.Some readers may be angered by the authors' use of Deweyan Pragmatism to criticize traditional liberalism, but the authors have good reason. Dewey did have a small role in Chinese educational reform before the Communist Party assumed control in 1949. Dewey, and pragmatism in general, are both better exemplars of distinct American realities than liberalism. Also, using pragmatic terms, the authors couch Confucian concepts in a way more palatable and approachable.The authors argue, that a Confucian interpretation of democracy is possible. This Confucian democracy is useful as a tool for political reform. And then, by using Deweyan thought, it is possible for Chinese and American reformers to share ideas for reform in both countries. The book, therefore, is ultimately a practical one.The authors eschew nationalistic and philosophical bias, which is necessary for productive dialogue. This is not a book that celebrates western values over eastern ones. It has relevance also in Korea, yet, ironically, it will not convince Americans of the need for reform in their own country, especially if readers refuse to abandon implicit faith in liberal thinking. This is not a book about dead things, but a very lively, well-written, timely offering.."},{"Title":"The Celtic realms (History of civilisation)","review":"I've had a few people recommend this book to me over the years, and finally sat down to read it when a friend brought it in to work for me. I went out and bought my own copy the next day.This is an excellent book and is surprisingly current, especially considering that it was first published nearly 40 years ago. Chadwick and Dillon were definitely ahead of their time. I may have been reluctant in the past to crack this book open due to the vast amount of chaff that I have tried to digest from several of their contemporaries.This book covers most of the topics in Celtica - prehistory, history, culture, language, kingdoms - with a heavy focus on the Celtic literature. Some great insights, definitely a useable research work.Doesn't say a whole lot about the Druids, but match this up with Ellis' &quot;Celtic Empire&quot;, &quot;The Celts&quot; and &quot;The Druids&quot;; Gregory's &quot;Complete Irish Mythology&quot;; Guest's &quot;The Mabinogion&quot;; and Hutton's &quot;Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles&quot;,and you have an excellent all-round introduction to the Celts in general and to the Druids in particular."},{"Title":"The Celtic realms (History of civilisation)","review":"Most of us are interested, to some extent, in history, and Celtic history captures the interest of a consistently increasing number of us. There's so much wonder, beautiful visual and literary art, and mystery to the ancient Celts.But amid the work published on the Celts, there is much that is superficial or based on inaccurate traditions (too often English traditions misinterpreting true Celtic realities). I've found some of the latter, as well as some much better sources, and this ranks as the best among them. The scholarly research that went into this book is very strongly apparent; it is as deep as it needs to be. But it is surprisingly accessible as well. The writers know how to speak good, understandable language rather than Academese. Also present is a large amount of actual material. Many similar volumes only present the ideas and conclusions of the writers, while not bothering to provide the reader with much source material. Here, though, you'll find some excellent pictures, fine paraphrases of many Celtic stories, and even a good selection of actual Celtic words, poetry and inscription in the original language, as well as translation. Other writers give us precious few actual Old Welsh and Old Irish words, but these authors realize that most of us will never have easy access to the old texts.All in all, as a lay reader, if you want intelligent research which gives you a fair amount of familiarity with important ancient mechanisms like art, language and poetry styles, with a fine record of the important points of history, you'll be hard-pressed to find it in a more accessible form. I'd number this among my ten most important books."},{"Title":"The Celtic realms (History of civilisation)","review":"This Dillon and Chadwick masterwork was first printed in 1967 and still stands as a significant work. Some writers of books on the Celts that have been printed over the past twenty years would have benefited if they had consulted this book.Its discussions of the origins of the Celts are fair-minded and the authors do not rush the reader to conclusions that cannot be with our present state of knowledge and were somewhat ahead of their time in pushing back the origins of the Celtic period further than what is usually presented in other works.For the beginner it is not always an easy read but it is still approachable and the determined beginner would do well in reading this book as their first introduction to the history of the Celts.The author's use of the Celtic bardic texts is commendable for they introduce the information they contain yet minimize them as far as being a reliable source of fact and history.Explored are accounts of the Celts by the Classical world as well as a discussion of the first traces of the Celtic language. Social and religious aspects of the early Celts are also touched on.Most of the book concentrates on the historical Celts of the British Isles. Their study of the religion, art and literature of the Celts of the British Isles is masterful.A good companion to this book is Barry Cunliffe's \\"The Ancient Celts.\\""},{"Title":"The Celtic realms (History of civilisation)","review":"This book is a scholarly account of the history and culture of the Celts, from the earliest archeological evidence in the iron-age Hallstatt culture circa 800 BCE, To the Norman invasion of Britain under William the Conqueror in 1066. The authors discuss the mysterious origins of the Celts using place-names as a guiding demographic to trace their principle routes of migration and their established settlements. The book then goes on further to discuss the formation, structure and the bodies of independent Celtic kingdoms, of Gaul, Britain, Wales, Brittany, Ireland, Scotland, Cornwall and the Isle of Man. Of particular interest is the changing and reforming political and social change which occurred in Britain following the withdrawal of Roman governance C. 4-500 CE. The fifth chapter on Irish secular institutions gives an interesting account of a Gaelic society, its inherited laws, the class based structure, customs and dress, festivals, and the organization of time. All of this is done in comparison with the Welsh system, but interestingly draws many parallels with Indo-European culture, particularly the Vedic and Hindu codes of law.The 6th chapter outlines the structure and organization of the early modern Celtic kingdoms, providing information on the Pictish tribes and the Dal Riata, Irish incursions and influence in Scotland, the development of the Celtic Welsh and their relations with the Saxons, and overall the influence of the Viking and Nordic raids and settlements throughout the Western Gaelic communities. This period history spans from the 5-6th CE to the late 9th, leading up to the invasion of the Normans at Hastings in 1066. The remaining chapters examine Celtic culture from the perspective of literature, myths, language, religion and art.I chose this book because I wanted a broad but academic and scholarly account of Celtic history, its formation, structure, people and culture. This volume fulfills all of those criteria, but it was certainly not a \`casual' read, indeed it took me several weeks to digest and may properly be used as a reference and source of information rather than leisurely perusal. Both authors are renowned and respected academics, Myles Dillon having been the senior professor at the Dublin Institute, and professor of Celtic studies at Wisconsin, Chicago, and Edinburgh universities. Nora Chadwick is a veteran lecturer at Cambridge University and Newham and Girton Colleges. Celtic Realms is written with an absolutely serious attention to detail, woven together and cross-referenced in the true tradition of Celtic knot-work, and is perhaps the result of several years dedicated study and research. It belongs in the library of any reader with more than a passing interest in Celtic history, and itself provides a student with valuable resources.What I enjoyed most about this book were the accounts of literature and arts, where the authors bring the voice and actions of the Celtic people to life. The study of any history can be susceptible to a dry and flaky recount, yet Dillon and Chadwick have cleverly avoided such a downslide by depicting the passion, ingenuity, creativity, artistic beauty and linguistic enchantments of individuals who lived so many years ago."},{"Title":"Leonard Feather's 200 Omnibus of Jazz: Prestige Jazz Fake Book - 200 of the World's Greatest Jazz Themes","review":"Prestige Records Fake Book - 200 tunes recorded for Prestige Records from the late 1940's-early 1960's - 20 apiece from Miles Davis, Sonny Rollins, and Gene Ammons also some by John Coltrane, Donald Byrd, Yusef Lateef, Coleman Hawkins, Kenny Burrell, Shirley Scott, and Tommy Flanagan.

Who wants to read a book with a glossary in the back??? Manolo is the son of the greatest matodor in spain who was gored during a bullfight. Now everyone in Spain wants Manolo to be a bull fighter (come on peeps the kid is like 10 and there teaching him to fight bulls? Thats kinda violent isn't it?) Manolo dosn't have an ounce of courage (I guess you would say that he's a \\"pretty boy\\") he dosn't want to fight the bull. On the day of his bull fight he gives the bull to some one who really deserves to fight. I don't think some one should write a children's book on bullfighting because it is a violent sport it is full of blood and death that shouldn't be tought to children."},{"Title":"Shadow of a Bull","review":"Shadow of a Bull is a Newbery winning book written by Maia Wojciechowska.It's about a boy, Manolo Olivar, son of Juan Olivar, the best bullfighter in Spain. But, Manolo is afraid of bulls; he thinks bullfighting is cruel to bulls. Manolo has to fight his first bull at eleven. Everybody expects him to be as good a bullfighter as Juan Olivar, but Manolo's a coward, and he knows it.This book contains many Spanish bullfighting terms. This story is well written and always fascinating and interesting. This book often makes you think what you would do if you were Manolo and in his circumstances. When it is time for Manolo to fight his first bull, it is exciting, gripping, and intense.Overall, this is a wonderful book and I give it four-and-a-half stars."},{"Title":"Shadow of a Bull","review":"Book Review: Shadow of a BullDo you think you would have enough courage to fight in a bullfight? Well, Manolo did. Manolo's father was one of the greatest bullfighters to ever walk the face of the Earth, and everyone expected Manolo to be the same. However, Manolo could not perform anywhere near his father's standards, and often wished he did not have to live up to those expectations. When he saw his first bullfight Manolo started to enjoy bullfighting more, and realized he could be as good as father. He practiced every day and got better, and better. Finally, he fought in his first bullfight. He did very well with the cape, but did not perform as well in his other competitions. Then an old man gave Manolo the choice to either become a doctor or a bullfighter. This was a very difficult choice for Manolo to make.I guess you will have to read the book to find out what he chose.In my opinion, Shadow of a Bull was a good book for several reasons. First of all, it was a quick easy reader. Second of all, I think that the author did a wonderful job describing the bullfight and the Spanish culture. The reader feels like he is at the bullfights cheering on Manolo. Next, I think that many people have faced intimidating challenges similar to the Manolo's. This makes it easy to sympathize with Manolo throughout the book. Finally, in addition to being a book about Spanish culture and bullfighting, Shadow of a Bull is a fable. The lesson to be learned from this book is that hard work pays off and that working hard is the only way to achieve goals. That is a very important lesson to learn in life. I would recommend this book."},{"Title":"Shadow of a Bull","review":"Shadow of a Bull is a book about a boy named Manolo Olivar who is forced by the people of Arcangel to follow his father's path as a bullfighter. Everyone in the town of Arcangel expected him to fight a bull at the age of 12, just like his father had. He believed that he couldn't overcome his fear of the fight, and that he could not find the courage and strength to fight his first bull. His friend named Juan Garcia always went to the pastures to cape wild bulls(do passes with them). Manolo asked him if he could come and watch him cape the bulls. At first, Juan was hesitant and refused to take Manolo with him, but, after convincing Juan, they decided to meet a few days later to go to the pastures. Manolo got to see how Juan put his bravery and strength to test. He felt that he might be ready to fight his first bull. Manolo wanted to show the people how good Juan was at fighting bulls so he asked the Count if he could cape some cows after Manolo was done with his bull. The Count agreed and said he could cape the cows, but that he couldn't help Manolo with his bull. During Manolo's fight with the bull he said that he did not want to be a bullfighter and said that this was Juan's bull. So Juan started fighting the pull and did some magnificent passes. The crowd shouted \\"Ole!\\" and Juan had tears in his eyes. Manolo had given up what he was destined to do and had given that opportunity to Juan who pleased the crowd much more than Manolo could have done.I enjoyed this book because it was fun to hear about the gorings of the bull fighters. Manolo was always scared to be gored by one of those big, sharp, bull horns. \\"In Spain, however, people have found a way of cheating death. They summon it to appear in the afternoon in the bull ring,and they make it face a man. Death-a fighting bull with horns as weapons-is killed by a bullfighter. And the people are there watching death being cheated of its right.\\" Manolo feared death. He was not sure if he could cheat it like others could in the ring. I also would be scared if I had to fight a half-ton bull.I also disliked this book because it was very boring in the first half. I would suggest this book to people that enjoy having a sad, but interesting ending. It would be enjoyable to read about how the bullfighters fought if the reader likes to hear about how animals can be killed with no chance to escape. I found it upsetting to read about how animals are cruelly tortured just for the entertainment of a crowd.My favorite part of the book was when the doctor was showing Manolo the gore wound from a bull. It was very descriptive and explained very well how the wound looked. It seemed a little bit of fairness that bullfighters had been injured by the bull because humans usually injure them.This book is great for young readers and adolescent readers(grades 4-7) and even older. This book is one of the best I have read. I recommend it to readers who want to learn about another culture or who want to find out more about bullfighting."},{"Title":"Shadow of a Bull","review":"We've all done things we didn't want to do just to make other people happy. In the book, Shadow of a Bull by Maia Wojiechowska, a young boy named Manolo Oliver has a dream of becoming a doctor, but that dream is quickly shattered when his hometown of Arcangel, Spain, look to him to bring the spirit of bullfighting back to the small town since the death of his father. Six men, friends of his father's, take Manolo to many bullfights and teach him everything there is to know about the sport. Manolo knows what the whole town wants from him. He just doesn't know if he is capable to give it to them. But in the end, his dream comes true in a way that pleases both him and the town when he becomes the doctor he wanted to be. The suspense and drama you feel while reading this book is all due to the great descriptions that Maia Wojiechowska uses. She describes the pressure that Manolo feels of following in his father's footsteps.

Secretly Manolo wanted to be doctor. When Manolo went to see the doctor, he said he could help around the clinic. When Manolo was forced to fight the bull, he did well at the begining of the fight but, when it came time for the bull to be killed, Manolo choked and couldn't do it.

When Manolo's father is killed in the ring, the people look to Manolo to become the man his father was. Manolo does not want to be a bullfighter. But he does not want to disappoint his mother and his father's friends and all the people of his town. He is afraid, paradoxically, of both the bull and of being a coward. He can find no way out.The author is somehow able to share with the reader the beauty and the horror of bullfighting. I was surprised to find that I could see bullfighting in a new way, as an art, as a heroic act, though I continue to feel revulsion as well."},{"Title":"Shadow of a Bull","review":"A cultural history lesson about Spain disguised as a story, but a good story nonetheless. Manolo Olivar looks just like his father, a famous bullfighter killed when Manolo was small. Everyone in the Andalusian town of Arcangel just knows Manolo is destined to be a great bullfighter like his father. Everyone, that is, except Manolo himself. When taken to his first bullfight at age nine, young Manolo sympathized with the bull rather than with the man facing the danger (\\"He wanted to cry out for the bull and his pain\\"). Now, nervously facing his first fight as a matador, Manolo prays to the Virgin Mary not for his own safety, but for the animal's: \\"Please don't let them make me kill the bull.\\"He is no coward; he simply lacks afici&oacute;n, defined by the author as \\"intense love for bullfighting.\\" This boy is not destined to be a killer, but a healer. After facing down his fears, and finally deciding to speak up for himself, Manolo announces that instead of becoming a bullfighter, he will study to be a doctor.We never learn much about Manolo besides his feelings about bullfighting. The author does not describe his home, mother, siblings, or school, though we know he has them all. Manolo is a merely the blank slate upon which is inscribed a verbal portrait of Spanish bullfighting culture. And yet the simple story does not get lost -- this boy on the verge of manhood must prove himself to be physically and morally courageous, or suffer social humiliation.On every page there are specialized Spanish words pertaining to bullfighting; a useful glossary at the end defines these terms and gives a pronunciation key. This book would be most appreciated by young male readers who will someday enjoy reading Ernest Hemingway, especially Death in the Afternoon and For Whom the Bell Tolls. No illustrations."},{"Title":"Shadow of a Bull","review":"When a boy, Manolo Olivar, is born, all the people of Archangel expect him to become a great bullfighter like his father, Juan Olivar.

Overall, a wonderful story :)"},{"Title":"Shadow of a Bull","review":"Shadow of a Bull demonstrates the need for young people to follow their own dreams rather than the dreams placed on them by parents or other adults.This has been a favorite of mine for many years.--Marge"},{"Title":"Shadow of a Bull","review":"Spain's ancient fascination with bulls can be seen in the Celtiberian bull sculptures in Guisando, Avila, which are thought to be made in the second century BCE. Practiced by many ancient cultures, bullfighting became an integral part of Iberian culture, and was immortalized to Western audiences by Ernest Hemingway (Death in the AfternoonandThe DANGEROUS SUMMER).Polish author Maia Wojciechowska held numerous fascinating jobs including an undercover detective, a motorcycle racer, a translator for Radio Free Europe, and finally, as a female bullfighter, and Hemingway said that Maia knew more about bullfighting than any other woman, so she is amply qualified to take on the immense task of making Spain's bullfighting culture and history accessible to a younger audience.In Shadow of a Bull, originally written in 1964, Manolo Olivar is the young son of the famous torero Juan Olivar, who was fatally gored by a bull. Juan was the most famous matador in Spain, bringing glory to the small town of Arcangel, and now everyone expects Manolo to fill his shoes by becoming an equally talented bullfighter. The book has aged well, and minus any references to computers or cell phones, could take place today.Except Manolo has a major problem: he's a coward and hates the very idea of bullfights. This would actually be funny, if it wasn't such a serious matter in 1960s Spain. A man's honor was of utmost importance, and to be labeled a coward when you're the son of Spain's most famous matador...Manolo secretly wishes to study medicine, but is forced into digesting hours of bullfighting history and technique and practicing bullfighting moves with young bulls in secret (it's illegal to practice on bulls before they enter the ring for the first time). He's so traumatized by this that he wakes up screaming at night, but he knows that he can't disappoint the entire town by bowing out of his first corrida.Shadow of a Bull is about bullfighting; not the gore, perhaps, but the skill, the delicate moves of a talented matador, the history behind its traditions and the large role it plays in traditional Spanish culture. Wojciechowska makes these numerous small details fly by without becoming bogged down in technicalities or minutia, even for someone like myself who has no experience with bullfighting (as a vegetarian, I refused to attend bullfights, either in person or televised, the two times I lived in Spain). A glossary of bullfighting terms is also included as a handy reference, and the text has a sprinkling of Spanish expressions.Manolo's story is a common enough one of an adolescent struggling to find his place, to live up to his father's reputation, and to discover his path. He is a likeable enough protagonist, although more aggressive boys who read this will likely label him a sissy (or worse).More importantly, Shadow of a Bull is a priceless travelogue on 1960s Andalucia, of the quirks of small-town life in rural Southern Spain (the endless gossiping of old men who do everything together), of flamenco and fiestas and dry, hot summers punctuated by bullfights. This was still the period when Franco ruled Spain with an iron fist, and the town's poverty is a testament to those lean years (for maximum historical value, read Shadow of a Bull at the same time as James Michener'sIberia, also written in the 1960s, for a comprehensive overview of life in Spain under Franco).Fans of bullfighting and Spain will enjoy this book, although it is more about the moves and pomp and circumstance rather than action inside the bullring. Wojciechowska draws a riveting portrait of a typical Andalucian town captured in time, and of one boy's struggle with who he is expected to be and who he is that still speaks to modern readers."},{"Title":"Meaner Than the Meanest","review":"My 3 year old daughter has had this book for about a year and it has become a favorite. I never get tired of reading it to her unlike some of the other books we have. The story is about a witch who wants to create the meanest most hideous creature ever. Unfortunatly for the witch she forgets a key ingredient and ends up with Daisy, the cutest, sweetest girl in the whole. No matter how the witch tries to turn Daisy into the mean creature she desires, Daisy finds a way to make the situation better and remain true to the sweet girl that she is. How Daisy transforms Hiss the cat into Mr. Fluffy is particularily funny. The ending of the book is very sweet and I think the book carries a great underlying message. Keeping a positive attidue and a smile on your face can turn even terrible situations around. Looking on the brighter side of things is a great way to go through life. The witch theme makes it perfect for Halloween but the story is so great that you will want to read it year round."},{"Title":"Meaner Than the Meanest","review":"I'm not generally a fan of children's books (even when I was one), but this was a satisfying read because it was witty and original, and communicated a positive message without pandering. As children become ever more media savvy, it's hard to strike a balance between saying something meaningful and just plain having fun. Kids will experience the latter and appreciate the former. Be nicer than nice and add this to the library of a child in your life."},{"Title":"Meaner Than the Meanest","review":"This is a terrific story with great illustrations.

A must read!"},{"Title":"The Dillinger Days.","review":"If this were 1963, I'd advise you to buy this book. However, it's 2007, and while John Toland did an admirable job researching his material and visiting the various sites made notorious by the public enemies whose exploits he depicted, the fact is that much of the book's contents is old news and simply inaccurate. A fantastic read at the time, but, simply, outdated today."},{"Title":"The Dillinger Days.","review":"When first published in 1963, Toland's The Dillinger Days seemed to be the definitive work on the public enemy era, as both a biography of John Dillinger and as a sweeping chronicle of the whole Midwest Depression crime wave, also including &quot;Pretty Boy&quot; Floyd, &quot;Baby Face&quot; Nelson, the Barker-Karpis gang, &quot;Machine Gun&quot; Kelly and Clyde Barrow. Indeed, Toland may even be credited with launching a revival of interest in the Barrow gang. The scattered passages on the Barrows, whose fleeting fame was largely forgotten outside Texas by 1963, was largely the inspiration for the later movie Bonnie and Clyde. Toland's main subject here was of course Dillinger and the sections on the other gangs are scantier and often erroneous. Errors also appear in the Dillinger chapters. The &quot;second Dillinger gang&quot; was really &quot;Baby Face&quot; Nelson's, which Dillinger joined after the Crown Point escape, the exact details of which will never be known with full certainty though subsequent research--by Girardin and Helmer, Joe Pinkston and others--indicates that Toland got it wrong. The &quot;Dillinger&quot; letter to Henry Ford was long ago proven a forgery. As a straight Dillinger biography, Toland's book is actually far less detailed and accurate than the slimmer work, nearly contemporary with his own, Dillinger: A Short and Violent Life by Robert Cromie and Joe Pinkston. Still, as a history of the Depression crime wave, it was about the best volume available in 1963. Subsequent research has turned up much new information in recent years. Other authors have corrected Toland's errors. But the fact remains that Toland's work inspired a great deal of this research. Many of us gangster buffs got our start with Toland's book, so a lot of the new information available today probably wouldn't have surfaced without it. And for all its flaws, Toland's book remains a useful starting point for anyone interested in the gangster era--the Dillinger days."},{"Title":"The Dillinger Days.","review":"I can't comment on the veracity of Tolands account, so this review deals with the book's impact on someone reading about the 30's American Gangster era for the first time. The book is fast &amp; furious. It has a style &amp; pace that seems totally in sync' with the wild events &amp; full-blooded characters involved. Dillinger &amp; Company come alive here. The accounts were thrilling, detailed &amp; totally enjoyable. Although the author is commendably non-judgemental, not unsurprisingly, Dillinger comes over as the Class-Act of the the mobs. Whilst he certanly had a style, I use the word &quot;class&quot; with some reservation! The rest were just out &amp; out villians! I was pleased to see the lawmen get a fair share of the action. The dedication &amp; bravery of these men is in the most part commendable &amp; a credit to their profession. The thought of facing up to a gang, including such vicious characters as Baby Face Nelson &amp; Homer Van Meter, armed to the teeth with automatic weapons, is chilling indeed. The bank escapes give the reader a good feel of the times. It seemed that a five minute chase from any city centre bank would find the fugitives deep inside a maze of unmade roads. An almost total lack of communication between law enforcers, plus State Line jusridiction restrictions made the already fraught pursuit of these characters difficult indeed. I thoroughly enjoyed the book &amp; recommend it very highly. I also agree that it is a good &quot;appetite whetter&quot; for more books of similar genre."},{"Title":"The Dillinger Days.","review":"I give &quot;The Dillinger Days&quot; by John Toland 3-Stars for research and photography. Although this book is not the most accurate, it does display information that was available at the time of this publication. Today we have a better factual picture on events of the Dillinger era. Over the years many have bred mythology, speading fictitious imaginary stories creating false beliefs. However, I have to agree with historian and author Rick Mattix, The Dillinger Days is a good starting point for first time Dillinger readers. Good Book!"},{"Title":"The Dillinger Days.","review":"In the late sixties, when the popularity of &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot; at the box office ushered in a renewed interest in the period, this book was a compelling, concise account of a period when some of history's most ruthless criminals became cult heroes. From Machine Gun Kelley and John Dillinger to the Barrows and Pretty Boy Floyd, the Depression spawned its own brand of anti-heroes, placing them forever in a crude infamy of greed and murder. Toland is an excellent storyteller of the War era and plies his trade to new levels in this book. A highly recommended read to anyone interested in the period or exploits of some of American history's criminal element."},{"Title":"The Dillinger Days.","review":"This fast-paced narrative looks at underworld life in the USA during the Great Depression of the 1930's, when bank robbers were considered folk heroes by a surprising number of persons. It's primarily the story of John Dillinger and his gang, known for prison breaks and bank holdups. Dillinger was an anti-hero and celebrity (he played the role to the hilt) as were certain other criminals of that era such as Bonnie and Clyde, Baby Face Nelson and Pretty Boy Floyd. Readers get a feel for the criminals, the top FBI personnel on their trails, and for life during the hard times of the Depression. Alas, many came to a violent end, suffering the same fate as some of their victims.Author/Historian John Toland (1912-2004) had a way with gripping prose, and this effort is no exception. Some attack this book for glamorizing vicious criminals, while others point to a handful of inaccuracies. Whatever your take, this book still makes very interesting reading."},{"Title":"The Dillinger Days.","review":"I already have plenty of Dillinger books decided to get this anyways. Best decision I could of ever made on a book. This is kind of like public enemies if you've read that but way better, easier read, more info and more accurate information. I've been trying to find a book on the Karpis-Barker gang and so far this is the best I've seen. Although I am confused now because all the books I've read said Ma Barker was a sweet old lady that new nothing of their criminal lives. This book is totally the opposite saying she mastermind alot of the bank jobs and even got her hands dirty in killing her ex- husband (I think thats what he was) Dunlope. So know I gotta figure it out myself."},{"Title":"The Dillinger Days.","review":"All of John Toland's histories enthrall the reader, with a kind of \\" you are there\\" feeling. The Dillinger Days puts you right there with John Dillinger, Bonnie & Clyde, Ma Barker... It is at once entertaining and highly enlightening. EXCELLENT !"},{"Title":"The Dillinger Days.","review":"John was pretty much on the money in dexcribing that this is not a book entirely about Dillinger but about the crime wave that hit the Midwest in the mid 30's and the various gangsters that were a part of it. My complaint about the book is that it read more as a travel log or calendar of events of the various gangs exploits, ie Dillinger and company went there, robbed bank, went here to hide out. It does not in any detail investigate the personal motivations of each of the gangsters or the people that helped and sympathized with them or the social situation in the country that helped spawn them. In other words, its not a very deep book. If you are looking for a timeline or an introduction to the events that made up this period in US history, its ok. If you want to understand why it occured, look elsewhere."},{"Title":"The Dillinger Days.","review":"John Toland is probably best-known for his military histories, particularly those dealing with World War II. He is often praised for his narrative style, but has been criticized for his occasional lapses in historical rigor. Both commentaries apply to The Dillinger Days. Though it primarily deals with John Dillinger, this book encompasses all of the major figures of the Depression-era crime wave, including Bonnie and Clyde, Baby Face Nelson, Pretty Boy Floyd, and the Barker gang, among many others. Toland gives more than adequate background on all of the major players and their various associates, and does an excellent job of keeping the reader from getting confused by the large and revolving cast of characters. He also is on point when it comes to humanizing his subjects without excusing their crimes. This book is a great starting point for any reader who wishes to learn more about these colorful criminals and the ear they helped define."},{"Title":"The Dillinger Days.","review":"This is an earlier work by John Toland about the gangsters of the early Depression period such as Dillinger and Bonnie and Clyde. Surprisingly for Toland, who military histories have been well reviewed, this book seems to fail both as a history and a narrative. It seems jumbled and meanders at times. There are other good histories of this period and I so I wouldn't recommend this book for the casual non-fiction reader."},{"Title":"Malay magic;: Being an introduction to the folklore and popular religion of the Malay Peninsula","review":"Malaysia, despite being a modern \\"Islamic\\" country and its stated \\"official\\" religion being Islam, is by and large steeped in acute superstitions and common folklore believe in the supernatural...strange as these may seem! Don't pretend for a minute that the native (Malay) folks are really dedicated to their acquired official religion called Islam as belief in supernatural force is very common and practiced throughout the countryside. I often see native people, when they are ill or enraged with revenge, to seek the services of a bomoh or medicine man which practices black witchcraft, casting spells and curses or taking out both! Even the Western-educated Malay still subscribes to the belief in black magic (or voodoo). Some Malay girls when their boy friends leave them would seek the help of a local bomoh to cast a spell on their oppositie sex just to get even! However, such revengeful black magic would work or not to work depending on the effectiveness of the bomoh in question. Sometimes the bomoh would engage to fight back with another bomoh and try to cast a spell on him or her in which their client's requests have been neutralized...! I have seen all these black magic wars when in Malaysia. Even ambitious and corrupted politicians seek the services of these bomohs to make them popular and hide their corruptions from the public, as evidence today in the State of Sarawak! Thus the writer of this book comes into usefulness to those who are currently going research in Malay magic in Malaysia today and even though the book was written a long time ago, its findings have still relevance in today's Malaysia which is seething with political and racial polarization and jealousies among its politicians to unseat one another via black magic...!I, a former Malaysian, is buying this book in order to learn more about the current superstition and black magic rivalries among the politicians and bureaucrates so that their bad deeds and especially corruption are not revealed by rivalers and archenemies...! Remember: those who do bad deeds will somehow be made known in time to come...hence, do not do evil and seek no evil...! I highly recommend this interesting book in Malay Magic to all who are interested to understand the nature of the Malay man's and woman's dark nature...Cheers!"},{"Title":"Aurora Leigh","review":"Having been brought up on the notion that Elizabeth Barrett Browning was the slighter and less-talented adjunct poet of her husband Robert, I was pleased to find I was wrong.She's terrific.This is a brilliant work, full of dazzling poetry and insights.It's loaded with allusions and references (I read the Penguin edition; and the notes there run for many, many pages--and these barely skim the surface), but it is remarkably accessible and fun.This is a work full of wisdom and unusual perspectives. Luminous and grand and down-to-earth all at once. Imagine Jane Eyre written by Shakespeare.It's an education in Victorian (upper-middle-class) England, and also the Victorian English infatuation with Italy. It's also a biting and incisive feminist portrait, full of rebellion and self-discovery.I strongly recommend it to anyone who likes poetry, or Victorian novels."},{"Title":"Aurora Leigh","review":"E.B.B. set out to outstrip Milton and does so in an amazingly original way.

Isaac Asimov is not a Christian and approaches this subject with an even hand and a balanced manner.

He describes large rock and small rock, fractured rock and what makes it (most are found broken and lying on the ground due subsurface pressures that cause joints), the colors of rock, cliffs, mesas and buttes, canyons, arroyos, washes, and gullies, monuments, etc.On one hand Stokes has not written a book with much depth to it. A \\"Geology for Dummies\\" book would have far more depth.

I, along with many others, was forced to keep a chart about the different characters for the first half of the book or so, in order to piece it all together. By the middle, though, the characters have fallen into place. Although there are still elements of non-linearity, the story is nicely told, and the ending and the climax are both well done. The plot and setting are nice, the conflicts are realistic and valuable for the story, and the whole, developing as it does, in an organic fashion, is well worth reading. I will probably read it again at some point, which makes it a particularly pleasurable Vine pick.A. PlotThe plot of the book centers on one of the main characters, Jonah. As a small boy, Jonah is loathed by his mother, and mauled by his dog. It's fairly obvious that Jonah is not well-liked by his classmates, either. A neglected, disliked individual, Jonah is not really close to anyone. He has little family, with the exception of his mother who may or may not have committed suicide. After her funeral, he becomes curious about his family history, and he finds surprising connections with other individuals.Troy, the other main character in the book, has a large number of family members, most of whom have disappointed him, or he has disappointed. Jonah and Troy, in a lot of ways, can be considered opposites. Troy is not interested in socializing, he wants only contact with his son. Troy spends much of his life around drugs and alcohol, and is caught with a large amount of drugs, losing his only child, Loomis.When Jonah begins working at the same bar as Troy, they begin to get to know one another, and become friends. This is the beginning of a whole new spell of trouble for Troy.B. CharacterThere are only a few characters of consequence in the story. Jonah, Troy, Loomis, Nora, and Ray are the most important of these. The connections between them and their relationships are revealed through the course of the story, so I won't spoil them here the way that other readers have. It is enough to say that the characters are compelling, they are rounded, and they are humans. There are other, ancillary characters, that are less well developed, but there aren't any characters in the the book that are a complete waste. They all seem like people.The characters, as a whole, present an interesting dichotomy. They purport to answer a question that the author puts forth: How much of a role does fate play in the shaping of our lives? How much is due to our own choices? How much choice do we actually have? And the characters run the gamut of answers. Some, such as Jonah, seem to be entirely the product of their environment and their lives. Others, such as Loomis and Ray, seem not to and seem to wrest control of their own lives, for better or for worse.C. SettingThe novel is appropriately set in the middle nowhere of Kansas. The setting is supposed to be in the background in this novel. The main focus is supposed to be on the characters, not the setting. It was an appropriate choice, as the small town feel suggests, strongly, the feelings of hopelessness that most of the characters feel.On a smaller scale, the settings of Troy's home, the Mother Glass center, the bar, and Jonah's home equally convey these feelings. Hopelessness, pointlessness, and fatigue are the predominant feelings that the book brings out by way of these settings, which is appropriate for the context and the themes.D. ThemeThe theme of the book is the role that choice and fate play in the shaping of our lives. All of the characters are dealt bad hands to start with and have to choose how to play them. The different characters handle their options with more or less maturity, resulting in greater or lesser freedom in their later lives. While many have said that there doesn't seem to be much uplifting in this book, I would tend to disagree. The message that I got was, \\"If you struggle, and you try, and you don't make it worse, you might just make it out of where you started.\\" Of course, the characters who gave this impression the most strongly were on the cusp of success when the book ended. It could all have gone down in flames from there. Overall, though, the themes of redemption and of tribulation were strong and well developed. Desperation, hopelessness, and sorrow are the main feelings of the characters, but on occasions we get a glimpse of hope from one of them. THe feeling that maybe they will make it out of this.E. Point of ViewWhile the story leaps around in time and perspective, the constant usage of the third person omniscient point of view, along with the dates conveniently provided at the top of each chapter, allow the chronology to remain clear and consistent. This was a welcome change from similar novels where the reader is left to piece this together on their own.F. AestheticsThe aesthetics of this novel are, to put it simply, not well developed. While may readers complained about the wordiness of the story, I didn't find this to be the case. The sentences were not particularly verbose and were never longer than I assume Mr. Chaon found necessary to get the point across. The words chosen were not particularly flowery, but they were well chosen. Aesthetically, the book was successful, in my eyes.Conclusion:The book is not as hopeful as some may have wanted it to be, but that doesn't mean that it was as hopeless as they condemned it as. I think that the message that Mr. Chaon was attempting to get across WAS hopeful. Per se, I think that he is telling us that, if we try, if we act, if we desire, we can overcome the ground in which our seed is planted and surpass the expectations that others have of us, and even those that we have of ourselves. Ultimately, the book speaks of redemption, but only after a period of tribulation that is a result of our beginnings. It was beautifully told, and I enjoyed it. Anyone else who enjoys the same theme of will vs. predestination, nature vs. nurture, and an examination of who we become and why, will find those issues addressed in the penumbra of Mr. Chaon's work. Well crafted.B-Harkius"},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"This book was unique to me, as far as Chaon's writing style is concerned. Composed of countless vignettes that bounced all over the place as to timelines, it was sometimes hard to follow. His top ability at short stories shines thru in this novel; each one is a tiny novella that seemed written with ease on it's own. His detail at character descriptions was enjoyable and certain ones held their own in this book. I read this while in the hospital and even with the countless interruptions, you could go back and move on with the story.I don't think his characters were depressing, as they seemed to be of people I know and followed real life situations. Because of the way this is written, I can understand why people either love it or hate it. I liked it. Can't help but wonder if he will be able to break free of the short story settings, perhaps in his next book. For a first novel, it's impressive."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"I thought overall this was a good book. The characters are very well-written, to the point where you can really visualize things in your head while reading it. Where the book lost me a little is all the jumping back and forth, I'm not good with that. I get confused in my head and I have to remember okay which character was doing what when I come back to that part of the story.It's not all rainbows and unicorns, the themes of the book are dark and depressing at times, but it's an interesting story to read."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"I hate to give a bad review on a book I didn't finish, but I simply was unable to get interested in this book. I tried several times. First, I don't care for the way the author phrases things - I found him excessively descriptive. For me, it felt like he was trying to fill space by overdoing it. Then, he jumped around quite disjointedly - a technique I usually enjoy, actually, but again, it just didn't work for me the way Chaon did it. I very much liked the premise of the novel, so I am going to try yet again, and if I can get past his style enough to get into the story, I will edit this review accordingly. Maybe it will grow on me. I doubt this review is particularly helpful, but as a Vine participant, I needed to write it as part of my agreement with Amazon."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"Although the writing is striking in places, I couldn't get into this book or the characters. when I tried to read it for the second time, I realized that I had purchased it before several years ago and was unable to finish it then. Not a feel-good novel."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"Wow - over FOUR YEARS since there's been a post or review. On the off chance you might actually read this - Dan! Where are you? You're one of my favorite writers and I sure would like to see more from you. I trust you're well but I look forward to your next project."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"This book is alright. It's just alright. It could be better, but it could be worse.The timing is a bit haphazard; we are taken forward and backwards and forwards again. There is a chapter that gets cut off (I think it's okay to mention this, since it does not seem to be an ARC). There is a lengthy passage near the beginning that repeats itself pretty much exactly at the end. Where I have seen this before, the intent seemed clear and we knew what was going on. Here, it felt as if maybe (considering the cut-off chapter mentioned earlier) there was a mistake.The story focuses on three different main characters, and shares perspectives from these three and then from a few more characters. There is a drug dealer on house arrest, a heavily scarred man who is most likely his brother, and their troubled mother. The characters are morose, and no one actually appears to move on or grow much. I think maybe I was supposed to feel sympathy for the scarred brother...but he was an unlikable character in general.Reading this will not bring you to any overwhelming epiphanies. Not reading it won't be much of a triumph either."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"This book reminded me a lot of The Book of Ruth by Jane Hamilton, probably because they both take place in small towns, and they're both pretty depressing and about dysfunctional families. This book jumps back and forth in time, showing how the various characters are related (literally) and Chaon does a good job of bringing together the various storylines into an interesting, if not altogether unpredictable, denouement."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"Normally I enjoy stories that switch between characters or jump around in time, but this was done poorly in my opinion. The first part of the book jumped around so much between years and characters that by the time the author started writing in chronological order I had no attachment to the characters and didn't really care what happened to them because I was just starting to get over my confusion with the story."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"I really enjoyed this book. Very introspective. A bit dull at times, but very worthy read."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"Some people can write stories, some novels, rarely both. Dan Chaon is one of those talented few who can. I came to know of this book after reading his amazing collection, Among the Missing, after reading about it in an essay collection on fiction writing.This book is VERY disturbing because the main character is so disturbed. You will be queasy while reading it, it will give you the creeps, but it is SO well written that you will not be able to put it down. And if you do put it down it's because it's gotten inside your head so badly that you need a breather, as it happened to me. That is how good of a writer Chaon is! I hope he goes back and gives us another stellar collection soon, but this book is more than enough to tide you over in the meantime! I won't say what has already been said in terms of synopsis, but if you want a terrific, mind **** then pick this up! LOL"},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"After just having finished this book, I wanted to write this review with it very fresh in my mind, almost like the feeling that stays with you upon leaving a theatre after a great movie. Really great books and movies stick with me for hours upon finishing them, and this book is a strong example.Rather than give yet another \\"book report\\" review as so many seem to do on Amazon, I'll write about qualities and colors rendered and feelings caused. I leave it to anyone reading this to figure out the rest, perhaps buy the book and enjoy it.There are nagging questions I have about the various characters in this book and at times I even mentally asked \\"Why are you doing this?\\" to certain ones. So, in this way Mr. Chaon has achieved success: an emotional response in the reader. A surreal connection to the characters in the story wherein they become real enough to cause concern, fear, and eventually, relief. Very few recent books I've read have this power.The writing style is easy going and very stealthy, it sucks you in without your realizing it has done so. After a few chapters, it's too late. You need to know what happens next. Quite a few chapters are cliff-hangers. Clich&eacute;? Perhaps, but very effective. The story is compelling and I think should be appealing to many reader types.There are a few problems. The chronology of chapters is purposely jumbled. I don't know if this is a device to keep the reader more interactive than they would have been naturally or just an annoyance, a writer's way of tweaking our noses. I kept having to flip back to various chapters to figure out certain facts in the timeline. Looking back, I don't know whether I found this \\"fun\\" like a mystery puzzle or just plain pesky. Either way, this shouldn't be enough to keep you from reading this novel.At times, the character Nora (the only real mother in the book) is amorphous, so fractionated that she is hard to get a complete picture of. Again, I don't know if this is purposely done to draw her as a sketch in her slowly disintegrating mental state or just a failing of Mr. Chaon to render her completely in standard style. Either way, the patina he creates in her scenes is a wabi-sabi masterpiece. She's young/old, whole/broken, beautiful/damaged to perfection.There are very few novels on the shelves these days where the main male characters are not detectives, police men, CIA agents or some other &uuml;ber hero or villian. \\"You Remind Me of Me\\" has men that are run of the mill, strangers, garden variety. And getting to see these Regular Joes complete with flaws is a sorely needed breath of fresh air in the publishing business. Let's hope Mr. Chaon adds more of such normalcy in the future.I'm looking forward to reading more by this author. Mr. Chaon, you have a new fan."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"This book was amazing...Chaon writes with a poetry that I haven't read since Kerouac. And not that I'm comparing this book at all to Kerouac, per say, but Chaon writes with the same intensity...he weaves words together so that they flow effortlessly on the page, and then later, stay with you as you progress through the day. He truly makes you look at life with a different perspective. This book is about identity. About how it is formed...is it nature or nurture? Or do we create ourselves? The characters are so intricately linked, and the point of view is such that I have never read before...this book is truly a journey. I will probably reread it sometime again in the future, just so I can extract even more out of it."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"I don't know what it is about this book that I loved so much. Maybe it's just that Chaon is such a masterful writer that whatever he writes about is a pleasure to read. I found the prose enjoyable and full of insights; the characters real and engaging, troubled but sympathetic. I read it straight through from beginning to end, unable to put it down.Looking forward to reading more from this talented writer."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"I read in the blurb after I got this book that one of the main characters, Jonah, is brutally attacked by a dog as a boy. This is a pretty harsh event and I worried that such tragedy would mar my enjoyment of the book. It was difficult to imagine how the author could redeem such an event. But I was surprised to find that the author blends the tragedy with the personality of Jonah to make an extremely interesting character who is at once vulnerable, nave, and sympathetic. The other characters in the book, principally a boy named Loomis and his father Troy, are just as interesting in their own quirky ways. An author that can breathe life into these very difficult plots and characters is to be congratulated.After reading the first couple of chapters I couldn't put the book down. There's a kind of understated, informal quality about Dan Chaon's writing that is almost addicting. Chaon wastes no words advancing the story. As the plot unfolded I could imagine several possible endings. I was glad to discover I was completely wrong and that the author wrote an ending that avoided both the best possible ending and the worst and opted for an ending that was neither clich&eacute; nor disappointing.I will definitely look for books by this author in the future."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"For the most part, You Remind Me of Me was a convincing glimpse into a tortured mind, a tale that made you continue reading in hopes there would be a happy ending.Chaon did an excellent job breathing life into the character of Jonah, who at turns one feels sympathetic-for and repelled-by. The author deftly got into this character's head - you witness the thought processes that lead to Jonah's at times irrational behavior and compulsive lying, and you see how it kind-of makes sense from his perspective.Unlike some reviewers, I had no problem with the story's shifting time line and perspective, it was pretty easy to follow and made the story compelling (the Reader's Guide provided at the end of the book talks about how Chaon developed the characters and story structure, and this was pretty interesting reading in itself).*Spoiler alert*The only part that I thought was a bit dubious was how easily Loomis gave himself over to Jonah. For as perceptive as Loomis was described, it just didn't seem too convincing.There are no heroes in this story, just a sigh of relief at its conclusion along with an uneasy feeling that trouble could start brewing again."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"Exquisite writing about real people in complex relation to one another, THIS is the stuff of greatness! Don't be put off by the shifting time-frames, flashbacks, flashforwards, and \\"flashpresents\\", it all ties together in the end. But, in a way, that, almost, doesn't matter. What matters is the journey and the people we meet along the way. A discourse on fate; a discourse on the decisions we make (and those made for us); a discourse on life itself: What more do you want?"},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"If I had not read Await Your Reply first, I probably would have rated this higher, but it did not quite measure up to that very high standard. Still, it was a very, very good book. Almost twelve hours after I have finished reading it, I am still shook up over the last chapter. I feel I may always be shook up over it. Although it did not induce the mouth-gaping moments that Await Your Reply created and I guessed correctly early on regarding one of the biggest plot points, it did have plenty of twists, turns and gut-wrenching moments.While this book may not have measured up overall to Await Your Reply, it did in some ways surpass it. I think this book will stick with me longer and make me reflect more on my own life: past, present and future. While some of the details of Await Your Reply are starting to fade from my memory after six months, I suspect that this book may last a lifetime.Maybe that is because it reminds me of me."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"I thought You Remind Me of Me was absolutely phenomenal, and I've already bought two additional copies as gifts for friends. Would suggest this to anyone who enjoys literary fiction. Extremely accessible and captivating-- was reading this on a cruise and didn't want to do any activity that wouldn't allow me to read until I was done with it!"},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"Dan Chaon's \\"You Remind Me of Me\\" is a well-written, evocative novel. Chaon is especially good at peering into people's souls, even those of children and women. I've always been a fan of his writing, being introduced to his collection of short stories, \\"Among the Missing\\" in the early 2000's.\\"You Remind Me of Me\\" plots through the lives of several people, focusing on Jonah Doyle, who eventually goes in search of his long-lost adopted brother in a desolate small Nebraskan town. Both are clearly fragile and damaged men - stemming from their alternately awkward and depressing childhoods.The language he uses is realistic and gritty, writing that evokes Chuck Palahnuik, but with a less bizarre \\"science fiction\\" bent and love of violence for violence's sake that infuses Palahnuik's work. Otherwise, he is akin to Chuck Klosterman's sense of probing insight, without the trend toward humor; instead, it offers grace and deep emotional intensity. This book also reminds me highly of the movies, \\"Babel\\" and \\"Amores Perros,\\" which offer a fractured group of stories about flawed people who eventually come together in the end, much like this book. It never delves into mawkishness even though the characters themselves are depressed and damaged, which is a very fine line that many writers cross. Beautiful and well-written, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"Looking at the other reviews here, I see that readers are either falling all over themselves or reacting very negatively to this book. Clearly, this is a novel that provokes strong feelings in people. So instead of gushing about the prose (which I do think is poetic and lovely) or railing on the characters (which are, for the most part, miserable... but some people like that kind of thing), I thought I'd try to identify some of the elements of this book that readers might find either enriching or problematic.1) Structure - Dan Chaon is first and foremost a short story writer, and this comes through quite clearly in this book. Much like an Arriaga screenplay (21 Grams, Amores Perros) the chronology and cast of characters are fragmented and require a bit of piecing together in the beginning. In fact, I kept a timeline for the first ten chapters just to keep myself straight. While some people may enjoy this puzzle, others might find it gimmecky and unnecessary and not have the patience to continue reading.2) Predominace of storytelling by way of characters' interior -One reviewer I believe called this novel \\"claustrophobic\\", which I think is a pretty apt word. This is not a novel of plots and dialogues - most of the story is revealed through the memories and thoughts of a variety of characters. Very little happens directly in this novel, resulting in a sort of slowness, or lack of immediacy. Here again, some readers will savor this richness and pace, and others will find it aggrivating.3) Tendancy toward melodrama and sentimentality - Remember the books in the first round of Oprah's book club (Jane Hamilton, Wally Lamb, etc.)? This book is ripe for this audience. This can be a very dark book, seemingly hopeless at times. But it is a perspective that many people find truth and redemption in. For others, this way of looking at the world is pessimistic and depressing.All said and done, I did enjoy this book, and my book group had a very long and involved discussion about it. I can't say that I'm going to run out and buy the rest of Chaon's work, but I do give him credit for being a gifted and unconventional writer that seems to be resonating with many, many people.For a book with similar themes, but a different edgier approach, try Eliot Perlman's Seven Types of Ambiguity."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"This book was extraordinary...a book that revived my faith that the novel is here to stay. The theme -- in Chaon's own words: \\"How can you be alive when every choice you make breaks the world into a thousand filaments, each careless step branches into long tributaries of alternate lives, shuddeing outward and outward like sheer lightning.\\"That's solid writing by a master in control of the process. The novel is, ultimately, about choices and alternate lives: what would happen if you were born to a different mother? If you'd grown up in a different place? If you had some kind of proof that you were unlucky? These are questions that we all wrestle with at some point in our lives; Jonah more than most.There is ample foreshadowing that \\"something is wrong with Jonah\\": his child demeanor, the way he deals with the dog Rosebud as an adult, his own lack of involvement at the time of his mother's death. It is inevitable, then, that his appearance in Troy's life will eventually create what appears to be a crisis.Each character is carefully drawn, even the minor ones. I could picture each one -- the twitches, the yellowing sheets, the gnarled hands, and most of all, the scar which, of course, is symbolic of the schism that runs through Jonah's life.I highly recommend this novel!"},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"A very touching book. So well written. I'm thoroughly impressed, as are many others, obviously. A few seem to want to slight this novel, but I can't help thinking they don't fully understand how difficult a book like this is to write. Chaon makes it look easy, really, and that's a trick of enormous skill. This novel could have seemed fragmented, but I don't think it does because each different time and location that he drops us into he creates completely. He grounds us on each page. Each line and scene is so complete that there is very little that's fuzzy or unclear about this. Complex, challenging, yes - but unclear or fuzzy, definitely not.Some reviewers have complained about the characters, but I think that's another strength of the book. Chaon has such empathy and understanding for his characters that they're compelling despite their obvious flaws. Yes, their decisions can be pathetic and painful and damaging, but people make decisions like that. Just because it can be difficult to read at times doesn't mean we shouldn't examine such characters, the lives they lead and the decisions they make. Personally, I feel for them all. I'm glad to have this time with them. I've more compassion and interest in adoption, and more appreciation of the family I have around me. Altogether, I learned from this book and enjoyed the writer's skills on every page. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"Dan Chaon has a unique style that is both visual(I could see the movie playing in my head) and poetic(his use of words is beautiful). While I did not like most of the characters, I appreciate the complete sketch that Mr. Chaon paints of these characters' bleak lives. Troy Timmens is probably the fullest real character we see and in my opinion the most comprehensible. The book is midly disturbing and depressing, however, I recommend it for the beautiful and unique style and the griping story."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"Chaon's been awarded acclaim and praise for his short story collections, but this, his first novel, will push him into an even higher realm. With gorgeous language, soaring metaphors, and utterly engaging characters (primarily a missing child, a pregnant teenager, and a disillusioned drug dealer), he weaves a rich and varied tapestry of memories, pain, and a search for redemption in a small Midwestern town. There are ghosts of haunted pasts that bring the characters, maimed both physically and spiritually, to the brink of irredeemable tragedy as their paths converge.Constructed in the newly popular but not always successful technique of fragmentary flashbacks into times of an indeterminate past, You Remind Me of Me is sometimes confusing, always engaging, and forever memorable.Highest praise."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"This is a painfully exquisite book. Not only is each sentence beautifully and thoughtfully composed, but it is also a book in which all those amazing sentences make something big and important-- it's not just a pile of pretty words. I think many readers will find themselves transformed by the compassion this book inspires. These characters have such difficult lives, often due to circumstances imposed upon them, often from their own dumb mistakes-- and in a way, the distinctions don't matter. Jonah, Nora, Troy, Loomis, Judy--they're so human and you bleed a little with them and become a little more human yourself--in the best way-- because of them. You Remind Me Of Me is really about as good a book as anything I've ever read."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"At the beginning of this achingly haunting and beautiful novel we're introduced to Jonah and Troy: Two half brothers whose lives have yet to intersect.What builds to this inevitable meeting is their own involved origins, thier parents, loved ones, and children. Shifting between past and present, Chaon presents a story about the lives we wish for ourselves, and the reality of what we've become. The book has such a searing exactness in it's dissection of human emotion. It's writing elevated to art. A great book."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"Dan Chaon writes beautiful prose, but it's more than just pretty words.In his first novel, \\"You Remind Me of Me,\\" he pierces to the heart his characters and makes the reader care about their fate.\\"You Remind Me of Me\\" was one of those rare books I found literally impossible to put down. He introduces us in rotating chapters to a mother unable to forgive herself for having given up an illegitimate child and who can't love the child she has kept, the son who was given up for adoption and who is dealing with a multitude of his own problems, and the unloved son who strives to find his lost half-brother and, when he does, is unable to reveal himself except through gestures that raise only suspicion.Chaon has a way of dealing with even minor characters that makes them stand out in the memory like someone you've actually met. And, the major characters - more often than not, you'll want to give them a swat on the head to wake them up and do what common sense dictates they should but never will.It's a complex book about the delicate relationship between human beings and how easily those tenuous ties can create unimaginable tensions."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"Jonah's mother ignores him and yearns for the son she gave up for adoption before Jonah's own illegitimate birth. For all Jonah knows, his sibling is living a perfect life while their mother drinks and daydreams. His widowed grandfather tries to provide a normal life, but Jonah learns early that people naturally seem to dislike him.When he is finally on his own, Jonah decides to look for his older brother in hopes of making some sort of connection that will bring peace to his troubled life. He makes a mess of it.Instead of telling his brother the truth, he spies on him and pretends to be just another co-worker. Jonah finds that his brother's life has not been ideal, but it is not made better when he finds out that he has a strange younger brother.This is the kind of quirky book that will have you reading well into the night and sneaking away to read during the day. Dan Chaon's story of familial dysfunction reminds us that we are all a little odd in one way or another. This writer's description of typical life through the eyes of an unstable man is masterfully handled in this terrific novel."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"Jonah was dead once. He is a six-year-old boy living with his grandfather and his mother, who tells him of the baby she put up for adoption before he was born. Elizabeth, an elderly Doberman trained by Jonah's grandfather to be a guard dog, also lives with them. Lonely Jonah, ignored by his depressed mother, adores Elizabeth. When he constantly plays with her, his grandfather says, &quot;Quit pestering that damned dog! I hope she bites you someday.&quot; And then she does. Elizabeth bites off part of Jonah's ear. She savages his face, scalp and chest. She kills Jonah. The paramedics resuscitate him. The scars he bears forever symbolize internal wounds caused by his upbringing.Around the time of Jonah's death and resurrection, ten-year-old Troy avoids his adopted parents' unhappy marriage by hanging out with his drug-dealing cousin and his pot-smoking teenage customers. Troy becomes a drug-dealer himself eventually, even after his wife leaves him with custody of his much-loved son, Loomis.A scene from an earlier period reveals Nora as a lonely girl in a bleak unwed mothers' home: &quot;It is not quite a prison, not quite a hospital.&quot; She does not want the baby --- at first. Her feelings reluctantly change, but it's too late. By the time she voices her wish to keep her son, he's been taken to his adoptive parents.Moving back to the past and forward into the present, the reader learns the story of Jonah, Troy and Nora --- two boys and their mother. The stories give the reader the emotional underpinnings necessary to empathize with each character, and are brilliantly dovetailed together into one big meaty tale. Author Dan Chaon also pays loving tribute to Midwest prairie and small towns, making the setting a vital element to the story.Each character is disconnected and yearns for someone. Nora has never recovered from the loss of her first son. That sorrow has twisted Nora's personality until she is mostly unable to give love to her second boy. Jonah obsesses about his older brother, the baby his mother gave up for adoption. He wonders about the hand he's been dealt. Who is better off --- the brother whose life was mauled by his despondent mother, or the one who escaped via adoption?Jonah's longing to connect with his half-brother leads him to search for Troy. When Jonah finds him, Troy is in agony. After being arrested for dealing drugs, his son Loomis is in the custody of his grandmother, who won't allow Jonah to visit or speak with him. Troy is so painfully distracted by missing Loomis that he can't quite focus when Jonah approaches him as his brother. Inevitably, Jonah decides to act, hoping his drastic feat will somehow give him the family he's craving.I highly recommend YOU REMIND ME OF ME as a gripping, good read. The plot is moving, and the prose is elegantly subtle. Occasionally, I was stunned by a beautifully wrought sentence, rereading it in admiration. Usually, though, I was simply and happily lost --- spellbound by a master storyteller.--- Reviewed by Terry Miller Shannon"},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"This is a story of a couple of regular guys, struggling to rise above real and imagined hardship. The story of relationships they want and wish they's had. And the story of their odd and unfinished brotherhood. At times, I wondered if I would finish the story.

Although it doesn't take much imagination to tie the four stories, Chaon's book is a tragic tale of how life, with even the most miniscule change, is drastically altered, and how one is left to wonder what could have been if only those changes had been made. One of my favorite lines \\"If your life had an understudy, could that person play you better?\\" Beautiful, thoughful writing like that abound in this book.Norma, the woman whose first baby was given up in adoption, gives birth to a second son, Jonah who is attacked by the family dog. Jonah's physical scars from the attack are only the beginning of the emotional scars he suffers at the hands of his mother who can't come to terms with giving her baby -- who we learn is now known as Troy, a drug dealer/alcoholic who's trying to reform -- up for adoption.After his mother's suicide, Jonah searchs for his brother and comes across Troy who is trying to overcome his demons and be a good dad to Loomis, a wonderful character who plays a great role in the novel and, at 6, is the most grown up of the bunch.The book is written in a series of flashbacks, each chapter gets a date, and the reader is left to put the timeline together. It's a good read."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"The first thing that jumped out at me about this novel was its literary style.

There is honesty within these pages that most people don't see in reality. The character of Jonah is so heartbreakingly unfortunate that I'll never forget him. I didn't stop rooting for him even when he crossed lines that I, as a reader hoped he wouldn't. There was enough redmemption to keep me turning pages.

The reader becomes completely absorbed in people whose lives, superficially, are thoroughly ignorable. The ending is thoroughly satisfying, and the getting there an absorbing journey."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"Dan Chaon's novel, YOU REMIND ME OF ME, recounts the search by Jonah for an explanation of his life which will allow him to feel that it was worth his being born. Jonah lives with an emotionally cold and mentally ill mother and with his grandfather and dog, both of whom he loves and who provide him with comfort. In the single defining moment of his life, at age 6 he is mauled by the dog leaving him with grotesque permanent facial scars. The scars make Jonah an object of others' uncomfortable curiosity. Jonah learns to deal with people's reactions to his appearance, but never with the fact that he has and will always remain one of those unfortunate people who is unable to crack the code of normal human interaction. Jonah is the perpetually lonely outsider, so in a desperate try for meaningful human contact, he begins to invent a life so as to become more interesting and attractive to others. This works for a while until his few new friends begin to feel that, no matter how interesting his stories, Jonah is an uncomfortable person to be around.The single most important facet of Jonah's life besides the dog attack is the fact that he has an older half brother who was given up for adoption, and whom Jonah has never met, who was the bitterly guilty focus of Jonah's mother throughout her life. Deciding that finding his brother will solve his problems - it will give him a sense of family and provide him with at least a friend and hopefully someone who will, due to their fraternal bond, love him - Jonah discovers who and where his brother is and travels to the town where Troy, his brother, lives. Of course Troy not only is unaware that Jonah wants to find him, he is totally unaware of Jonah's existence.I will not discuss the plot further so as not to spoil the book for anyone who may want to read it.Dan Chaon's subtle and sensitive writing creates a novel of loss, failure, and overwhelming sadness extending to every major character. YOU REMIND ME OF ME is an intelligent, nuanced, and ultimately brilliant novel. I can't recommend it highly enough."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"Our book group had an in depth and interesting discussion with this book. The themes of loneliness, what constitutes a modern family, and how much does \\"fate\\" factor into one's life had us talking for a couple hours. Lots of personal histories were drawn out by our discussion--everyone found characters to which they could relate. Chaon weaves a story that alternates back and forth in time, which might tend to irritate the reader, but it works here. His characters are made real, flaws and all. I went looking for more of his writing."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"Considering the description given of the book, I thought this would be many seemingly unrelated stories that would eventually wind all together. My misinterpretation of \\"...begins with a series of separate incidents...\\" This is really the story of one person name Jonah. He has a messed up childhood that leads to a messed up adult. There are other stories mixed in, his mother, half brother, his nephew, grandfather...Because the book jumps around a bit from character to character, I initially had a little trouble following it. Thankfully I got used to it. I found the story of the dog attack & the mother's scandelous pregnacy to be the most interesting parts in the book. The main character was ridiculously unbelievable to me. Like he was retarded. Clearly he isn't retarded, his extremely smart. He just struggles in the \\"people skills\\" area of life. I found it a bit hard to believe that someone so intelligent could truly be that stupid when it came to socializing with others. I found the other characters in the book were much more believable.Putting my personal lack of belief in a character such as Jonah, I enjoyed this book. It is a bit sad & not all rolled into one.Who's to say what really makes us us?"},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"Dan Chaon, always a brilliant author, has outdone himself with this striking and intelligent novel 'You Remind Me of Me.' The story, in brief, follows the various lives of two brothers, one adopted, one not, their mother, and one of their sons. It jumps back and forth through time, setting up parallels and images, all beautifully wrought in Chaon's elegant and simple style. The characters are engaging and sympathetic, and the plot and narrative form are fascinating to watch unwind.I personally found section two impossible to put down, and read it all in one sitting.You cannot miss this book. As usual, Chaon weaves stories of mysterious beauty, and this, his first novel, is just more to enjoy."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"I tried to enjoy this book, but found it difficult to keep going back to."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"I just could not enjoy Dan Chaon's *You Remind Me of Me*. I found Chaon's storytelling to be too wordy for me. In addition, he admits to being a short story writer. Therefore, you're sent forward and backward in time, among different characters and their perspectives. I'm not sure he he's trying to do it like Audrey Niffenegger's *The Time Traveler's Wife* but was unsuccessful in doing so.The first three chapters were interesting and I had thought that I would enjoy this book. However, beyond the third chapter (and certain excerpts in other chapters), the story goes downhill. For me, it was troublesome remembering who was who in what year and whatnot.In addition, I found Chaon to be too wordy in storytelling. I had to put the book down for little mental and visual breaks. Plus, I found the characters to be too depressing. It was as if life is just plain dull and there's nothing good coming out of it."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"This book is full of depressing adventures that are sort of believable. I mean, some people do have a sucky life. This book is about generations of crap happening to the same family. Almost like saying if your daddy is a drug dealer, then most likely growing up in that situation, his kids will be too. This book is about Nora Doyle, and her son's Jonah and Troy. The boy's have a drug dealer father, who is a total loser. Nora is depressed, and suicidal. Written by Dan Chaon. It's hard to explain this book. Either you love it, or you don't. Although this book was dark, there's lessons to learn. This book is kind of depressing because it seems they just can't see daylight. Also, the characters jump around so much in the book at first, it's hard to bond to any one character. It does all fit together once you get to the end though. This book is worth reading and I do recommend you read it at least once."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"With \\"You Remind Me\\", Chaon has uniquely intertwined several characters stories into a single master plot. I enjoyed the constant change of perspective from one character to the next, though I found the time line shifts to be a little quirky at times. One thing is for certain: this is a depressing novel. Clearly there exists a deeper message of self-reflection, but for an upbeat spirited person such as myself-- I'd refrain from reading this one on a rainy day."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"I didn't finish the book, and usually I wouldn't write a review for a book I didn't even finish. I just feel like I want to warn people about how bleak and depressing this book is. It just makes you sad. The writing is good, but reading it actually made me depressed. I am not a moody person. The book is just a major downer."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"Another book that won't be loved by all due to issues that other reviewers have mentioned.It can be difficult to keep all of the characters straight.The novel includes dark thoughts and secrets of the characters.As others have mentioned, it boils down to actions and consequences. Nearly everything that exists is impacted by choices and decisions we make or don't make at any given moment."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"Books like this are a dime a dozen which is not necessarily a bad thing. This was not an \\"Oprah Book Club\\" book, but it is the type that would make it to the list.

Not bad but nothing special either.It certainly provides lots of discussion topics if you belong to a book club."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"LOVE TO READ. LIKE THE GOOD SHORT STORIES THAT YOU CAN COMPLETE BEFORE BEDTIME? HERE YOU GO !"},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"What a sad and depressing book. I gave it two stars because I didn't want to put the book down- I read it all the way through to see if there was to be any redemption in it. SPOILER HERE------Although there was ample foreshadowing about Jonah's 'sickness' and I wasn't surprised by his kidnapping the boy, this was anti-climatic and didn't add any depth to the plot. In the end, these characters were so pathetic, that reading the book was mostly a wasted day for me. How sad and without a purpose...these characters were boring, passive and without any redemptive value. Portraying loneliness is one thing, but this book is just sad and and depressing."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"This is a well-written book but perhaps it is best enjoyed during a week at the beach. It is that forgettable. The story is not new nor refreshing. The story starts interesting enough and the narrative style is very clever. It keeps you glued to the book to figure out how all the loose ends tie up. But soon it loses its spark and resorts to the main themes of so much contemporary American literature: dysfunctional childhoods, lack of responsbile parent figures, unstable adults that get into trouble and then \\"redeem\\" themselves. I found Jonah unlikable, in spite of his disfigurement. I am a very sensistive and tolerant person and worked very hard to try to warm up to him. It just did not happen. Plus the kidnapping episode is really creepy and pointless. It makes him even less likable. Troy is much more multi-dimensional and he helped me get through the book. But I kept thinking: \\"It's time for these guys to grow up!\\". Life is difficult for most people (look around at our messed-up world outside the U.S.). We live in a society where we focus on feeling sorry for reckless individuals and make excuses for when they behave badly versus helping them become accountable for their actions and grateful for the things they DO have. Books like this one perpetuate the \\"poor me\\" mentality that is so pervasive and self-defeating in many aspects of our society."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"This Ballantine Books edition has appended to it an interesting interview with Chaon. In it, the author confirmed my suspicion: He had no idea what he was doing as he wrote the novel.By his own admission Chaon simply started typing with only the vaguest idea of what he wanted to write. This lack of planning required the editor, Smetanka, to get very involved in the novel's construction; so to be fair, I will marry the two and refer to Chaon-Smetanka as joint authors. The marriage led to a mid-stream change to the narrative stance, ending up with a series of semi-omniscient third-person narrators that can read character's thoughts and know some future events, but frustratingly dont know the history of St. Podunk, Nebraska. Usually it's one narrator per chapter, but in one chapter Chaon-Smetanka daringly switched narrators back and forth, and even had an independent authorial narrator state that the other two narrators had the identical thoughts about a little toddler dying in a freezer, right down to knowing the freezer's storage capacity to a tenth of a cubic foot. (Before I leave that horrific scene I should say Chaon-Smetanka's gratuitous killing of little fictional Joshua is cheap, unforgivable manipulation of the reader. The description is only there to make us think, Oh please dont let that happen to little fictional Loomis! In my view an artist would never do that, for an artist would understand that Joshua and his mother's suffering are more important, and more terrible, than Loomis's.)The language is bland American. The main characters merely drift along, and Chaon-Smetanka balance the aimless main narrative with equally pointless manufactured drama. Red herrings. The most boring of these red herrings were whether Troy could drive home from work in ten minutes and Jonah asking somebody to move his car.Oh, sure, there were some decent parts. I especially delighted in Jonah's doberman being reincarnated to assist the police in chasing and punishing the kidnapper. And there was development of some themes: The unhappy leaves; the gravel; and the curlicue, unraveling, unwinding spiral motif that paralleled Jonah's predictable unraveling.In the interview Chaon says the seed of the novel is his wife's response to his own (and I think, boring) fixation on nature versus nurture---his wife observed \\"people invent themselves\\". That's a good insight. For example, Nietzsche's body of work and Proust's narrator present two celebrated examples of how to invent one's self----they both propose that a self could be invented through articulate art. It is a very interesting subject; lots of things to mine here.But development of the \\"invented self\\" theme was beyond Chaon-Smetanka. It seems to me the theme could not be explored because Chaon-Smetanka chose to saddle themselves with Jonah and Troy, two dreary, inarticulate, unreflective characters, who our joint authors proceed to cut off from the world (no father, mother, wife or kid, only the most bleak and undemanding kind of job). The two characters are incapable of action, and without action, as I've learned from Nietzsche and Proust, you cannot \\"become what one is\\". Nor are characters that have invented themselves introduced to contrast with Troy and Jonah.Instead, we are only given a simplistic behaviorist model of the self; in Jonah's case bad wiring, a lack of maternal love (I doubt the acrostic formed from the the novel's title is a coincidence) and a loaded dog going off made him into a sociopath, borderline psychopath. There is no interesting psychology, like a Freudian unconscious, to explain why Jonah might act differently than the third-person narrator's report of his beliefs and desires. The characters are beaten down; Jonah believes he had \\"not been born significant\\" and at 36 Troy believes it is \\"too late to become a different person\\". Maybe in Jonah's notebooks is that invented self, but alas we are given no writing samples. I think Chaon-Smetanka have merely provided us with two examples of how to fail to invent who one is. Failure can be instructive, but given the dismal mental life of these characters, it isnt interesting.Please authors, do not talk about your work in public! If you are quiet, we just may charitably credit the final product with achieving your grand design."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"While I realize that the majority of people thought this to be a stellar book, it reminds me of the story, \\"The Emperor has no clothes\\". Yes, Choan can write a beautiful sentence and yes, the first several pages were intriguing but the switching of years was very annoying. The \\"flipping back and forth\\" was not accomplished in a smooth, flowing manner. In addition, the subject matter was incredibly depressing and the characters were so flawed that one did not even care about how their lives evolved. The kidnapping was predictable and the ending contrived. It would be impossible to recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"This story bored the dickens out of me. The writing dragged on and on about subjects which were uninteresting and depressing. I agree wholeheartedly with R. Farmer. I am not a Pollyanna who only needs sunshine and smiley faces, but this was ridiculous. The characters were stuck in boring places with no desire to make things better for themselves. Talk but no action."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"I bought this book based on the rave reviews, but I found it to be depressing not hauntingly beautiful.

About 1/3 of the way through I discovered there was a large chunk of the book MISSING, and a chunk of the later part of the book in it's place. This was extremely frustrating since I ordered it online, and I never finished the book. Now I have missed the window to return it. I am very disappointed and will probably never order from Amazon again."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"i'll keep it short- Chaon is a great writer and this is a great novel. i read his first book, a collection of short stories, among the missing, and loved every page of it. i constantly thought to myself while reading both books that he has the ability to write of things that we all know and experience, but somehow don't pay too much attention to- \\"yes, that's it exactly.\\" that kind of a feel (if that makes any sense-hopefully you'll know what i mean.)his characters are rich, beautiful, flawed, and broken. i loved all of them.Chaon is now one of the writers i will read w/out having to know what the book is about, or what kind of reviews it has received-i know i will love it.--i can't say enough about this author."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"This book shows a deep sense that's present in all of us-- a desire to be connected with someone. Jonah, Troy, Nora are the three characters who are finding themselves, and in the course of doing so, struggle to attain a sense of belongingness. The book explores the intricacies and complexities of young, unwanted pregnancy, the pain of adoption, the insecurities of someone feeling unappreciated through these characters portrayed. At the core of all their messed up lives, love and the desire to connect are the threads which weave them together.I think this is a story worth reading. It awakens so many emotions in the course of going through their lives. It's a melodramatic story without trying too hard to be a tearjerker. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"You Remind Me of Me is a tremendous achievement, and is easily one of the best books of 2004. With a smooth, accomplished narrative that flows beautifully and mellifluously across the page, Chaon presents a charming story of regret, self-knowledge, lost souls, and family. Moving elliptically through past and present, the narrative explores the lives all the main characters, moving forward and backward simultaneously. Focusing on character and theme, rather than plot, Chaon pieces together vignettes from multiple points of view across several decades into a rich narrative mosaic. The accumulation of illuminating detail is remarkable, and the shifts in time and point of view are handled with such care and understanding that reader is never confused or baffled by the story.The story centers on three main characters, - Jonah, Troy, and Nora. Nora, a failed member of the Woodstock generation, is Jonah and Troy's biological mother, but she was forced to give Troy up for adoption in the early 1960's when she was committed to Mrs. Glass House, a home for pregnant, wayward girls. Five years later, she gives birth to Jonah, amid expectations of a lasting relationship. But her hopes of a lasting relationship are dashed, and she returns home with her son to South Dakota. The young Jonah is at home with his grandpa's Doberman when the dog turns on him, and the mauling leaves a nasty scar across Jonah's freckled face - a scar that comes to symbolize his sad childhood.By the time he's 25, Jonah is already bitter, reclusive and resentful at his lot in life, so he decides to look for his long lost half-brother Troy. Troy Timmens is living with Loomis, his young son in St. Bonaventure, Nebraska. Jonah travels there and takes a job where Troy works as a bartender, a pub aptly called the Stumble Inn. Troy has just been busted for dealing drugs, and he is estranged from his junkie wife Carla who has run off to Vegas. There's lots going down in his life, and the arrival of Jonah is met with a kind of half-heartedness and skepticism.Jonah, Nora and Troy were once \\"little babies unknowing and slowly reeling in the world, gathering it loop by loop like a ball of string.\\" Cleverly using flashbacks, Chaon creates an intense world in which both Jonah and Troy seek the fulfillment of personal dreams, against the brittle hopes of better lives that have probably died before coming to fruition. They are obsessed with retrieving fragments of their past in order to make sense of the present and their future. Chaon paints a rich portrait of lives lived in trailer parks, orphanages, homes for unwed mothers, pubs, shopping malls and decaying small towns. And he never fails to take seriously and sympathetically each individual's attempt to carve out a meaningful identity. The dialogue sparkles, and the narrative quickly moves along in spite of the characters' haphazard and aimless lives. Chaon never takes advantage or condescends to his characters' shortcomings; he treats them with a warm, almost gentle affection as they struggle to do penance for their inadequacies and dysfunctions. Mike Leonard September 04."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"The dog attack ripped me apart (no pun intended). It was hard for me to get beyond that scene, but I eventually did. Though this was a dark and somewhat melodramatic work, with characters that at times were hard to relate to, I found that I couldn't put it down, even though I wanted to. Oh, how I wanted to.The story did wander--sometimes aimlessly, and it did make me uncomfortable at times, but there was a sense of hope for an ending that might have some semblance of happiness. I suppose I was foolish to wish for that. The overwhelming sense of sadness was something I'd not experienced while reading a book, and yet, I can honestly say that despite how uncomfortable it made me, in the end I was glad to have read it."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"I had not read a novel by Dan Chaon but this will not be my last. This is a unique, intertwined story about Troy, a man who loves his son but has his faults; Jonah, a lost \\"little boy\\" who is an adult coping in a world that he doesn't quite understand; and the distant story of their connection, their mother, Nora, whose sad life sets the tone for the next generation.We delve into the story of each of them as they come of age, the story of Nora's early era contrasting interestingly with that of Troy's more druggie era and Jonah's self-reflective days. Troy was the son Nora gave up for adoption, Jonah was the one she kept--and who was the luckier? You will find out in this novel's unusual twists and turns.The element of how Loomis, Troy's son, fits into the picture, is also colorful and augments the story with contrasting how Loomis is like Jonah, and the position that Troy has in the middle of them both.This is the type of book for those who like the gentle unfolding of storylines. It is not an action-packed novel, but yet is fully interesting. What a great character study! Both Troy and Jonah unfold like gradual flowers, showing captivating nuances and self-reflection that applies to all of us.This rich novel is surely a harbinger of even greater stories to come from this author. Do not miss this deep, moving, inspiring novel that has lessons for all of us."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"I read a lot....not just novels, everything and anything I can get my hands on. I am one of those people who reads magazines, books, cereal boxes, junk mail, advertising flyers, the bathroom walls....but occasionally, just occasionally, something comes along that I know I am going to hate to finish reading. Chaon's novel was one of those occasions for me. I hated to leave these characters behind, and yes, I forged through at full throttle simply because I had to.Chaon's characters are real. Their lives are real, their dilemnas are real, and throughout there is this creeping sense of the duality of our own significant sense of self. I found myself reluctant to identify with any one of his characters, and yet, I was compelled to admit so many things about myself that I sigh before I can say....this novel, reminds me of me."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"I am a voracious reader and have to say that this is the best book of 2004.

PLEASE do yourself a favor and read this book."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"As a sometime wanna be writer, reading the work of Dan Chaon is a truly humbling expereince. The man possesses a talent so immense it's almost frightening. This is one author that is deserving of every accolade he receives.\\"You Remind Me of Me\\" is a strange, sad, story about the lives of several seemingly ordinary individuals, and the secret connections that link them together.

Mr. Chaon your skill as an author is amazing, more please!"},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"I had to consume this book in small bites rather my usual all-consuming &quot;non-stop&quot; style. I agree with the other reviewers that this author writes with an absolutely luminous style that transcends the hopeless and regret-filled lives of his characters. But I often felt mired in the quicksand of their lives, and struggled at times to find a reason to continue reading after yet another disappointment or dream unfulfilled. It isn't an easy book to read - either emotionally or structurally because of the author's style of moving forward and backward in the characters lives. Luckily he puts the dates at the beginning of each chapter , making it a bit easier to orient the reader as the story weaves between the characters. This book will undoubtedly be considered for many major awards - and the characters will linger in my memory in the days and weeks to come."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"Ultimately this is the story of Jonah searching for his half brotherTroy who was given away at birth.This search, the people involved, all linked in some way, and their families, is a story of family dysfunction, a longing for connection, and what might have been in one's life.In the Reader's Guide at the back of the book, the author was asked why he wrote the novel in fractured chronology, with multiple points of view, making the story complicated. The jumping around of events in time was difficult for me to keep up with, and often made it hard to keep my characters straight, but I loved this book nonetheless.The writing is beautiful, a tender and loving and sometimes brutal depiction of human beings flawed and in pain, struggling through life. The characters are amazingly real, with the author showing great insight into the human condition through his detailed descriptions.There is nothing clich&eacute;d or expected here; the characters and story feel completely fresh and new.I was especially taken by the depiction of the Doberman Pincher Elizabeth, the little boy Loomis, and the vulnerability of Jonah; all three characterizations making me think from time to time what a gentle man this author must be, and what a capacity for love he must have."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"If his mother had gotten treatment for her mental illness, his life would have been different, he would have made different choices, had different relationships with the people in his life and this would have been a different story...This is the 'what if?' book. What if the parents had been more careful about their bad habits? What if the teenage mother had kept her first child? What if she had stayed with her stable boyfriend? There were many 'what if's? to ask in this story. I think about these kinds of 'what if's? sometimes for myself and my children.I thought the characters were believable, the interwoven story-lines were realistic and the author created a tension for the reader who keeps wondering how things will turn out.I thought this was the opposite of chick lit...maybe Richard or 'Dick' lit? It was heavy on the male characters; fathers, brothers and sons. I can see how some people would love this. I thought it was a very quick and easy read. It just didn't resonate with me so that's why I'm giving it three stars and not four.I think people who like short stories would probably like this."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"This book was amazing...Chaon writes with a poetry that I haven't read since Kerouac. And not that I'm comparing this book at all to Kerouac, per say, but Chaon writes with the same intensity...he weaves words together so that they flow effortlessly on the page, and then later, stay with you as you progress through the day. He truly makes you look at life with a different perspective. This book is about identity. About how it is formed...is it nature or nurture? Or do we create ourselves? The characters are so intricately linked, and the point of view is such that I have never read before...this book is truly a journey. I will probably reread it sometime again in the future, just so I can extract even more out of it."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"I can't pour enough praise on Dan's ability to paint scenes and characters with his prose. Unfortunately, Dan's at his best when he sticks to his primary area of focus, the short story.Dan Chaon's attention to detail and memoir-like character accounts create a vivid patchwork of interconnected stories. The characters are poignant and haunting. Chaon manages to captivate right away, even though he loses a lot of steam in his attempts to weave things together. This was an enjoyable, if not disjointed read, but again, not the best prose to showcase Dan's abilities to craft fabulous stories."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"My parents tell me that when I was a baby boy, I inflicted my affections on a neighbor's Doberman pinscher. I'd fall headlong on the dog and happily spend the day chewing on his nose. The dog suffered through it all patiently. I was reminded of this in the first chapter of Dan Chaon's \\"You Remind Me of Me,\\" in which a 6-year-old South Dakota boy named Jonah is rough-housing with the family Doberman, who's not as patient as the dog who tolerated me. When Jonah falls on her, she lashes out, either in panic or in pain, savaging the boy to the extent that \\"Jonah was dead for a brief time before the paramedics brought him back to life.\\" (That is a GREAT opening sentence for a novel!)Around the same time in that spring of 1977, a 10-year-old named Troy is hanging out in a trailer home in Nebraska, watching his cousin sell pot to teenagers. Troy will grow up to fall in love with, marry, divorce but remain attached to one of the girls smoking dope that afternoon. At least Jonah got his mauling over with quickly.I hope I'm not spoiling anything, but it's pretty easy to guess that Troy and Jonah are brothers. Troy was given up for adoption by the boys' mother, Nora, shortly after his birth. Jonah claims to remember his older brother, but Nora scoffs, assuring Jonah that Troy was gone before Jonah made the scene.Growing up, Troy is effortlessly likable, while Jonah finds that people instinctively object to him. Even Nora sees him as a \\"constant, living reminder of her failures as a mother, as a person.\\" And the scarring makes it worse.\\"The scar they noticed first ran along his cheek from the edge of his eye to his lip. A keloid: a smooth, raised line of healed skin which they might associate with a cesarean section or appendectomy but not with a face. Not in America, not in the twentieth century. It made them think of a pirate, a thug from a pulp novel, a hideous blind beggar in a third-world country, and though there had been several revisions over the years, attempts at plastic surgery, the scar remained Jonah's most prominent feature. He had grown used to certain looks ... no matter where they looked they couldn't help but see damage: the nick of missing ear, the thin lines that ran along the backs of his hands, and others that pull down the side of his neck and past the collar of his shirt.\\"After his mother dies, Jonah takes his inheritance, cuts off ties to his home and his past and moves to Chicago to start a life of his own, though mostly he observes the lives of others from a safe distance. When Steve, a co-worker, catches Jonah staring, Jonah explains that Steve reminds him of his brother who died in a car accident. \\"The lie had come to him almost supernaturally, like a premonition. ... The whole thing had burst forth with such vividness that it had almost seemed real.\\" And the lie works. \\"It had established a connection between them, a bond ... Steve was pleased in some way, flattered that he looked exactly like the brother who had died.\\" Jonah has a friend.Steve and his wife, Holiday, have a history of adopting strays, and Jonah is their latest. They welcome him into their circle, but after a while, Jonah's neediness proves too much for them. This leads to an excruciatingly uncomfortable scene in which Jonah desperately and futilely tries to pry himself back into their lives. Jonah, alone again, decides that he's spent so much effort in constructing a fake dead brother, he might as well try to find out what happened to his real one. He quietly leaves Chicago, discarding another life, without telling his boss, his landlady or his former friends. \\"Better, he thought, to simply disappear.\\"Twenty-some-odd years after the scene in the motorhome marijuana den, Troy is trying to responsibly raise his son, Loomis. He and his wife, Carla, agree that Troy is the lesser screw-up in the couple and slightly more suited for parenthood. \\"'I'm not dealing,' he said, which was mostly true. 'I'm not even hardly smoking myself,' he said, which was not.\\" Troy, at 30 years old, decides it's time to start acting like an adult, to get out of the drug trade, go to school and be a dependable dad to his \\"Little Man.\\" But marijuana has a way of staving off good intentions until manana y manana y manana...One night, the cops bust in on Troy while he's holding a re-up bag full of weed, 'shrooms and acid. One of Troy's steady customers is a lawyer, but after his trial, he wonders if having a pothead mount his defense was the best choice. Troy is electronically shackled to his home, and Little Man is taken from him and given to Carla's mother, Judy. \\"His parental rights had not been terminated, exactly -- though Judy had official custody of Loomis for an indeterminate period.\\" Judy sees Troy as a \\"druggie little leech\\" and won't even let him talk to his son over the phone. But she loves Loomis and is happy to bring him into her home. She sets out to make the arrangement permanent, filing to strip Troy and Carla's parental rights.Then one bright day in June, Loomis disappears from her backyard.Before \\"You Remind Me of Me,\\" I read Andre Dubus III's \\"The Garden of Last Days.\\" I couldn't help but compare the two. Both books are about people in the throes of bad habits, chemical and personal. People who captain the sinking ships they themselves scuttled. Both books feature a kidnapped child. \\"You Remind Me of Me\\" even includes a stripper, just like \\"Garden.\\" I dinged Dubus' book for the self-pitying stupidity of its characters, so why does Chaon get a pass from me?For one thing, his characters are much more interesting and sympathetic. Jonah isn't trying to defraud anyone or get something for nothing. He acts out of an urgent need to belong -- somewhere, anywhere. Most readers should be able to relate to that. Jonah can't even inhabit his own skin comfortably, inventing false persona after false persona. \\"It is as if each possible life is just beyond his reach. He thinks of a fly against a windowpane, tapping steadily against a transparent barrier. He always gets to a certain point, he thinks, and then he fails.\\" Troy never moans about how the world is out to get him and keep him down. He could be considered a loser, but he has the self-awareness and good grace to recognize where the roots of his problems lie: \\"What an idiot he'd been. What an idiot!\\" During court-ordered rehab, Troy feels guilty not only for his own actions but for enabling other people's failures. \\"At least there is no one here he knows. That would be terrible -- to have to sit here with one of his former customers, thinking that this was someone he had aided and abetted down their trail of addiction, someone he had wronged.\\"And good writing will elevate any story, no matter what the content. Dubus' monotonic prose often feels as if it were written expressly for the dullards who populate it. Where Dubus plods and trudges, Chaon springs nimbly from word to word. He's a keen observer of behavior, sketching in the beautifully mundane minor details that bring a character fully to life. Most of his work has been in the form of the short story, and his first novel features several perfect little character sketches that could spin off into their own self-contained tales with some elaboration.\\"She was already frowning when she opened the door, a small, thin, bedraggled woman with a mole like the head of an emerging earthworm at the corner of her eyelid and a pelt of gray-black hair on her head. Her jowls and lips were turned down in an exaggerated arc, which nevertheless deepened when she saw him standing there. She stared at him hard, her lower lip protruding and her nostrils widening as if she were furious, as if he were an enemy she were preparing to defend herself against. 'Yes?' she exclaimed.\\"In just a few sentences, the reader already knows quite a bit about what kind of person this is. For my review, I could just continue to string together particularly good paragraphs from \\"You Remind Me of Me.\\" There's certainly no shortage of candidates for excerpting, and Chaon's words could do a much better job than mine of selling his book. But I'm far too fond of my own voice to go the easy route, and besides, I had to share my own dog story with the world. So let me just say in my inadequate but enthusiastic way: This is a really, really good book."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"Maybe I'm one of the few people in \\"contemporary reading\\" who loves short stories. They used to be more popular in general society than they are today. Short story collections won big awards, like Pulitzers and National Book Awards. Short stories were the way to break into the market, published first in magazines and anthologies. Now, when we've tried to help a friend publish his collection of short stories -- excellent stories, I assure you, already published in Penna. Game News, Field & Stream, and the like -- most publishers are leary. So many said, \\"Short stories just don't sell.\\"Those publishers should read this collection. Wow. I loved it. Lyrical writing, interesting characters. I'm actually looking forward to going back thru them a second time, to absorb more, to see them again from a new perspective."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"First let me say that Chaon is a gifted writer. His choice of words sometimes borders on poetic. He is able to string a whole plot along with a series of vignettes that flesh out the book and make it an interesting read. I enjoy his writing, when I am in the right sort of mood.However, Chaon is not the type of writer you want to read before bedtime. His stories are so realistic that they are, in some ways, depressing. One feels like the characters in his books are sitting too close to you, breathing in your face with halitosis and revealing too much about themselves. Sort of like the person sitting next to you on the plane who tells you all their sordid life details. You are a bit repelled, but also embarrassingly, interested.This book is not uplifting, easy reading, simple to follow or for those who like action packed plots.This book is thought provoking, unbearably real, gritty, haunting and a sometimes a dismal portrayal of the hopelessness of those who seem unable to focus themselves in life.I liked his book \\"Among the Missing\\" better than \\"You remind me of me\\" because the ending in this book seemed staged and too simplistic. After painfully detailing the development of the characters the ending had a \`lets wrap this up and be done with it feel\\". Thus 4 stars."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"I'm reviewing this novel late; I read it a while back. But I am surprised at the majority of positive reader reviews. Like reading the prologue in Cunningham's The Hours, reading this novel's equisitely written first few pages was like having the icing before the cake and finding the cake itself bland and flat (and, well, so depressing, too, without being interesting, and dark without really terrifying, and the style itself throughout, irritatingly problematic).But there is a brilliance and depth of image in those first pages, and I hope that one day in another novel--or novella?-- this author--I think he's fairly young--will give whatever time it takes to sustain (for the most part) that same genius through to the end. I also loved the title."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"A few chapters into this book I realized I had read it before. (note to Amazon - it would be great for the purchases of one form of a book, say hardbound, be noted when I look at another form, like paperback or Kindle). I searched my bookshelves for the first copy, but then remembered it was something I gave away as \\"readable, but I don't want it back\\". That basically summarizes my feelings about this book. It was well-written and worth a read if there is nothing that looks better in your stack of unread books, but not something to save, re-read or cherish."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"I had high hopes for this novel. I have long been a fan of Chaon's short stories. But somehow his first novel is not in the same realm.The book starts off very well, but soon devolves into a series of flat, disjointed snippets from various stages of the characters' lives. Unlike other readers, I am not at all put off by what some call \\"depressing\\" circumstances in a novel. Yet as I continued to read Chaon's book, I came to realize that I just didn't care about his characters. That's what bothered me the most. And for me, it was a struggle to continue reading about characters I don't care about. Your mileage may vary."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"I had a hard time getting into this one. Most of it was my fault, so I won't try to be too negative with this. I had to travel for work and then went on vacation, and both times I forgot to take it with me. So, it took me awhile to get back into it. Overall, I think it was worth it. It's listed for new at under $3 and used for a penny, so it may be worth your while to explore one of those options."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"I so rarely come across a novel that is so addictive, so utterly stunning I had to give it 5 stars. I have literally been forcing myself not to plow through this book so I will be able to enjoy it for a longer time. I cannot praise Chaon enough. His ability to take you out of a room and transport you into this other world he has created is simply phenomenal. In addition, every sentence is a masterpiece. I've gone back just to reread passages in order to savor them like a rich dessert. This writing is gorgeous, magical and intoxicating. I highly recommend this book and cannot wait for his next."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"This is a novel unlike any other I have read--when I finished it, I felt it in my entire body. I can't even say I \\"liked\\" it because reading it was like living it, like feeling the weight of life in every single one of the characters. It's awesome--in the old, true, astounded sense of the word. I feel like we should put it somewhere for safekeeping so it will last until the end of time."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"Chaon's novel is a story of identity as revealed by Jonah and Troy, half brothers separated by adoption. Troy is placed for adoption, Jonah kept by their mother, both growing up in small Midwest towns. Troy wanders from the influence of his adoptive parents to that of his cousins, low-level drug dealers living in a trailer. Jonah wanders in his own way between his mother Nora and his grandfather, both running from the life they lead.Eventually, Jonah arms himself with documentation of Troy's existence, and sets out to find him. Troy, separated from his son and wife by a series of his own bad choices, is left with his job at the Stumble Inn, his drug rehabilitation classes at the junior high, and the electronic monitoring ankle device that is part of his parole agreement. When Troy realizes that his co-worker Jonah is actually his half-brother, and that Jonah has lied to him about everything-from their biological connection to the kind of life Jonah lived with their mother-Troy experiences a kind of mirror-vision clarity about his own life. In a series of blundering moves, Jonah makes one final and nearly disastrous entry into Troy's life, setting in motion events that will settle one man's life and throw the other's into an orbit of despair.Chaon's prose is dense, and at times annoyingly over-written. At the same time, he is able to endow a generally disparaged segment of American culture, the working, under-educated poor, with the dignity of their own being. Neither Troy nor Jonah has big dreams or even ambitions to have big dreams. They are surrounded by people who have settled for what they could grasp, unconcerned with great ambition or legacies beyond their families. They do not travel, or want to. They are grounded in a place where a man can become a prosperous community leader by owning three bars and a bowling alley. And yet, they have that dignity, and for Troy life turns out to be good enough. Sometimes that's all you can ask.I struggled with this review because the story is fairly simple-but the relationships are not. Armchair Interviews says that if you like stories of complicated relationships you can really get into, give this book with an intriguing title a try."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"Dan Chaon's first novel delivers on the promise of his impeccable stories. YRMOM is a haunting and desperately sad story with too many plot twists and turns to recount here, though suffice it to say the plot will sweep you along and before you know it, your heart will be breaking. Chaon writes well about completely average people, neither glamorizing nor denigrating their completely normal and honest hopes, passions, errors, what have you. This makes for a refreshing book free of unnecessary stylistic or intellectual showmanship; this is instead a classic, almost realist, American novel, the like of which is, sadly, seen all the more rarely these days. Pick this book up, definitely."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"This novel brings out so much feeling in the reader...it has gut-wrenching moments and unforgettable characters. It's skillfully crafted. For me, it's about loneliness, and the need for connection. Achingly beautiful. Great story-telling. Don't miss it."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"It's a testament to Dan Chaon's brilliant writing that I put this book down after the first 50 pages. The opening incident -- a little boy is mauled by the family dog -- was so traumatic I felt physically ill. As I continued to read, I realized things probably wouldn't get much better for this child, or any of the other characters. I really didn't want to put myself through it.Clearly, I'm a little conflicted. I'd recommend this book to anyone who appreciates a masterful use of language. If, however, you're sensitive to reading about bad things that happen to children, you might want to give it a pass."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"Every so often you stumble upon a writer that captures all the pain and joy of living onto each page. Dan Chaon has made the leap from short stories to the full-length novel with astounding ease here, examining the lives of his characters carefully and compassionately, even though they are often difficult to love. How much of each person's life is the consequence of his own choices, and how much is simply the luck of the draw? Can we ever use circumstances to explain away our inability to move forward, or does person responsibility trump \\"bad breaks?\\" Truly an exquisite novel, one that will stay with the reader long afterward."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"I've enjoyed Dan Chaon's wonderful short stories and have been wanting to read his first novel for quite some time, but found this work slightly disappointing and frustrating. Chaon is quite evidently a master stylist, but occasionally I thought he got a bit carried away with some of his language choices at the expense of the story. That is, too often I was very aware that a writer was at work here, more than a storyteller. While I love the beautiful writing, I'm happier when the writer disappears, and when the writing itself is a bit less flowery. One other complaint is that every character in the book is utterly miserable, and after awhile I became tired of wading through their miseries. Sorrow and regret are not the only human emotions worth writing about! This is my weakness, but I also felt sidetracked by the jumping back and forth from the sixties to the nineties, and the detailing of minor character's lives, such as Judy, Troy's mother-in-law. (The minor characters are also miserable). What are the best things about this book? Chaon's mastery of language, especially where he floats in and out of a child's consciousness (Jonah at the start of the novel and later Loomis): I wish he had stayed there longer. Overall, this is quite an accomplished work, and if you enjoy unique language choices and highly intelligent writing, and can put up with unhappy characters, you might very well like this book. The jump from story writer to novelist is a big one, and I suspect that Chaon's next novel will be even better."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"This is a near-perfect book: The writing is unique, the story is believable and interesting, and the characters are ones you are disappointed to have to say good-bye to at the end.The first half is better than the second, and the only reason I don't give the book five stars is that the ending doesn't fulfill the expectations of the incredible beginning. I really don't like too much action and twists in the novels I read, but the ending could have been a little more captivating. The last few chapters build to a climax and then suddenly jump ahead a few years; I had to learn about the resolution through flashbacks instead of being present during those events.Despite its flaws, this is a very touching book and I hope that Chaon will hone his skills with more full-length novels in the near future. I look forward to meeting more of the people in his imagination."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"Let me start by saying this was a very good book, one I enjoyed immensely, but not one I could read for an hour or so before falling asleep. I actually had to have pencil and paper handy and had to jot down who was who, what was what and where was where, sort of keep a running track of things, especially on the who was who part. But it was worth it. Keeping everything in mind as I read was a bit difficult, a little trying, but I liked doing it, liked following how Mr. Chaon's mind works, liked his story.Jonah Doyle lives with his sadder than sad mother in South Dakota, with his grandfather too and with Elizabeth, a doberman. When he was six Elizabeth tried to take his face off and left him horribly scarred. If that wasn't bad enough, his mother gives him a lifetime of rejection. And to make matter still worse for poor Jonah, before his birth sad mommy gave up his brother for adoption and wishes she'd given Jonah up as well.And meanwhile older brother Troy, that brother who was adopted out, knows he's adopted, but he's loved, popular and happy, even if he is running around with the wrong kind of crowd.Jonah wants to find his older brother, the one his mother misses and he will and it's the meeting of these two brothers that really resonated with me, how they changed. Nothing in this story was as I thought it would be, but I sure did like it."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"1) novel ends right where it begins. No character changes over time.

The book is a pleaser - it stays with you long after you've read it, so you wish to reread it."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"You Remind Me of Me is a novel that slowly worms its way into the very fabric of your being. Chaon's characters are so flawed and utterly human that the reader can't help but accept them as part of everyday reality.Chaon also plays with chronology and perspective to the point that the book almost feels like a puzzle, which mirrors the theme perfectly. The structure of You Remind Me of Me demands both patience and concentration from the reader, and that's not a bad thing.The story itself revolves around several characters that, as the plot progresses, are inextricably linked through the circumstances of conventional misfortune. There are no unbelievable coincidences in You Remind Me of Me, for as the story unfolds, Chaon is careful to keep everything strictly within the bounds of reality.Because of the jumps in time and narrative, this book didn't \\"wow\\" me right off the bat. Early on, I wasn't sure what was going on, and had trouble investing in it as a result. However, as I kept going, plot points began connecting, and at that moment I realized the magnificent craftsmanship that went into You Remind Me of Me. Furthermore, it revealed itself as a deeply engaging story.You Remind Me of Me is a rare blend of creative structuring and captivating story. If you have patience and don't mind a little brain tickling, I know you'll enjoy You Remind Me of Me.~Scott William Foley, author of Souls Triumphant"},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"The first thing you can say about this book is that it could never pass for a \\"crowd pleaser\\". Maybe that's because this novel hits the raw nerve in all of us had we not found loving partners, or meaningful work, or mothered or fathered wonderful children. This is a strange look at loneliness and the thirst to find real meaning and to bond with whatever we can find that will give us that meaning.What struck me so deeply about this story is, here you have these ordinary guys--young men doing grunt jobs: in bars, kitchens, whatever, trying to just get by and the unexpectedly deep and dark and profoundly empty spaces that we are drawn into as we read along. I was so moved by the tender portrayal of Jonah and his lonely search as well as his brother--and all that their lives entailed. This is a very beautiful and moving story about the true depths in the very human beings that are in our midst, everyday. In the malls we shop, in the restaurants we frequent.So recommend this amazing story,and don't be fooled by the seemingly ordinary here; there's so much going on with these men and Chaon portrays it all like a true master."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"Everything promised in Dan Chaon's short stories in the cherished AMONG THE MISSING collection comes to full fruition in this incandescent novel YOU REMIND ME OF ME. Without question Dan Chaon is emerging as one of the more important writers of the 21st Century, so gifted is he at creating unique characters and then guiding them through the crusty terrain of the earth in search of the meaning of existence. He is a consummate storyteller, a master of the English language, and a social observer along the lines of the greatest thinking writers of the last century.YOU REMIND ME OF ME, significantly distilled, is the story of two men who share the same biological mother Nora, a woman so fragile that at age 16 she gives the first born son (Troy) for adoption, never marries, keeps her next son (Jonah) born four years later, only to descend into mental illness and guilt of her actions with her first born son and the disaster of her second born being mauled to death by her dog, reviving as though resurrected to a life of physical distortion and loneliness. Thus separated by Nora's decisions, the two boys grow into adulthood without significant direction: Jonah fears relationships because of his physical scarring creating a self concept of appearing a beast and spends his youth as a loner, while Troy's adoptive parents disintegrate, allowing him to bond with a young couple who introduce him to the life of drugs, and his downward swirl ends in a life as a bartender, divorced from a junkie wife and left with a son (Loomis). Jonah longs for the 'brother' he never knew and after Nora's suicide he strikes out to find his only blood relative. All of this happens on the plains of middle America - St. Bonaventure, Nebraska and Little Bow, South Dakota - and Dan Chaon knows these vast stretches of lonely terrain and the isolation of small prairie towns well. He uses the places like a stretched sheet over a morgue bench to dissect the fragile lives of his characters and the folk who populate these spaces. It seems as though reducing the matrix of the novel to such places erases the distractions of life so that he can meditate on the important things. &quot;The true terror, Jonah thought, the true mystery of life was not that we all are going to die, but that we were all born, that we were all once little babies like this, unknowing and slowly reeling in the world, gathering it loop by loop like a ball of string. The true terror was that we once didn't exist, and then, through no fault of our own, we had to.&quot; And the thoughts come not only from the young men but from the life experiences of the elderly, such as Judy - the grandmother of Troy's son Loomis: &quot; She is aware of herself dividing. There is a reasonable self, floating above her perception, a practical mind that observes the sensual organism. She is aware of herself as muscle and fat wrapped in a damp skin, aware of herself as a dry, yellow-tasting tongue, aware of the matrix of sounds that spreads out from the center point of her body, the interstate of blood moving, the grasping tendrils of the spirit, seeking purchase.&quot;The story progresses to Jonah's finding Troy, desperately seeking connection to someone, finding that connection through distorted lies about his life that promise a bond with Troy, and the manner in which the earlier referenced 'baby' (Loomis) provides that bond is the odd resolution of this engrossing tale. Jonah's desperate need to connect with Troy finds words from a inebriate mouth: &quot;People seem to think it's all either nature or nurture, or some combination, but you know what? I think it's even worse than that. It's all...random. It's all chaos and luck and whether you're like...stupid and cowlike , like YOU, or else you have some inkling of how deluded it all is.&quot; These searchings for meaning close the book in a flashback to the time when Nora was in labor with Jonah: &quot;It's hard to believe that this is how it's done. That this is how we get here into the world, by accident or design, the microscopic pieces of ourselves bourne by fluids and blood and growing into a tiny kingdom of cells inside someone else's body. It seems so difficult to become alive. So improbable.&quot; &quot;How can you be alive when every choice you make breaks the world into a thousand filaments, each careless step branching into long tributaries of alternate lives, shuddering outward and outward like sheet lightning.&quot;Yet in addition to all of the profoundly philosophical diversions Chaon writes, he is also deeply concerned with his characters - ALL of them - like the guardian of a small town of disparate citizens, each of whom has a semblance of life and each of whom finds validation from each other. He makes the beauty of nature visual with his poetry, he uses subtle techniques of style to enhance the momentum of how he unfolds the depth of his story, and he leaves us inextricably bonded to some of the most memorable characters you are likely to encounter in any author's books. Savour this jewel of a book with a slow and addictive read. Dan Chaon has the gift."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"I ordered this book after reading the mostly phenomenal customer reviews, but I just didn't like it nearly as much as the rest of you seemed to. The writing is good; I will say that. I think my main problem was how much I disliked the character of Jonah. It may sound too simplified to say I'm an animal lover, but honestly, I was miserable from the (near) beginning following the Doberman episode, which I blame on Jonah even if he was a child. And the later episode with another dog really seals my feelings toward him. I couldn't stand that sad sac weirdo. Troy I liked more, and there were times I felt empathy for him. All in all, I was glad to finish it and start a new book."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"This is a novel that I had to read, put down, and have to get up the motivation to read again. I lasted until about page 200, and I had to set it down. Maybe I will pick it back up in a few days, but I am not thinking that I will.Admittedly, one of the reasons I did not like this book is a bias I have against wordy authors, of which Chaon is certainly one. The action in this book - if it may be called that - is very slow, which is primarily due to the author's (in my view) frustratingly wordy text.I would gladly overlook such a thing if the characters and plot were interesting. In You Remind Me of Me, the characters were quite stagnant and were not people that I was at all fascinated by. While the mode of storytelling, oscillating between different characters at different times, injected a little forward motion into the book, I can't say that I cared enough about the characters or direction of the story to continue \\"piecing together\\" the fragments into a story.I can see how some people would like this book, though. The prose is very solid (if lengthy) and the characters are sharply drawn. Chaon is a decent story teller. It is just that he was not telling a story interesting enough to get past its wordiness and stagnance."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"It's hard not to appreciate Chaon's talents. He writes with an effortless ease. He's insightful, has a way with literary empathy, he weaves threads of a tale together well. And yet...The cores of his characters' stories are, if not rotten, then mal-grown. There is an unrelenting 'wide of the mark' theme to their lives that, in the end, gutted me. Even now, I'm trying to figure out what I'm going to read as an antidote to this malaise.'You Remind Me of Me' is authentic, it's accurate, it's truthful...but it's also, in its own 'death by a thousand cuts' way, a journey with its own cost. It is as good as it's being rated here, but beware: if you're looking for a well-written, uplifting novel, you may get the former, but certainly not the latter."},{"Title":"You Remind Me of Me","review":"Nora Doyle had two sons: Jonah and Troy. The latter she gave for adoption because she felt too young to raise a child. The novel is constructed like a jigsaw puzzle and the reader slowly becomes acquainted with the various characters. Nora the depressive and suicidal mother, Jonah the unlucky father who is caught in drug dealing and who is refused the custody of his son Loomis and Troy's long search for his lost brother with the help of The PeopleSearch Agency.The characters are extremely well drawn and the author skilfully explores their emotional paths as they all fatally blotch every opportunity they are given. It seems that everything the characters attempt to achieve is doomed to fail. In this sense it is a remarkable novel about failure, oblivion and destruction by apparently everyday minor incidents. It is a claustrophobic tale in which there is not a single destiny which does not go awry. Quite an achievement when one considers that it is Dan Chaon's first novel."},{"Title":"How To Make Your Business Run Without You","review":"After owning a jewelry store for 20 years with 16 employees I had a consulting company come into my store. 30% of what they did is exactly what this book shows you what to do.I have since sold my store and am a consultant in the jewelry industry helping people run a better buisness.

Oh, yeah: after that they tell you what they already told you. And then the rest of the book is filled with \\"well this isn't related to our thesis, but you might be interested in this other stuff anyway.\\"I'll save you the $38 cover price right now ... this book tells you but one practical thing: publish a detailed operations manual for your business. That's it! Nada! Finis! Unless you, as a business owner, believe that half a page offering recommendations in FONT STYLES is important, you are well advised to stay away. This book is a rip-off."},{"Title":"How To Make Your Business Run Without You","review":"If you want to actually apply concepts of operations development to your own business, especially if you have 0-20 employees, you'll do well with Carter's book. You'll find short chapters, with simply stated to-do items and an understandable how to guide for setting up business operations. For my money, it's a steal at the price. If you can't glean one, single idea for bettering your business that's worth the 38 bucks, you're not paying attention. I've shaved thousands of dollars off my overhead expenses thanks to Chapter 15 alone. It's a lot of common sense stuff, but it was obviously common sense stuff I wasn't doing very well.Books can only jump start your thinking and action - you're still the one who has to be willing to do the work. This is the best jump-start I've ever had for building my business."},{"Title":"How To Make Your Business Run Without You","review":"\\"Make Your Business Run Without You\\" is a seminal piece that takes an important subject matter, adds its own unique perspective along with proven concepts, rules and techniques; and then goes beyond what other books that cover similar topics provide.It shows the practical and practicable aspects of the proper way to do operate that seems obvious to many if not most small businesses, but of which most business fail to do as owners fall into the trap of the inability to see the big picture beyond the immediate fires they are trying to put out, as well as the hands-on role they're playing, even if the myriad issues that occur-- working harder than ever, not earning as much, frustration, etc.-- are a recurring theme, and owners continue to fight the symptom and get too busy doing it that they fail to step back and do what's necessary to move to the next level, a level that actually fixes while making all current symptoms irrelevant.This books shows you how, in a way that other great books espouse, such as the importance of creating systems and processes as well as documentation. People refer to Michael Gerber's E-Myth Revisited, or Robert Kiyosaki's books or a lot of others that address the theme well. But as good as those books are (and they are), what makes Susan Carter's book stand out is because her book is actually \\"complete.\\" It doesn't just tell you what you need to do, but shows you exactly \\"how\\" to do it, with ample examples you can use immediately, and without needing to second-guess yourself if what you're doing (if you're even following what is taught in the other books) is the ideal way.Of course, there is no wrong way to do these things, but it's good to finally see actual samples of structures and outlines of how to go about it. But there's more, because not only does Carter's book provide this, but it also shows concrete examples and an actual manual in doing so, on top of all the other parts of the book that by themselves would have even been enough to make it superior."},{"Title":"How To Make Your Business Run Without You","review":"I read the reviews and this seemed like the book one had to have. Well, it probably is but most of the important stuff could have been written on 2 pages:Make your business a niche business.You need an Operations Manual so that you business runs consistently.Treat it like a franchise but you don't have to franchise it.Here is a sample Operations manual Table of Contents, here is a sample procedure.Encourage the employees to follow it.Fair bit of E-Myth stuff but at least more detail.Not even 2 pages.The Operations manual seems rather oddly structured; not by department as is more common but by some other system I haven't worked out yet.Some sections are by procedure; Sales policies & ProceduresSome by Task; MerchandisingSome by Time; Daily Operating ProceduresWhich would be ok if they were not all top level Sections.Anyway the book certainly has value but a bit of Internet research will get you the same if not better.As for the person who paid a consultant $165 an hour to do it?

But, everything that the author wrote is a common sense to me and it can be easily found via internet without reading a particular book. I flip back and read it fast since there's nothing really new for me. It's almost like wasting time when I read the book. I am really sorry for such negative comments but I feel that I had wasted time and money to read a book that I thought can benefit me/inspire me.

This being said I'm going to compare the two in this review.Both books are for anyone who has wanted to turn their aquarium from a mix and match display to a strict biotope aquarium. They are divided in two parts, the first is a \\"practical section\\" that covers the water cycle, substrates and decoration, plants, water conditions and planning. Aquarium Designs Inspired by Nature (ADIBN) goes into some detail on the subjects but doesn't go as far as a textbook and make it boooooring. It is good information for aquarists of all levels. In the book, \\"Creating a Natural Aquarium\\" (CANA), the same information is covered in Part 1, but to a lesser degree and CANA omits some small sections. Part 1 of both books is really very similar and I wouldn't choose one based on the small differences. The important factor, in my opinion, the differences in part 2.Part 2 of ADIBN covers more biotopes than CANA, which I will list below. The biotopes that are in both books are virtually the same. I this list I will list the biotope sections and then which book it is in.Mountain Stream (CANA) split up in ADIBN*Chinese Mountain Stream (ADIBN)Central American Stream (BOTH)Central American River (BOTH)Australian River (BOTH)European River (BOTH)*European Lake (ADIBN)Flooded Forest (CANA) Same as BelowFlooded Amazon Forest (ADIBN)Amazon Acid Pool (Both)*Downriver Amazon (ADIBN)*Congo Whitewater River (ADIBN)*West African Streambed (ADIBN)Lake Malawi (BOTH)Darkened Cave (BOTH)*Southeast Asian Stream (ADIBN)Southeast Asian Swamp (BOTH)*Indian River (ADIBN)Brackish Estuary (BOTH)Mangrove Swamp (BOTH)Personally I prefer Aquarium Designs Inspired by Nature because it includes a few extra biotypes and goes into a little more depth about each biotype. Aquarium Designs... is also a larger book so there are more pictures and they are larger. Aquarium Designs... uses the pictures from Creating a Natural Aquarium and adds a few. I like pictures, so this personal preference.CONCLUSION:If you want a little more detail and a few extra biotopes then go with AQUARIUM DESIGNS INSPIRED BY NATURE. If cost is a factor CREATING A NATURAL AQUARIUM is usually cheaper, or if you don't really care about the extra details left out CANA is equally as good as ADIBN. Both books are helpful in pointing you in the right direction and showing natural habitats. No matter which you pick you will be happy. (I Hope) These are the best books I have found (so far) that describe natural environments for the home aquarium.

It quickly became my oldest child's favorite book at age 2 and we had to read it EVERY night, and neither my son, my husband, or myself get tired of it! This is a book creatively written with &quot;sing-song&quot; type poems for each letter of the alphabet and for each page/letter of the alphabet there are beautiful pictures inside a &quot;shadow box&quot; type frame. There's a little character named &quot;Shadow&quot; that you need to help find certain hidden objects on each page, but there are so many pictures, that you can search for a different object each time you read it! Laura Seeley must have spent hours upon hours getting her poems just right, not to mention artwork that you don't see every day! This book is not your typical &quot;A is for apple&quot; type book. Laura gets one's mind really thinking about different ways to look at the alphabet and also includes some phonics-type lessons, without the child even knowing it...it's just plain fun!If you are looking for a perfect gift book, whether for a baby, toddler, preschooler, reader, or teacher, I HIGHLY recommend this book, it is one that everyone enjoys reading! And if you are looking for a book just to add to your own collection, there is no way you could be disappointed with this one!

I suggest utilizing a real shadow box with objects beginning with a letter in conjunction with the book.

I'm already able to read, understand and say correctly several commonly used words and phrases in Spanish. I am not traveling abroad, however, it has been a goal of mine to learn this language. Before page 1, there is vi and vii pages which provides the reader with handy access to Spanish Pronunciation. The rest of the book has the word or phrase you wish to learn in English, such as this:I am glad to meet you. (what you wish to say)Me alegro de conocerle. (how it is written in Spanish)may ah-LAY-gro day ko-no-SAYR-lay. (how to properly pronounce it, capitals where emphasis should be placed).Everything is categorized in an easy to reference and sensible manner. For instance, the first category is \\"Greetings, Introductions and Social Conversation.\\" The second category is \\"Yourself,\\" to many, many others relating to everyday stuff, travel, time, colors, numbers, etc. Just a fabulous mix of things. In the back of the book, there is a great INDEX that has all of the words (in English) that you wish to find in the book quickly, listed by page number and categorized. There is NO GUESSWORK here when you are trying to learn how to speak it correctly, it is so easy to be speaking some basic Spanish after only an hour without peeking into the book. I have enjoyed this so much, I bought several more copies for my immediate family who is interested in learning it with me. After all, we can practice it together and use it throughout the day, sort of an \\"immersion\\" style, although we are all native English speakers. We have swapped this book around several times already and bouncing what we have learned off of one another. It is not only constructive and educational, but FUN! I tried several years ago to learn Spanish off of a CD program alone, but had trouble remembering what I thought I had learned (bouncing our newfound words off of each other reinforces it in my memory). Although I am basically a newbie at this, I feel my confidence building as I begin to recognize Spanish words written as well as spoken. Also, I am starting to get a feel for sentence structure, if even in a small way, by just examining the way each phrase is laid out. I purchased other books that go more into depth about all of that, but for now, this is the book that I am studying to help me get the more commonly used words and phrases cemented in my mind. I cannot believe how something this useful can be so inexpensive. If you have children or other family members that would be willing to dive into learning Spanish, I would certainly buy extra for them so that you all can study and \\"converse\\" together while learning.This book is slightly larger that 5\\"x8\\" and around 1/2 cm thick. But, it is PACKED with really useful words and phrases, and super easy to throw into my medium-sized purse to squeeze in some quick learning whenever I have to sit and wait somewhere. I love this book, and the excitement of learning a new language that I will actually use.I highly recommend this book to anyone new to the language, just beginning, or for those who took Spanish in High School (such as my husband) and would like to brush up on it."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"This is James from James Spanish (the learning Spanish blog).

With over 770 of the most commonly used phrases, the Easy Spanish Phrase Book is an ideal companion to traveling in a Spanish speaking country, as well as a great learning aide to help you memorize some key sentences.The phrases are organized into easy to use categories, so you can quickly find the one that you need. You will find phrases for most common situations.Even if you don't know a single word in Spanish, and have no prior knowledge you should be able to get by in many circumstances with this phrase book. Each phrase also has helpful pronunciation tips to make sure you are understood. Most phrases are short sentences, making them easy to remember and use. Practicing the phrases, paying particular attention to the pronunciation keys, can also help you to feel more comfortable speaking Spanish and build on your confidence.Study topics such as introducing yourself, telling the time, ordering a meal, or making travel arrangements. A little regular study of the phrases will soon get you on the road to being able to have a basic conversation without relying on looking up each individual phrase.For students with a little more knowledge, the book is a useful back up with plenty of phrases and vocabulary that you might not already know. Its handy compact size means that it can easily be carried around to have to hand when needed.While you may not need all 770 phrases, you can memorize some of the phrases that you are likely to use and have the peace of mind that if you get stuck, you can probably find more useful phrases in the book.The Easy Spanish Phrase Book is not a comprehensive way to learn how to speak Spanish but it is an ideal first step. A good phrase book is a great item to have in your language learning \`tool kit', and this one is a great choice.At such a low price, this little book is one of the wisest purchases you can make if you need to speak in Spanish.In closing my review of this product, I'd like to share with you the three Amazon products that I have found most helpful in my pursuit to learn Spanish. If you are truly serious about achieving fluency, I'd recommend getting all 3 of them if you can afford it.1.Lights, Camera, Spanish (Book + DVD): Learn Conversational Spanish by Watching a Romantic AdventureThis is actually a 90 minute movie for Spanish-language learners. It gives the option to watch the movie with subtitles but I'd recommend not using them to improve your Spanish. This \\"movie\\" also includes a workbook so that you can reinforce the Spanish vocabulary words and phrases from the film. The workbook also has lots of exercises to keep you engaged in the film. But be prepared to hear Chilean accents. Although pleasent to the ear, the accents from Chile are very different from most Latin American accents.2.Verbarrator Version 1.1 (Windows Version)This software replaces the traditional verb conjugation books and makes learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs an interactive and fun activity. This should be a required resource for anyone who wants to improve their ability to conjugate Spanish verbs. Especially anyone who is challenged by the drudgery of learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs and who is looking for a new way to make learning how to conjugate Spanish verbs an easy and fun activity3.Diccionario esencial de la lengua espanola de la Real Academia Espanola (Spanish Edition)If you are really serious about speaking the language fluently, then at some point you will need to replace your Spanish-English dictionary and get a pure Spanish dictionary with both the vocabulary words and the definitions entirely in Spanish. I use this one only because it was highly-recommended by a friend from Spain who teaches Spanish."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"For the price, you get a lot of bang for your couple of bucks. Although this little book doesn't cover much material or grammar rules, you can use the ready-made phrases to make more phrases as you increase your Spanish vocabulary. This along with a Spanish/English dictionary helped me pass my introductory Spanish class when I had to write sentences in Spanish for homework. Some other reviewers didn't like it because the phrases sound touristy, overly formal or out-dated, but I would rather learn proper/formal Spanish before trying to master the colloquial. Besides, it is probably safer to use the more-formal Spanish when traveling. What if you get an idiom wrong trying to use the local dialect, offend the natives, and then who knows what may happen?! If you speak formally and get it wrong, the locals might be more forgiving because they'll figure that the gaffe was unintentional. Besides, it is unfair to critisize a $2.00 phrase book for sounding touristy when that is the main purpose for the book-- to help a vacationing English speaker communicate in a Spanish-speaking country. That's it's purpose, and that is just what it does, despite whatever gringo-isms it may contain. Since it is so cheap, it's not a big loss if you don't share my enthusiasm about it's worth (especially if you are going to buy other books anyway and qualify for amazon's free shipping). So whether you are going to travel to a place where the people \\"no hablan en ingles\\" or taking your first Spanish class, you should click on \\"add to cart\\" and buy it today!"},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"An older booklet for which Amazon charges three times the cover price is a good reference for conversational Spanish and small enough for taking with you."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"This little book has been a big help in using Spanish as I help and transport the sick and elderly. It has a high percentage of the expressions you will use (and need)."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"I found The Easy Spanish Phrase Book a bit outdated with the suggested phrases. I purchased it along with the Merriam Spanish-English Dictionary hoping they would partner in a more affective way. I had hoped it would be more helpful, but truthfully it felt like I was in the dark ages of travel with some of the phrases choosen to translate. It's in great need of updating."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"A very good \\"quickie\\"-type language book. Helps you with common phrases. You won't learn much about conjugation here, but for the price, a very valuable addition to my library."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"This is a must have when you're traveling in a Spanish speaking country. Tt covers everything from questions about food to getting help in emergencies. Can't be without it! Wonderful book!"},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"Good for overall basic sentences.

It is just a supplement to other materials, and a darned good one at that.As for the 'other materials' ... I would recommend you use Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use along with Behind the Wheel Spanish 8 CDs and book. Fantastic combination. Many of the same phrases you read in 770 Basic Phrases are on the CDs so you get to actually hear them pronounced."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"I am an instructor in Spanish and I gave everyone of my students this book. They loved it and found it to be helpful and informative. I think it was the best gift I could give to a beginning Spanish student."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"I am just learning Spanish, so I bought the phrase book to help me learn quicker. I really like the way the book is organized into sections such as dealing with medical personnel, ordering food in a restaurant, etc. I also am very pleased with the phonetic pronunciation given with each phrase. I liked the book so much that I bought two other books for friends taking the same Spanish class I am taking."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"This book is a very good value at its price.The topics are laid out very well.The book is very thin and lightweight.The printed format is a bit dated compared to other phrasebooks like Berlitz ..but the content is still very useful."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"Wow, This book is such a great value! I mean, If this book was priced at $12.99, it STILL would be a great value, but for $1.50, It's shocking. This book tell you how to speak basic spanish. The index is usefull incase you need to look up a certain word, for example '' window'', Just go to the index and they will give you a sentecnce and the word window in spanish. Great book and I recomend it to anyone who isn't very fluent in spanish and needs some help. This would be good for students who take spanish in school, it would be great with homework. I would suggest you buy this book before the price increases."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"Has everything you'd expect and a little extra -- but then, who needs a translation of \\"tortillas?\\" If there's a person out there reading this who isn't sure what a tortilla is, ask Google images or your roommate or your grocery store or a Hispanic person (\\"Que es una tortilla?\\") The book also seems more travel-oriented than conversational (\\"How much for a telegram?\\" \\"Where is a pharmacy where they speak English?\\" and \\"I would like an authorized, American tour guide.\\" are the sorts of things in this book) so it isn't what I was looking for but then again, that's my fault, not the book's. My biggest (and only) complaint is with the awkwardness of the content. If you want to send a telegram or understand a tortilla, get this book. If you have trouble remembering the difference between \\"to hug\\" and \\"to be pregnant,\\" wrong book, a verb chart or SparkChart might be more useful."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"This small book is useful for many everyday situations. It's handy and easy to reference. There isn't much other information in it. The dictionary is very limited, so you would still need that to make your way around."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"Nice little book. Easy to take with you. Definatly worth the price."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"This is useless if you know any Spanish. I thought it would contain idioms but this contains only the kind of information you'd need for simple travel. Save your money."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"Sorry, but this just was not very useful for me. It was like $2, but a waste of my money. Didn't use it at all for my spanish class. I really don't recommend it if you are using it for a spanish class."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"A quick reference, light to carry, and great to have at your fingertips when struggling for words in a foreign country.."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"I bought this in a bundle offer. It's thin and fairly confusing. Also, I have a friend who speaks Spanish and she informed me half of the phrases are wrong. This book is pretty much useless. Move on."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"They give what they offer. I ordered a book and I got it the exact day they told me I would have it."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"There are indeed useful phrases for the traveler, but the way they show how to pronounce things is pretty awful at parts and you'd sound really weird pronouncing some of this stuff... for example:English: \\"I want to leave these packages for a while\\" =Spanish: \\"Quiero dejar estos paquetes un rato.\\"Their way to pronounce this is: \\"KYAY-ro day-HAHR ESS-tohss pah-KAY-tess oon RRAH-toh\\"I know how to pronounce things well after 3 years of learning Spanish and speaking with a native every day...Even looking over the small pronunciation guide in Madrigal's Magic Key to Spanish will help a lot more with pronunciation. That sentence is more like \\"KYEH-roh deh-HAR ESS-tohs pah-KEH-tess oon RRAH-toh\\".Anyway, still there are a lot of useful phrases and people will still probably understand some things, even using the book alone. My Spanish boyfriend does think some people actually do only rely on books like these for pronunciation because he says he's heard tourists from America speak similarly to this and that it sounds weird. Even though it's obviously best to read a pronunciation guide AND hearing things being said, if you are only reading how to do it, the book could be a lot more helpful and improved... But for $2 it sure isn't bad."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"Not as great as I thought it would be, but there's some use to it. Many of the phrases are not typical ones everyone might use."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"For the price, this is an incredibly helpful little volume.I like it because, in addition to learning new words in context, I can also practise my pronunciation. I am a novice at Spanish so having phrases to work on is better than one word at a time but also not having lengthy sentences, which I am probably not ready for.The phrases are very memorable, and give the learner a start in how words fit and flow together when actually speaking Spanish."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"I like this book very much. It's a good start has about everything you would need to say."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"Not bad at all for two bucks. I wish i would have had this book before i went to Mexico for the first time. For a traveler who is a gringo its gotta be a buy a few weeks before shoving off. Older book... yes, but not a bad deal if you know little to no spanish at all."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"I like that is has indications of how to pronounce words. That is very helpful if you are just learning Spanish as a second language.As the description says: ...over 770 BASIC phrases. Just what a beginner NEEDS."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"This is a neat little phrase book which is helpful as a supplement to other materials to learn Spanish.

Great for when you don't have time for an actual lesson, like when riding the bus or on break at work."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"Great book at a great price. WE both got one.I haven't gone down to Mexico yet, but I think it will be very useful since I plan to \\"roam\\" and not stay in an exclusive resort.

I feel this will help a great deal."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"i took this with me to Barcelona for 3 months. I have to say looking at it and when i did have it I found it helpful. There are a lot of things in this little book so if you are trying to look quickly it is hard.

So far he hasn't put it down and is constantly asking to be quizzed! Love it!"},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"We recently went to Mexico and some of the words in the book produced a question mark over the heads of the locals there when we used them. For instance, &#34;dispenseme&#34; for &#34;excuse me&#34; - didn't go over well. A waiter told me, when I asked, that I could just use &#34;con permissione&#34; instead. Also, there is not dictionary in the back, which could have been helpful as we spent our time there and needed to try to construct some other phrases. All in all, it was helpful, but could've been a little more thorough. Still, we're continuing with our Spanish studies."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"The common phrases in this book aren't always the same as my other books and references.

When I'm learning a language, I frequently need to back up and review something that came long before--it's just not that easy on Kindle. Also, one complaint I have about this and other 'fast-learning' Spanish books, while there is ample practice on how to ask questions, less attention is paid to how to understand all the possible answers you may get to those questions. That said, it covers many different travel situations, and I have learned from it."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"I would recommend this book to anyone that is interested in learning Spanish.

Your Spanish instructor from eLearnSpanishOnline where I give free video Spanish lessons using my proprietary immersion system. The purpose of this book is to teach you words, phrases and sentences that you will need in order to communicate with Spanish speakers in typical everyday situations. The purpose of the book is not to teach you Spanish grammar. If you are interested in learning Spanish grammar then you should purchase a completely different book.This book gives the traveler lots of vocabulary words and phrases for topics such as Greetings, Customs, Airplane, Train, Taxi, At The Restaurant, Money and Banking, Months and Seasons, Weather, Numbers, Days of the Week, At the Post Office, At The Dentist, Colors, Shopping, Barber Shop, and Sending a Telegram.The best thing about this book is that it is economically priced. Because of its size, it is also very convenient to carry. This makes it a perfect book for backpackers. I had one student that used to go everywhere with this book in his back pocket.The reason why I am only giving this book 3 stars is because many of the Spanish words and phrases in this book are archaic and definitely not the type of words and phrases that you would need to know to live in or to travel to a Spanish speaking country nowadays. For example, there is a section on vocabulary words for sending telegrams. No one in the 21st century would ever think of sending a telegram. This book also lacks a section that covers vocabulary for the Internet.Nowadays it is necessary that you know Spanish vocabulary covering the Internet when traveling to a Spanish speaking country, unless you plan on traveling to a Spanish speaking country and never using the Internet while you are there."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"This book was certainly cheap and it is certainly easy to carry. But it was also almost entirely useless. I know only a little Spanish, but enough that this book was not useful to me, because I already knew how to say anything in it that was meaningful to our travels. My husband, on the contrary, knows almost no Spanish. When attempting to shop on his own, he discovered that this book will tell you how to buy gold cufflinks, scarves, gloves, and almost every item of apparel except shirts and pants. It contains a very strange collection of phrases and does not appear to have been updated since its first publication in the 50s. Not useful if you want to ask the location of an internet cafe."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"This little book it full of useful phrases for a beginner like me to learn and converse with my Spanish speaking friends.

Solid and practical. Easy Spanish Phrase Book has the added advantage to being highly portable.But if you want more (and I expect most of us do) than just a few important phrases, or if you want to know how to make your own original sentences in Spanish, speak them, undertand them, in a very easy format(you even have the option of learning to read and write Spanish with the great book that comes with the course)then I have to recommend you buy both."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"Very useful and easy to use pocket-sized guide to Spanish basics.

Yet this criticism misses the point of a phrasebook. A good phrasebook has organizing principles that enable the non-speaker of a language to quickly find what he or she needs to say, and hopefully be able to pronounce it right.This Dover book is well organized. Another reviewer astutely observed that it is a good idea to study it before you need it.

The book is comprised of more than 770 basic phrases for everyday use which are categorized under topics such as greetings, introductions and social conversation, yourself, making yourself understood, useful words and expressions, difficulties, customs, baggage, and travel: general expressions. The book opens with common greetings such as good morning, good evening, good bye and until next time. Each phrase is accompanied by its Spanish translation and pronunciation. Each sentence, phrase and word is numbered from 1 to 773 with each topic being boldfaced and capitalized, and the parts of speech being denoted by abbreviations such as adj. for adjective, adv. for adverb, n for noun, and v for verb.If you're seeking to learn Spanish as a second language, this book is highly recommended. Persons who have travelled to Spanish-speaking countries have found this book to be quite rewarding in their interactions at the bank, restaurant, hotel and other places they visit. This book also plays an essential role in building your vocabulary skills quickly and efficiently. Spanish beginners and those without prior knowledge of the Spanish language would find this book quite useful in developing their Spanish language skills. The book is conveniently organized for beginners to study topics that they desire. It also relieves the stress of being confined to moving from chapter to chapter in a sequential manner.Some other products that I recommend for Spanish language learners are Rosetta Stone Spanish.Rosetta Stone Spanish (Latin America) Level 1,2,3,4 & 5 Set with Audio Companionis pretty good if you are a visual learner like me. My only complaints are that in Rosetta Stone Spanish the Spanish is rather basic and the course is also very expensive. In order to speak Spanish fluently, you must also learn lots of new words. For increasing Spanish vocabulary, I recommendQuick Study-Spanish Vocabulary Flash Cards-1000 cardsYou get 1,000 of these cards at an excellent price.To speak Spanish fluently besides having a stand alone course as your base and a method to learn new Spanish words, you will also need to master conjugating Spanish verbs. The best product for that is theVerbarrator Version 1.1 (Windows Version)software. The Verbarrator software does a great job of replacing the boring Spanish verb conjugation books and makes learning Spanish verbs enough fun that you will want to use the software every day. And the more you use the tool the quicker that you will learn how to conjugate Spanish verbs and reach fluency. The Verbarrator is probably the best investment that I have made in my journey to learn Spanish because it is a product that I will use daily until I reach fluency. Unlike some learning-Spanish products such as books that you will only read one time or some Spanish courses that you will at the most review 2 or 3 times from start to finish.The last product that I recommend for anyone who is really serious about learning Spanish isThe Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice w/CD-ROM (UItimate Review & Reference Series). This Spanish grammar book covers every aspect of Spanish grammar imaginable. To get the equivalent learning-Spanish value of this one book you would have to buy 3 or 4 books in the Practice Makes Perfect series."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"I know a little Spanish but not as much as I'd like.

The book contains useful phrases that you'd need to know; however, they way they translate them into Spanish is almost overly proper and polite and if you were talking to any native Spanish speaker using these phrases, you would just seem awkward.

Its small size made it easy to carry in a pants pocket. It is organized by groups of phrases that one needs in particular travel situations such as on an \\"Airplane\\", in the \\"Bank\\", at a \\"Restaurant\\" (particularly useful). This made it easy to find a needed phrase quickly. It is the perfect thing to study on the airplane as you begin your trip. But perhaps the most useful feature of the book is the phonetic pronunciation guide for each phase. Knowing the phrase is not very useful if you totally mangle the pronunciation. These pronunciation guides will get your meaning across in most situations. This book will not teach you Spanish and its brevity means you will encounter many situations it does not cover, but it will certainly get you around in most large Spanish speaking cities where many folks speak English and all you need is some occasional help."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"Too many useless phrases like \\"Let me introduce you to my wife\\" and \\"how is your day going?\\" How many non-Spanish speaking travelers are going to be concerned about how someone else's day is going? Sadly, there're not too many survival phrases and necessity words that are essential during traveling. For example, it's missing such concepts as \\"I'm allergic to milk,\\" or peanuts, or you name it. You won't even see such a common word as \\"el bano\\" (restroom) in this book. The author calls it some outdated word that is barely used anywhere. Yes, you can get by with this book if you're not allergic to anything and don't need to use a bathroom, and if your pocket is big enough to squeeze these space-wasting pages along with the maps, documents, money, camera, makeup and other essential things... Do yourself a favor - buy something else!"},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"This books is not very practical..It lacks every day phrases that are necessary in normal conversation,very limited in my opinion.."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"This is a very simple booklet that was made in the 1950's. It was designed for a tourist or business traveler going to Spain. It is a decent resource for that purpose but not practical for Latin American spanish today."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"I bought this book based on the reviews I read here. While I agree that it's a bargain for $1.50, I have to say that I found some of the phrases to be presented as commands or demands, rather than polite requests. For example: \\"bring me a . . . \\" rather than \\"may I please have a . . . \\" I don't speak to people at home like that, and I certainly wouldn't as a visitor to another country.There is some good information in the book, though. If you buy this book, please choose your phrasing carefully."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"I am \\"conversational\\" in Spanish. I am not fluent in the language. But I am comfortable carrying on conversations with native speakers providing they don't start speaking Spanish too fast. This book has been an indispensable tool for me.I have my own method that I have used to learn to speak Spanish. I have tried several methods to learn Spanish with very little progress. But this is the method that has been most effective for me:Use this book and the other Dover Publication: 1001 Most Useful Spanish Words to build up your vocabulary. Read one or both of these books daily just for 5 or 10 minutes each. You can use them when doing some other activity when you'd normally read a magazine or when you are waiting for a bus, train, plane or an appointment.Study with Learning Spanish Like Crazy for 30 or 40 minutes per day. But after you buy the CDs here at Amazon, make sure you follow the instructions that come with the CDs. The instructions tell you how the Amazon customers get to download the revised Learning Spanish Like Crazy lessons for free. The lessons on the CD are good. But the revised ones are great. They're easily the best Spanish lessons that I have used for actually improving pronunication and learning how to think in Spanish. LSLC is expensive but well worth the money.There's one more thing that I did with my learning method. I think this has been the most important or one of the most important things in helping me to learn. And this is a very inexpenisve technique: Whenever I am in my car I have 2 different CDs in the CD changer from Learn in You Car spanish and I'll also have 2 different CDs in my car from Behind the Wheel Spanish. So whenever I am in my car, I'm exposed to different teaching methods and hearing different Spanish speakers. I let them run continuously for 6 or 7 times before adding a different CD from the course.I guess you know what I'm trying to do. I am trying simulate what it would be like to live in a Spanish speaking country using Easy Spanish Phrase Book and 1001 Most Useful Spanish Words along with the other courses that I mentioned. And these books have been one of the key tools in my journey to become fluent in Spanish. You cannot beat this book for the price."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"This is a great book for those learners who know little or no Spanish and need to travel in no time. Of course, on its own it is not so useful if you consider that not only do you have to pronounce the phrases but you also need to understand the answers that native speakers give you. However, at [...] I encourage my students who need to travel to buy it and we use the book to roleplay different travel situations. By working this way, you can profit much more than by just repeating phrases in isolation."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"This is a helpful book in many ways, however it is out of date. I wish I had checked when it was printed, so I would have known that many of the phrases that were commonly used then, are quite awkward now. However, much of the information remains useful.

It is simply not a 'stand alone' type of manual.You cannot learn to really speak Spanish without a complete course to back you up and even then it can be difficult.I have and am getting excellent results using Easy Spanish Phrase Book along withBehind the Wheel Spanish 8 CD course.Many of the same phrases are used on the CDs and this makes learning to speak the language a lot more efficient.Plus, Behind the Wheel Spanish also comes with a book, and this one has over 200 pages of information.If I see something I like in my phrase book, I look it up or listen to it with my Behind the Wheel course.I recommend you buy both and really learn to speak Spanish."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"This book was a life-saver in traveling to the Dominican Republic and only knowing some conversational Spanish, with this book i was able to even order room-service! it was great!"},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"This is a nice little volume to have on hand.

As it was I was looking for everyday phrases (per the title) and this was not it. I don't ride trains and buses and taxis and check into hotels and make dinner reservations on a daily basis. Nor do I go through customs, take boat rides and buy cigars. This is a book for people who are away from home and need phrases for transportation, lodging, restrooms, etc.There is a bare minimum of hello, how are you, and words like who, what, why, but not much that I would ever use in my daily life.

I haven't had to ask for an ashtray or a telegram in a long time. Or ever. The book is pretty old, so these were probably appropriate at the time it was written. There are plenty of other useful phrases though. I like the way that it provides the phrase, the pronunciation, and the English translation very clearly. Many of the phrases might be useful, but not necessarily for a traveler.One more caveat if you are headed to Latin America like I was. This uses Castilian Spanish (spoke in Spain). People in Latin America speak a different flavor to the language, and there is a bit of a bias against those speaking Castilian."},{"Title":"Easy Spanish Phrase Book: Over 770 Basic Phrases for Everyday Use (Dover Easy Phrase)","review":"Small enough to carry along, good value for the price.

There is a 1950's flavor to the phrases - that is, a rudeness and big-city arrogance to the phrases that reminds me of the way people spoke to each other as is the movie THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL.

West gives the Women of Whitechapel voice here and plumbs to the depths of a world of sordid artists and royals. There's a harrowing psychological tale to be told here, no matter who committed the murders. And besides, it's much more interesting to imagine the royals doing it than your average guy on the street."},{"Title":"The Women of Whitechapel and Jack the Ripper","review":"Paul West's novel is an often intriguing, luridly fascinating meditation on the sensational Ripper murders, the very nature of evil itself, the obligations and prerogatives of art, and, ultimately the responsibilities of the artist toward society, and his fellow human beings. West's novel, by his own admission in the foreword, is an exercise in creative license writ large. Using the highly speculative, but nonetheless fascinating &quot;Royal Conspiracy&quot; scenario for the gruesome murder spree that took the lives of five prostitutes in the seamy Whitechapel section of London in 1888, the aesthetic core of the book concerns the Impressionist painter, Walter Sickert's almost Hamlet-like agonized ruminations over his role in bringing the scourge of the murderer upon his forlorn and debased victims. Most of the novel is comprised of Sickert's incessant brooding upon his perveted erotic attraction to the vulgar, dissipated women and their squalid environment, as well as its relationship to his art; his self-loathing and condemnation as a coward who not only fails to act to save the women from their ghastly fate, but, disturbingly, experiences a trace of sordid pleasure as they are butchered in front of his very eyes. West has a formidable vocabulary with which to realize his novel's profound artistic ambitions, but unfortunately that very asset ironically leads to the undesired effect of weakening the work's message and impact. West seems intent on flaunting his facillity with polysyllabics, with the result that &quot;The Women of Whitechapel&quot; is often over-written, with many abstruse, impenetrable passages, several re-readings of which fail to bring any light of clarification or comprehension, much to the reader's frustration That is a shame, too, because there is much that is admirable and thought-provoking in this otherwise seminal work that delves deeply into all the issues resonating from the Ripper crimes, including the institutionalized evils of misogyny, as well as the social and economic iniquities of the Victorian England which is its setting."},{"Title":"The Women of Whitechapel and Jack the Ripper","review":"\\"The Women of Whitechapel\\" is a book that relies on elaborate, even obtuse language in an attempt to capture the spirit and ambiance of Victorian London stalked by a killer. The story is all to familiar to recount, and West relies on a very old and totally disproven Ripper theory (Dr. Gull in a carriage killing off friends of Prince Eddy's secret Catholic wife.) The twist is throwing into play the character of the painter Walter Sickert (another non-placer amongst Ripper theories) to shape the narrative. West's prose is a little over-reaching, but the story, perhaps because of its very familiarity, flows quickly. No surprises here; just $50 words and a tired tale."},{"Title":"The Women of Whitechapel and Jack the Ripper","review":"I followed an online recommendation to this book. As a lover of Alan Moore's From Hell (a graphic novel about Jack the Ripper) and a lover of London's dark side, it caught my interest. But for me the writing was ultimately more turgid than dense, more aligned with the author's inner thoughts than the character's - and somewhat too clever to easily digest. (For example - and this is from memory since I don't still have my copy - if you can work out the exact meaning of \\"He knew he would finally act when his hands were firmly in his pockets\\", then you might enjoy this book more easily than me. Otherwise I can't recommend it.)"},{"Title":"The Women of Whitechapel and Jack the Ripper","review":"This novel is an interesting read (I agree with the other customer reviews to a certain extent, but I'm always eager to learn new words and read with a dictionary close at hand) but rehashes the same old theory of the Royals' involvement. Sir William Gull was aging, in poor health, and debilitated from a stroke at time of the murders. I seriouly doubt he was physically able to murder anyone. He has been discounted as the Ripper MANY times as have the Royals, John Netley, and Walter Sickert, who is the Ripper according to Patricia Cornwell. Her theory will be detailed in her forthcoming book.I attended the Jack the Ripper Conference in April and chatted with Donald Rumbelow, author of \\"Jack the Ripper: The Complete Casebook,\\" as well as other Ripperologists. Don is of the opinion that the Ripper was \\"John Smith\\" or \\"Joe Schmoe,\\" definitely no one famous, and his identity will never be discovered. I tend to agree with him.I would recommend this book for its entertainment value but not for actual Ripper information."},{"Title":"Death Valley Scotty told me--","review":"To read of Death Valley Scotty is to wonder why anybody would want anything to do with such a shameless con artist and liar. To listen to his actual voice, a sample of which can be heard at the Scotty's Castle visitors center at Death Valley, is to be further mystified, as his speaking voice is unremarkable and without nuance. To read this book is to become entranced.Eleanor Houston and her husband, Sam, a park ranger, lived near Scotty's Castle in the late '40s. Scotty had little to do with the castle-like ranch house, other than lending it his name for its mystique. He visited the castle and guests whenever the mood struck him, and made friends with the more permanent residents and neighbors, like the Houstons. Eleanor was taken with Scotty's stories and recorded many of them for posterity in this book.Like any good confidence man, Scotty was an excellent reader of character, and some of the best parts of his stories are his descriptions of historical characters like Shorty Harris, Charles M. Russell, Buffalo Bill Cody, and John Barrymore. Where the reader needs to be careful is when Scotty describes adventures and events. He describes Buffalo Bill teaming up with the Barnum & Bailey circus, but it was Sells-Floto that eventually absorbed the Wild West Show, and not under the most honest of circumstances.But you want to believe what Scotty tells, and that's the value of this book: it provides an accurate and entertaining record of his storytelling ability, as well as his personality. Even remembering that he pulled many a con game and fleeced many a rube (which he more or less admits to), it's difficult to get angry with him when you read these stories.Each chapter is garnished with a black & white photo or two featuring Scotty and some of his human and animal friends. These pictures reveal a convivial man who seems to have been a natural actor. Perhaps he should have continued in show business rather than drifting into mining and grifting.This book is a must for anybody interested in Death Valley Scotty and the eccentric mansion that bears his name. As these stories prove, he may have been a con man, but he was complicated man as well, and in that sense, quite genuine."},{"Title":"Stg 9c Glumly Is (Literacy 2000)","review":"This is a good starter novel for children.

It is divided into two categories: Giants (that which are *huge* obstacles) and Thorns (not obstacles, but the little things that chaff, bother, annoy and wear you down).The book is full great Biblical advise and is devoid of the bland platitudes that generally plague this type of Christian literature.Be warned on two accounts though. First, you *will* find yourself saying, &quot;yup, that's me,&quot; a lot. Secondly, this book can be a &quot;downer.&quot; If you are looking for a happy-sappy pickup, look elsewhere.

The titles is divided into 2 main areas:1. Giantkilling - Obstacles that can be very large and can stare at you face-to-face (fear, bitterness, jealousy, lust, grief, pain, depression, etc.).2. Thornpulling - Obstacles that tend to be smaller but if left alone, can grow and cause you to stumble (habits, cliches, superstition, busyness, impatience, expectations, comparison, etc.).The book is around 90 pages and consists of several 1-2 page devotionals on each topic.

Though rationing is a way of life and entertainment only comes in the form of a festival for tourists, the clever City Council occupies the restless residents with a weekly lottery. How can individuals not play when a five-minute shower a day is a potential prize.However, a missing person interrupts the lottery nirvana when Kennedy, a winner, simply vanishes. Rumors spread quickly, and the concerned Edinburgh leadership hires private investigator Quint Dalrymple to quickly learn the truth. Before he can solve that case, murdered bodies begin to appear in the Leith, leaving the City Council in a panic, a city in fear, and a pressured Quint trying to stop a body count from growing any further.Award winning Paul Johnston's world is radically different from that of today. Global warming has reached extreme levels turning the climate into the Big Heat. Everything seems rationed and centrally controlled. Still Quint remains an interesting character with his obsession for the blues standing out in this drab world. Mr. Johnston brings in his full cast from the previous two books, but instead of the welcome return of old friends, this sends a clever story line spinning into chaos greater than his surrounding countryside. Doomsday fanatics will relish WATER OF DEATH and its predecessors for its descriptive look at an apparently dying society trying to survive. However, readers of other science fiction sub-genres will struggle with the plot's anarchy.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Night Prayer from the Liturgy of the Hours","review":"The Christian \\"Liturgy of the Hours,\\" or \\"Divine Office,\\" includes prayers for various times of day.

Night prayer includes a psalm or psalms, another short scripture reading, an examination of conscience, and various prayers and verses that are used every night (so after a while you'll probably have a lot of them memorized). Night prayer is the shortest and simplest of the daily offices of the Liturgy of the Hours. It can be said in about ten minutes, either alone or with others, and you just flip to the day of the week to know what prayers to say, referring to the appendices to choose a penitential prayer and an antiphon to Mary.Note that there's amore recent editionof this book.

At my seminary (a conservative one) the book is considered to be very good as well. So polar opposite ends of the spectrum agree on something, which is usually a positive sign.Dodd provides extensive historical data that factors into exegesis of John's gospel. He does not transliterate the Greek or Hebrew so those with little or no knowledge of either may become bogged-down; however, using an interlinear or diglot of some kind may help. I would encourage beginners to get acquainted with this work since it will introduce them to a wealth of literature and provide in-depth information on John. That said, this isn't a 'toy' and shouldn't be wielded as such. The work is definitely geared more toward scholars or at least those with a little language/exegetical training under their belt. I bought it before taking five years of Greek and I can say that it is much more useful to me now than before.(Side note: the 3-star review before mine appears to be a review of the seller from whom the reviewer bought their copy; not Dodd's book itself.)"},{"Title":"The Interpretation of the Fourth Gospel","review":"Interpretation of the Fourth Gospel by C.H. Dodd is rightly considered a classic commentary on the Gospel of John. Despite the fact that it was originally published in 1953 it is still very insightful and offers ideas not found very often in commentaries.However, it is not what most people would consider to be a good contemporary commentary. Contemporary commentaries have an introduction that explains the themes, context, author, and other issues that will appear in the book. However, the introduction will usually be relatively short with the bulk of the commentary offering either verse-by-verse or paragraph-by-paragraph analysis of the text. In the case of Interpretation of the Fourth Gospel the introduction comprises more than half of the book and the commentary section offers only limited comments on the text.The other down-side is that the Dodd liberally uses the Greek character set for both words and phrases in the analysis. An interlinear Greek/English Bible would be needed for someone who is not familiar with biblical Greek.For serious students and pastors this book will be helpful, providing excellent lengthy discussion on various religions and philosophies at the time of the writing of the gospel and the leading ideas (themes) developed in the gospel. This will offer an excellent, in-depth lens through which to understand what the author of the gospel teaches about Jesus Christ, the Son of God.There is another way to access the insights in this volume and in the sequel, Historical Tradition of the Fourth Gospel. George R. Beasley-Murray, who counts Dodd as his most important mentor, has written the Word Biblical Commentary: John (2nd edition) which heavily incorporates Dodd&#8217;s insights into his commentary. The Word Biblical Commentary series also liberally uses the Greek character set for both words and phrases in the analysis."},{"Title":"The Interpretation of the Fourth Gospel","review":"The book is what I have expected.

Elizabeth Nowell was Thomas Wolfe's literary agent at the time of his early death. She knew both Maxwell Perkins and Thomas Wolfe well, if she didn't know Thomas Wolfe who could? She spent many years not only as literary agent to Wolfe but many years his friend.She has written a traditional biography taking us from Thomas' birth in 1900 through his life until his untimely death at age 38. She uses many quotations from his personal papers she had and also much of what Wolfe wrote of himself in his books. Not only knowing the key players in Thomas Wolfe's life but also being an active participant herself, helps bring the life of Thomas Wolfe, the writer, to life. This was a man who had to write, who said in one letter that if he couldn't he would surely explode.Though this is a dated biography it is yet a very readable one. Elizabeth Nowell also was the editor of the letters of Thomas Wolfe. Her book remains a valuable edition concerning the life of Thomas Wolfe.Semper Fi."},{"Title":"Dark Mother: African Origins and Godmothers","review":"Lucia Chiavola Birnbaum's most recent book, Dark Mother: African Origins and Godmothers, carves new passageways into the collective unconscious of human spirituality. Her premise-that the oldest veneration known to humankind was of a divinity both African and female-shatters the dominant paradigm. Drawing on the scholarship of archeologists, geneticists, and cultural historians Birnbaum crafts an intricate thesis and supports it with impeccable research. Her words lead us back to our most ancient origins. She brings an astute awareness and reclamation of her roots as a Sicilian American woman to her analysis. In doing so, Birnbaum takes readers on a serpentine journey through time and place and memory where the essence of the Dark Mother resides-in art, in ritual, and in the stories and the ethos of the subaltern peoples of the world. Dark Mother is deeply moving and provocative. Ultimately it is a book that will transform the way we think about gender, race, class, spirituality and cultural legacy. The Dark Mother's values of justice with compassion, equality, and transformation are as vitally necessary today as they were in 50,000 BCE when migrants out of central and south Africa carried them to the wider world. This book is an important contribution to the scholarship of women's spirituality. It is an equally invaluable record of mother-loss and a treatise on humankind's cellular longing for a reunion with the feminine principle of divinity. As intellectually stimulating as it is emotionally compelling, Birnbaum has written a groundbreaking work that challenges and delights."},{"Title":"Dark Mother: African Origins and Godmothers","review":"I have read many books on the Black Goddess and have been disappointed that the most obvious fact about the dark Mother the world over is not recognized. People cannot grasp the meaning of any dark Mother until one connects Her to Her original home and perception. When books don't do this, the document is left in endless speculation \\"on what these icons could possibly mean.\\" They are African women....no mystery there. Lucia Birnbaum's book does not involve itself with speculation or fanciful tales about the dark Mother. She bravely goes to the source;....to Africa, to Kemet, to Carthage, to West Asia, to Sicily, to the folktales and readings of native Southern Italians, to the dreams and theories of dark others and to her own wise knowing. Her book does not just connect the dots clearly to Africa and beyond but she also unites herself with people all over the world who dream of a more humane and just world. This work represents for me the next level. It is not womanism, humanism, environmentalism, new age or anything else. It is the gradual maturity and transcendence of everything. It is the bubbling forth of basic truths laying dormant for generations. Wonderful Wonderful Wonderful work."},{"Title":"Dark Mother: African Origins and Godmothers","review":"As a young girl I liked to read encyclopedia articles on people or countries or history. Though comprehensive and informative they were always linear, lacking the unexpected and unusual. But here is a book that gives us the meandering trail of the DARK MOTHER, the astounding story of the primordial earth diety first worshipped in Africa and subsequently spread by African people to every continent. It is a new understanding of why so many traditional peoples, especially those who live in rural/agrarian areas, still revere female deities transmogrified into &quot;black&quot; virgins in the Catholic and Eastern churches, adopted by Latin American indigenous cultures, and found widely in Asian religions as well. Lucia Birnbaum provides the evidence for an understanding of the depth and ferver of emotion around what appears to be a deeply unconscious connection with a fecund female earth that has always and still provides for life on earth. Starting from memories of her Sicilian grandmothers' stories and practices, she weaves genetics, archaeology, art, geography into a rich and fascinating story of global religious practices that, surprisingly, makes the whole of humankind one literal family. A great read!!"},{"Title":"Dark Mother: African Origins and Godmothers","review":"For those of us who want to build a good society Dark Mother: African Origins and Godmothers offers a unifying metaphor for humanity of justice, equality and transformation.

Considered revolutionary and dangerous at the time, this theory has now been substantiated by increasingly solid archeological evidence. Building on the foundation of that theory, Lucia Chiavola Birnbaum postulates that if blacks were the original people, it follows that any original divinity must also have been black. Then, with an abundance of new research and evidence, Birnbaum demonstrates that that deity was female.

It does not fit easily into the categories of history, biography or psychology, and yet it has elements of all of them. The author has obviously written it for sheer personal pleasure and this sense of fun - of which the splendid Jacky Fisher himself would have thoroughly approved - is communicated to the reader. It is no fault of the writer that Fisher remains an enigma at the end of it, a man of vast contradictions, enthusiasms, energy, genius and simplicity, but the journey is enjoyable on every page. Fisher was a force of nature who tackled every challenge, regardless of size, with zest, verve and originality and the story of his whirlwind career, and his transformation of the Royal Navy has much of the epic about it. Few men can have had greater vision, or a greater gift for grasping the potential of technology for transforming organisations and national destinies. Much of what he did and said could serve as a textbook for today's business schools - while the rest might have marked him for a straitjacket. For all his greatness however, he was diminished by his last years and by Churchill's disastrous decision to recall him to the Admiralty soon after the outbreak of the First World War. Old, and by now unstable, his tenure was marked by huge miscalculations and personal behaviour that swung erratically between the inspired and the lunatic. Those who enjoy this unique book will be no less delighted by Fisher's idiosyncratic memoirs - entitled &quot;Memories&quot; - which are an eccentric and haphazard collection of ideas, reminiscences and dictums (slogans might be a better word). This is long out of print, but well worth the seeking."},{"Title":"Fisher's Face; or,: Getting to Know the Admiral","review":"I'm reading this book for the second time now and its every bit as fresh as during the first go round.

Well done, I'm searching the back list for your other titles."},{"Title":"Fisher's Face; or,: Getting to Know the Admiral","review":"I read this book in Cyprus, and there, Fisher's adventures whilst Admiral of the Mediterranean fleet seemed strangely poignant. The book is so unusually written that I actually thought that I was about to meet him at any point. I wish that I had, because as a life long lover of the navy, I find Fisher to be a most compelling character. There can be few people in this century that would be a more interesting correspondent. I wish that I could write to him now on the Web instead of writing this. If there is a more revealing (and one always feels, only slightly speculative), colourful and fun biography about anyone at all, pray tell me about it because this book was truly superb!"},{"Title":"Fisher's Face; or,: Getting to Know the Admiral","review":"For those of us who are thoroughly rapt with the Royal Navy; following Mr. Massies &quot;Dreadnought&quot;, Mr. Manchesters volumes on Churchill, and Winstons volumes on himself; this book will make your day.Jan Morris via the wonders of surgery can take magnificently opposite points of view. In the same paragraph she/he can be the disgruntled fellow officer and a breath later the wife of that same affronted officer, enraptured by the demon Admiral Fisher; who has just put her husband down. Fisher was a man who would destroy many a career without compunction , but in such a way that the victims would name their first male child after him. Go figure.Winston-O-Files will find little here but two characters so similar, so individual, and so revolutionary, that they could have been twins.Ms. Morris writes this book in the second person taking us into Admiral Fishers quarters on board the &quot;Renown&quot; and letting the effusive and entertaining and somewhat comedic Admiral lead us on a tour of his life. Morris is clearly in love with Jacky and through attention and sensitivity writes a gripping and compassionate biography.Wedge this book in next to your Manchester and Churchill and, oh'ya, your James Morris"},{"Title":"Fisher's Face; or,: Getting to Know the Admiral","review":"Sir John (Jacky) Fisher was the driving force behind the modernisation of the British Navy in the late 19th and early 20th Century. At the time the British Navy was the defining power of the Worlds largest Empire. Fisher was responsible for a change over from coal to oil, for introducing turbine engines, encouraged submarine warfare, great fire power, greater gunnery practice and so on. He retired before World War One, but was recalled during it. His career had been helped by his energy, his audacity, his willingness to overturn convention, and brook no oppostion. He had favourites, but many rivals. He largely failed the test of active warfare and resigned in humiliation after the failure in the Dardenelles and the draw in Jutland. He died in 1920.Jan Morris was born in 1926 and says in the book that she has been haunted by Fishers face (hence the title) since her childhood. In the 1950's she gathered material to write this book, but did not do so until 1995. She feels guilty about this, in that she corresponded with a large amount of people who knew Fisher, but they did not see the end result.The book is more a trawl through the artefacts - letters, pictures- which she has accumulated, than a strict history. She has visited a number of places that were important in Fisher's career, and she imagines what it must have been like to be Fisher or to be with Fisher during major events. I found this a bit disconcerting, as I found it hard to know what was documented fact and what was Morris's imagination. Nonetheless Fisher's story is told well, and something of the challenge of his character and the impact of his leadership is conveyed. There is a fascinating story of taking an organisation of the size, scope and impact of the British Navy and changing it fundamentally and quickly. I read Robert Massie's Dreadnought, a number of years ago and it tells this story rather better.Massie does leave out the World War One story, in which Fisher's reputation - until then compared favourable with Nelson - is shattered, upon combat. Morris's tale seems to indicate that Fisher and his staff had invested so much money and reputation in putting the most powerful fleet together, that they refused to take risks which might have entailed its destruction. This ensured their caution in the major Naval or amphibious engagements of the First World War and was a major embarrassment at the time.I picked up Morris' book because I had read Massie's Dreadnought, and I wanted to know more about Fisher. It definitely added to my knowledge of how Fisher ended up, but I could have done without the interpretive elements which Morris grafted onto the story."},{"Title":"Fatima Priest","review":"Coming to this book without any a priori knowledge of Fr. Gruner or his &quot;apostolate,&quot; I really didn't know what to expect. But from the first pages of the book, I sensed that there was something &quot;not quite right.&quot;First of all, though a biography, the tone and content is entirely self-aggrandizing. Where it is not smug and self-congratulatory, it is defensive and petty. This is not an inspired work. Or, more aptly, this is not a divinely inspired work.Secondly, while Fr. Gruner appears to have suffered at the hands of left-leaning Ecclesiastic authorities, he has enjoyed considerable freedom. Ultimately, he comes across as a man who will bow to no-one. This is admirable in many respects. It is just not admirable that he will not recognize the legitimate authority of the Church.While I am sympathetic to the traditionalists, among whom Fr. Gruner is at home, and cannot fail to notice some of the sour fruits of Vatican II, I have much more respect for the schismatics in SSPX et al, who at least have the courage to bear their excommunication, than for those borderline Tridentines who court the good name of the Pope while undermining the authority of the Papacy and the Magesterium.By all means, hearken unto Fatima. Practice the devotions, say the rosary and the little office. Admire Immaculate Mary and seek to emulate her perfect love of God. But beware the inculcation of hatred, and its purveyors.In summary, I can only echo the words of an excellent and faithful priest in regard to Fr. Gruner: &quot;it is a pity that such zeal is wasted.&quot;"},{"Title":"Fatima Priest","review":"A most startling insight into the issues facing the modern day Priesthood in the Catholic Faith.

If enough of the lay people would fulfill the five first Saturdays that Our Lady requested, and offered it up for the vatican bureaucrats and dissenters of the church, tremendous things would happen. Apparently, the leadership has neglected educating the people of the church regarding the grave warnings and concerns that Mary, our Sweet Messenger from Heaven came to warn us about and stamped it with the approval from God by the Sun spinning off it's axis (as the church is now doing) and plummeting to the ground. 70,000 people witnessed this event. It was the greatest miralce that has occurred since the resurrection. It's totally dumbfounding to me how the hierarchy cannot wake up and do what she asked! It's definitely in the hands of the laity, we need to spread the message and get people to offer up their first five Saturdays to our Dear Lady for help."},{"Title":"Fatima Priest","review":"At one time biographies were stories that glorified the person being written about. More recently they have been tell-all books that do nothing but revel in scandals and wrongdoing, both real and imagined.Fortunately, Fatima Priest is not cut from the same cloth. The author, Francis Alban, has creatively used his pen the way an artist uses a brush, to paint a picture of a man that is at once both simple and complicated.Fatima Priest is a modern day story that inspires religious calling but disturbs concerned mothers.The author has unknowingly paralleled, in his story, the person Father Gruner has devoted his life's work to making understood and responded to.Just like Nicholas Gruner, Sister Lucy was part of a loving, religious family. Both had their lives changed forever by the Message of Our Lady of Fatima.Lucy dos Santos was given a message to warn the Church and the world about the dangers of Russia. She was told the requirements necessary to avoid persecution, annihilation and the devil's reign on earth.Father Gruner studied that message and for his entire priesthood has tried to get the Pope and the bishops to respond to God's demands: the consecration of Russia by the Pope and his ministers.Just as Lucy found members of the church's hierarchy using whatever means they could, including outright lies, to silence her, Father Gruner has endured persecution form the very people who are supposed to be God's chosen representatives.Alban chronologically leads the reader through the life of a man who could and should have given in to pressure from his superiors to be silent or at the very least &quot;politically correct&quot;. Physical force was tried when other, illegal means, were unsuccessful.Interviews and anecdotes are interwoven in a masterful way to show how the efforts by Satan's followers are courageously thwarted by this priest and his loyal followers.No one who reads this book will forget it. The controversy, the lies, the efforts to silence one man for trying to remind his superiors of the duty they have to obey God and His Mother, will inspire conversation and awaken the long-dormant religious fervor in the Catholic faithful that have been lulled into a false state of complacency by the Satanists in the Vatican.The story continues ..."},{"Title":"Fatima Priest","review":"Gruner and his pals at the Fatima Crusader are borderline heretics. They support nigh every aspect of the SSPX and their schismatic brotherhood, acting as if a every ruling of the Church since Vatican 2 is Satan's own policy. Gruner's entire mission in life is to promote a Malachi Martin outlook to the Roman Catholic church,filled with half baked theories of Sister Lucy clones,Vatican mafia,and people being beat up in the dark alleys of Rome 'because they knew too much'! His worst teaching is the damning of the Vatican by implying or accusing them of supporting Communism,New Age cults and subverting the Church from within. He actually accused the Vatican of hosting black satanic masses inside St Peters...his source being his friend Arch-Bishop Millingo who has since been excommunicated.His biography paints him in the super hero mold as he and his buddies like Faust,Vennari,and Ferrara would like to view him. From this, one gets the impression that Gruner is the only man faithful to the Church while everyone else from the Bishops on up to the Pope are corrupt opponents of Christ. For years he promoted the painting of Joseph Ratzinger as the dark villainous,puppet master pulling the strings of John Paul 2 and suppressing the Virgin Mary at every turn.Not a issue of his Fatima Crusader went by with out some negative article on Cardinal Ratzinger..then he became pope. Oops. Now he has to walk a fine line...openly attacking every thing post Vatican 2 as evil but claiming to support the Holy Chair of Peter. As Ratzinger said back in the 80's this makes no sense..to be faithful to the Church but only up until the 1960's?Gruner's bio is a waste of time.He adds enough legit Catholicism to relax you then drops his conspiracy theories on you as the gospel truth. Read a catechism ,pray your rosary,watch the Ten Commandments,all of which will help your faith while this book and it's subject will merely lead you down the wrong path,the path of schism laden with Catholic veneer."},{"Title":"Fatima Priest","review":"Father Gruner claims that the Fatima warnings were not heeded by the Catholic Church, that the consecration of Russia was not properly done by Pope John Paul II, and that the conversion of Russia has not really come about. While I may be only a layman, I can completely refute such utter nonsense with simple, cold logic:1. Father Gruner suggests that Pope John Paul II acknowledged in his own words that the consecration of Russia to Our Lady's Immaculate Heart was not complete, and as evidence he specifically cites a passage in which the Holy Father prayed &quot;for those who still await our consecration.&quot; Perhaps he should actually read the full text of the consecration of the world (which does include Russia) to the Immaculate Heart of Mary on Annunciation Day 1984, which was properly executed in concert with the world's bishops. In the OFFICIAL Vatican release and interpretation of the text of the Third Fatima Secret promulgated by the Congregation for the Doctrine of Faith on June 26, 2000, you will find the following paragraph: &quot;Sister Lucia personally confirmed that this solemn and universal act of consecration corresponded to what Our Lady wished ('Sim, esta feita, tal como Nossa Senhora a pediu, desde o dia 25 de Marco 1984': 'Yes, it has been done just as Our Lady asked, on March 25, 1984': Letter of 8 November 1989). Hence any further discussion or request [for another consecration] is WITHOUT BASIS (emphasis mine).&quot; Rome has spoken; the matter is closed.2. As to the conversion of Russia, I submit this timeline of the important dates involved in the final, rapid collapse of the Soviet Empire:August 22, 1991 (Queenship of the Blessed Virgin Mary): Communist coup attempt collapses due to popular resistance and lack of military support. Coup plotters are arrested.December 8, 1991 (Feast of the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary): Russia, Ukraine and Belarus establish the CIS, marking the de facto end of the USSR.December 25, 1991 (The Nativity): Twelve sovereign nations succeed the USSR, whose hammer and sickle flag is taken down for the last time, marking the de jure end of the Soviet Empire.For Heaven's sake, how much more of a sign do you need?When Our Lady began appearing in Portugal in May 1917, there was an anti-clerical, socialist government in Lisbon that attempted to silence the truth. But the Portuguese people were converted, and that Godless government was peacefully overthrown in 1926. This contrasts starkly with the Medjugorje experience, where by 1992 (one decade after the supposed start of the Virgin's Balkan apparitions) Yugoslavia was completely engulfed in the flames of war. Since Our Lady is the Queen of PEACE (proven by the events in Portugal), this should by itself demonstrate that, as Cardinal Ratzinger has been quoted, &quot;Whatever may be going on in Medjugorje, it is DEFINITELY NOT of Our Lady.&quot; Our Lady brings peace, not war; she is our ADVOCATE and as such she cannot bring judgment upon people or nations, since this role is properly reserved for Our Lord. If anything, the Devil himself may be behind the Medjugorje deception. (See _The Medjugorje Deception_ by E. Michael Jones, editor of Culture Wars magazine, for his view of the so-called &quot;fruits&quot; of Medjugorjism.)3. Further, Father Gruner cites Anatoly Golitsyn's _New Lies For Old_ and _The Perestroika Deception_, in which the highly placed KGB defector predicted a staged, Trojan Horse style liberation of the USSR. And in fact, this is precisely what took place during the 1985-91 Gorbachev era; the August 1991 coup was intended by the Soviets to be the start of the rollback towards Communism. But, as evidenced by the dates listed above, even the Communists cannot put the genie of liberty back in its bottle, once it has been loosed. Communism is a human creation, whereas mankind's innate love of liberty is a timeless gift from God to us all. Accordingly, the false millenarian dogma that is Communism is not and can never be a permanent state of affairs anywhere.In addition, Our Lady never once said in her prophecies that Russia would be converted to Roman Catholicism. It would make no sense for Russia to become a ROMAN Catholic nation; its history places it squarely in the GREEK Catholic (Byzantine/Slavonic) tradition, not the Latin rite. If Russia is to come back to communion with Rome (a joyful event for which all of us should pray), it will be through the renunciation of schism by the Russian Orthodox leadership itself and not through any mass conversion to the Western forms of liturgy, which are totally alien to the Russian people. Happily, there appears to be growing popular support for the Uniate cause in the Orthodox nations, particularly in the Ukraine where a significant minority of the population is already of the Greek Catholic faith, in full communion with the Holy Father (as over one million believers at a Byzantine Catholic Mass in Lwiw, Ukraine made clear in June 2001). The spirit of the Council of Florence and of the great Metropolitan Isidore of Kiev may yet come to complete fruition, almost six centuries after its conclusion.Although there is certainly subversion within the church (as has always been the case - this is nothing new), it is no more so now than any other time in Church history, given all the schisms and heresies that have manifested themselves over the previous twenty centuries. But Our Lady herself promised in 1917, &quot;My Immaculate Heart will triumph.&quot; Indeed it has, and always will. Father Gruner would do well to take heed of this simple fact; sadly, until he does, he continues to take well-intentioned Catholics down the road towards open schism within the Church, which is precisely what the Devil wants.For those readers who would like a book that treats this subject correctly, I recommend &quot;Fatima, Russia, and Pope John Paul II&quot; by Timothy Tindal-Robertson, which makes it irrefutably clear that Russia was properly consecrated to the Immaculate Heart in 1984. This book by Father Gruner, on the other hand, should AT ALL COSTS BE AVOIDED by Catholics who aspire to be faithful to the Pope and the Magisterium."},{"Title":"Fatima Priest","review":"The absolut rumor , August 11, 2006Reviewer: Giordano Bruno (Portugal) - See all my reviewsOr as we could say, \\"Everything you dont need to know about the true Fatima events\\". Yes, the old rumor is a conquerer of our crowds, without chances to know the real and original reports aboutFatima events. Do they really know, ie. that the Portuguese daily press pubished in February 1917 a few reports made by Spiritist groups in Lisbon and Porto ( the major national cities )announced that \\"in May 13 a great anounce would happen\\". Well, the catholics believers can not see here a proof for their devotion; by the contrary, the Spiritists don't agree with the official Marian apparitions interpretation and they would not be the promotors of the present Fatima status. So, it's nonsense to think in a conspiracy catholic-spiritist in this preannounce in the portuguese press with 3 months in advance.So, the traditional interpretation has to be revised. The believers will have to know the original reports on the phenomena and not pious third-hand slogans that repeat the well known rumor processs in Psychology. Who said that the Marian apparitions never could be understand by Science is mistaken.

The writing is poetic, the dialogue witty, and the characters three-dimensional. The story flows with animation and grace. And probably the most important facet of the experience is you sympathize with the main characters and desperately want to know how each one makes out in the end.At first a story of romance, which gradually introduces mystery, and in the end escalates into the unthinkable.

The characters contained therein were very memorable and provided haunting images. I'm not quite sure why I never heard of this book before but I'm just glad I stumbled across it. Although it isn't a very short book, it was a fast read because I just couldn't wait to find out what was going to happen next. The unanticipated ending was poignant.

This is a witty, often amusing little story, with dialog that you can practically hear and a mystery that remains a tantalizing, just-out-of-reach secret until the end. Both of the male characters are vitally human - Katya, the love interest, is superficially charming but strangely wooden, the first clue that something is seriously wrong with this picture. The plot epitomizes the old adage that love is blind; although the reader is not sure what the problem is, you know there is one, a discovery that Jean-Marc stubbornly refuses to see until it is literally forced upon him. This book is a little known gem; a quick, enthralling reading experience."},{"Title":"The Summer of Katya","review":"This is not a page turner, but a brilliant, slow-moving psychological thriller. Experts say the 19th century ended only in 1914 with the outbreak of WW I [and the 20th century in 1989 with the fall of the Berlin Wall]. The life of newly-graduated medical doctor Jean-Marc Montjean (25)(JMM) straddles both centuries. He wrote this account of the fateful events of the summer of Katya in 1914 which deeply marked him, only in 1938 when he returns to where it all happened. In 1914, as in 1938, the air is rife with rumors about war...In 1914, JMM works in Salies in his Basque home area as a temporary understudy of the resident doctor Gros, who is awesomely ugly, but a great success with women of a certain age, who patronize this spa village, a delightful book character. JMM is totally bored until handsome Katya seeks his help when her twin brother Paul breaks his collar bone. The twins (26) live with their father, a historian specialized in medieval village life, in a rented, chilly, half-ruined summer house 2.5 km out of Salies. He bandages Paul and before returning to his lodgings in Salies, JMM realizes he is in love with Katya.No reader/reviewer on any Amazon site has dared to disclose fully what will happen next. This reader follows suit. When love or passion grows between Katya and JMM, her twin brother Paul warns JMM repeatedly to stop meeting her, with ever more contrived stories of why his family fled from his beloved Paris to the foothills of the Pyrenees and a damp ruin...Katya is either alert, daydreaming or demure. She is the most enigmatic character in the book. Her twin brother Paul is a truly decadent male, embodying all tenets of J.-K. Huysmans hero Des Essentes in his 1884 novel \\"Against Nature\\". JMM is the only character foreshadowing the 20th century, questioning what is wrong with the Age of Grace and foreshadowing the Era of Efficiency. Finally, the twins' scholarly father appears unaware of his surroundings.Trevanian (T) is the pen name of a Canadian professor of linguistics and communication sciences in the USA. His unique gift was (he passed away in 2005) his ability to grasp and copy the writing styles of bestselling- or classical writers. He could hardly believe the success of \\"The Eiger Sanction\\", a parody of Ian Fleming's James Bond novels and wrote another, \\"The Loo Sanction\\". \\"The Main\\", written in the present tense about a widowed police veteran in Montreal in the mid-1970s, is a homage to Emile Zola. The worldwide success of these novels prompted him to turn his back on teaching and the USA and settle with his family in the French Basque country, which forms the backdrop of \\"Shibumi\\", a parody of the popular Ninja books written by e.g. James Clavell and Eric von Lustbader in the late 1970s. And of this book, which is a brilliant horror story in the vein of Marcel Proust and J.-K. Huysmans. [Finally, readers should consult Wikipedia to find out how versatile a writer Trevanian was]."},{"Title":"The Summer of Katya","review":"The Summer of Katya is an exquisitely crafted literary masterpiece that in numerous ways is more poetry than prose. This is what writing as an art is all about!Set in the summer of 1914, between, what the author Trevanian calls, &quot;the age of grace and the era of efficiency,&quot; the young Basque doctor Jean-Marc Montjean falls in love with Katya Treville, a young Parisian woman. His brief and heartbreaking relationship in what he calls the &quot;Summer of Katya&quot; ultimately devastates him in life.In this short story(about 280 pages), Trevanian has brilliantly encapsulated the unfathomable intensity of love and youth. Set in the Basque region of Southwestern France, the novel is a pristine example of the author's artistic and lyrical writing talent. It is a novel that is not only read but is &quot;experienced.&quot; It leaves the reader with a profound sense of melancholy that only a writer of Trevanian's calibre and genius can deliver.For those sick of the mainstream nauseating happily ever after love stories, &quot;The Summer of Katya&quot; is written for you...an expertly weaved tragic romance that is unforgettable! Trevanian has truly shown that there is poetry and beauty in sadness. You will shed a bucket of intellectual tears!!!!"},{"Title":"The Summer of Katya","review":"Trevanian is a wonderful writer, best known for spy thrillers, his artistry however, is most impeccable in this mysterious love story. As it opens, Jean-Marc Montjean, begins telling his story and it flows from there with casual, yet poetic prose, evolving like the day, bright with possibilities in the early hours, full of hope, yet soon twists to the inevitable dark of evening.

I fell in love with Katya, too--perhaps a little more than Jean Marc, who;s ideology made him a lovable character by his own rights--but my world became transmuted to darkness, in the oppressive summer afternoon, when I finished reading---I had grown up, and I was in love------the name Hortense, the name Katya----became the very centre of my being , at least for some time to come.

Trevanian likes to play with pacing, point-of-view, and plot twists in such a way as to draw you relentlessly on, even as you're aware on some level that you're being had.At the same time, neither book delivers in the end on the suspense that has been so well crafted.

I once thought Hitchcock might have made a good movie of Katya but not now. The escalating mystery and twist at the end are Hitchcockian for sure but the rest of the story resides in a place full of nostalgia for a time and place long gone before two devastating world wars changed everything so much.

For philosophical completeness, the book GIANTS AND DWARFS: ESSAYS 1960-1990 includes a translation of Plato's dialogue &quot;Hipparchus or the Profiteer&quot; translated by Steven Forde, in which the question of aim arises early:COMRADE: The profiteer, Socrates, thinks he ought to make a profit from everything.SOCRATES: Don't answer me so aimlessly, as though you had suffered some injustice from someone, but pay attention to me and answer as though I asked you again from the beginning: don't you agree that the profiteer knows about the worth of this thing from which he considers it worthwhile to make a profit? (p. 95)The comments of Allan Bloom, in searching for &quot;profound possibilities of human life&quot; (p. 105) in the origins of political philosophy, also caution us to learn &quot;of the capital importance of the virtue of moderation in the political thought of the ancient authors.&quot; (p. 105). Keeping everything political is the surest way of convincing American readers that we are not really talking about saintly characters, so we might easily agree with Socrates &quot;that the one making the reproach is himself of the same sort.&quot; (p. 104). Bloom has been leading up to this view in his discussion of Shakespeare's &quot;Richard II.&quot; &quot;Knowledge of political things brings with it the awareness that in order for the sacred to become sacred terrible deeds must be done. Because God does not evidently rule, the founder of justice cannot himself be just.&quot; (p. 93).The Preface attempts to explain where Bloom has been coming from, and I appreciate the mention of Nietzsche on the last page of the Preface as a guide to understanding the nature of the intellectual contrasts which this book expects from Lemuel Gulliver, Xenophon, Socrates, Rousseau, Plato, and Leo Strauss. The Address delivered at Harvard University on December 7, 1988, is a prime example of the complex and fascinating psychology of democracy. (p. 13). After Bloom's book, THE CLOSING OF THE AMERICAN MIND, was a big hit, Allan Bloom became a professor identified with &quot;American anti-intellectualism&quot; for trying to preserve thought about our heritage from the political antielitists seeking a uniform view in the humanities.At the time of THE CLOSING OF THE AMERICAN MIND, I was most interested in seeing that book as a failure to consider the intellectual power of rock 'n' roll. GIANTS AND DWARFS contains a translation of Plato's dialogue &quot;Ion or On the Iliad&quot; translated by Allan Bloom, with his discussion of it. The cultural significance of a contest of rhapsodes dedicated to a god was not despised by Socrates, who &quot;often envied you rhapsodes, Ion, for your art. For that it befits your art for the body to be always adorned and for you to appear as beautiful as possible, and that, at the same time, it is necessary to be busy with many good poets and above all with Homer, the best and most divine of poets, and to learn his thought thoroughly, not just his words, is enviable.&quot; (pp. 124). Ion is the prize-winning expert at reciting Homer dramatically, but Socrates shows how little this matters by mentioning the other major poets, Hesiod and Archilochus, the former a master of cataloguing the Greek gods in his &quot;Theogony,&quot; and the latter, a 7th century BC general (&quot;They'll say I was a mercenary,&quot;) who died in battle, who won more fame for the battle about which he wrote a poem in which he dropped his shield and ran away. Bloom found Ion's devotion to Homer shallow. &quot;For Ion, Homer is sufficient, for the sole reason that it is for reciting Homer's poetry that golden crowns are awarded.&quot; (p. 141).The longest explanation by Socrates is about how poems are created &quot;not by art but by divine dispensation, each is able to do finely only that to which the Muse has impelled him.&quot; (pp. 129-130). What is most common in a society which has produced a number of poems that exceeds everyone's fantasies is that a single poet will be commonly known for one work, as Socrates says of &quot;Tynnichus, the Chaldean, who never composed any poem worth remembering other than the poem which everybody sings and which is very nearly the finest of all songs, being simply, as he himself says, \`a discovery of the Muses.' &quot; (p. 130). Socrates asks about the great dramatic moments, &quot;are you in your right mind? Or do you become beside yourself, and does your soul think it is at the scene of the deeds of which you speak in your inspiration, either at Ithaca, or Troy, or wherever the epic takes place?&quot; (p. 130). Bloom is most aware of the politics of winning approval. &quot;Ion has no satisfactions which are not dependent on the approval of his spectators. He needs the cities as they need him. For political men the accident of where they are born is decisive in limiting their possibilities of fulfillment.&quot; (p. 161). Bloom wrote that in 1970, when he still pictured thinking as being the opposite of rock 'n' roll. Rock's answer might be the song, &quot;Analyse&quot; by The Cranberries.

I bet most White House operations are run as strictly as Nixon's was -- you simply MUST have exemplary efficiency and effectiveness at that level -- though without the stainless steel quality that those two palace guards imbued.My favorite episode was the one wherein the wife of a terminally ill senator petitioned the president's office for Nixon to visit the man on his deathbed. Haldeman evaluated the situation and determined it would be more politically beneficial for Nixon to be seen consoling the bereaved widow... so good old Bob wrote this immortal instruction to the staff member who'd forwarded the request: &quot;Wait until he dies.&quot;"},{"Title":"The palace guard (Warner books 79-918)","review":"Days before his death, Lyndon Johnson entertained a group of old political acquaintances by telling them of a recent visit to the White House, now occupied by his successor Richard Nixon. Johnson marveled that while his old phone allowed him to talk to anyone in government he wished to chew out at the moment, Nixon's hotline had only three buttons.\\"Just three buttons,\\" reads the quote in \\"The Palace Guard.\\" \\"And they all go to Germans!\\"As Dan Rather and Gary Paul Gates go on to explain, Nixon would have benefited from disconnecting two of the lines, the ones that reached chief of staff H.R. \\"Bob\\" Haldeman and domestic affairs advisor John Ehrlichman. Together the two men effectively blocked all access to the President during most of his time in office, with only one exception, that being chief White House diplomat Henry Kissinger (German #3). By insulating Nixon so, they not only shielded him from a broader range of ideas, but instilled an institutional paranoia that abetted the blockheaded Watergate fiasco that brought them all down.It's tempting to read \\"The Palace Guard\\" with an eye on co-author Rather, especially as he departs his own place of prominence this week over a scandal given the name \\"Memogate.\\" Rather's knee-jerk liberalism is on display for sure, as when the book criticizes Nixon's opposition to forced busing as a blatant sop to racists while crediting him only for initiatives that revealed non-conservative thinking, like welfare expansion and reaching out to communist China. But \\"The Palace Guard\\" is not written in a mean-spirited way. In fact, it's quite entertaining for the snarky but sensitive way it presents its characters.It's not only Haldeman and Ehrlichman who get the spotlight. Much time is spent on people like Wally Hinkel, the secretary of the interior who goes Green on Nixon and is frozen out after balking over Kent State. Arthur Burns, an early cabinet leader, is dubbed \\"Super Bore,\\" which the book notes \\"was no small achievement when you stop and consider the place was something less than a haven for gifted raconteurs.\\"One exception to that rule, the effulgent future Democratic senator and urban affairs advisor Daniel Patrick Moynihan, mentors Nixon for a time on taking a more liberal policy course, thus earning Rather and Gates' approval, until he is undone by some memos leaked to the public, probably by Haldeman, that gets Moynihan in trouble with blacks and academics and undercuts his authority. That and, suggest the authors, there was less need for Nixon to protect himself by tacking left after his most likely opponent in the 1972 election drove himself off a bridge in Chappaquiddick.The book's drawbacks include a lack of direct quotations (surprising given the fact one of the authors was CBS's White House reporter at the time) and a divided sense of what its supposed to be about, the various cabinet officers Nixon drew around him at various times or the way two of these officers (Haldeman and Ehrlichman) paralyzed the process by denying access to Nixon for anyone else but themselves.Still, it's an entertaining book whatever it's about, very much of the moment and somewhat dated (words like \\"Negro\\" pop up from time to time) but worth having for Nixon lovers. Rather enthusiasts will miss the Texasisms of their hero's later career, but he and Gates put together a solid addition to the record on one of our most interesting, if not exemplary, presidents."},{"Title":"The palace guard (Warner books 79-918)","review":"&quot;The Palace Guard&quot; is the story of the two most powerful underlings in the Nixon Administration, H.R. &quot;Bob&quot; Haldeman and John Ehrlichman. Together, they rose to the pinacle of success by shielding their paranoid boss from all those with whom he did not wish to associate. And together they fell, both resigning on the last day of April 1973 as the heat from the Watergate scandal began to scorch the second term President who had been reelected by a landslide only months before. Rather and Gates's account, while lacking historical perspective, is fascinating in how it depicts two power hungry men who moved largely in the shadows. They served their boss well, even to the end when it was hoped that by their sacrifice he would be saved. Political junkies will love their story."},{"Title":"The palace guard (Warner books 79-918)","review":"This book covers the inter working of the Nixon White House and the two people the authors claim really ran the day to day - John Ehrlichman and Bob Haldeman. The book starts out with a nice history on the power of the Presidents cabinets during the time from FDR to Nixon and the back and forth that took place with power being centralized in the White House or at the cabinet level. The authors also provided an interesting review of the Nixon cabinet picks - who they were, how they got their jobs and what happened to them during the course of the administration. Of course following the premise of the book a good deal of this reporting centers on how Ehrlichman and Haldeman interacted with them and or caused their downfall.The authors did make a lot about how Ehrlichman and Haldeman were in such control and the power they held, but all administrations have similar people - if not they fall into disarray. A good example of this would be the first few years of the Clinton administration until the Chief of Staff was replaced - many books have detailed the out of control White House and the mistakes that were made. I think what is unique or most interesting about this book is the underlying tone of the administration and its use of power not only to get things done, but also to punish political enemies. The book touches on that part of the administration and you see it in many of the actions Ehrlichman and Haldeman took.The authors have a spunky writing style, but many references are 1970's based and if you were not even a teenager in the 70's it is something difficult to understand the full meaning of the comments. Overall it was an interesting book that covers an aspect that was not as well reported as the break in and cover up. I would think that it is a book that would appeal most to political junkies."},{"Title":"The palace guard (Warner books 79-918)","review":"Although this book came out in 1975 I still found it fascinating reading and throwing light on what led up to Watergate. The book was conceived in 1971 and relates in great detail how Haldeman and Erhlichman came to the powerful positions they held in the Nixon White House. One gains insight into the big puzzle about Watergate--that the Nixon people would do such stupid things when the political climate for Nixon's re-election was so favorable. The book shows why Watrgate happened; and one cannot help but gain satisfaction that the dangerous situation which prevailed at the Nixon White House fortunately came crashing down on the people responsible for it. The book has no source notes but events show that the authors were relating the situation rightly."},{"Title":"Snow Kittens (We Love Animals)","review":"Clara and her best friend Jilly rescue two orphan kittens and nurse them back to health. The book is very easy and fun to read!"},{"Title":"Mona and Other Tales","review":"Reinaldo Arenas, author of the memoir, Before Night Falls, brings us an imaginative collection with Mona and Other Tales. 14 short stories and one essay comprise the posthumously published book. Arenas, a self-imposed Cuban exile, fled for New York City in 1980. Castro's iron fist fell harder on Arenas, a gay intellectual. The author was a political prisoner in Cuba for much of the 60s and 70s for his writings and lifestyle. His novel, Hallucinations, had to be smuggled out of Cuba. The book propelled him into international fame, however the author died in 1990.No one word or phrase can accurately describe Arenas' energy. He weaves sentences succinctly and soon, a beautiful tapestry lies before one's eyes. Like an acrobat who has perfected his or her art, there is no strain here. Arenas' words flow across the page. His humor is quick and subtle. Most interesting is the footnotes in the short story, \\"Mona\\"-both bizarre and hilarious. In the first footnote, the author pokes fun at himself. \\"Besides being frivolous, Arenas was a real ignoramus.\\"\\"Mona\\" also verges into the fantasy genre. The main character, Ramon Fernandez, seemingly attacks the Mona Lisa painting at the Metropolitan Museum. I say seemingly because the strange story becomes stranger as it unfolds in a high-paced manner towards a surprising conclusion.The short stories \\"Parade Begins\\" and \\"Traitor\\" bear out the raw, difficult life in Cuba. One can feel the anguish of living in a non-tolerant Communist Cuba.My personal favorite, \\"Halley's Comet,\\" follows the five Alba sisters in 1891 from their Andalusian home to a small town in Cuba. A simple, pure joy is expressed in this amorous short story that was inspired from Federico Garcia Lorca's play, The House of Bernarda Alba.Mona and Other Tales showcases Arenas' versatility. We peer into the mind of a sleepless boy on Christmas Eve, delve into an essay on Latin-American literature, understand the psychological horror a Communist regime dispels, and so much more is offered-a cornucopia of thoughts and emotions.Arenas will delight and horrify-an amazing collection of short stories that will jumble the brain with its originality.Bohdan Kot"},{"Title":"Mona and Other Tales","review":"I was quite suprised that I had never heard of Reinaldo Arenas. He had to be one of the best writers that I had read. His language was certainly well-developed, had a certain sense of whimsy and captured the feeling of moments.

He really captures the modern world in his speach, and I suggest anyone to read his writings."},{"Title":"Mona and Other Tales","review":"Glorious work of amusing short stories.

Finally, for those of us who love to wake up to the aroma of a pot of coffee brewing, comes a book that explores the magical properties of this delightful drink. Author Posey explores the magical ways people can enhance their enjoyment of their daily dose of caffeine.She explores methods, such as reading coffee grounds in the bottom of the cup, coffee bean divination (similar to I-Ching), divining by examining the coffee bubbles -- or by scrying the swirls of cream in your cup of steaming brew, and she provides a unique system of divination, the Cafe Nation system, which invokes the symbolism of the pentagram. This system can be used with casting the coffee beans, or with wooden coffee stirring wands, which are then inscribed with the names of the many worldwide varieties of coffee. Interpretations for this system of divination are provided.Aside from the divinatory aspects, Posey explores the use of coffee in magick, providing creative ways in which to incorporate coffee into spells, rituals and seasonal observances. She even has a little magickal working, designed to help keep a caffeine addict's addiction in check, including a rather &quot;in your face&quot; affirmation. She also gives readers ample background information on coffee history, legends and lore.This is a fun, informative little book for the mystic or spiritually inclined who also happens to be a coffee lover.

Also, since much of this book is based on the new (in 1884) science of anthropology - a close cousin to psychology and psychiatry - I generally find it pretty easy to get my head around the concepts that he presents.It stands out really clearly in this book that he and Marx trace the origins of class society to the agricultural revolution (when human beings started raising crops and animals instead of being hunter gatherers) - which immediately resulted in a \\"surplus\\" of food - which became the responsibility of an elite (chieftains and priests) to safeguard for the winter and hard times.He also traces the necessity for men to trace their offspring once there is a surplus and they begin to accumulate wealth (the keepers of the surplus get to keep a little more of it than everyone else). Because by this time human beings have figured out how babies are made and want to bequeath their wealth to their descendents. This can only happen if they can trace their paternity, which means limiting women (but not men) to a single sexual partner. Thus the need to replace matriarchal society with patriarchy and to introduce the marriage contract to bind women to a single man.Engels then traces how this primitive \\"tribal\\" structure, eventually led to the concept of private property - and of the feudalistic state. To have a state you have to have a king or supreme leader. He maintains power via a standing army and rewards \\"knights\\" in his army with gifts of private property. And because property is no longer owned communally, people are forced off the land they used to farm and have no choice but to go and work as serfs for the knights and lords who now own the property by the king's decree.The book contains a fascinating section about the way the Iroquois Nation governed themselves - including their use of consensus in decision making, inheritance through the female line and their collective ownership of property. He also outlines how various Iroquois tribes were united in a Confederacy governed by a Federal Council (which formed the basis for state-federal structure the colonists adopted in the US Constitution).The section about democracy in ancient Athens and the coalescence of Latin tribes into a single Roman government is also extremely interesting. The final section concerns the amalgamation of the various Germanic tribes into the states of Germany and France.By Dr Stuart Jeanne Bramhall, author of THE MOST REVOLUTIONARY ACT: MEMOIR OF AN AMERICAN REFUGEE.regard for all members of the tribe as having an equal voice (with men and women playing an equal role in leadership), , insistence on consensus decision making, their"},{"Title":"The Origin of the Family","review":"I like this book, of course.

It connects the development of the modern family and the subsequent oppression of women as intimately linked to the development of capitalism. The flaws in this text come from his use of Lewis Henry Morgan and the problematic notion of a universal and linear evolution of human society.

The author's constant plugs for different punk songs and albums were very distracting. Especially to those who do not listen to punk rock music, and also to those who expect an author to have enough writing ability to explain a situation with out plugging a song to describe the mood.Nevertheless, the characters were poorly developed and the plot was also lacking. Melanie, the main character, started out a young and naive blue hair girl. However, by the end of the story she had not grown or matured. She seemed to learn nothing for her twisted love affairs, but rather she just moves on to another relationship doomed for failure.The plot was fresh and interesting at the start of the book. However, the middle lags. The main character becomes a depressive, love sick puppy chasing a woman who does not want her. Not mention the lame political protest scene that's unrealistic and choppy at best.

In the begining, her wavering on-is she-or isn't she- a lesbian get a little tiring, but it stops right before you get really sick of it. Also the name dropping of Punk Rock bands is plentiful, but also doesn't quite go overboard (Plus it's nice to see bands I like mentioned in print). She falls in love (maybe?) with this girl,Iso, who she always seems to miss-connect with. During this termoil, she finds out just who she is and how she relates in this place. You don't have to be a punk rocker or a feminist or even a lesbian to enjoy this book. The core story is really good, and Melany has some realy cool thing happen to her (like working as a temp. for the government and puting her mark on confidential papers and having a cool friend, Patti, who leaves college in a really big F-You type of way).

I enjoyed this novel about a punk rock girl coming to grips w/ her lesbian identity. It's a good quick read w/ a slamming soundtrack consisting of bands like the Clash, the Pretenders, and X-Ray Spex. On the downside, at times Sprecher seems to try too hard to make the story accessible to non-punks, and I think this sometimes hurts the book more than helps it. True punk rock attitude wouldn't care if you don't get all the references, so why does Sprecher? The love story angles are a little better than the political notes that sometimes get a bit tedious, and it has a sweet, if predictable, resolution.

After I read a few pages, I got really into it and couldn't really put it down. It was very realistic, dealing with problems that are likely to happen. There's funny times, and sad times. There's a realization of oneself and deciding on where to go from there. This book gets you thinking on what will happen. I like that Melany has pride in herself.I think this book is good to read for everyone with an open mind. It deals with relationships, friends, work, school, politics (somewhat), and just trying to make a living while still being who you are."},{"Title":"Sister Safety Pin: A Novel","review":"If you hate the 80s or lesbians or punk, why would you read it?

Although I am not a punk rocker like Melany, I never really fit into the &quot;lesbian community&quot; either. It is an unfortunate fact of life that no matter how alternative our lifestyles are, conformity is still highly valued and enforced. As far as the GLB community has come in the past ten years, we have still not learned that truly being open and affirming means welcoming *everyone*, even if they look different from you, think different from you, came out at a different age from you, or are more/less &quot;out&quot; than you. Clique-ishness is still the bane of many highly oppressed communities and ours is no different.*Sister Safety Pin* is, therefore, a great comfort to me!

Elizabeth Stanley's prose makes clear to young readers that this is not really dancing. &quot;Around and around the poor bear turned on her two back legs, her head pulled from side to side by the chain which Haluk jangled to the clatter of his tambourine... The performance continued relentlessly for many hours until day began to fade [and] Haluk led the bear back to her cage and lock[ed] the door.&quot; Stanley's pastel illustrations in purple, blue, gold, scarlet and indigo evoke the liveliness of Turkish village life as people go about their ordinary business of shopping, eating and paying the bearkeeper to see dancing bear. The overall effect of these village scenes, however, is depressing. The heavily textured paper to which the pastels are applied seems to drain the light out of these sad market scenes, in which no-one seems to smile.The power of the book, however, comes from the scenes that depict the dreams of the chained bear. The scenes that show her fishing in mountain streams with her mate or lying lazily with her babies in the sun are full of shimmering light and vibrant energy.And thankfully, the bear's dreams come true. An old man named Yusuf buys the bear from Haluk, takes it with him to his house by a stream and slowly reintroduces it to the wild. And that is just the beginning of this eloquently written and superbly illustrated book dedicated to relieving the suffering of captive bears.Stanley saw her first &quot;dancing bear&quot; in 1979 in Athens and decided then to write a book to challenge the assumption that men could cruelly use wild animals to make money. In 1992 she took her written text to Turkey to take photos and to make sketches for the artwork. In the same year The World Society for the Protection of Animals effected the release and the return to the wild of all chained bears in Turkey. Today there are no dancing bears in Greece or Turkey.But a recent WISPA report has revealed that the trade in dancing bears is still alive and well in India. It says that &quot;60-70% of cubs taken from the wild die before they even begin their brutal training. Dehydration, starvation and trauma are all reasons [for their dying]. Should the cub be lucky enough to live, a punishing regime of starvation and beating will begin to condition it to perform. The piercing of the cub's sensitive muzzle with a rope for control is the next ordeal. It is held down without anaesthetic while a crude iron needle is heated in a coal fire and plunged in with a group of men holding the squealing cub tight. The investigators also found that the site of the nose piercing was invariably infected in all the seventeen cases observed. 'The cub would the have to suffer a second piercing before the first was healed, compounding his agony,' explained Geete Seshamani. 'The tug of this rope, along with an intense fear of the strike of a heavy stick, motivates the bear to lift its legs in turn and 'dance'.'&quot;The WISPA site also provides gory and even more gruesome details of bearbaiting in Pakistan and of the farming of bears for bear bile in China.WISPA has done and will continue to provide facts about animal mistreatment and about campaigns and projects to challenge these abuses. Whilst it is important for the thinking public to have access to information like that on the WISPA site, I believe that Elizabeth Stanley's &quot;The Deliverance of Dancing Bears&quot; is one of the best books for introducing pre-school, elementary and junior high school aged children to these issues.While not so sparsely written as Anthony Browne's &quot;Gorilla&quot;, the prose is tight. The illustrations are similar to and as powerful as those in Brian Wildsmith's animal books. The interleaving of reality and dream is reminiscent of Shirley Hughes' &quot;Stay Away from the Water Shirley&quot; or of the more recently published &quot;Magic Beach&quot; by Alison Lester. All in all, this is an ideal book to get the young and the not-so-young thinking about animal rights issues. It is a beautiful book that can help us all to realise the epigraph that Stanley has taken from Aristotle: &quot;Hope is a waking dream.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Deliverance of Dancing Bears","review":"Named an honor book of The Children's Book Council of Australia, The Deliverance Of Dancing Bears is a wonderful picture book story written by Elizabeth Stanley for young readers having intermediate level reading skills. This very highly recommended account is about a captive bear who forced to dance, and who clings to hope, even though the degradations of her daily life cause her spirit to ebb. It is a kind-hearted peasant who liberates the bear and who reminds all of those watching of an important moral lesson about dignity and life. Elizabeth Stanley's touching and emotional color artwork highlights and enhances her original and involving parable."},{"Title":"The Deliverance of Dancing Bears","review":"This is a children's book with text and illustrations to tell the story.If you have any compassion for exploited animals you will appreciate this touching book for our young readers. I feel the book is important to teach morals at an early age. The dancing bear trade is a cruel practice.

She explains this briefly at the end of her book."},{"Title":"Speaking in Tongues: New and Selected Poems","review":"&quot;Charles Ghigna writes with appealing freshness, placing his words exactly and concisely, with a mean eye for a metaphor.

Readers who delight in word play will particulary enjoy the poems on the circus and on authors. My favorite section is the one on Howard, an ambitious series of poems on an enigmatic schoolmate named Howard. &quot;When Howard Became Jesus&quot; will send a tingle down your spine. Sometimes to be pitied, Howard's actions nonetheless provoke self-reflection in the narrator and other persons who know him regarding struggles common to all of us. There are other fine poems as well, in both free verse and forms. I can't help but think that if more contemporary poets could combine memorable language and subjects the way these poems do, poetry would have a bigger audience in the U.S. I was formerly a teacher, and in addition to reading these poems for your own pleasure, I recommend this as a book to share with your students to help awaken them to the possibilities of language and to writing their own poems.

If your a MacEnroe fan it is a must read!"},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"John McEnroe was a freshman at Stanford during my last year of graduate school. He joined the top ranked team in the nation and as a freshman became the star of the team and led them to a national championship and an undefeated season. He left to turn pro after his freshman year. Yet this could have been expected. Before arriving on the scene at Stanford he made a miraculous run as a junior reaching the semi-finals at Wimbledon! All this and more is detailed in this book.The book is basically a look at McEnroe's life, how he was involved in sports at an early age and actually liked team sports like basketball better than tennis. This and his natural patriotism explain why he played Davis Cup so much and encouraged others to do the same.Most of the book deals with his childhood friendships and his ascension in the tennis ranks to his run as the number one player in tennis. He describes his great matches and you get an inside look at what led to his great victories and his agonizing defeats. He even replays as best he can his terrible fold to Lendl in the only French Open he really should have won.Part of his purpose in writing this book is to give you a look at what was going on inside him when he had his infamous tirades on the tennis court. He reveals the New Yorker inside of him and his inability to control his temper. Contrary to what many think this was not something that he did for advantage. McEnroe felt that these outburst hurt his matches as much as it helped him. He also usually felt bad or guilty about it afterwards.John McEnroe is an intelligent and complex person and that comes out if you read this book closely. Late in the book you get a glimpse at his personal life. His marriage to Tatum O'Neill and the problems that led to their stormy divorce. Unlike what most people think, he does not blame her for the problems and does accept some of the responsibility. But he definitely wants to dispell the notion that he tried to hold back her acting career in favor of his tennis career.We also get a glimpse of his second marriage to Patty Smyth and how his attempts with his own rock band nearly caused problems in that marriage.McEnroe seems to be a much more content soul these days. He has his tennis commentating and received the honor of Davis Cup captain and induction into the Tennis Hall of Fame that were oviously very satisfying achievements. Still it seems that he wants to change his public personna. The bad boy image is not something he is proud of and this book and his recently unsuccessful TV quiz show seem to be attempts to reconstruct his image. He also has a very good sense of humor which comes across in this book as well as in his TV commercials"},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"McEnroe is an enigma. He was certainly one of the greatest tennis players of all time, a joy to watch in his prime for his extraordinary skill. His behavior was abominable sometimes, just plain out-of-line by most standards. Many people have written him off as worthy of no respect for that reason, yet he really was a great player, is now the best male commentator on TV (in my opinion), and a very altruistic person, (he is one of the top charity fund raisers in the tennis world.) If I remember correctly, he was honored as father of the year in his native New York recently.In this book, he speaks for himself. He doesn't forgive his behavior or suggest it was appropriate, and he does apologize. Yet, it is easier to see his many sides. He talks about being so alone on the tennis court. He loved Davis Cup partly because it was a team sport. I've always thought he was such a strong person, able to take the unpopular stand on things, but reading his own words, he comes across as remarkably insecure and craving approval. The public adulation of being #1 was his motivation more than an innate love of playing tennis. I find that amazing.I am a tennis player and fan, and I try hard to separate great achievers from their personal beliefs and private lives. This book helped me to understand the man, the person, the little boy, the young adult with extraordinary skills who found himself pulled into a fantastic world where he was supremely successful but lacked the character to achieve greatness in all areas. At least he is open about that. This is his point of view, and he deserves his say. The book is well written, I feel like I just had a nice long conversation with this remarkable person."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"When McEnroe was a freshman at Stanford, I was in my last year of graduate school there.

You also see how his attempts at leading his own rock group caused some turmoil in that marriage.McEnroe is a very intelligent and complex person. His intelligence and tennis skills are often overlooked or played down by tennis fans because of his notorious cry baby attitude that he displayed so prominently on the court. His tantrums were accepted and tolerated by tennis officials because of his great success and the interest it brought to tennis. But he was a poor role model that others copied. He was not the first though. Remember Ille Nastase!McEnroe seems to be much more content these days. He has been a successful tennis commentator and received the honor of being named the US team's Davis Cup captain and was elected into the Tennis Hall of Fame. These were obviously very satisfying achievements. Still it seems that he wrote this book to help change his public personna. He is not happy with his bad boy image and by writing this book and hosting a TV quiz show he hopes to show a different side of him as he reconstructs his image. He has a very good sense of humor that comes through in the book as well as in some of his recent TV commercials.I also found it interesting to hear about his relaionship with Mary Carillo. They both are tennis commentators now. Also John's brother Patrick has made his mark on the tennis world, not through his mediocre fennis career but for his estute commentator, more insightful than his brother John and his success as a Davis Cup captain who brought the cup back to the USA this year."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"If you're a tennis player and have been following McEnroe since he was a kid, you might enjoy this book. I am, I have, and I did. But for most people, the book may be slightly disappointing. It's pretty heavy on recounting the results of past matches, and doesn't have as many interesting insights as I would have expected, especially considering that I find McEnroe as a commentator to be uniquely insightful and compelling.I got the sense that, while McEnroe did write about some personal stuff, like his marriage to Tatum O'Neill, he was less open than he could have been. I don't blame him for wanting to hold back -- I wouldn't want my life to be an open book. But if you're writing a book about yourself and your life, that's sort of the point.So if you would share McEnroe's nostalgia about the Port Washington Tennis Academy and his various matches up and down the ranks of the tennis world, go ahead and get this book. But if you're not a serious McEnroe/tennis fan, you might be better off just listening to McEnroe on TV."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"I was very disappointed in this autobiography that read more like an unauthorized biography without ANY juicy details written by someone who was NOT given access to his subject.If you didn't know who John McEnroe was or whom he married or how acrimoniously it ended, you would come away from this book with an unsympathetic portrait of a petulant, unpleasant, lonely man, a man who could have been ANY tennis player, not the number one player in the world. You would come away with many (MANY) descriptions of tennis plays (!!!) of twenty years past, meaningless descriptions of tennis action you could have read in the New York Post, and probably have. In the photo of his first win at Wimbledon, he is down on his knees. In the book he says, \\"and I had my first Wimbledon.\\" Whoopie.John McEnroe emerges as a person who was miserable when he was number one in the world, miserable when he was down, miserable when he was alone, and miserable when he was married. His tennis career, his first wedding, the anticipation and the birth of his children, his early fathering, his split with Tatum, all show him to be wretched and unhappy. He is a man who didn't seem to enjoy anything, not his God given talent, not his thousands of tennis matches, not his friends, not his materially comfortable life. If he did enjoy it, he doesn't show us, though he does TELL us many times how much he loves his kids--while being away from them more than half the year.The book is dishonest because McEnroe keeps all the good scenes of his life to himself. His day to day life, what his relationship with Tatum was like before it soured, the workings of his failed marriage, his own drug use, his wife's drug use, what it was like to be a father yet travel thirty weeks of the year, and who took care of his kids (was it Tatum? Was it the nanny?) Why Tatum was not a good mother, how her motherhood and his fatherhood manifested itself, how her drug use manifested itself (did she use drugs? If you yawn, you'll miss the sentence where he says so) all these are hidden from the reader. Perhaps he doesn't feel it's his place to divulge such private details about himself and other people in his life. Then what in the world did he write an autobiography for? Those are best written when one is not afraid of showing the reader what one's life was really like, perhaps when one is much much older . As it is, McEnroe is so afraid he only alludes to his own drug use (\\"don't ask,\\" he says) alludes to his promiscuity while single and his faithlessness while married. What he tells us about the details of his life is more superficial than an Enquirer article. Even in descriptions of his own verbal abuse antics on the court, he TELLS us he was abusive, but he shows little and remains so afraid of being indiscreet or offensive, he even uses asterisks in the few places where he attempts to show us what expletives he used in humiliating the umpires! In this book he concentrates on telling us tennis play by plays, teling us how abominably he acted on the court, calling himself an idiot, proceeding to act abominably, ad nauseam. There is very little here that is more than People magazine trite.But there are some things here: His utter inability to rejoice in the athletic or personal successes of his friends and his brothers, his black jealousy when it comes to his best friend finding love or beating a hated tennis adversary, his stunted and stunning tantrums, and his lifelong inability, even while acknowledging these demons, to exorcise them. Those things are here. Frightening and unlikable, boring and shallow, and sad, that's McEnroe and his book."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"I became interested in tennis watching Jimmy Conners, Ivan Lendl and John McEnroe play tennis. My brother and I would go to the park on US Open and Wimbleton weekends and pretend we were the different pros while playing our mildly [bad] matches. I was a fan on McEnroe's but it was always kind of a love/hate relationship because I saw my childish self in him. I was a bit petulant myself when I played sports but, on the other hand, I was always embarrassed by my behavior and wished I could control it. I guess I projected some of these feelings onto McEnroe.It was nice, therefore, to read his book. To be honest, I really didn't know much about him and it was interesting to get a look at how he became a tennis star. And interesting to see what he did with his fame. Let's face it, people like McEnroe get to do a lot more than those of us who work for a living and it's fun to live vicariously through them. This isn't a book filled with shocking revelations, if that's what you're looking for, but it is a real romp at times.I tend to read autobiographies as opposed to biographies. I think it's usually more fun to read what a person has to say about themselves as opposed to what others have to say about them. A person writing about their own life has an agenda, of course, just like any biographer but this just tells you even more about them. In this book, despite the help from Mr. Kaplan, McEnroe sounds like McEnroe. And that's what I wanted to read. If you are a fan, you should definitely take a look."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"To be honest, I was never a big fan of McEnroe. Sure, he was an amazing tennis player and it was a joy to watch him play. Until he opened his mouth! But in recent years, I had begun to admire his commentating style. He had insite into the game, and wonderful behind-the-scenes stories which made watching a match much more enjoyable.I purchased this book hoping there would be something that would find me liking him for the player he was all those years ago. Unfortunately, what I found was what a lot of other reviewers found - an ego the size of Texas and an astonishing lack of remorse or repentance for his inexcusable behavior while on the court. I have never heard so many excuses in my life. For every emotional explosion or match he lost there was, to quote him, \\"reasons, not excuses.\\" It takes a mature man to be able to say \\"I played a bad match\\" and leave it at that. He just doesn't seem capable of doing that. Unfortunately, this book is really nothing more than 300 pages of Mac trying to explain to us why we shouldn't hold him accountable for his actions and/or losses - that we should blame the conditions surrounding them instead as he so obviously does."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"This is a very breezy and elliptical biography that doesn't scratch the top layer of whomever John McEnroe is. The kinds of insights here are what you'd expect strangers at a dinner party to gladly reveal of themselves without provocation (much less twenty bucks).I mean, John McEnroe was arguably the most charismatic athlete of the 20th century. But I'm reading his book and feeling that he missed out on the entire train ride himself. I'd have loved for some real insight on what it was like to be such a competitor and to keep come out winning -- sometimes despite yourself. How did that work for him? At what cost? We're not told. He never reveals what was going on inside his head when he would melt down on court or what he was like preparing for matches. He'll tell you that he used to cry when he lost, but not what he was thinking. He authors the story as though all of his achievements and misdeeds just burst out of the blue. He sounds so passive. He doesn't attempt to account for who he is.There's no life or excitement to this book. Perhaps this explains for the gratuitous insertions of exclamation points to tart-up the otherwise turgid prose. Like this!I'm very disappointed in this book. If you're going to write an autobiography, then say something to the reader who is (presumably) already interested in your life that will enlighten his knowledge of you. I don't know where to strike the balance between this remote and reserved style of biography and a heart-on-the-sleeve tearjerking tell-all. But you know what? That's not my job. Game. Set. Match."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"As a teen in the 80's and an avid tennis fan and player; &quot;Mac&quot; was my idol because he was an extraordinary athlete and he just said what was on his mind - &quot;there's got to be the-someone-so-called 'Bad Boy' of tennis and it might as well be me.&quot; I could not put this book down and read the entire book within one day. The best parts of the book was when Mac discussed his ascent onto the professional circuit circa 1977 to his domination in 1984. I enjoyed how he broke down the key matches with Borg, Lendl, Becker, and Connors. Mac's attitude is reflected as to who he genuinely respects..Borg, Vilas, Sampras, Agassi, and Peter Fleming; Who he despises...Lendl, Becker, Connors, Bill Scanlon, Brad Gilbert, and the Williams Sisters; and who he feels sympathy for...Vitas, Frank Hammond, and his brother, Patrick (!).I was hoping for more direct Mac-level commentary and more insight on his interpersonal conflicts on and after the tour. I've seen Mac much more candid when he was interviewed on Letterman several times and I just felt he didn't 100% say what was on his mind about the players, the current state of tennis, and what he viewed as essential for tennis to survive. I also thought the sections about his romance(s) could have been handled better - forget the romances; we want to hear the conflict and the thought processes of a still impressive athlete and entertaining and interesting individual!"},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"You know, when someone is the BEST at something, it would be interesting to read about the thought processes, the feelings, the joy and agony behind holding this position. What this book was, was a play-by-play commentary of every match McEnroe ever played, and I mean EVER! I was half-way through the book and was shocked when he was only up to his 19th year. Get to Tatum already!We can watch the great matches on ESPN2. What we can't see is how McEnroe thinks. He manages to down-play every life event from championships to the birth of his children until they are as exciting as watching paint dry.Believe it or not, I wanted to know about Farrah and Ryan, the \\"mystery celeb girlfriend\\" and about how he did wild and crazy things in his youth. It seemed as though he wrote this book cautiously, deliberately censoring adult language in case his kids might stumble onto it. Is this really the place to apologize to everyone in your family \\"(Sorry Mom!)\\"? If there is anyone that deserves an apology, it's the fans that have listened to his temper tantrums all of these years and the youth that have watched his example and now think it's OK to loose control of yourself while playing a GAME.And please, don't get me started on the rock musician portion of the book! Carlos Santana dedicated a song to him. WOW! I mean, if your are going to go on AND ON about how cool music is, talk about how it affected your game, training, mood, etc. You can't live in New York or Los Angeles without rubbing elbows with musicians, John. Unless you're going to discuss an influence they had on you, you're only going to sound star struck."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"I consider John McEnroe to be the finest announcer in all of sport. His insights are keen; his humor at once good natured and dry; his enthusiasm contagious. Why James Kaplan elected to dilute Mac at his best I don't know. It could be, of course, that Mac himself is too blame. This autobio suggests, though, that while Mac would recognize that he might deserve such blame, his bluntness in such an admission should not be mistaken for his own allegiance to the position. In other words, he _suggests_ blame as an option, while at once offering more self-serving possibilities. The result of his repeated such strategy is a book that reads most obliquely. Somehow, Mac's obliqueness is not what I most wanted, or expected, from this far-too-cautious (political?) treatment. That he refuses to name drop (when it matters) and that he is downright elusive in terms of his own articulation of his own vices might be admirable--the busy reader may indeed deserve nothing more. But when combined with his failure to nail down his own positions regarding the very center of the book--himself--the result is evasive at best, and elitist or exclusive at worst. I opened the book ready to love Mac all the more having read it: In large part I expected to celebrate--truly celebrate--his mistakes, his faults, his shortcomings. Instead, I felt as if I was betrayed--locked out of any sense of who he really is. I could be wrong--he could, really, be the sort of guy who pulls punches, gives equal weight to contrary positions, and worries most about (a shallow) diplomacy. But I still doubt it."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"I don't know if it is because I am an avid tennis player and have been since I was ten, but this was the fastest read that I have ever had in a book. It is very entertaining and informative. John McEnroe is a very good story teller. The people that he knew and has met in his life is amazing. It makes you wish that you could have been there too living it with him!He is an amazing man."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"I loved this book. It was interesting and entertaining from cover to cover. I literally laughed out loud in the bookstore when I was flipping through it and read the part where he talks about Brad Gilbert! Perhaps Mr. McEnroe should take up writing as a sideline."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"John McEnroe claims to have written his autobiography, You Cannot Be Serious, in order to determine if he really needs attention- and if so, how much? And why? The answers to these questions are yes, he really needs attention, and lots of it. The reasons why make McEnroe a compelling and beguiling persona.I am a tennis fanatic and long-time McEnroe observer, sometimes even a fan. John McEnroe is still very much a controversial and outspoken individual in the tennis world, but the book rounds off most of his rough edges. McEnroe always accused others of being phony and himself of being honest and right. However, certain parts of his book lack self-analysis and credibility. For example, McEnroe says that he never felt good about his on-court tirades (and I believe him) but why was he never able to get his anger under control? He describes his matches and his opponents but glosses over the reasons behind his poor behavior. Credibility? He devotes only two-thirds of one page to the pinnacle of rude and shocking behavior- his default from the Australian Open. As tennis fans and journalists know, the details of this incident are extremely ugly, and they are omitted entirely.The best sections of the book deal with McEnroe's rise and fall from number one. We learn that McEnroe's true love was not Tatum O'Neil or Patty Smythe- it was Bjorn Borg. According to McEnroe, hunting Borg was more fun, and much easier, than being hunted. His skirmishes with Connors and Lendl and friendships with Borg, Vitas and Fleming are recounted in amusing fashion. He articulates the loneliness, doubt and paranoia that characterize the top ranking very well. Mac vividly describes what it is like to fall from the top-- as injuries, family life and age take a toll. He made me understand why so many athletes don't seem to realize when they are past their prime.As expected, Mac spends a considerable amount of time feeding his own ego. Whether you are a fan, foe or neutral observer, you will shake your head at many of his comments. This is an entertaining read and I think casual tennis or sports fans would enjoy it. Non-sport fans should probably pass on this one."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"McEnroe not only captures his career, but his entire era - McEnroe, Connors, Borg, etc. His honesty is refreshing. This book together with Agassi's \\"Open\\" encompass most of the open era up until Federer-Nadal-Djoker. For players age 50+/-, a must read."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"This is the true tale of John McEnroe, the baddest boy that tennis has ever seen. I enjoyed reading his story, especially his take on various foes like Jimmy Connors, Ivan Lendl, and Bjorn Borg. The writing is crisp, but not to the level of some memoirs I've read. Overall, a satisfying read that reveals more than I expected.If you are looking for the ultimate tennis tell-all, I highly recommend Andre Agassi'sOpen: An Autobiography (Vintage). This one is a doozy, and one of the best memoirs I've read in a long time. I loved this one. Very highly recommended!"},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"I recently read this book, and it is without a doubt one of the best autobiographies of a tennis player ever (tied with Andre Agassi's \\"Open\\"). I was surprised at how funny McEnroe was, and how he took the mickey out of himself, as well as talked about how hard he pushed himself to become a better tennis player when he started out and how it was difficult for him to get the skills needed. Also, how much he was in awe of Borg and what becoming the No.1 player meant to him. I thought it was interesting how he talked about when his career ended, and how he started a new career becoming a TV presenter for today's tennis tournaments, for which I think he has done a great job. I intend to soon read Rafael Nadal's new autobiography, and if you are a fan of this sport and would like to read about the history of players then I seriously suggest reading this book."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"This book by John McEnroe appears to be a pretty well thought out and balanced book. He seems to find a way to talk about the warts and all, even the good and very good parts. I enjoyed reading this and was always a McEnroe fan.J. Robert Ewbank author \\"John Wesley, Natural Man, and the 'Isms'\\""},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"Johnny Mac is a very interesting guy. Having grown up watching his epic matches with Borg and Connors I was eager to read this book. It did not disappoint. You will be happy to find all the details on his tennis career and all of the behind-the-scenes action that the media never covers.But even more impressive was to read about John's growth from a self-centered kid into a mature father. As one who has made the same journey, this part really touched me.The only thing missing was more dirt on his ex-wife's abuse of narcotics and their custody battle, as well as details on the abuse dished out by his ex-father law. But I guess you have to respect a guy who doesn't trash people just to sell a few more books.Well worth the (used book) price!"},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"McEnroe takes you on a chronilogical tour of his career starting from childhood all the way to the early 2000's. I would definitely recommend this book for someone who is a lover of tennis, especially tennis from the 70's and 80's. Even without knowing about a lot about his competitors, I still enjoyed the dialogue and Mac's opinions of some of his older matches. He certainly wasn't afraid to let the reader know exactly what he felt about refs, calls, and his opponents. The story of his 'Hollywood' life during his tennis career was also a very enjoyable read. He takes you through the story with his two wives, his kids, and his parties and activites with celebrities. He also talks briefly of some of his other career endeavors including his art gallery and his dream of having his own band and being a famous musician. The only thing I thought he should have talked more about was some of his more recent activities. The last 5 years or so seemed to be quick even though a lot had happened. Besides the missing detail there, the book was a good read. Even without being a huge tennis fan, I enjoyed the book. I imagine that a real tennis fan would love this book."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"The greatest asset of Mr. McEnroe's autobiography is the author's (sometimes brutal) honesty regarding both himself and the characters/events surrounding his rise to fame. Sure, it is clear at times that McEnroe is concealing some juicy details about his personal life, but it is not fair to expect admissions about everything! What McEnroe does share proves to be very revealing about both the pro-tennis tour and his celebrity lifestyle.Ultimately this book will appeal to fans of not just McEnroe, but rather all of his contemporaries, since McEnroe is not afraid to dish the dirt on his colleagues. Although McEnroe is not going to be winning a literary prize anytime soon (some exciting grand slam wins are breezed by in a style that makes them seem almost secondary), his exciting roller coaster life proves amiable reading which most tennis aficionados will enjoy."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"Born in Germany in 1959, John McEnroe must surely be considered one of the great tennis players. He turned professional in 1979, though reached the semi-finals of Wimbledon as an amateur in 1978 - a record, at the time, for an amateur in the open era. He went on to win 77 singles and 77 doubles titles, including 7 Singles and 10 Doubles at the Grand Slams. He most famous match, strangely enough, may well be one he lost : the 1980 five-set Wimbledon final against Bjorn Borg. He also took the Davis Cup very seriously, winning it as a player and captain. He retired as a professional in 1992, though has played on the seniors' tour and works as a television commentator.He is, of course, just as famous for his temper, something that apparently caused The New York Times to label him \\"the worst advertisement for our system of values since Al Capone\\". Some of his more memorable lines came at Wimbledon. While he won that tournament for the first time in 1981 (beating Borg in the final), his second round match saw him label the umpire the \\"pits of the world\\" and \\"an incompetent fool\\". Naturally, he went on to utter the immortal words \\"you cannot be serious\\". Nowadays, however, when he plays on the senior's tour and in exhibitions, he feels he's expected to \\"yell at some people and break at least one racquet.\\"As a kid, Wimbledon was practically required viewing during the summer months. At the time, McEnroe, Borg and Connors were the top dogs in the men's game - and the rivalries McEnroe had with both made for great matches. For me, the most interesting and enjoyable sections of the book dealt with McEnroe's thoughts on both men. His admiration for Borg is clear, and the pair seem to have forged a strong friendship over the years - something I thought a little strange, given the differences between them on-court. However, his rivalry with Connors seems to have been a little more keenly felt - but there were parts I'm sure I picked up a touch of genuine admiration.There are some things, of course, that may have been difficult for him to write about - his marriage to and divorce from Tatum O'Neal. He also seems somewhat embarrassed about his bad behavior both on and off the court. To his credit, he doesn't try to brush over things or make excuses. (Admittedly, there are times he possibly tries to give himself a little too much credit). All in all, though, it is a very readable and thoroughly enjoyable book."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"Howdy,I really enjoyed reading this book from the very beginning. Very well written and it gave a lot of insight to the man behind the headband.I had been wanting to read this for quite some time and found it hard to put down.All in all I enjoyed it a lot."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"If you've only seen McEnroe as a commentator on USA, NBC , or CBS, then you might be intrigued by his brash, bold, and sometimes brutally honest analysis of a given match or player. Quite simply, McEnroe knows so much about the tennis industry that he is invaluable to the coverage of the four Majors, particularly Wimbledon and the U. S. Open. I think that he is the premiere sports &quot;color&quot; guy, regardless of the sport. Considering how many of his on-court antics have become famous (or infamous), even to non-fans of tennis, his personal life doesn't have quite the mystique that it would seem to potentially have. Or maybe McEnroe just doesn't want to (or can't) explain his behavior. One of the reviews said that he does too much &quot;justifying&quot; of his behavior to be sincere or apologetic or still in-your-face, and that is a very good characterizing of this book.The first third or so of the book tells of his youth tennis days, his rise to national attention, his college days, and his early Wimbledon tournaments, particularly his semi-final run in 1977. He then goes into almost excruciating detail of certain matches over the next few years as he rose to become the #1 player in the world. We know what he was thinking point by point, and each instant takes on great significance. If I were not such a huge tennis fan, I would have found this colossally boring. However, I was a huge Bjorn Borg fan growing up, and McEnroe spends a great deal of time exploring and trying to explain one of the most intense &quot;could-have-been&quot; great rivalries in all of sports. Borg left the scene, and McEnroe had to settle for Connors, Lendl, and Wilander in subsequent years.He goes into some detail about his marriage to Tatum O'Neill, their difficulties, and their ultimate demise as a couple. He is very stuck between loving the spotlight one moment and blaming that fame for all of his life's difficulties in others. I don't know if he was going for sympathy, but I found it hard to feel terribly sorry for him.Later chapters talk about his Davis Cup experiences, particularly as captain, his relationship with his current wife and kids, and his career as a seniors player. He offers a few details about his &quot;career&quot; as a rock star and his interest in the art world. I didn't read much that I hadn't known already, and I would love to have learned more about his gallery experiments.Bottom line: If you know McEnroe only casually from the occasional glimpse on TV, this book will bore you to tears--rent a video of tennis bloopers and see his &quot;You cannot be serious!&quot; line from Wimbledon. I'm a fan (although I liked Borg much better), so I enjoyed it. McEnroe is obviously a complicated personality who has lived a fairly complicated life. He does his best to explain both. He also is as smart as all-get-out, so he is careful not to tell too much or too little--he's always straddling that elusive line. His commentary during the tournaments is much more entertaining, enlightening, and insightful--he knows what he thinks of certain players, rules, and situations, and he will certainly not hesitate to tell a national audience on live television. This book is just another piece of that puzzle."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"As a lifelong fan of tennis I was looking forward to this book very much. While it was interesting to hear Mr. McEnroe's story in his own words, I felt like he was VERY selective with regard to what he chose to discuss. He was so brutally honest about all matters tennis and yet offered very little about his personal life. His marriage to Tatum O'Neal was barely even mentioned, which is surprising considering that they had 3 children together. I believe that if you are going to write an autobiography you must be willing to tell the good, the bad and the ugly. In my opinion, Mr. McEnroe told only bits and pieces and left his readers wondering about everything in between."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"As a long time fan of professional tennis, and John McEnroe in particular, I was tremendously disappointed in this one. Most of the book reads like a box score of a tennis match. McEnroe describes matches in agonizing detail. I was amazed that he remembered these matches so explicitly; perhaps he watched video of them while writing the book. There is painfully little about his personal life. I read Tatum O'Neal's book just before this one, and was curious to read McEnroe's take on their marriage. While I admired him for not taking an opportunity to trash his ex, he doesn't disclose much about why their marriage failed, or why his current marriage succeeds. I suppose he wanted to keep some things private, which is certainly understandable; but if that's the case, why write an autobiography in the first place?"},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"I am a HUGE tennis fan. My tennis memories stretch back to seeing Rod Laver (one of McEnroe's idols) battle Ken Rosewall. Growing up I often played tennis during the summer at a local park. I continue to play today and I go to the US Open for a couple of daytime matches every year. I don't watch tennis on TV the way I once did. During the late 70's and early eighties, anytime Borg or McEnroe were playing a match, against each other or against other opponents, I made sure to watch the event. My allegiance was originally with Borg, because of his speed covering the baseline, his two-handed backhand, his european background, and his quiet dignity. No one ever played the baseline like Borg. All McEnroe did was change the way tennis was played. He combined foot speed (which he credits to playing soccer), hand speed, hand-eye coordination, with the best serve and volley game in tennis. This made him virtually unstoppable when he was in the zone. In terms of pure tennis skill, no one else came close to McEnroe during his prime. Because he was left-handed, his first serve, which angled almost into the stands on some occasions, drew opposing players very far off the actual playing court. IF they were able to return his serve, McEnroe would simply rush the net,pick and choose where the ball would go in the open court, and either volley, half volley, or drop volley the ball to a wide open court.Fortunately, McEnroe does credit many people along the way with helping him improve his game. However, he was hampered by so many emotional problems I found it difficult to watch him. McEnroe talks about his problems during this period. His family, in particular his father, was a source of tremendous conflict for McEnroe. Borg was his alter-ego because of his ability to move laterally and horizontally with cat-like quickness. Together they played some of the finest tennis matches ever seen. McEnroe talks quite movingly about his experiences with Borg, his Davis Cup appearances, and other tennis-related aspects of his life. In 1985 I stayed up until four o'clock in the morning to watch Johnny Mac and Peter Fleming play against Guillermo Vilas in Davis Cup. It was the GREATEST doubles match I have ever witnessed, and one of the greatest sporting events I have ever seen on TV. They played in front of an Argentine crowd which was so anti-American and anti-McEnroe, I thought there would be a riot during the match. But Mac and Fleming were victorious. Afterwards, McEnroe and Fleming were interviewed on TV while they drank Heinekens. How many TV interviews have you seen where the athlete is drinking a beer? Say what you will about his behavior, he remains an individual in professional tennis. He is filled with conflicts which he discusses at length. He played Davis Cup for his country whenever he was asked, yet he exhibited behavior on the court which gave new life to the phrase &quot;ugly american&quot;.I have not always been a big McEnroe supporter. I thought tennis was a game where your emotions were kept in reserve while you battled your opponent, akin to chess. For that reason, and others, I never really enjoyed the theatrical aspect of McEnroe, or Connors, or Nastase throwing fits on the court. Give me a five match epic without much histrionics thrown in, and I am a happy camper.I still dislike Connors and Nastase, and after reading this book, my impressions are unlikely to change. In this book Connors comes across as self-absorbed, opportunistic, and somewhat dull away from the tennis court. McEnroe openly discusses his family, tennis, even the impact of 9/11/01. He is forthcoming about his problems, and displays a fairly high level of awareness than other athlete-turned-authors. The only reason I gave this book four stars instead of five is because I had just finished reading a biography of Vince Lombardi, written by David Maranis. The Lombardi bio is quite possibly the best sports bio I have ever read. This one is very good, but it pales somewhat next to the work of a seasoned journalist like Maranis. If you are a tennis fan, or a fan of Johnny Mac then you should find this book very appealing."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"If you call yourself a tennis enthusiast, suffice to say you're not one in my book if you haven't read You Cannot Be Serious. The always irreverent Johnny Mac takes the reader behind the scenes of his meteoric and sudden rise to the top of the tennis world as a teenager as well as his difficult, if not tumultuous, ride down when he was married to Tatum O'Neal. McEnroe recounts many amusing anecdotes from his tennis days that make for an entertaining read. He tells the stories behing his not so secret disdain for the enigmatic Jimmy Connors(beginning with Connors' refusal to shake his hand prior to their first Wimbledon meeting in 1977 when McEnroe was an 18 year-old unseeded juniors player).McEnroe reveals his propensity for smoking marijuana during his self-imposed hiatus from tennis in the mid 80's, the wild partying with the amiable Vitas Gerulaitis, the mutual camaraderie, unparalleled competition, and respect, of his nemesis and friend Bjorn Borg, the infamous longstanding feud with Connors, and his passion for, and unprecedented success, with Davis Cup. Johnny Mac tells of an offer of $1 Million from Donald Trump to play Venus that Venus turned down based on the somewhat dubious claim that she didn't want to play &quot;an old man.&quot; McEnroe, ever the competitor, tells of his anger over Steffi's notorious default of their Wimbledon mixed doubles semi that left him calling her a rather choice name(female dog is a hint) in the locker room - strangely enough in the company of her future hubby Andre Agassi and his then coach Brad Gilbert. Good stuff."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"When I listen to John McEnroe as a tennis commentator I often wish that other former athletes were as candid and insightful as he is. I figured that his autobiography might provide similar insight and entertainment. I can't say that the book succeeds in this regard but it is still rather interesting and entertaining.The quick summary is that McEnroe grew up in a comfortable environment as a child and was able to transform tennis talent into a life of celebrity and athletic greatness. He's bright and articulate but also rather shallow, extremely sensitive, somewhat self-centered, but has generally decent intentions.For tennis fans and fans of McEnroe's, the book provides a nice recounting of his tennis career. I especially enjoyed reading about his personal impressions of some of his opponents including his disdain for Jimmy Connors, his relationship with doubles partner Peter Fleming and his strange respect and awe of Bjorn Borg.The problem I have with the book is that in attempting to reveal his personal life with Tatum O'Neal and his current wife Patty Smyth, he doesn't do himself any favors in terms of image. He also doesn't reveal much about himself. In contrast we know how screwed up (in his mind) that Tatum O'Neal and her family are, but very little introspection on himself.Indeed he even admits in the book that even in his playing days he rarely admitted that someone beat him. Instead, he had some sort of excuse for why he lost. In this book, he also has plenty of excuses for some of his \\"losses\\" off the court and gives off the impression that he would be fine to share a few beers with, but would be awful to have as a friend.In short, if you were a tennis fan when McEnroe, Connors, Vilas, and Borg were the stars, read this book. Otherwise, it's kind of interesting but you could spend your time better elsewhere."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The first half focuses on JMacs tennis career and matches and he gives a lot of insight into his key matches and opponents. He definitely gets rather technical here but I find it interesting to read his analysis of Arthur Ashe's backhand, for example. He doesn't shrink away from doing a set by set analysis of his key matches, but again I find it interesting to read a first hand account of a wimbledon final in intricate detail from the perspective of one of the participants... The second half focuses more on his personal life, which was less interesting to me. Mcenroe is remarkably straightforward about his shortcomings on and off the court, which makes this more honest and less self-aggrandizing than most autobiographies. For anyone interested in the game of tennis and the career and opinions of one of the game's greatest players, this is definitely worth picking up."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"Love him or hate him, John McEnroe is an engaging personality. Reading this autobiography is just like listening to him do tennis commentary--it's conversational, funny, and honest. I already liked McEnroe, but I like him even more after reading this book. He can admit when he is wrong (well, now he can at least), and he is not afraid to share moments of insecurity and awkwardness in his life. He is a real human being, and it shines through in these pages. I wish there were more men's tennis players like him today."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"When I picked up the autobiography I only knew of John McEnroe as a star tennis player. The whole story from his meteoric rise to passing his athletic prime is personal, interesting and in many ways suprising. I am a bigger fan having read the book."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"This book is so much fun to read. McEnroe is a unique individual. He is incredibly arrogant, neurotic, rude, self centered, and narcissic. He is also insightful, brilliant, artistic. He understands the game like few others. He also plays the game like few others. It all comes through perfectly well in this biography. Nothing in this book was surprising. It was all expectable Mac in your face stuff. And, it was so much fun.On a more serious tone, Mac has a lot of smart wisdom to impart about the game, and the game's direction. He makes a lot of recommendation that make a lot of sense, but unfortunately are utopic. The most noteworthy of them, is that tennis should go back to wood racquets. I fully agree. Mac feels that the character of the game, and the associated skill requirement completely changed after that.I don't know if anyone remembers the artistic, versatile styles of Adriano Panata, Ilie Nastase, Tom Okker, Manuel Santana. They all played with wood racquets. Their style of finesse and unpredictability is gone from the game. John McEnroe also emulated that style. Today, our only hope is Roger Federer who shows the versatility and talent of the past. Unfortunately, he rarely passes the first round in any Gran Slam tournaments, and gets worn down by some anonymous grunter."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"I bought this book mainly because i was in love with Tennis and always wondered what made john mcenroe lose it on the court. Tho i was too young to watch him during his peak years, he always facinated me and would watch his recorded matches a lot.In this book he reveals the emotions of each of those matches and points, and it was a real pleasure. You can never hate him, but you can never be his greatest fan. what you would admire in the book is his honesty. His passion for life, family and game of tennis is very admirable. A great living legend but still a human being with emotions and anxieties just like u and me.His patriotism is irreplaceable.Definitely he puts in a lot of humour into the book also.To compare the game of the williamses with the college professionals that was uncalled for.To enjoy this book you really need to know in and out of tennis, the legends, the matches, the controversial points.......But for a tennis fan, this is the best treatThankyou and Kudos for a great book"},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"I found John to be quite candid about his professional tennis career, his personal life from family to first marriage and now with his second wife. I was suprised by the amount of children he has and his hands on role as a parent. He talks openly about success, drugs, fame, family, his past, the present and future hopes and dreams. There are a collection of photographs that add to the story telling and validate this man of many talents. I was a fan during his peak on the tennis courts and found him refreshingly outspoken and spirited. His book is more of the same with a bit of wisdom, grace and class that seems to stem from his age/personal growth. Interesting and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"I enjoyed watching Johnny Mc play tennis and I enjoyed his book. It was truthful and entertaining. I liked it so much I bought two books. One for me and one as a gift.I think most of the reviews are sour. John is one of the outstanding pople of our generation!An Ace in my book!"},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"I grew up watching John McEnroe in action. I'm an avid reader and a tennis lover. And I could not have asked for a better read.The book is very different from anything you might have read. But then, so is Johnny Mac. Right from the get go, you feel as if McEnroe himself is talking to you and telling his story in person. You can almost hear him speaking as you read. You get to know a lot of tennis legends, from Borg to Sampras...plus the greatest of them all, the super brat himself. You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"I just love laugh out loud books. This one is especially great because it's non-fiction.

Over the years I, like millions of other tennis fans, sufferred through John's losses and basked in the glow of his great triumphs. I ALWAYS loved the supreme elegance of his tennis and I ALWAYS knew intuitively that what he was enduring both on and off the court was the inevitable consequence of his very personal style of consumate professionalism, and the rigors of young celebrity. I hurted for him but I never condemned him. His revelations in his book suggest that he is growing up and finding a measure of peace in his life. But you're still very young John, and there is hopefully another half century of growth and maturation for you out there to be had---so go do it!This book is very well written and full of a touching (if somewhat naive) honesty. But I buy into McEnroe's sincerity and am moved by the extent to which he wants &quot;forgiveness&quot; from his fans. Regardless of that French open disaster and missing the much wanted Australian triumph, you WILL be remembered as one of the greatest tennis players of all time John. No one player can ever be called be THE greatest!"},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"John Patrick McEnroe, born in 1959, was the world's best player between 1980 and 1984. He has won 76 singles titles, of which 7 Grand Slam, and 76 doubles titles. Nowadays he is one of the best (perhaps even the best) tennis commentator.In this book McEnroe discusses his childhood, his rise to tennis fame and success, his fantastic 1980 and 1981 Wimbledon-finals against Bjorn Borg, his marriage to actress Tatum O'Neal, becoming a father (eventually six times!), his slow slide down the rankings, his divorce from Tatum O'Neal, his rock 'n roll career, the start of his art gallery in New York, meeting his second wife Patty Smyth, and being a father of six children. He also discusses his current work as tennis commentator for both US and UK television.Although I am/was a huge John McEnroe-fan I am slightly disappointed with this autobiography. Yes, it does shine some light on the magical tennis player, but it does not go very deep. There are not many details and he remains mostly at the surface. In all honesty, he comes across as selfish and childish (for example: his divorce from Tatum O'Neal was her fault, his slide down the tennis rankings was also not his own fault.) Just like some other readers I expected more as that is what autobiographies are about. However, for John McEnroe-fans like myself it is a MUST."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"John McEnroe is one of the all- time greats in the game of tennis. Bursting on the scene in the late 1970's, McEnroe brought a new dimension to the sport. He relives some of his greatest sports moments in this book, \\"You Cannot be Serious\\".McEnroe was known for his legendary temper, and he explains to readers how he got this way and why he continued to blow his top from time to time. He admits, in retrospect, that he went too far more than once, but he stops short of completely apologizing for his on- court antics. Among other reasons, he points out that the promoters of professional tennis quietly encouraged his behavior. They didn't necessarily think it was the best way to act, but they also knew that McEnroe's bad boy image helped increase the popularity of the sport.McEnroe talks about more than just tennis in this book. He also covers his tumultuous marriage with actress Tatum O'Neil; his encounters with rock and roll superstars; his second marriage to pop singer Patty Smythe; and his present- day occupation as a tennis announcer and commentator. McEnroe lays his heart on the line in this book, letting the reader know exactly how he felt about different players in the game and the women in his life.Even though I like John McEnroe, both the man and the player, there are a few negative points to make about this book. First of all, there's the editing job by James Kaplan. There are some poorly- worded sentences throughout the pages and there are too many exclamation marks and colons in places where they are not necessary. Second, McEnroe's ego could be hard for some readers to stomach. He brags on himself and always seems to have an excuse to explain why he lost certain key matches.Overall, this is still a fun book to read, in spite of its flaws. It could have been better with some more thought and effort, but it still makes for an enjoyable read. McEnroe lets you know exactly how he feels about the sport of tennis, the various personalities involved, and his own personal relationships. He's very serious, and he wants you to understand where he is coming from and where he is going."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"Arguably one of the most charasmatic and colorful athletes of the 80's has written a ... boring account of his life. McEnroe has written a \\"tell-nothing\\" book which pits him as the noble, misunderstood guy of tennis, and (relative)clean-cut athlete. All the while he is quick to criticize other players on and off court behavior and greed (namely Jimmy Connors). You would think a mercurial and brilliant athlete, who revolutionized his sport, and then married a famous child actor / heroin addict, would have an interesting tale to tell. Guess again.The book is drowned in sportspage type writing, where Johnny Mac painfully accounts hundreds of matches throughout his brilliant carreer (who cares who McEnroe played in the 1979 Milan Open in the 3rd round?). When it comes to providing insights into what was life like on the tour, and what drove him to be the best player and worst behaved; McEnroe is way off the mark and sheepish.McEnroe has never been accused of being a saint and you definitely get the sense he was privied to some wild offcourt experiences, but he never divulges. Probably to protect his image and family.In the end, the only real takeaway from the book is McEnroe is a bitter, greedy, self-serving, and selfish human being."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"The book offered great tennis history. It makes me want to rewatch all those great matches. Perhaps a video/dvd collection, John?I was disappointed in the lack of insight he brought to his personal and emotional life. As other reviewers have written, he did not offer much beyond what a magazine article written by another author would provide. He seems incapable of being diplomatic with those he has chosen to dislike. He constantly offered excuses, rather than understanding, for his own mistakes. It's apparent he is afraid of failure and is perhaps reluctanat to analyze his own faults for fear he (and we) won't forgive him(self) for them. You've got to be willing to put yourself out there when writing a biography. Seems to me that Mr. McEnroe needed a few more years to develop some emotional maturity and emotional intelligence before writing this one."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"As with many people of a certain age, I can remember John McEnroe's epic 1980 and 1981 Wimbledon finals against Bjorn Borg. Whatever you thought of Mac, he got a lot of people interested in tennis through those classic matches.I just finished Mac's autobiography and I'm ambivalent about the book.The best thing about You Cannot Be Serious is that it is a page turner. Mac has led an interesting life and the book includes many interesting anecdotes. The book does lose steam in the last few chapters when Mac discusses his post-tennis life. Mac is famous because he was a tennis player; his life after tennis just won't be that interesting to most people.Tennis fans might find this book to be something of a disappointment. There are some good sections about how Mac learned tennis as a child in New York. Otherwise, he does not go into enough detail about his tennis game and his many famous matches; a typical entry about his performances at Wimbledon or the U.S. Open might be only a couple of paragraphs - even when Mac discusses those years when he did well at the tournaments.A particularly disappointing, though not surprising, omission is a detailed discussion of the latter years of Mac's career; you just don't get much on Mac's mediocre performances after 1985. While no one likes to discuss failure, fans will want to know Mac's take on why, after dominating tennis for several years, he could not get back to the top. It was, perhaps, the biggest story in late-80s tennis, but you get about one chapter on it here.You may also get the strong impression that Mac wanted to settle a few scores through this book. He is rough on people he does not like. Mac is especially venomous toward Jimmy Connors, Ivan Lendl, and Tatum O'Neal. I will be honest: I like gossip as much as the next person and Mac is interesting when he lets loose on those he perceives to be his enemies. But those criticisms cause you to walk away from the book with the notion that Mac is anything but a man at peace.I also think that Mac tries to have it both ways when he discusses his infamous temper tantrums. On the one hand, he will say that they were out of line; on the other hand, he freely admits that he reveled in the attention celebrities paid him due to his notoriety.Mac also sanitizes and omits the details of many of his worst tirades. (I probably would have done the same thing). But if your only knowledge of Mac came from this book, you might not realize just how horribly he used to treat people during his matches. One way that Mac tries to justify his tantrums is to argue (20-30 years later) that his tantrums were OK because the officials' judgments during his matches were often wrong. Of course this misses the point; people don't criticize Mac because they think that think that the officiating at his matches was good; they criticize him because of the vile and demeaning way he treated everyone who crossed his path.In the end, I found You Cannot Be Serious to be the sort of book one seldom encounters: it is both very entertaining and deeply unsatisfying. What is here is pretty good; but you may feel that you're getting only a biased account of the McEnroe story."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"I give this book a C-minus.I hate to say this, but John was alot more entertaining and credible when he was acting out on the court.I'm glad he's now a devoted dad and husband, but he sure didn't own up to much of his past behavior in this book. Unfortunately, that part was glossed over.It would have been interesting for John to have been more candid in describing his &quot;temper tantrums&quot; as a contrast to what he is today. Instead, most of what we read is about the new, improved John, the devoted husband and father. (I thought an autobiography was supposed to be revealing and honest?)Also, I don't like what he wrote about his relationship with Tatum O'Neil. He writes about only one side of her and leaves out anything positive. It's as if he doesn't want the reader to know that he once loved this woman, that she was (and is) a viable human being. And not only that, he never seems to bring up his contribution to the break up of their marriage. He throws just enough negative stuff into the book about Tatum and her family as though to justify the ending of their marriage.Unfortunately, younger readers of this book will never learn about of John's antics on the court and how, in a crazy sort of way, they contributed to the history of tennis in the seventies and eighties.This could have been a much better book had it been written more honestly."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"Johnnie Mac muses in print on why he even wanted to write this book, and figures it's largely because he wants to keep out there, loves the attention. Could be; it certainly wasn't to bare his breast and tell all he could be telling.This is not to say he doesn't try to be honest. Mac is refreshingly frank about his tantrums, the emotional triggers which set them off, his crushing fear of failure, his feelings after a mood hits. No doubt Mac was able to win a lot of matches by tapping into his emotions, but he lost more than a few by letting them get out of control. One can feel McEnroe's pain and sense of loss after blowing a couple of chances he'd never get again, losses mostly his own fault.Beyond that, you get almost a match-by-match history of Mac's rise and fall in tennis, starting when he's playing at his parents' club, some of which can get tedious. This kind of thing could have been left for an appendix. People naturally want to read about the Wimbledon battles with Borg, or the struggles with Connors, but not every match rises to this level. Also, he occasionally will have trouble giving credit where due; some of his excuses for losing matches are pitiful or laughable.What you don't get would be far more interesting. His problematic relationship with Tatum - and her problematic relationship with drugs - is touched on all-too-lightly, considering this first pushed his career into limbo and then into its decline; the parties with Gerulaitis and later Borg are mentioned so obliquely that if you didn't know what they were doing you'd never guess it from this book; and more information on the difference between commenting on a game and playing in it would have been welcome. Even a chapter on his art gallery project would have been better than the couple of lines he writes.John McEnroe may at times have been a colossal and self-centered jerk, but he was also one of the greatest tennis players ever to have lived, a magnificent athlete when one could still compete internationally without having to transform oneself into a machine or a freak. His was an exciting and honest game. There have been bad boys before and since; his talent made him a standout. McEnroe haters will ascribe some blame to him for the decline of civility or decency in sports in general; perhaps. But if the spectators really wanted it any differently they would vote with their dollars. McEnroe was an American original, encompassing both the good and the bad.The book is worth reading as light gossip about Peter Fleming, Farah and Ryan O'Neal, Borg, and Connors (a presence Mac can't seem to grok or figure out or get over), and of course there is the tennis. But Mac's full story has yet to be told."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"This is extremely disappointing for me as I don't feel that I get anything out of this book. The beginning of the book which I find most interesting deals with how John McEnroe began his tennis career and a little background information about himself. It also depicts the life of a young tennis player, the expectations and pressure that he had to deal with. Also somewhat interesting was the politics of tennis, the importance of ranking and in general the world of tennis players. However, three quarters of the book deals with the career of McEnroe, detailing every match he had ever played. It can be extremely boring after 50 pages of the same thing and I think he should have only highlighted some of the more important matches of his career. I cannot but help feel that he seems to go into great length of matches that he won but mentioned briefly those that he lost. A reviewer said if you're not a tennis fan, this is not the book for you. However, I would like to say if you're not a McEnroe fan, you should definitely avoid this book.As a tennis fan, I thought there would be more insights in this book but was brutally disappointed. If you are hoping to get motivations, personal struggle, rags to riches type stories, this will not be the book. The book is shallow and personally, I find myself not respecting McEnroe as much as I did before I read his book. I have to agree with another reviewever that he seems to find excuses in what seems like everything such as his divorce to his first wife, lost matches, fines, etc."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"The McEnroe-Borg-Connors years were the apex of tennis viewing. These three very different individuals brought tennis to a much larger viewing audience. Their games and rivalries have - in my opinion - never been matched since. Men's tennis has become too power-serve oriented - at least Women's tennis has more rallies and somehow the shorter games can make for an interesting match.As you would expect from a super-star and a number-one ranked player, Mr. McEnroe comes off as very self-centred - there are all manner of justifications in this book for his many temper tantrums and outspokenness on the tennis court. He does dwell on his inner feelings - he has never gotten over his loss to Ivan Lendl in the French Open Final - a Grand Slam event he never won. And surprisingly, in the same way that Borg never got over losing to McEnroe at the 1980 U.S. Open, McEnroe never quite got over Borg's total withdrawal from the game after 1981. He missed his adversary and fell into the doldrums. He describes difficulties after that in getting motivated for matches.As much as John explores his inner feelings, he does come off as someone incapable of viewing the world from another individual's perspective. He becomes irate in the late 1980's when Steffi Graff pulls out of a doubles competition with him in Wimbledon - without realizing that doubles competition is a very poor cousin to singles competition - can anyone remember who won a doubles competition at a Grand Slam event? Also Mr. McEnroe himself either withdrew or deliberately \\"choked\\" in several matches due to his tennis \\"depression\\". He does not seem to realize that his several vicious tirades against umpires and fans (plus breaking tennis rackets) will make some people think rather less of him.Mr. McEnroe is honest about himself in this book. For my taste there is too much on wives, ex-wives and girlfriends. Little is said about women's tennis - Navaratilova is hardly mentioned, Chris Evert not at all."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"I just finished reading this book, and now I'm ready to buy all the videos of McEnroe's old matches against Borg, Conners, Lendl, etc... Now that I know the stories behind the on-court rants, and what went on behind the scenes at some of these tournaments, I want to watch it all over again!If you are a fan of John McEnroe, which I am, you will love this book! Growing up in the tennis boom of the 80s, I was drawn to McEnroe's passion for the game, and as a young player I tried to emulate him, but I never knew much about McEnroe the man. I found it very interesting to learn how he became such a great player, and hear how he looked at the top players as he was starting out on the pro tour. Imagine being barely 20 years old, running around Europe with guys that *you* idolized, like Borg! It's great to hear Mac talk about things like that. You can really tell who he liked, and who just got under his skin. The man does not mix words!Even if you are not a McEnroe fan, but a fan of his era in tennis, you will find this book to be of interest. He talks in great detail about some of the players of that era (Borg, Conners, Lendl, Vitas G., Vilas, etc...) and some of their actions on and off the court. To me, anyway, it was quite interesting to hear about that stuff. When you are 10 or 12 years old, like I was in 1980, you never wondered about what happened off the court, but now you can find out!I was lucky enough to find a SIGNED copy at my local bookstore, as well! What a bonus!"},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"I had purchased this book thinking that it was a tell-all about his relationship with Tatum O'Neal as well as all the goings-on in the tennis world. While I do like tennis, I don't play and don't watch it enough for the tennis stuff to be all that interesting to me. I thought that the book would have been much more entertaining had I been older in the eighties and remembered most of the people he mentions. It is very \\"Oprah-esque\\" in his justifications of why he did the things he did, but I do think he has some great ideas for the future of tennis and the USTA would do well to listen to him. After all, it is obvious that tennis has lost many fans since he left the sport. I left the book feeling that McEnroe still feels he has something to prove at least to himself, if not the world. And that is unfortunate, because at this point in his life, he should be able to just sit back and enjoy what he has worked so hard to obtain."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"I loved watching McEnroe play tennis with a wooden racquet and all the angles he created on the court with his serve, volleys and slices. For people who found his behavior on court \\"out of order\\" they will find a good analysis as to why he was like that.I like McEnroe's account of himself \\"I'm still a work in progress\\". He talks about his failed marriage with Tatum and subsequent one to Patti Smith. On the tennis side his respect for Borg is very evident and he was never quite the same after Borg retired in 1980. He certainly didn't like Jimmy Connors and he had run ins with Arthur Ashe in Davis Cup matches.I very much enjoyed the book with his clear, lucid style and would recommend it for tennis fans and anyone who would have strong opinions about him."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"A riveting book about who Johnny Mac was a person and his outlook on life. Very honest portrayal of him. Bold of him to openly talk about his weaknesses as a person not just a player. I absorbed the book in 2 days. Could not put it down. I found myself looking at old tapes of some of his memorable matches (from my father's collection) with a new set of eyes. Loved it. Highly recommend it."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"Better than most autobiographies. Moments of honesty and openess...however, not enough. McEnroe is too fascinating a character for such a tepid book like this.I did not get to see him during his best tennis years, so I did find the parts that recounted past matches to be pretty engaging.This is a good shot. If you're a Mac fan, buy it. If not, go get it from the library. It's worth the read."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"I found \\"You Cannot be Serious\\" to be an insightful view into John McEnroe's life as a tennis player, and he certainly has gone on to become probably the best commentator on the sport today (when is Bud Collins going to retire? He's almost as painful to listen to as Dick Button about Figure Skating, and I think that he has retired)....when reading the book, myself being an avid tennis player for over 20 years, I was solely concentrating on McEnroe's rise in the ranks. Another thing that surprised me was when he was a ball boy for Bjorn Borg, he went on to play him in more than several tournaments, and had a complete Idol worship of the Silent Swede, going on to say that Borg was the best male tennis player that the public had ever seen."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"I admit to being in the habit of not finishing a book, temporarily; however, it is rare that I skip chapters to get to the end and never care to read what I missed. This was a difficult read...or rather difficult to read.When you have lived a public life, it must not be easy to share what we (the public) have already seen in a way that is as interesting as the live moment that we have already witnessed. For John, it was almost impossible. It was painfully obvious that unlimited exclamation points were relied on to bring life to stories that should have had enough energy on their own. And that brief parenthetical phrases were used in place of a more in-depth telling of the John McEnroe story. Instead the book read like a drawn out People Magazine article, cropped and unengaging.Unfortunately, the book was as disappointing as John's Borders Bookstore visit to SF. He obliged his audience with autographs but sent word ahead of his arrival that he did not want to talk about the book. Did he really think we were there to get his signature?? I hoped the book would redeem his lack of interest in his audience, however, instead it highlighted how little he actually wants to say. Unlike other autobiographical reads that deserve their adoring audience, this one was not worth the time or the money."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"John McEnroe is one of the more intelligent and well-spoken sports superstars. I suppose with a good private school background and an attorney father it stands to reason. I have always liked McEnroe not just for his tennis ability, which at the net was truly artistic, but for his bluntness, openness and dare say honesty. During a match if he argued a call he was usually correct. I had some first-hand knowledge about that, I was a line umpire at one of his matches (he just bought the blue 450SL at that point in his career).That said I couldn't help but feel that the book is a compilation of many sessions with his shrink. It read a little too cute for me, too self-aware in a PG type of format. I suppose he couldn't really let loose because of his T.V. career.He leaves out plently of interesting stuff. Enough with Borg already, tell us how he self-destructed, went from Nordic God toNordic trash hauler. What happened? I'm sure McEnroe can shed some light but refuses to do so.We don't really read what happens on the road other than a few banal generalities. Again, I suppose he doesn't want to go into the gory details in order to protect his TV image and not make enemies. Taum O'Neil? I suppose she has to write her own book to get her side of the story out.If the book was a movie it would be produced by Disney and given a G or PG rating. As a sports celebrity book it is above average but not outstanding, steady from the baseline but lacksthe killer volley.David Watner"},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"In retrospect, John McEnroe was the only reason I watched tennis on TV. He's a genius and tennis hasn't been the same since...So I just had to read this book and I absolutely loved it. I understand the people who were hoping he would reveal more - but after having read this I do believe he is essentially a shy person who isn't able to expose every bit of himself. And I don't agree that he was overly critical of Tatum - from what I read, I believe he was making every effort to stick to the facts.I hope we see more of him on TV and in print.If you enjoy tennis-Read This Book!"},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"Good book.

His memoir is entertaining, somewhat insightful, and a must-read for anyone who enjoys the sport of tennis, admires McEnroe's skill both as a player and most recently as a commentator, or wants an inside peek of what went on in those halcyon days of the '70s and '80s when tennis was really at its peak."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"I found this book to be a little dull. The bulk of it is just a chronological listing of his matches, with a little insight from John about the match. He does talk a little bit about his antics, his marriages, and other non-match related stuff, but not enough for me. If you loved Johnny Mac back in the 80's I guess you would like this, but for the rest of us, I would pass on this book."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"This shot is OUT!

At the same time, his game was nearly a joy to watch -- his serve and volley plan was exciting, graceful, and -- obviously -- quite effective.The portions of the autobiography where he looks back on the tournaments -- his memorable 1980 Wimbledon final against Bjorn Borg, his infamous choke in the 1984 French Open final -- just very interesting to read in his own words. His detailing of the day-in, day-out rigors of professional tennis were slightly whiny, but very interesting, nonetheless.As you might expect in an autobiography by one of the more self-centered, arrogant figures of all time, this book is nearly exclusively about him -- to the near total exclusion of any real meaningful commentary on anyone else in his life. His parents and siblings largely disappear. His relationship with Patty Smyth is touched upon, but not in any way that sheds light on it. Tatum O'Neal is present, of course, and his has some thoughtful musings on fatherhood and being a husband so young -- but even his relationship with her feels very glossed over.Ultimately, I am a tennis fanatic, so there was no way I wasn't going to read this. Fans will enjoy it, others might not...."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"John McEnroe scores a triple bagle on his personal testimony. A brat on the court and an insightful analyst behind it, Johnny Mac endorses tennis fans with a rare perspective of his life unveiling some truths, but attempting to eradicate those dark dots in his life in a self-righteous fashion.Honesty fuels good biographies; objectivity rattles them. McEnroe offers the former, but true to his principles, repudiates the latter. His admiration for Borg, his disdain for Connors, his arrogance for up-and-coming players, his passion for Davis Cup competition, his addiction to controversy are all illustrated in a book churned by his unparalleled idiom.Yet, his conspicuous bravado backfires on him one too many times. Rather than apologizing, McEnroe expects answers from the likes of Girulaitis and Ashe. Rather than admitting his own share of faults on a relationship that failed because of clashing egos, Tatum O'Neal and her genealogical tree are the evil empire. Rather than trying to understand Lendl's or Connors' different personalities, he bad-mouths them imperviously.However, John McEnroe does attain one peculiar feat. He harnesses the various dilemmas presented in his book in much the same way he picked up an argument with a chair umpire or negotiated a long rally with the \\"robotic\\" Ivan Lendl. He writes a great biography and he does it in his own terms."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"John McEnroe is an honest guy. And indeed, he pretty much lays it all out the book - the good and the bad. One gets the feeling from watching him as a commentator and reading \\"You Cannot Be Serious\\" that he is a very popular person and great friend to many in the tennis world. And I get the feeling that he would be a loyal and fun friend to have. What is lacking is a sophisticated look at the world of tennis and personal analyses of his experiences that led to a mature understanding the relationship professional tennis players have with the game, the officials, business people and the players off court. While his brother Patrick's TV analysis is very incisive, John McEnroe comes across as shallow in this book. One gets the impression that the admission of his mistakes came through someone else's analysis rather than extended self reflection. While one can track the personal growth in Andre Agassi's fine book \\"Open\\", I didn't find the same kind of personal growth in \\"You Cannot Be Serious\\". I hope he will write another book after he has more experience outside of the tennis world."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"This book is what you would expect from John McEnroe. It details his tennis career along with the random events of his personal life. I was suprised how much was written about his relationship with Tatum O'Neal. It is interesting how he gives his perspective of not only tennis, but what he was also going through off the court and how he dealt with the pressure."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"Back in 1986 the only thing I liked more than playing tennis was watching it on TV. I disliked John McEnroe, but I admit he was entertaining in a trainwreck sort of way. I hated to see him win and loved it when he lost. Things change. I've since admired and enjoyed the way he commentates a tennis match on TV now. He peels back the layers of tennis players psychology on court in ways few sports commentaters have ever done.Likewise in his book, John commentates on his life as a tennis superstar the same way he would call a tennis match. It's very funny, very honest, and very multi-dimensional. The self-depriciation of his own childish bad behavior on court when he played was refreshing to hear and it was sprinkled throughout the book enough times you had to feel it was sincere.Great reading. Nice to get to know you Mr. McEnroe!"},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"Interesting autobiography. Easy to read. McEnroe not only talks about his famous tennis matches, but he also gives the reader a look at how he was feeling about certain things + a look at his personal life.I read Pete Sampras' biography too and found this one much better. Not \\"wooden\\".Very honest."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"Johnny Mac's biography is a rare glimpse into the psyche of a star athlete. I think most people miss the point when reviewing this book. Of course the writing isn't exactly Shakespeare and he glosses over some parts of his career while exagerating others. What else would you expect from an athlete's perspective...or anyone doing an autobiography for that matter.What is most revealing in this book is what he doesn't overtly say and what he implies in his descriptions of his life. For example, it was very telling how while growing up and throughout his career he always had some excuse for losing. It was never that the opponent was actually better than him. I think this really captures the essence of all great athletes. They simply cannot allow any self doubt to creep into their game or it destroys them. Certainly Mcenroe vented his frustrations more inappropriately than most, but understanding his mindset at the time, it isn't really surprising how he behaved when someone actually challenged his own self perception as unbeatable. What is surprising is that more celebritiy athletes don't behave the same way.In addition, there are numerous passages where his opinion of such contemporaries as Connors, Lendl, Becker and others has to be read between the lines. His thinly veiled dislike of Connors coupled with an almost jealosy of his reputation and achievements has to be gleaned from the unwritten words. Similarly, his treatment of his first marriage leaves a lot to be filled in and much of what he says should probably be taken with a grain of salt. Certainly an objective observer might have described the situation differently.But none of this really detracts from the book. It is an honest portrayal of the modern day creation of the \\"celebrity athlete\\". I really do believe him when he blames the USTA and others around him for partly making him what he was by never curbing his outbursts with any serious sanctions or defaults. Similarly, does anyone really think the NHL couldn't stop fighting in hocky games if it wanted to. It brings in the fans and so did Johnny Mac."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"When I was 9 years old, I stumbled onto a tennis match on TV. It was the most exciting thing I had ever seen, due primarily to the theatrics of the match. Of course I didn't know just how significant that 4th set tie breaker of the famous Wimbledon match between John McEnroe and Bjorn Borg was. However, from that day on, John McEnroe became my hero for many reasons including but not limited to the fact that he was a great left handed performer. Being an attention monging left handed 9 year old, I decided to imitate this American &quot;hero&quot; on TV. I started hitting against the wall with an old wooden tennis racquet. Ya, I liked tennis, but I LOVED John McEnroe. My emotions would be complete joy with his victories and crushing sadness with any loss. I longed to watch the way he hit the ball so I could copy it the same day at the park. To make a long story short, I went on to be a tennis pro myself thanks to John McEnroe. Now about the book: I believe that John has done a great job articulating what makes him tick or at least what HE thinks makes him tick. It was great to get answers to questions I've always had. An example: I remember being deeply saddened when Lendl took over #1 from John and when he took his leave of absense. At the time I assumed like alot of people that he didn't care about tennis anymore with the new wife and all. At the time, it left a void in me regarding watching tennis that still exists. This book will at least offer some closure on alot of behind the scenes as to why John did or didn't do this or that. I'm sure there's alot of John fans out there. I'm one of the few who proudly view him as a tennis hero: a man who played the game in an unorthodox or to me special way who did things on his terms. As a poor young boy who couldn't afford lessons, this gave me the will do tackle tennis and life like John: On my terms. Thanks, again John.

It is easy reading and the material was interesting. It gives insight on the world of tennis and the hardships of being number one. The reader was kind while revealing little of his family life. Having four children of my own, I would have enjoyed to read some of his own experiences with children and the affect of the tennis life on them. We do get a reasonable glimpse of the authors relationship to other tennis stars.

I am a tennis player and dreamed of being to the top someday. But since I chose to put studies first before my tennis, my dream didn't materialized. I just wondered what is the life of a tennis player would be. Through this book. I learned a lot of things. I learned to hate John, I didn't expect how a terrible person he is. But, I was amazed of a traveling tennis guys life.John put on this book what he really is, without the fear of other people might say. There is no magical about John as a person. I only like his talent, what he achieved and playing for the country. I wished that his talent went to another guy with a good personality, tennis would be a better sports."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"As a sport psychologist and author of the book Smart Tennis who works with professional tennis players, I enjoyed the insights into the life of one of the most successful tennnis players in history. It amazed me how fortunate John was to continually find himself in the right place at the right time. How he was was coached by the player who beat his boyhood idol Rod Laver (Tony Palafox), and was later coached by Laver's coach Harry Hopman. How his creative genious made him the best (I once did a survey in my column and readers rated McEnroe the most creative player in tennis history). It was also ironic that just when he was on top of the tennis world, he admitted that he was not at all happy - and that he could not appreciate his success. Tales from the Tatum O'Neil relationship were illuminating. The public often doesn't appreciate the fact that these so called \\"stars\\" are people just like you and I - with the same problems - and often more problems - and that money and fame are not the keys to happiness. I personally remember meeting John and Tatum as a tennis coach on Maui in the late 1980s. They were on their delayed honeymoon in January. I was visiting the Haleakula volcano at the top of Maui in January of 1987 when I saw John and Tatum standing there alone near a rented Ford convertible. I approached John and said - \\"Hi ... you look a lot like John McEnroe\\" and he said \\"yeah ... a lot of people tell me that\\" ... and Tatum smiled. It was the standard scene of the famous tennis star approached by one of the multitudes (far from being ranked in the top 10, I was just coaching tennis at Maui's Royal Lahaina Resort at the time). This book indicates that John has grown a lot in many ways since his pro career. I was pleased that he was open about seeking counseling for his anger. Sport psychology counseling works for standard problems - and also to improve performance by enhancing mental skills such as focus and confidence. I currently enjoy his television commentary. \\"You Cannot be Serious\\" is a deep and serious book and appears to reveal John's innermost thoughts and feelings. A creative New Yorker who changed the sport of tennis forever."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"...too bad this isn't the one.Tennis's most legendary bad boy, and television's finest commentator (sorry Bud Collins), McEnroe knows tennis. That's clear from early in the book. Unfortunately, Johnny Mac doesn't really have a handle on his precise role in the annals of tennis history.McEnroe played against some of the true legends of the game (Borg and Conners, primarily), and he shows near reverence when discussing them, and some of their matches. It's somewhat odd to read this, because McEnroe was never one to show respect on the court itself. But allow some other genuine masters of the game to be the topic of conversation, and Johnny Mac slips into his enfant terrible persona, primarily when discussing Ivan Lendl and Boris Becker.His personal relationships take the same tone as his professional ones, and its clear from his wirting and memories that once you get on MacEnroe's bad side, you're there to stay. He is absolutely (and somewhat over-harshly) disparaging of Tatum O'Neal, the mother of two of his children. I had just finished this book when Tatum made the \\"revelation\\" that Mac was a steroid user (unaccounted for in this biography, which leads me to question some of the veracity of Mac's other accounts), and JM criticized Tatum for making such revelations that would be to the detriment of their children. MacEnroe must have dozed through some of his own writing, for his early family life with Tatum was no \\"Father Knows Best\\" episode.There is a lot of trash talk in this book (he obviously does not care for the Williams sisters - again this could be personal, as he had challenged them to play a charity match). Mac Enroe should have been above all that. Having made the transition from the courts to the business and entertainment world, you would think this guy could tell hard stories without lowering himself to a juvenile level. He doesn't quite find that balance.Some great pages of tennis history are here. So is some purging of personal demons. But ultimately, and unfortunately, I think far less of MacEnroe having read this book."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"Candid, insightful.You don't know McEnroe until you've read his bio. A complicated, passionate man. A celebrity, but also a human being. I didn't think it possible, but now I like him even more after reading the book!His life off the tennis court is equally intense. Find out what happened behind the scenes between his matches, and what happened in his mind during the matches."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"Well, John McEnroe is a great tennis player, but not that great of an author. Thats why you have a ghost writer, right? The book had all the pertinent information, but it was so jumbled it was hard to keep track. Alot of information that was left in the book was, well, boring. I was one of his biggest fans growing up, but even I dont want to know about every single girl he dated. The first half of the book(about tennis) was very enjoyable."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"John McEnroe is an icon of American tennis. There hasnot been a player before or after John McEnroe that hadas much passion as he did on the court. I enjoyed the bookbecause he is very true to himself. Some people may thinkhe has an excuse for every match he lost but that's justhis personality. Sure, he may be an egotist but who cares?He was the best thing that every happened to American tennis, whyshouldn't he have an ego? I particularly enjoyed his thoughts on his downward spiral in tennis. It was very candid and he really made you understand how lonely he felt at the top.I like to live by his philosophy: You never know how far youcan go until you pull out all the stops. GO MAC!"},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"Mac tells his story in his words. But when you are a \\"spotlight hound\\" who likes the advantages of being famous but doesn't feel he should have to live with the negatives, how creditable can the story be?I play lots of tennis and remain a big fan of his artistry on the tennis courts. But let's be honest. The only reason Mac stopped playing tennis is the game evolved beyond his abilities. There are few serve/volley players because the game is based on power now. Mac did not have great power. It was sad to watch Mac play Lendl in the late 80s expecting a compelling duel when what you saw was Mac unable to handle the consistent pace of Lendl's power.But unlike many players, Mac was more than just a player. He attended private school through one year at Stanford. And while still a pro, he developed a deep interest in art by touring various museums around the world.Then there is the other side of Mac which occupies significant space in the book. Mac the musician. Here he uses his celebrity to play guitar poorly with famous people. While I'm sure this is quite a rush, he eventually forms his own band that does some minor touring. But his budding music career comes to an abrupt halt. He continues to bug his musician/wife Patty Smythe to sing with his band. When she finally agrees, Mac walks out in the crowd playing his guitar effectively taking the spotlight off the true artist, his wife. At least he's willing to put this story in his book showing how badly he needs the spotlight.Mac does talk extensively of his celebrity status and the advantages it allowed him. In our current pop culture this may be the most interesting part to people who don't closely follow tennis. While Mac may have thought he was writing a compelling intelligent biography, it will always remain known for the publicity is generated by his statements of wife Tatum O'Neal and her televised response.In summary, Mac is a very good tennis television commentator and a former great player. He also is a celebrity who needs the stage. But Mac, your time was over in the 80s. Time to move on and writing a book about yourself justifying why you whine on the tennis court doesn't quite cut. I'm glad I read this book, as I'm a big tennis fan. But Mac's highest and best use is a challenge match against one of the Williams sisters. He's become Bobby Riggs. And I'll bet the match eventually takes place because Mac needs the spotlight."},{"Title":"You Cannot Be Serious","review":"...incredible and genuinely evocative; a wonderfully creative and indeed thought provoking rarity. Imagine an author with several very urgent, refreshing, candid and most definitely intelligent scenarios to share with insight and wit. John McEnroe definitely does possess a wide and rich assortment of tangible literary gifts and engrossing &quot;story-telling&quot; skills. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Myths of the Hindus & Buddhists,","review":"This was a required book for a college class. We read the version of the Ramayana offered in it. I & my classmates found that it was lacking in some important details of the epic. My professor said that he chose this one because it was a \\"cheap, small book.\\" However, he did not realize that this new version has huge print so it is a massive book. He is not going to require it for any future class. I recommend finding a used copy of the old version or else an alternative."},{"Title":"Mind Over Matter (Delta Expedition)","review":"Amazing what they did, but told in a very undignified, uninspired manner. After finishing this I went immediately to Mawson's &quot;Home of the Blizzard&quot; and the contrast not only in writing style but personal qualities is startling. Fiennes complains endlessly, in a petty manner, about his companion-. He keeps teling the reader he is tougher, faster, better navigator, etc. yet he made some major screwups in planning (although he did a good job of avoiding the polar bears!). And the recollections are so self-centered, down to numerous photos of frostbitten toes, fingers etc, plus an hourly update of the status of every blister and hangnail. And he wrote the book after the fact! Scott, Mawson, Shackleton and many other earlier explorers didn't gripe one tenth as much even in their diaries, written in the midst of the pain and agony. And those earlier guys actually noticed their surroundings and wrote of them poetically. Since Fiennes took the trip mainly as fodder for a book (he says so in the book) you'd think he could have offered the reader much more. The earlier explorers accomplished things for the greater good - mapping, meteorlogical recordkeeping, collecting biological specimens, etc. They wrote their books, or published their journals, to finance exploration, not the other way around. And the MS cause seems dubious, considering it wasn't Fiennes' idea, but rather a condition placed on them to get funding. I found it depressing all in all. Much more inspiring to read about Scott freezing out there than this guy surviving."},{"Title":"Mind Over Matter (Delta Expedition)","review":"As I read this book I found it hard to believe that what I was reading was actually written by one of the adventurers. I was sure that I must be reading an account of their expidition based on one of their diaries that was recoverd next to their bodies. That Fiennes and Strand found it withing themselves to keep going is hard to believe, even now, and yet they achieved their goal. I would rank what they did one of the most &quot;out there&quot; of human achievements. And for that reason alone this book begs to be read."},{"Title":"Mind Over Matter (Delta Expedition)","review":"Englishmen Ranulph Fiennes and Mike Stroud together made four failed attempts on the North Pole. Their major success was an expedition both inwardly expected to fail - the unsupported (carry everything) crossing of Antarctica.There had already been an unsupported trip to the South Pole. Indeed, as they were making their crossing, the Scandinavian explorer Erling Kagge - who claimed the first unsupported trip to the North Pole, disputed by his rivals Stroud and Fiennes - was making the first solo unsupported trip to the South Pole.The crossing of the Antarctic continent, however impractical, was the next logical goal. This account, and another by Stroud entitled \\"Shadows on the Wasteland,\\" stress the grinding wear and tear on the human body, the bleak, black thoughts that accompany every labored step, and the life-threatening hazards of weather, crevassed terrain and starvation.The difference in their stories is entirely point-of-view and personality.Fiennes, the leader, sounds a practical, matter-of-fact note - his appendices on leadership, equipment, history and topography are nearly as long as his personal account. Stroud, the younger and smaller man, is more volatile and impassioned, resentful of the very notion of leadership in a two-man expedition.They began the trip unsure that they would even be able to budge their sledges - loaded with 485 pounds of food, fuel and equipment. \\"It would be so embarrassing if, once in our harnesses, our efforts came to nought and the sledges refused to budge,\\" says Stroud.After four hours they had moved only a couple of miles on their 1,700 hundred mile journey. And the next day they had their first equipment failure - a thermos that left one of the major respites of their day, hot soup, cold and full of gelatinous fat globs.On they went. Sails, parachutes inflated by the wind, had been an early bone of contention between them. Stroud was insistent, Fiennes, dubious about their usefulness and the added weight, agreed reluctantly. On their first try both found them terrifying and exhilarating.Says Stroud, \\"Compared with the toil of manhauling, to be pulled forward at high speed was a delight so intense that to ignore it, merely because it was difficult and dangerous, was near impossible.\\"And Fiennes, \\"After a hectic ten minutes of being dragged over ice ridges, crossing ski tips and being struck in the back by the sledge....I suddenly spotted a blueish shadow some forty feet ahead.\\"Fiennes threw himself to one side. Stroud, used to seeing his companion fall, started to go around. Going too fast to stop, he plunged into the crevasse. Says Fiennes, \\"Appalling thoughts crowded my mind: chiefly how I would explain Mike's death to his wife and mother.\\"But Stroud had landed on a precarious snow bridge. The description of extricating him and his sledge is harrowing. The sledge was permanently but not crucially damaged. On they went.Black thoughts, with no other outlet, turned on one another. Their chief friction was pacing. Stroud believed Fiennes was going slower than necessary because of brooding over his age (47); Fiennes believed Stroud was wasting energy by going too fast and later attributed hypothermic episodes to this depletion. Both experienced intense anger toward the other, most of which they avoided expressing except in their diaries.Consuming 5,200 calories a day, they were using 6,000 to 8,000, even 10,000. Slow starvation far outpaced the lessening of weight on the sledges. Because of Stroud's medical record keeping, (ironically described in greater daily detail by Fiennes) chemical changes and physical debilitation were documented with appalling exactitude.Both were subject to digestion problems, chronic frostbite infections, sores from chafing clothing and harnesses, skin damage from the depleted ozone layer, blindness from white-outs and from the absence of anything to focus on. But starvation was chief among their troubles, leading to muscle loss (even of the heart muscle) as well as every bit of insulating fat.When Fiennes finally called a halt after Stroud experienced several life-threatening bouts of hypothermia and hypoglycemia they had crossed the continent, although not the ice shelf which intervened between continent and ocean. They had succeeded, raising millions (at a penny per mile) for the Multiple Sclerosis Society, accomplishing major physiological research and being first to cross the continent unsupported. This, despite all the practical, idealistic reasons given, was their reason for going, a reason incomprehensible to most of us.Both books are well-written, expressive of separate personalities undergoing the same grueling physical and mental hardships. Both acknowledge they could not have made it without the other, for mental reasons as well as physical. Both are riveting accounts of exploration in a place few of us ever wish to go."},{"Title":"Mind Over Matter (Delta Expedition)","review":"This is the account of his journey across Antartica - on foot, pulling sleds - with Michael Stroud. In it Ranulph describes, not only his journey, but insights into the human mind. It is supported by extracts from the diaries of both men, as well as extracts from books of previous Antartic explorers. Some people feel the need to push themselves to extremes, others (like me) like to read about them, and this is an intelligently written, honest and interesting book.There are absolutely no bears mentioned in it, and it is a pity that one reviewer felt the need to give it one star without ever having read it."},{"Title":"Mind Over Matter (Delta Expedition)","review":"This may be the most inspirational book I have ever read. The ability of two men to cover the entire Antarctic continent while hauling 500 pound sleds and having no support, (even at the pole), is too crazy to seem plausible. Fiennes comes across as a bit crazy and scatter-brained himself, (he dosent' check the thread on the propane bottles until it is too late to change them, for example), yet he and Stroud persevere and survive a trip of unbelievable deprivation."},{"Title":"Mind Over Matter (Delta Expedition)","review":"I couldn't put it down -- extremely honest account (at least I had no trouble imagining that I'd feel the same way in similar circumstances, supposing I survived them)."},{"Title":"Mind Over Matter (Delta Expedition)","review":"Not great reading. Walking in a desolate land pulling massive sleds just doesn't sound exciting. Describes mainly bickering between partners and incredible endurance. You can pass on this one without missing much.

This is gruesome to the point of making me wonder if this man needs psychiatric help for self mutilation.Much more fun are the people who do this (crossing Antarctica) using parachute (wind) pulled sleds, or even dog teams.

This publishing focus reflects a national obsession with helping adults while assuming kids will be all right. Not true!We are in the midst of a terrible tragedy in terms of undermining children's health before they are even through their full physical development. Ms. Henner deserves a huge thanks for taking this subject on, and doing a fine job with it!The data are clear. Children of five often have unhealthy cholesterol levels. Childhood obesity and many related diseases such as diabetes are on the rise. ADD and depression are soaring. Allergy-related problems are often chronic by age six. Many of these problems will stay the same or get worse in adult years. For example, those who are obese while young will usually be obese as adults. That increases the risk for many diseases, especially diabetes and heart problems. The causes relate to eating the wrong foods, too little exercise, and parents doing a poor job of offsetting social influences (like advertising to kids, vending machines for candy at school, and supersize meals at fast food restaurants) in these areas. If your kids are having a lot of ear infections, are tired all the time, are grumpy or hyper alternatively, have asthma, or are overweight, this book will probably help you make changes that will enable your child to improve.If you want a quick overview of the problems and the solutions, Dr. Peter S. Waldstein's foreword captures the key points.While many books on subjects like this rant about the problem but provide little guidance, Healthy Kids is a happy exception. There's lots of practical advice about what food to buy and prepare at home, what to do when eating out, how to improve the food at school, ways to increase exercise, and suggestions about getting rid of and avoiding toxins. The book contains over 100 healthy recipes for foods that kids like, that can substitute for traditional, unhealthy ways of preparing the same or similar foods.I was particularly impressed by the detailed advice related to each age group through college. The book begins by pointing out that 85 percent of children today don't get enough breast milk for proper brain development. Human breast milk has six times the fatty acids critical for brain development that cow's milk has. And cow's milk can cause allergies for some that lead to respiratory and ear infections.My only complaints about the book were that it did not take a look at how blood type affects different youngsters; usually ignored the differences between what girls and boys need; argued for separating and combining different foods without making a case for why that was a good idea; and did not have a section on drinking enough water.The sections on why to avoid sugar, white flour, the wrong fats, hormones, caffeine, beef, dairy products, and other artificial chemicals were very well done. The related sections on how to avoid them were even better!Ms. Henner is ready to be your success coach in this important area. As she points out, your child's pediatrition got almost no training in these areas and probably won't make the right suggestions relating to diet and exercise. Even if you have a pediatrition who does provide good advice on what to do, she or he won't know much about how to help make the changes.After you finish this excellent book and place it where you make your grocery shopping lists, I suggest that you think about how you can improve your children's emotional health, too. How many hugs and kisses did they each get today? How many kind words did you share?Let's put an end to unnecessary suffering by our children!"},{"Title":"Healthy Kids: Help Them Eat Smart and Stay Active--for Life!","review":"Even though I am a vegetarian and eat very healthy, I have felt a little lost about how to pass on the importance of healthy food to my daughter.

For example, how to handle McDonald's birthday parties or school snacks without making her feel like the odd one in the bunch. This book gives great advice on how to handle these situations in a positive manner as well as how to make healthy eating a lifestyle for the entire family. I also love the recipes and knowing that I can still bake homemade desserts for my family, just without all the processed sugar and dairy. I have already tried some of the recipes and they have been a hit so far.

The truth is, the main problem with a meat-free diet, has always been how to make it attractive to the kids. Well, this book offers so many tasty, nutritious and inviting recipies that all toddlers will find food to their liking.

I also really liked all the info on development stages of children - for people who don't have time to research childhood development, it was great to have the info in one place, and to relate children's health to what they eat, and what they do (movement & activities).As a comment on a previous reviewer's observation about soy substitutes for dairy products; I have found plenty of vegan non-dairy subs (no casein) - they are becoming more and more available as demand for them increases. Also, there are subs made from other products (rice, oat, almond, etc) that contain NO casein. Going completely dairy-free has cleared up allergies, acne, and weight problems at our house.

As a programmer knows, learning a new editor/IDE is the bane of the profession. I still use the editor I learned in college, because I hate learning new ones. - This book makes it easy (No, I won't say how long ago I went to college :)The field guide is a very well written book and an essential guide for learning how to develop Java applications quickly. Fully 1/4 of the book shows essential details for learning the shortcuts that reduce keystrokes and teach essential techniques for becoming a power user of the IDE. The book also contains grey boxes that address some of the history and essential concepts of Java programming. Each section is designed to fully address the myriad of activities supported by the Netbeans IDE. The beginning of each section shows a table of essential functionality and associated key combinations, making this book handy to have close by.The Netbeans IDE has a lot of hidden functionality, which is exposed by a quick scan of the book. Code refactoring and debugging are very common activities that are covered in detail. The book also covers every type of Java application - from PC based (console) to embedded systems (J2ME) though server based systems (J2EE) and Web Services.Coverage of how to use the Form editor is good; however the example does not show how to create form. It also does not mention that in order to drag and drop components in Windows both mouse buttons must be pressed.

If you are an absolute beginner, I would recommend combining this course with the Earworms one (also sold on Amazon). I found that they work well together to help you break into this complex language. The only way to learn a language is to hear it over and over again, so every vantage point you can get helps. It is important to find out if you want to go further in Russian before you invest a lot of money, so this is a very good place to start. I hope to go on to their full courses. What I like about Pimsleur (I have used their French and Italian courses fairly extensively) is that it can all be done by listening. Of course you can look at the text from time to time but the bulk of the work is in audio (I load it on my iPod). That point has kept me from Rosetta - the bulk of their system is on the computer and I already spend all day on a keyboard. I want to learn while I walk/jog/run and fold clothes!

From this father's perspective, he is not the sole authority here, no! His daughters opened up a world he did not know existed, the world as seen through their eyes, and this changed his own view of his life, life in general, and the world in general. Each poem describes a snapshot moment in time, a fleeting thought, a feeling. As a collection, they embody the special, circular relationship between a father and his children.In reading this book, I began to wonder about my own parents, and if they had ever had such thoughts. It made for some great conversation with them, and we learned a little bit more about ourselves in that process.It is a book everyone who has a father, is a father, or knows a father should read."},{"Title":"A Father's Poems","review":"In heartfelt, powerful language Mr. Dutta has captured the complexities of parenthood.

No one could read these lovingly poignant poems without being deeply moved. Ajit has captured both the spiritual and temporal nature of childhood - its innocence and experience. His deep love for his daughters shines through the poems as he speaks in beautiful language of how much he has learned from them. Cheerios, rice krispies, and childish impatience are delightfully juxtaposed with powerful personal thoughts on the feelings of humility at the privilege of being part of the miracle of fatherhood. As Ajit says in his author's note, the poems are &quot;highly personal&quot; yet also &quot;universal. It would be hard to pick a favorite, but I think &quot;Dinner Conversation with a Six-year-old&quot; captures the essence of the poems. &quot;...But if God is everywhere, how come I don't see him?

Well, it's a pleasure alright (the plot twists surprise, the characters are hard to forget, the prose is elegant), but when you close the book 901 pages later, you probably won't feel guilty at all. You may even want to applaud.The setting is an alternate early-Renaissance Europe (France is called \\"Terre d'Ange\\"), in which early Christianity has taken an odd turn and for some reason there are three islands (as the helpful map shows) in the English Channel called \\"the three sisters.\\" (It takes a while before you learn what they are, and what their significance is, but it's worth the wait.)Phedre, bisexual courtesan-avid reader-linguist-slave-spy is thrown by fate into a grand tour of this world and she helps to right some wrongs along the way--and rather cleverly at that; her methods are never out of character.And then there's the style: Quite daringly, Carey has Phedre tell her long tale in a first-person narrative. And that's a difficult thing to do. Authors less skilled than Carey who use the first person to describe a \\"built\\" world often resort to conventions to disguise the fact that the narrator, there in the built world, is writing for you, here in the early 21st century (\\"I have heard that in some worlds there are strange beasts upon whose backs people ride\\"). But Carey avoids this convention entirely. Phedre's narrative simply assumes that you are part of her world and that you've picked up her narrative some time in _her_ future (not ours), and as a result everything is left shimmery, impressionistic, as foggy as John Jude Palencar's amazing cover. It may take you a while before you slap your forehead and think, \\"oh yes. Now I see what those 13 houses of the night court are!\\"A stunning novel, superior in every way. And there are two more, ready and waiting."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I have now read all three books in this trilogy, and if you are considering reading this first one, I envy you the treat ahead of you. These books as a whole story are deeply satisfying, and each one stands on its own as well. The world that Carey has created is strangely familar... the shape of the continents is the same as our Europe, but something different happened to the history, around the time of the crucifixion. Out of the mingled tears of Jesus and Mary Magdalene, the god Elua was born, and he wandered the world, joined by seven angels with different attributes. Today the descendants of Elua and his seven companions rule France, only the name \\"France\\" is never heard. Instead we have Terre d'Ange and its six provinces. Our England is named Alba, and the Romans (called Tiberians) never conquered it. And so on. By this device, Carey is able to draw on the richness of human history and her own fertile imagination, and the result is a world of great beauty.We follow the life of Phedre, sold into indenture by her profligate parents, and bought by an erstwhile poet and spymaster who is involved in a mysterious way with the royal family. Phedre has a special talent--she takes pleasure from pain. Where this destiny takes her in the three books is a masterpiece of storytelling, and has a message for all of us: you are needed exactly as you are.Above all, Carey is a master storyteller, with adventures, twists, and sexy romances that will keep you turning pages, and gorgeous language that will keep making you want to slow down! (The names alone are luscious: Ysandre de la Courcel, Melisande Sharizai, Anafiel Delaunay...are just a few.) Luckily for me, the books can be re-read with pleasure; they're that good. If six stars were possible, I would give them."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is one of the best fiction novels I have ever read. I reccommend it highly to lovers of fantasy, erotica, mystery, romance, and/or historical fiction. The characters are so very human, flawed and conflicted and beautiful and deep. Be warned, the book is full of S&M, \\"alternative\\" sexualities, and religious beliefs that would sound heretical to many conservative Christians (the savior in this series is a child born of the blood of Christ, and the tears of Mary Magnalene, birthed from Mother Earth's womb, and cast out of heaven by God, with a scion of damned angels, who create their own Eden). The plot is sufficiently complicated, as are the characters, and the book paints detailed pictures of the geography of this alternative Europe/Asia, the gods/goddesses that rule over them, and the peoples that live there. Unlike many fantasy authors that attempt an alternative Earth, Carey does not get too caught up in the exactness of parallels. For instance, the people called Yeshuites are much like the Jews of Europe in culture and language, but in Carey's world, they are the only believers in Yeshua (Christ) as the savior of mankind. Nearly all others from Phedre's country follow his son, Elua. This novel pulls the reader into exotic and savage lands, tantalizes them with rich tastes and sights and sensations, exposes them to a variety of cultures based on everyone from the Rom (Gypsies of Eastern Europe) to the French and Russians, and allows them a window into the mind of a delightfully willfull and passionate courtesan. Dramatic sword fights, sex-art training, royal spys, traitors, priestesses, courtesans, fortune tellers, voyages, slavery, assasinations, and trysts all find easy niches in this lovely book. 5 stars!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I inadvertently started reading the second book before I knew that it belonged to a trilogy, and had to backtrack to read Kushiel'd Dart before I could finish. The world Carey has created -- an alternate-reality of the middle-european Renaissance (sort of) -- is detailed and full of interesting cultural conventions and social rules. Without being overbearing and obvious, she builds the rules of this world through the observations of Phedre, the spy-cum-courtesan who drives the convoluted but well-mapped plot.This is primarily the story of political intrigue in the class of a good Ludlum or leCarre novel -- just enough twists and turns to be very interesting, yet not require re-reading to figure out all the puzzles. Setting the novel in this mythic world populated by the offspring of fallen angels and other christian icons lends a lush feel to the novel that Carey pulls off without being corny.I literally could not put this one down, and moved from the end of Dart to the second book, Kushiel's Chosen, in one sitting. It is, obviously, for mature readers -- a masochistic courtesan is the main character -- and not for the easily shocked or overly religious, I think. All in all, worth every minute."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"When I picked up this book in the bookstore, I read the jacket and was immediately intrigued. I bought the book in hardcover, which I rarely do, and when I sat down at home to check out my new acquisition, I read the whole thing in about eight hours, which I do quite often.I loved this book. It was set in an almost alternate Europe where people worship \\"Blessed Elua\\" who reminds me of Jesus, and many other gods. Look carefully, and, if you're Jewish, or know enough about the Jewish faith, you will find many references to Judaism and to other cultures. It is a hodgepodge of realty and fantasy that, if for no other reason, keeps you reading just to find out how much of reality is truly present.Phedre no Delaunay is called an anguisette, basically a fancy name for a masochist. Yes, she enjoys pain as much as pleasure, and in some cases, pain gives her pleasure. The sex scenes are graphic, but not tasteless. They are all done with some decency in mind, and never once was I horrified enough to put the book down.The book takes Phedre down the road of life in many unique ways. Not only is she a courtesan, she is also a spy, using her skills to gain information on the intrigues of the court around her. There are 12 courts in the land of Terre D'Ange, land of angels, where Phedre lives. Every court has certain qualities that allow them to become distinctive, and each court conspires and conives to bring down the others. Phedre, using her talents as the only anguisette in a hundred years, gains information and passes it on to her mentor, who tries to untangle the mysteries of the court.This book was fabulous in all ways. The land is clearly detailed, the people are all unique, and Phedre is a heroine that you will NEVER forget. This book is the epitome of all fantasy, and the sequel is even better.... but that's another review."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I'm immediately distrustful of erotic fantasies and my suspicious mindset wasn't improved by the cover of the book (a half-naked girl with eyes cast down, standing in front of a group of columns). I made the decision to buy the book in part due to the collection of rave reviews in the front of the book. There were, in short, enough comparisons to Tanith Lee and George R. R. Martin to spark my interest.While I have to say I don't think that Carey's written a book that can equal one of Lee or Martin's creations, I did find it readable and well-crafted. Moreover, while there are sexual elements, Carey does a marvelous job of keeping a book about a masochistic prostitute from descending into soft-core._Kushiel's Dart_ is best compared with _Maia_ by Richard Adams in which a prostitute can have a priveledged role as a witness to power. Through the lens of Phedre no Delaunay we get a rich look at the game of houses played in this fantasy land of Terre d'Ange.Interesting mythology with enough fantasy elements to make it an alternative world but resists using stock magic elements to carry the plot. The only fault is in the seeming lack of flaws in the main characters-- and I also get tired of races where everyone is unnaturally beautiful, but I guess that goes with the genre.I suppose it's worth repeating the obvious-- not designed for the younger fantasy reader."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Wow! When I picked up this book, I thought it was going to be something totally different; but it was still the best book I've read in a long time. The plot and the place is so interesting, how and who they worship as a religon is very new to me. When I first found out about the romance part I thought it was going to be a hokey book like Fabio or something. But the book just captured me and kept me going to the very end. The descriptions are very powerful and real, I felt like I was in the book. And the other aspects, the love Phedre feels for both her companion and Melisande is so intersting, and the best part is that people don't look down upon the fact that Anafiel loved prince Rolande and Alcuin.All in all this book was very well written, it even made me cry at some points, and the ending was so sudden and it just left you hanging! It makes you scream for the sequel, and I will get it as soon as I can!!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Most of what I have to say, people have already said, so I'll forebear gushing and keep it short.The subtitle for this book could well be a line that reappears frequently throughout: \\"All that yields is not weak.\\" (Or something along those lines -- I just finished Kushiel's Chosen, and have forgotten the exact wording.) Phedre finds pleasure in pain and submission, yes, but she rules her patrons through that same submission. It takes an incredible amount of talent to make this concept believable, but Carey more than acheives it. Some of the scenes are shocking -- this is not a book for the faint-hearted -- but they are never inappropriate or even overdone. The sex is integral to the plot, and after a few initial moments of revulsion, I was able to accept that Phedre truly enjoys and needs this. The mix of real and fictional cultures is engaging, and Carey's language is lovely, although in Kushiel's Chosen she becomes a little too fond of \\"'tis\\" and \\"'twas\\" for believability.I've noticed a few reviews complaining about the length. Grow up, people. This story is no longer than it needs to be -- Carey could not possibly have pulled it off in less than 701 pages. Seriously, I read it in three days -- you can't put it down. If anything, I wished it would last longer. Kushiel's Chosen is 700 pages exactly in hardcover, and I'm dying waiting for the third book! Also, someone was complaining that the names are incomprehensible and unpronounceable. I think the term was \\"jumbled up letters.\\" Huh? They're French. Some of the names later in the book are Germanic or Gaelic. There's nothing jumbled-up here. Sheesh."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I debated for months as to whether to buy this - especially as it hasn't been released in the UK yet - but i decided i had to read it the moment i saw the cover art... absolutely stunning. I finished it today, and i can say it just restored my faith in the fantasy genre.As far as characters go, Phedre is intriguing. I loved that nothing in her life is ever simple; that she can accept what she is, and yet hate herself for it, whilst acknowledging that it is a weapon she can use effectively. She gets read-out-loud dialogue, and the kind of self-confidence that drags the reader right in alongside. I got lost at times - i got completely confused as to which noble was which, and what they were doing - but in the end, it doesn't matter. Political intrigue never really grabs my attention, but so long as the characters do, all is forgiven. It isn't fantasy in the usual sense, although there are fantastic elements; i suppose it's really alternate history, although i usually steer clear of that. I wouldn't call it a romance, though. The romantic elements are no more pronounced than in many fantasy books i've read, and i can't stand slush. While i suppose you could term the sex element romance, i really don't think it applies...I've been trying to describe it to people ever since i started reading, but i wouldn't wholeheartedly recommend it to everyone. The sex scenes are integral to the plot, and to the characters, and i can think of a lot of people who won't like that. Some of the reviews here have said as much, but you need to be in the right frame of mind to appreciate exactly what is going on. None of it is gratuitous, exactly - Phedre uses her gifts and her training to gather information, and as bargaining currency, and boy, is she confident that everyone in the entire world wants her in their bed. Usually they do, of course, cos she's the heroine. It's only fair. It reminded me in many ways of Laurell K Hamilton's 'Kiss of Shadows', except far less supernatural stuff. Lots of similar elements; infact, for anyone who's read LKH's work, i'd say this is the direction she's going in. As far as the Tanith Lee comparisons go, this is far more accessable than her similar works, in my opinion.Highest praise? I turned the last page, and wanted to start writing myself. Only very bad or very good books make me want to do that, and this was very, very good. It has a cliff-hanger that you can live with, and i just found out there's a trilogy planned. Not sure how that's gonna work out, but on the evidence here, it should be good!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Kushiel's Dart is simply fantastic. The story is set in a world that is basically Europe, called Europa, but with a few changes: countries' names differ, yet remain related to the model, such as Alba for England, Eire for Ireland, and Terre D'Ange, for a France-like nation; a pantheon of gods and godesses rules Terre D'Ange, the main setting, whose leader god is the union of the Mother Earth and the tears wept by Magdalene for a Jesus-like Messiah.Into this world Phedre no Delauney is born, sold into indentured servitude but raised in the Night Court, a group of Thirteen Houses, which are bascially high class brothels, whose adepts can only be called courtesans, though that does not quiet define the service these men and women perform, for they serve the goddess Naamah in their doings, the goddess of prostitution and sexuality, and retain a degree of respect that is not usually associated wiht prostitution.The books runs through several facinating plots. When each ones ends, what comes to mind is what can possibly come next? Being raised in the Night Court and being a bond-slave, is one; another, plots of treason, conspiracy, war and betrayal. Being sold into actual slavery to a barabarian tribe, and escaping that situation and fleeing through impossible weather and terrain; becoming an ambassador to a hard-reached nation and fighting for two seperate thrones. All this with threads of sexual wiles accomplishing more than imaginable; all this with love, friendship, romance, and passion.All said, an incredible mix of everything one could wish for in a novel; impossible ot put down. And best of all, the story ends with another implied to follow. Do not overlook this first-time author's novel, for it is a true gem, the magnificent tip of potential great iceberg."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Weirdo that I am, I picked up this book at a used book store mostly by the half-naked woman on the cover O_o...

She is anguissette, marked by Kushiel's Dart, forever cursed and gifted to be pleasured by pain. The book is bursting with detail, bringing together a strange mix of Christianity and erotic paganism along with a sardonic and sometimes dark humor. If you don't mind the sex, it's an addicting read."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Kushiel's Dart is truly an epic, not just in length (700 pages!) but in quality and content. Jacqueline Carey has gone through much time and effort in this book to construct a world so alike and yet so different from ours. There is a fundamental difference in most alternate-universe books; the difference here is that when Jesus (or Yeshua, as they call him in this book) was crucified, his blood mixed with Mary Magdelene's tears and begat, on the fertile soil of Mother Earth, God's unwanted son, a whore's unwanted get--Blessed Elua, who makes his home in what we call France, and they call Terre D'Ange. Thousands of years later in Terre D'Ange, another whore's unwanted get is sold into slavery--the heroine of this story, Phedre no Delunay.Phedre is bought by the Night Court, which consists of thirteen houses of prostitutes that all specialize in one area or another. One concentrates on grace, one on artistry, one on beauty, and so on. They do this as a service to a goddess of theirs, Naamah, who was a companion of Blessed Elua and prostituted herself so that Elua might eat. Phedre grows up in this world with an unusual gift/curse--she is marked by the lord of pain, Kushiel, and feels pain and pleasure as one. Because of this unusual trait, she is bought out of the Night Court and into the household of Anafel Delunay, who becomes her foster father and trains her to spy and politick until she is a master diplomat.But what are Delunay's motives, and what does he have to do with the ruling house of Terre D'Ange? Phedre doesn't learn until it's too late, and is caught up in a web of mystery and intrigue that she has unwittingly played a part in. When she is sold in slavery again to the wilds of Skaldia (we call it Germany) she must rely on her skills as a diplomat and her skills as a Servant of Naamah to get back to her homeland and warn her Queen of the plot to overthrow her--and indeed, the entire nation of Terre D'Ange.There are twists and turns at every angle in this book; undying friendship and ancient feuds, unexpected love and unrelenting desire. It is truly an epic, and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I had difficulty with this book, and I'm still trying to figure out why. I have enjoyed epic fantasy in the past (e.g. George R. R. Martin), but this dragged massively in the beginning and a little at the end. It's written in first-person from the POV of the courtesan Phedre. I just didn't like her that much, and 901 pages is a long time to have to listen to someone like that.Plus I didn't buy that time and time again things hinged on Phedre sleeping with someone. That just gets predictable in a novel this long. In fact, it was a little frustrating that through the first half the eroticism was so elegantly written and in the second half it was hardly mentioned in favor of exploring the inner thoughts of Phedre which weren't as interesting.That said, I couldn't really find fault with the prose itself. The other characters were elegantly sketched, and the mythology that Carey created was amazing. I wished I could hear even more of the angel Elua and less of his scions. I might actually pick up the next book in the series just to hear more of the mythology, but it will be after I recover from this one and without such high expectations."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I have read many novels where the main character has been god touched, and uses his or her skills as an emissary of the gods to help save the lives of others but never in this way. Kushiel's Dart a novel by fantasy newcomer Jacquline Carey is a unique story. I can seriously say I have never seen anything quite like it before. It tells the story of, Phedre, a girl born with an ill luck name and a scarlet mote in her left eye. Considered to be cursed, she is sold in indentured servitude into the Night Court where she hopes one day to become a servant of Naamah, the goddess of sexual pleasure. Her life is changed forever when she is taken in by Anafiel no Delauny, a courtesan and spy. He sees her for what she really is, an anguissette, a child touched by the God of punishment Kusheil. This means that she is forced forever to feel pleasure and pain as one. As she begins to train for Naamah's service it is Delauny who teaches her the skills she will need to know to survive. He teachers her languages, history, and how to listen and pay attention in a world of dangerous politics.There are so many good things to be said about this novel and I cannot possibly list them all here. One of the most attractive things about this book, in my opinion, is the elegant prose it is written in. Certainly not for everyone, Ms. Carey writes in a very descriptive manner filled with beautiful picture of the D'Angeline world. Although some would consider this to be too drawn out and lengthy is fits the character, a strong woman who is taught to listen and pay attention to every detail, perfectly. Another strong point would have to be the instantly likeable characters. Phedre for all of her strengths is a wonderfully flawed character. Even though she is intelligent, beautiful, and skilled she also falls victim to too much pride, impulsiveness, and often not thinking about how her actions will affect others. You will find yourself completely enthralled in her world from first page on and eager to find out what will happen to her and the other characters such as Hyacinthe and Joscelin.The setting is another strength of Ms. Carey's writing. Although the map in the beginning of this book may look familiar (Central Europe) she manages to create interesting cultures that resemble there real life counterparts and, at the same time are very much different. Terre D'Ange, where much of the novel takes place, is a passionate world filled with beautiful people, the descendants of gods, and complicated politics. Carey also shows a skill for creating interesting religions, although the reader will not completely see that until the second book in this trilogy, Kushiel's Chosen.I've honestly never thought a 900 page book could be called a page turner but this certainly was. I read it in under a week and immediately went out and bought the sequel. Although many readers may be put off by amount of sex and violence (sometimes in the same scene) I urge you to look past that and see the novel for what it really is, an amazing story about a strong woman and the adventures she has."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I enjoyed this book. At first I was disturbed by the allusion to Christ as the \\"father\\" of Blessed Elua, founder of Terre d'Ange. Then I remembered the book is a work of fiction and moved on. That said, I found a very enjoyable book that I have read three times since receiving it in December.Phedre is a very intelligent and resourceful young woman who uses everything about herself: her mind, her political training and her sensual training to discover a conspiracy to invade her country and overthrow the throne. That the conspirators move in the highest circles of the land of Terre d'Ange (Land of Angels) helps to make it more interesting.Kushiel's Dart is a novel about the making of a spy. Phedre comes from a line of people who have chosen to become courtesans (whores to the untutored). She is gifted/cursed with the ability to find pleasure in pain. Phedre's life is forever changed when she is whisked from this sensuous world into the far more interesting world of politics and intrigue by a very skilled tutor. From there on, even though her sexuality is not covered over (it is \\"out there\\" for us to see), and she weilds it and her honed intelligence and observation skills taught her by her mentor like a sword against her country's enemies both within and without.Very much worth the price."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book has all the earmarks of a first novel: Mary-Sue heroine, unnecessarily elaborate plot, self-conscious narrative mechanics (the wordiness and repetition others have commented upon), and pacing problems.Phedre is an interesting premise in an interesting setting, but as a character she's quite one-dimensional. After spending almost a thousand pages in her head I still don't know anything about her other than she likes pain and those who can give it to her; and worse, she never grows or changes or learns anything from her adventures. I don't think anyone in this book does, they just suffer and struggle and have kinky sex. And while I am not bothered by kinky sex, I did have to say \\"ew\\" at the various examples of emotional and/or sociological incest. Furthermore, it gets pretty silly when every complication, every roadblock, can be overcome by Our Heroine going to bed with someone. Surely there are some folks in this land who can't be led around by their girdles?The political stuff is too subtle and too awkwardly handled to make much of an impression until late in the book, by which time it seems like an afterthought. There is such a pronounced difference in style and pacing between the first third of the book and the last two-thirds, that I wonder if the training-and-growing-up sequences were written first, and then had a larger plot grafted on when Carey realized she had to take the story somewhere. I skimmed past the clumsy infodumps in the first third of the book, because they had no apparent bearing on the present action, but then when I reached the part where those names _were_ important, I'd forgotten who was who and had to backtrack. In my mind, any book that needs a dramatis personae is not a well-written book.Another reviewer said Melisande was an inadequate villian and I have to agree. Though we are told _ad nauseum_ how cruel and manipulative she is, the author never really SHOWS her being cruel or sadistic--except when she and Phedre are having sex, and since only Melisande can hurt Phedre the way she needs to be hurt, it's okay. But the whole emotional aspect of their relationship was lost on me. I could accept that they had the hots for each other, but late in the book when Phedre says, \\"Yet I had loved her once,\\" I went, \\"Say what? When? Why?\\"I had the same problem with most of the relationships in this book. I couldn't see why Phedre and Alcuin would be so devoted to their mentor, I couldn't see why Phedre fell for Jocelyn or he for her--although I smelled _that_ one coming from the moment he appeared. The obligatory bodyguard--and a vow of chastity to boot! Is this really a surprise to anyone? The characters are all described in exhaustive visual detail, but I never felt any resonance from any of them. They are character _types_ rather than fleshed-out personalities.I resisted reading this book for a long time because I knew it couldn't possibly live up to all the hype. Finally a friend gave me her half-read copy and made me promise to tell her how it turned out because she couldn't stand the Mary-Sueness, either. I did enjoy Phedre's voice and descriptions of things. The world-building is distinct and thorough, I'll give it that. I also enjoyed Carey's toying with familiar languages--she's obviously very literate and uses language effectively.After a while, though, I started to feel cheated about the whole skewed-universe approach. Why bother making up a whole new world and culture when you can just rip off history--especially when the author has gone to such lengths to show us every single corner and culture of her knocked-off world? On the one hand it adds richness, on the other hand it's exhausting. (Another reviewer made an interesting point about how the D'Angelines seemed to be in a Rennaissance while the rest of the world was stuck in the Dark Ages; however I read it more like the arrogance of the Romans during the height of their Empire, when they assumed everyone else were barbarians.)One thing I haven't seen anyone comment upon was the inconsistency of the magic in this land. For the first 60-70% of the book it seemed that the myths of Blessed Elua and his consorts were just that--myths. Nothing magical happened, and although certain aspects of daily life were explained in terms of religious doctrine, and Hyacinthe was rumored to have psychic powers, everybody seemed to treat the supernatural aspects with the same half-seriousness we extend toward ghost-hunters and John Edwards. But then Phedre and crew have to cross the sea, and suddenly run into wind-and-water controlling demi-gods who walk and talk and cut deals just like the Olympians? And nobody bats an eye or says, \\"We thought you were just myths!?\\"That was the point where I stopped taking the story seriously, and it was all downhill from there. The rest was a rushed hodgepodge of names and battles and running to-and-fro, with occasional pauses for jumping in the sack with one noble or another, in order to keep the plot grinding forward.Needless to say, I haven't felt inspired to read the last two-thirds of the trilogy. Still, I know plenty of people like this kind of thing, so if you're into atmosphere and glamorous, unambiguous characters, then grab a box of bonbons and dive in.If you're more intellectually driven, picking out Carey's literary and historical influences may keep you diverted for the bulk of the book. Sure the plot is stock, but there's some mighty nifty wrapping paper around it. I suspect Carey spent several years elaborating and decorating and revising, when she should've chucked it in the drawer and written something new."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I am a fantasy reader and not a romance reader. However, I bought this book years ago at the recommendation of one of my favorite authors (Steven Brust). Once I started reading, I was hooked. Carey spins a grand tale full of intrigues and gets you caring about the major characters so much that you can find yourself clutching the book as you read on to see what happens to them next. And on top of that, the book gets quite erotic at times. It's not for the feint of heart though, no little girl's romances with soft kisses on satin sheets. Phedra's experiences explore the edgier side of erotica, so don't bother reading if you require tender sweetness when reading about erotic moments. After this book, I was hooked and eagerly awaited each of the remaining D'Angeline novels. Not all were as good as Kushiel's Dart, but I sure was disappointed when Carey decided to stop writing any more of them."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"No time to say anything else, I'm off to the bookstore to get the next one.(Sorry Amazon, sometimes you just have to have something now.)"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I've been a fan of the Kushiel series ever since I came across it a few years ago. Recently, I re-read this, the first book of the series. I had hoped that this was a series that wouldn't diminish with multiple readings (as sometimes happens when suspense at what will happen is no longer present) and happily was proved right.I've recommended this book and series to friends many times, and they inevitably ask me 'What's it about?' With a story of such depth, range, and intricacy, that question is nigh impossible, so I merely tell them 'Just read it. You'll see.'In the Kushiel series, Carey has created an alternate version of our world filled with people, places, and events just as complex as any in the real world - they are believable, they are intriguing, nothing is cookie-cutter black/white or good/evil as is found in so many fantasy books. She tackles three giants of the fantasy realm (political intrigue, religion, and war) and shines at all of them, still while maintaining an amazing level of characterization and originality. This series is like nothing else I've ever read, in the best way.This series really does have something for everyone, as another reviewer mentioned. Love stories and sex? Check. Fights and battles? Check. Political and social intricacy? Check. Mystical happenings? Check. Mystery and intrigue? Check. And unless you are completely robotic reader, I warn you - you will get drawn in. This series has made me laugh, cry, gasp, cluth something in suspense, wince, sigh, etc. And that is not limited to this first book. I've read all 5 books in the series now, and all have kept up that level of quality.So, as I tell my friends when I recommend this: Just read it. You'll see."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I've read many great modern books, but this is the first novel that has actually compelled me to write a review about it. Kushiel's Dart, part of the Kushiel Legacy Trilogy is so profoundly rich in culture and intellect that a simple mind will have a lock down.Pros:Kushiel's Dart has a new twist on historical facts as Carey invents her own stable and unique religion based off common knowledge of Christianity, Judiasm, and paganism, all of which have a focus in the Trilogy series. Also, instead of inventing a whole new physical world, she overlaps her world onto recognizable geography which makes for a fun guessing game of which culture she has renamed, but still portrays. For me, those were my favorite aspects! A gold mind for people who have a broad range of knowledge and like to fit pieces into the overlaying patterns.As for characters, Carey's Phedre is both a femme fatale and a compassionate martyr. She is a spy trained courtesan, in a culture where sex has no shame as long as it's participated in consentingly. Phedre is not so far off the mark that modern women cannot relate to her, but they can still envy her adventures and dramatic escapades in love. All of Carey's vastly concieved characters have both undeniable strength in various areas, and human weaknesses that liken them to their earthly realm.By the middle of the book, the compounded adventures and interlying, hard to forsee, patterns will have you glued to the pages, unable to put down the novel. 900 pages will fly by and barely keep your reading appetite at bay!Cons:Carey uses a very high vocabulary count, and I found myself with a dictionary all too soon. However, that could be because I crave to fully understand and recognize every word my eyes take in. Still, for someone who wants a quick pleasure in reading, this is not for them.This is also a \\"blusher\\" so conservative and sensitive audiences should be advise, though Carey displays this sensual language with style and class.It also takes a bit of time for the plot to build in the beginning, but every seemingly mundane detail is used later on during the rush of the climax of the story. There is also a huge cast of characters, which can be hard to keep straight. However, Carey tends to repeat certain material often so as the reader does not forget.Overall:I bought this novel on a whim, and at first didn't think I could see past her strong vocabulary use. But then as I became accustomed to Carey's language style, I was quickly swept away in Terre D'Ange and the web of mystery and intrique. As soon as I was done, I went out and bought Kushiel's Chosen and didn't regret that purchase either. Carey is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors based on her writing style and creativity, and is certainly making her way to becoming the next Anne Rice."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"It's a truly amazing novel. An adventure unlike any other. Jacqueline Carey invites us in a wonderful world of alternative religion, based on Christianism. Elua is the son of Christ, born from his blood upon the cross and from mother Earth.He founded a city, or is it a country? Regions depending on which of his disciples' views you follow.Phedre no Delaunay is an amazing person, with a will of iron, great determination, and a student of the arts of Naamah.The book is her life's adventure. How she was born and bred, where and how she was brought up, an adept of the Night Court in the city of Elua. A magical story!!Beware : you will not sleep to live through her eyes for an hour longer. Phedre is an obsession. I am in love... :)"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"When first recommended this book I was a bit questionable as I normally prefer more of the Sword and Sorcery type fantasy. Through about the first fifty pages or so I was still quite questionable. As I was reading it had my interest, though I had no idea what was really going on. Though after about the first fifty pages it stopped with a lot of the background info that was needed and started the proper story. Once things started to get into the masses of court intrigue I was hooked. The story moved along at a great pace making it hard to put the book down much of the time.Carey places you into a world of fantasy that is heavily based around ancient times of Europe. While it pulls from the fantasy some with placing it in the normal world it also added a great deal of interest in the book with figuring out the places and religions that were being described. This book takes you through mounds of royal court intrigue along with a nice blend of erotic fantasy.This book had my attention from the first page and the same day I finished it I went and bought the second book Kushiel's Chosen. I have highly recomended it to my friends and family."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book, the story of Phedre no Delauney from childhood until her early 20's, is a story of an amazing, capable woman, stung by the Dart of a fallen angel to forever feel pain as exquisite pleasure. Carey manages to write the scenes of Phedre's sexual torture in a surprisingly ungraphic way, and the twists and turns of her amazing life made me laugh, think, and even cry.One of the best points I can make about this novel is the depth of feeling that the characters both exude and evoke. The pain of the little girl who was sold into bondage by her mother for being imperfect, and thereafter never legally having a mother again, is a poignant scene. And when Phedre is forced to leave behind her best friend Hyacinthe, one of the men in her life who truly made her feel safe and she truly loved, I admit that I cried. Carey, even for a novelist who is just starting on her writing career, is an amazingly talented lady. If I were to have to guess, I'd have thought this was her 5th or 6th book, not her first. I'm amazed at the level of talent in such a new writer!I can hardly wait to read the sequel!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I picked up this book simply because it was the first thing that came to hand while looking through the book shop in a train station. I read a little of the beginning and then had to buy it just to finish it.While I loved it and was happy to see that the sequel had been published, there are something that I wish had been done differently:The S&amp;M scenes are glossed over and yet the writer still constantly refers to them. I would have been interested in hearing more about Phedre's patrons and her private indulgences. I think it would havehelped flesh out the emotional life of the character more.The court and political intrigue were amazing, but I was left frustrated by the lack of a resolution to the tension between the main character and her nemesis. It did leave me with baited breath for the next book, which I guess was the point, but it was still a bit frustrating.All in all, a very good and worth while read! I like books that can take me out of my life and surroundings and place me in the shadow of its characters and this book filled that requirement nicely!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I am not one for words....read this book...and let it speak for itself...You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I really liked this book, but some people may be put off by the S&amp;M scenes. The heroine is an indentured prostitute who enjoys pain mixed with sex, but who is also trained as a spy.

It is definitely not your ordinary alternate history story line, which makes it a fresh and intriguing read."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I really liked this book, but some people may be put off by the S&amp;M scenes.

This story was incredible, its span had me laughing, weeping, and was fully engrossing. I feel I have been released after reading this book, my emotions spent, much like Phedre I feel used. This novel took me from the peaks to the shadows and back again. I found the vivid imagery exciting. I await with anticipation Jacqueline's next book. I purchased this book after a chance encounter with the author on a plane after I relenquished my seat to accomadate a childs wish to sit by her mother. I never dreamed I would be sitting next to a world class writer when I did so. Jacqueline, kudos to you for creating a book with so much depth, and passion. I loved this book so much I am giving it to my mother to read. I put off reading it for a month or so, while I read other novels, I can't even remember what they were about, I think Kushiel's Dart will stick with me for a while. Thanks for talking to me on the airplane Jacqueline, you have enriched my life with your book."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This is the first fantasy novel in many a year that focuses on the story instead of on the magic, which only enhances the political intrigue beautifully set in a skewed Renaissance-world.Phedre is a heroine whose humanity, loyalty, and honesty truly touch us, and Carey should be enormously proud of her accomplishment.I urge you to pick up this book, because you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"A friend of mine recommended this book to me and, since I am a huge fantasy fan, it seemed like a good choice. I was interested through about two-thirds of the book, and then I just skimmed the last part. While the research and imagination that went into this book is impressive, it is far too slow and filled with all sorts of unecessary events and people. Parts of the book were certainly erotic, if you're into that sort of thing, but, by and large, it makes up a very small proportion of the book. The fact that this is part of a trilogy completely staggers me. I cannot imagine having to read two more of these to reach some sort of conclusion.Having said that, it certainly had redeeming features. The detail that went into the book was quite amazing and the imagination it takes to create a piece of this breadth is impressive. The relationship between Phedre and Jocelin is sweet, very touching, and it was the main reason that I might try to slog through the rest of the trilogy. If you like your fantasy sweeping and slow-paced with lavish detail, then this might be the book for you. If not, then I would try Guy Gavriel Kay, Neil Gaiman, or Laurell K. Hamilton."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I love to re-read these books because there's always a new understanding to be found in them. Her plot is gripping, her characters are memorable, and the places the main character goes! The rest of the series is amazing and the transition in writing from Phedre's point of view to Imriel's is nearly flawless (and not as verbose).Very much looking forward towards more from this author. She is one of my favorites. I love these books."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I write this review after having read both Kushiel trilogies and I will agree with some other negative reviewers that the beginning of the book was hard to get through, it took me some time to get used to the flowery writing, large cast and the teen-angst of young Phedre. But then there's a pivotal moment that turns Phedre's life around very severely and the epic adventure starts...and never stops. This wasn't my favorite but it's still wonderful and necessary to learn about the world they live in."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I read this book almost two years ago and boy was I in awe of the storyline, characters and world that Carey created! I can't get it out of my mind! I really liked the Skaldi! A jovial, but hard people-modeled after the gallant Vikings of the past-that were an honorable and ruthless band of warriors.My only criticism of the book was that it took all too long for the action to come together. The book should have been edited down by some 100-150 pages. Despite this, the action came together and culminated in an exciting battle! Boy was I enthralled! I can't wait to read more of Jacqueline Carey's series!A. Nathaniel Wallace, Jr."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Everyone else described the book,so if you're at all interested, let me just say: \\"It's a GREAT book!\\" Once you read this book, you will definitely get the next, and the next! I'm on book 5 and it only gets better. You will not be disappointed! Just amazed by the intrigue, the characters, and the plots. If you're a commuter, try it in audio book format - my one-hour, one-way drive has been enhanced tremendously!!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Overall, the book is really good, except for the main romances of Phedre: Jocelin, Melisande, and Hyacinthe. I think that the Hyacinthe love affair really took away from the building romances of Jocelin and Melisande. It makes love all about sex, which can be part of it, but it doesn't always have to be that way. Overall the world building is great, but the fact that Phedre is in love with everyone that she sleeps with is really annoying."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"An interesting book and one I wasn't sure, half way through, if I was going to finish it. It has a few themes I wasn't sure how they would play out and if I would like them, but I am glad i stuck with it as the themes ended up working with the story line instead of being for shock value only. This book ended up being a real joy to read and I look forward to reading the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Kushiel's Dart is an introduction to a parallel world in which things accepted and tolerated include prostitution. The author does a beautiful job of creating this world and through her main character explaining the beliefs of her people versus other cultures within this parallel universe. At times the author boarders on being cliche in describing the more erotic scenes, however how many different ways can you illustrate intimacy?Another key element to this book is the polytheistic approach to religion created by the author. I feel the main religion creates a different perspective on Christianity without being disrespectful. The author provides a balance in creating her deities by acknowledging both the feminine and the masculine.Overall, for the genre I think Kushiel's Dart is excellent in that it touches on so many themes without being chaotic and difficult to follow. If you enjoy reading about love, adventure and life I recommend this book make your must read list"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I Loved this book and the entire trilogy. Phedre has become my favorite heroine and I have read so many books I could possible make a list of it all.It is a spiritual, loving, passionate, creative, and very inspiring trilogy that brought me to tears and created a need for more that is hard to find another book to fill. I bought three different trilogies after I read that and honestly none did it for me and I am still hoping to find more.It is the story of a woman marked by a God that is a very hard one, Kushiel. Kushiel is a God that cleanse the soul with pain. He is the punisher of God. Therefore, she will find pleasure in pain and the book will have some s/m parts in it. But it is so beautifully weaved in the context, that it enlates you. Kushiel requires a lot of her, he sends her into many ordeals to protect those she love. She enters an spiritual journey, a love journey and a painful one. I couldnt stop reading. I was barely sleeping and I re-read it all again when it was done.What I love most? Love as thou wilt - The teaching that the most powerful thing in the world is love. Not romantic love, but love and there is no law for love, there is nothing that teaches you how to love, but if you give in to love something with all your heart, you will find grace in the end of a hard journey.Every knowledge is worthy having - You learn that if you pay attention in the life around you and learn, many of what you learned will be able to help you when you least think of it.Hyancinthe - I wish there was a note saying and she got his message sent by the winds and went for him every once in a while. That would make it all complete. He totally deserved it after what happened.It was the first time I wrote to an author congratulating her for her work. Honestly, it is worthy reading."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I had this book sitting on my shelf for a long while. I finally pulled it out, dusted it off and decided to read it. Within the first page I was wondering if this was a mistake. I felt the writing was kind of \\"flowery\\" and I wasn't used to that so I was a bit discouraged. I kept on with it though and decided if the first chapter didn't hold my attention I would just donate the book. Well by the first chapter I was hooked. I loved this book. I am now an overnight fan of Jacqueline Carey. This book blends in betrayal, battle, love, loss, sex and much more. The landscapes, costumes, people were so vividly captured in my mind. I would say that the only two downfalls to this book for me were that there were a whole lot of characters that I had a hard time keeping up with them and at the end Phedre just came off as too \\"perfect\\". Everything she did was without a flaw it seemed. But that's probably because she's Kushiel's Dart and meant to be that way. I highly recommend this book and will not hesitate to read her others."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"This book is so good. A wonderfully inventive, enjoyable adventure. Endearing, unbelievable, and character-driven with a juicy plot. I can't add much to the reviews that have already been written. But Phedre was a surprising heroine indeed.My only con: the fabricated names for vikings (the skaldi), jews (yeshuites) and many other ethnic or racial groups was somewhat immature and annoying to me."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"An unusual and charming heroine, a complex, multi-faceted world, a byzantine, well-crafted plot and a writing style that combines touches of hard realism with an almost mystical sense of prose make this a most brilliant, engrossing book. No short review can do justice to the allure of Phedre, the heroine, and those who surround her; from her companion the warrior-priest Joscelyn to her nemesis the high-born Melisande, taking in a varied, fascinating melange of gypsies and courtiers, courtesans and queens, soldiers and sailors and diplomats and priests... The story manages to combine the best aspects of thrillers, fantasy, high adventure, suspense and wrap them in a most original blend of exotic sensations and smooth storytelling. I most highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a superb tale and writing so good as to be, in parts, almost glorious."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"Phedre was born with a scarlet speckle in her eye, known as Kushiel's Dart. Those marked by Kushiel's Dart are cursed to always feel pleasure and pain as one. Using her skills learned in traing with Anafiel Delaunay, Phedre uncovers a plot that will lead her homeland to war.Hate to say it but, I love this book like whoa! It's incredibly well written and draws you in from the first page. The world and the society is incredibly well built and seem to be very loosley based on several European countries.Phedre is a wonderful and believable heroine. Although she's intelligent, courageous and strong, occasionally she does something or says something that reminds you she is human after all. Being an anguissette (one who feels pleasure and pain as one) leads to some interesting points of the story as well as adding an interesting exploration on what being an anguisette means for Phedre. There's lots of BDSM and same sex pairings as well, if you like that kind of thing. ;)I found myself crushing on Joscelin. I love it when a book character comes alive so much you get a crush on them. And Joscelin certaihnly comes alive! Boy does he ever. :)The real triumph in terms of hot characters, though, is Melisande. She's a cold hearted vixen but so seductive that just reading about her I had the hots for her. If she were a real person, I'd fall to pieces if I were ever in the same room with her.I thought the story was well paced and thought it was good that the time was taken to build each character and allow you to get to know them. I also loved the developing relationships Phedre shared with Joscelin, Hyacinthe and Melisande. They alll had great chemistry and played off each other believeably, especially in terms of her relationship with Joscelin.Overall, just a simply fantastic book and I cannot wait to go out and get the next one!"},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I kept running across this book in bookstores but it just looked too weird for me, so I always passed it over. Finally, after reading the reviews it got here I decided to try it. I don't think anything could have prepared me for a book like this.This book made my heart ache, it made me laugh, and it brought tears to my eyes. Each character is a complex, multilayered creation, neither good nor evil, but driven by passions and ambitions to do the things they do. Phedre's development from rebellious, observant child into an accomplished adult is believable and incredible to watch. I was as in love with Delauney and Joscelyn as she was. All of Carey's characters demand respect, from Melisande all the way to the minor Tzingano characters and the Skaldi.In fantasy it is rare to find a world that is totally complete in every way. Often worlds lack complexity, peoples lack culture, and relgions are dubious. Carey's world, however, is so rich in detail one can almost picture oneself in Phedre's place as she describes places and people. And Carey's language is beautiful. Poetic and flowing, but never becoming to flowery of difficult to read. She has a knack for catching the mood of a moment while adding insight as Phedre looks back on the event.Often, it seems, political intrigue books lack action- and action books lack any sensible politics. Carey has blended the two seemslessly. There is mystery, betrayal, romance, slavery, sex...so much that one would think the book would be too much. But it's not. It's real. It's dramatic and emotional and so vivid I feel as if I'd experienced Phedre's adventures myself.I can't say how good this book is...I simply can't do it justice. All I can say is that I loved the characters, and hated them, and my heart caught in my throat for fear at their fate, and that of their land. It's a beautifuly written book, but more than that, it's a lovingly written book. I loved it."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I was quite prepared not to enjoy Kushiel's Dart once I realized where the author was heading on the S&M; theme -- I tend not to enjoy graphic descriptions of sexual-related violence. Yet somehow Ms. Carey pulled me in spite of my reservations. The parts that could have upset me were brief, and were required for the plot.The book is not perfect -- I got lost quite a few times with the intricate conspiracy because of so many names and titles. Sometimes you'd hear a first name, a family name, or a title. I am usually quite good at keeping up with complicated plots, but a few places I missed important things that I usually wouldn't miss.Yet in spite of these flaws, I still give this book 5 stars, which I rarely give out in my reviews ... -- the book was compelling, unique, and I in particular enjoyed the alternative history of the scion's of half-fallen Angels."},{"Title":"Kushiel's Dart","review":"I've read through the reviews here, and noticed one thing - either you LOVED or HATED this book. I loved it. It was, in fact, one of the best fantasy books I've ever read. I took a chance on it --- and was well rewarded. I won't get into details of the plot (there are already many in-depth reviews here..) But I will say - to those of you out there who enjoyed Kushiel's Dart - try author Tanith Lee. I am a huge fan of Lee's and her work has the same dark, sensual and engrossing quality as Carey's book. I can't wait for the next one!
