I find Tony's blunt honesty amusing. I will be reading along and suddenly laugh out loud over something he has said just because it is so plain-spokenly blunt. Of course I would hate for that bluntness to be used against me.Curtis is kind towards his first wife Janet Leigh. Maybe that is because she has been kind towards him. It seems that he doesn't have much to do with his other ex-wives. At the time this book was published he was married to a girl named Lisa.Curtis also was/is very sensitive about his being Jewish and how he was picked on as a kid, and as an adult (the stuffed, taped tail-pipe in Germany-read the book to find out what that is about).Curtis was always a very good-looking man and he knew it, and he's honest about knowing it. His idol was Cary Grant. He wanted to make movies with Marilyn Monroe and Mae West so he could say he and Grant were the only actors to make movies with both. Curtis' tale about filming &quot;Sextette&quot; with Mae West is hilarious.I love his honesty, but there is alot of anger in him. Too bad he couldn't get therapy to work that out. It probably contributed to the break-down of his marriages, and his drug habits in the past. You have to give him credit for surviving though.I have to say that his performance in &quot;Sex and the Single Girl&quot; is one of my very favorites. He and Natalie Wood had such a strong on-screen chemistry."},{"Title":"Tony Curtis: The Autobiography","review":"What a courageously written book this is. I don't necessarily agree with all of Mr. Curtis's candidly expressed opinions, but I've never read a movie memoir that was so openly honest. It's very difficult in our society to transcend social strictures against open vanity, regardless of how well deserved. It's also open about sexuality in surprising ways.Mr. Curtis speaks as freely about his foibles and problems as he does about his extraordinary handsome face, which Edward G. Robinson, quoted in the book, called his sonne punim in Yiddish (beautiful face).I grew up watching TC's films and have an original lobby card from \\"The Great Imposter\\" on my movie wall. His \\"Houdini\\" was among my favorite films when I first began going to them alone, as were his swashbucklers and later, his dramatic roles. I still think he's one of the most underrated actors of his era. He deserved the Oscar for \\"Sweet Smell of Success.\\"I think eventually this book will be recognized as a unique classic among movie memoirs. It's remarkable for it's fidelity to the truth as TC saw it as opposed to the fictions penned by so many others.It's long past time to give this man some sort of major industry award.Just a note: his more recent autobiography changes his attitude toward some previous statements and events related in this version: most particularly, his relationship with Marilyn Monroe, in which he says kissing her was wonderful, not \\"like kissing Hitler,\\" an offhand remark he made not long after \\"Some Like it Hot\\" was made."},{"Title":"Tony Curtis: The Autobiography","review":"Explicit account from the man himself Tony Curtis of his vastly changing life style from his early days on the poor streets of the Bronx New York, to the high life as a young Hollywood star. One of the most well known celebrities that came from the later part of the Hollywood star stable, his biography is unusual in its style as it integrates the voices of Tony's friends and family along side Tony's own narrative, painting a very explicit and vastly interesting life. It pulls no punches and tells it as it is , and is a must read for all his fans. Including information On the Persuaders starring Tony Curtis and Roger Moore.

The worst, though, is the amount of times he talks about what a big star he was (and still thinks he is), and how incredibly handsome he thinks he is. He actually makes the ridiculous statement that people still stop and stare when he walks in the room because of his extreme handsomeness; I think the truth is that they can't believe how AWFUL he looks now!And as for his \\"art\\"...as if anyone would pay $$$ for that crap if it wasn't done by Tony Curtis.

All that being said, the book was in good shape, contains a number of photos of Mr. Curtis and as I said the recipient is very very pleased with it....that means I am too."},{"Title":"Tony Curtis: The Autobiography","review":"I just finished reading this book and loved it. I know they say \\"American Prince\\" is a repeat of this book and maybe it is, but I can only speak for this one at this time. I found this book compelling in its honesty, Tony Curtis presents himself to the reader warts and all, he doesn't set out to be liked, or to charm, although he manages to do just that at the end. Yes he was a rascal and he was vain and selfish and very proud of his looks, but let's face it, his face was his ticket to fame and fortune and why shouldn't he take care of it? He says \\"everyone liked the way I looked, including myself.\\" But when you look like Tony Curtis at the prime of his life, who can blame him? Yes, he bedded a lot of women, yes, he went through many divorces, yes, he had a lot of children, but a reader is not here to judge his shortcomings or mistakes. We are here to appreciate his art and he was an artist. He made a lot of good movies and he gave wonderful performances. Somewhere along the line, \\"The prettiest face in Hollywood\\" and I use \\"prettiest\\" on purpose because he was so good looking he was pretty, became a darn good actor. He left us with indelible performances and nobody can take that away from him, even if the academy never gave him the Oscar he so richly deserved for his performance in \\"The Boston Strangler.\\""},{"Title":"Tony Curtis: The Autobiography","review":"I have already read & enjoyed the book. It came in excellent condition,was safely packed and I received it quickly. Thank you very much."},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"What I want to give this novel is 3.5 stars. Not four, and not three. I found it disquieting because the author has Gordianus act in a way that seems totally out of character for him, namely his affair with Cassandra. I would expect, based on the previous books, that we would hear Gordianus's thoughts on this, but we don't. Add to that the fact that the main activity of the book is Gordianus questioning different people, back and forth, back and forth, without much happening, and you have a slow-paced novel. This book feels as if it's a bridge between Last Seen in Massilia, which was excellent, and The Judgement of Caesar -- a bridge that isn't of the best possible construction."},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"Saylor has definately become a master of his art. Each of the characters are so vivid, it is obvious that Saylor treats each with respect and critical thought has been put into view point analysis. The images Saylor uses to bring Rome alive are personal and palpable. Its as if Saylor travelled in time and really hung out with these people.The story line really didnt draw me in to the novel that much. But if anyone can make a story about a bunch of bickering old ladies facsinating, you better believe that it is Saylor who will do it.Although the story line didnt excite me, the realness of the characters that did. I mean, I almost feel like I was down their by the river with Gordianus and Clodia."},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"Well, Gordianus continues to be entirely implausible as far as actual Late Republican Rome was concerned. But then this novel manages to obtain an eerie athmosphere, as Gordianus enters old age in earnest in a setting of civil war, chaos and impending doom, the telling of the story revolves around a savvy counterpoint structure, and the mystery is actually satisfactory and not a pretext for displaying historical erudition. I look foward to reading the next novel - something \\"Last seem in Massilia\\" didn't quite manage to do."},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"The \\"Roma Sub Rosa\\" series, of which this book is the latest addition, just goes from strength to strength. As far as I am concerned, this is the best of the entire bunch, and I read it avidly, finishing it in record time! Gordianus may be getting older, but his wits are still sharp, and his nose for murder is as strong as ever. In this book we see our hero prone to a very human weakness, but it makes him all the more interesting for his failing. As usual, the Roman background is impeccably drawn, and the characters are excellent! We are in the midst of the war between Caesar and Pompey, and all Rome trembles with the fight. Once the mystery is solved, we see Gordianus packing for a trip to Egypt, and we just know that he's going to run into Cleopatra in the next installment. I can hardly wait!!"},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"With Caesar and Pompey facing one another in Greece, Rome itself is left to be governed by Caesar's lieutenants. Poverty, debt, decades of civil war, and decades of swiftly changing alliances have unsettled Rome, but also made it seem to be a perfect target for men unscrupulous enough to seize a time when the armies are largely away from Italy, and when the mob can become king. Gordianus, the Finder, has fallen on hard times. Like many others, he has had to borrow and now finds himself deep in debt. Yet, his new friendship and passion with the strange seeress, Cassandra, sustains him while the rest of his life, and his city, fail around him. When Cassandra is poisoned and dies in his arms, Gordianus sets out to find the killer even though he knows that the murderer is likely to be one of the seven powerful women who attend Cassandra's funeral--women far beyond his power to damage.Gordianus's investigation, interspersed with flashbacks of his growing relationship with Cassandra, takes him into the heart of conspiracy and the soul of the ancient Roman Republic which was then failing around him. His trips to the forum to meet with the 'chin-waggers,' the sight of lictors, axes bared in the City itself, and into the slave-ridden households of ambitious women, scheming while their husbands and lovers battle for control ring true.Author Steven Saylor powerfully conveys both the strange days of the Roman Republic's death, and the more humble striving of one man to seek the truth about the brutal murder of a woman who acted as a beggar, but perhaps was also a blackmailer, a spy, or a madwoman. In Saylor's work, and in the small doings of a common citizen, Rome becomes far more real than in many of the histories of battles and great men.A MIST OF PROPHECIES continues Saylor's excellent ROMA SUB ROSA series and left me looking forward to the next novel--of Cleopatra and Egypt in the last days of the Ptolemies."},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"Mr. Saylor's series on the life of Gordianus in late Republican Rome is wonderfully well written and for the most part highly accurate in its depiction of the actual lives of everyday Romans. This latest book depicts the despair and chaos of the Roman Republic as it collapses into horrifying Civil War. The chaos is replicated in the home life of Gordianus. The lives of various Roman women are vey interesting as they are illuminated in the search for the truth of Cassandra's death.I have not rated this EXCELLENT for several reasons. One, there are some odd inconsistencies which have been noted already by another reviewer. The absence of Davus and Diana's child, the difference in relationship between Bethesda and Eco's wife,bothered me in particular, as I am fascinated by Roman daily life.. These discrepencies are frustrating to us who like to read the series as a whole. Far more troubling to me, though, is Gordianus' treatment of his ailing wife, who is suffering, in addition to a physical illness, the emotional loss of her adopted son Meto. She had raised him all these years, and now he is lost to her due to Gordianus' decision.Roman society is famous for its debaucheries, but what is less known is that there were many loving marriages, particularly between plebeians and freedwomen, as evidenced from many tombstone inscriptions around Rome. I would have liked to see this aspect of Roman life given greater emphasis.In many ways, the figure of Cassandra seemed like a primal male fantasy- young, beautiful,and sexual while making no demands at all on her partner. I had already guessed what the solution was going to be to Gordianus' money problems, and felt this added to the male fantasy aspect.In spite of these reservations, this book, as all of Mr. Saylor's books are, is well written and well worth reading. The history woven into the story is superb."},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"If you haven't read any Roman historical fiction from Steven Saylor then I suggest you look immediately at the amazon.com reviews for 'Roman Blood', the first book in the series. 'A Mist of Prophecies' is best enjoyed only after reading Saylor's preceding novels. For those who have had the pleasure of doing so please read on.'A Mist of Prophecies' is a somewhat contrivedstory of an enigmatic soothsayer, aptly name Cassandra. She enters the life of our Roman sleuth Gordianus (..actually, she and Gordy develop a \\"special\\" relationship). In the start of the book we understand Cassandra gets poisoned. During the rest of the book Saylor makes clever use of flashbacks to understand what actually happened. Saylor deliciously re-introduces all the evil ladies of Rome we got to know from previous books. These ladies obviously took a shine to the fortune telling Cassandra. Did one of them kill her too? Read the book to find out.Bottom line: slightly fluffy but extremely enjoyable."},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"In 48 BC Rome is engaged in a great civil war with both sides led by a powerful warrior. Though the battles take place in the outer province of Thessaly, Rome is being drained by the war as inflation is running rampant and people are going into debt with barely enough money to eat.Gordianus the Finder finds himself besieged at every turn. He is worried about the debt to his banker, deeply concerned with his wife's mysterious and lingering illness, and frets over the end of his relationship with his adopted son Meto. When Cassandra, a mysterious woman who appear in Rome one day sprouting prophecy, dies in the Finder's arms saying she was poisoned, he takes it upon himself to bury her and find her killer. His quest takes him into some of the richest and most influential homes in Rome.A MIST OF PROPHECIES takes us into the heart of Rome during a civil war that makes the inhabitants of the city wary, fearful, and uncertain of the future for themselves and for their glorious Empire. Stephen Saylor descriptions of the times are so detailed that the audience can picture the city in the mind's eye. Experience grants the hero the wisdom to search out the killer using his brains while not relying on brawn as he did in his youth. This is a fascinating work, as much a historical novel as it is a mystery.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"How does he do it? He just keeps writing the best books ever. He has no equal in my book. Hr has the ability to hold your attention and more than that makes the experience most enjoyable."},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"great book and great service I always enjoy Steven Saylor books. I love kindle books and Amazon. will buy many more books in the future"},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"Despite how much I've generally enjoyed the stories of Gordianus the Finder, I was quite disappointed in Mr. Saylor's last outing in the Roma Sub Rosa series. Fortunately, he is pretty much back to form in A Mist of Prophecies.The plot here is a bit more straightforward than usual: a \\"seer\\" in the forum, the woman called Cassandra, has been murdered. For reasons that become clearer as the novel progresses, Gordianus is compelled to find out who has killed her. The suspects are seven of the most powerful women in Rome whom Gordianus visits in turn. All this is taking place during a time of upheaval in Rome, when most of the young men are off with either Caesar or Pompey, fighting in the civil war. Needless to say, Gordianus eventually ferrets out the truth, which is not what he nor the reader expects at first pass.Though Saylor takes Gordianus through his typical paces here, the mystery is much more interesting than it has been in recent novels. The payoff is better. Still, there are some things missing. This novel doesn't have the deep historical flavor of some of his better outings. Also, Saylor allows a fairly happy ending here whereas I've always enjoyed Saylor's willingness to do real harm to his main characters. He seems to be losing this as the novels go on.Still, there's a lot to like in this novel. Gordianus is a great character as are most of the characters Saylor has built into his family. As long as he has a decent mystery, like he does here, it's hard to go too wrong."},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"I've read all of the series in order. I think this is about the ninth book and the third from the last. I think Saylor's phoning it in. I really liked the early books and loved the combination of mystery and historical novel. The last three or four I read just weren't up to par. This book is alright in the context of the series, but it is disappointing and lacked creativity. Nevertheless I'll finish the series - in time"},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"I've read the whole Ancient Rome series by Steven Saylor and this one was a bit off track. Steven went off on an affair and deep feelings in this one, which over shadowed the history of the book. Thankfully the rest of the series was wonderful!"},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"I am savoring this whole series, and yes, A Mist of Prophesies is a little out of the mold. But it grew on me - Gordianus is more vulnerable, more human. The Roman women characters are so well drawn. I agree this book has a few rough edges, maybe needed another round of editing. But if you are working through the whole series, it is a delicious nugget. Enjoy."},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"This novel is another in Steven Saylor's \\"Roma Sub Rosa\\" \\"Secret History of Rome\\" series. In this one, the protagonist, Gordianus the Finder, falls in love with a beautiful woman who is apparently a seeress. When she is murdered, he seeks to find the culprit. All of this takes place against the backdrop of Julius Caesar's struggle with Pompey Magnus (\\"the Great One\\") as Rome is riven with civil strife and intrigue.While this is not my favorite novel in the series, it is excellent historical fiction and an enjoyable read. The author departs from his usual linear storyline and instead presents the story as flashbacks. The technique is effective, if a bit jarring to Steven Saylor regulars such as myself. Recommended. RJB."},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"I'm a big fan of Saylor's Gordianus series and gladly give four or five stars to the other \\"Roma sub rosa\\" books. But this one volume in the series is a disappointment on several counts. First, Gordianus starts an affair that's totally out of character for him, as a person who's normally all about truth and integrity. Second, the book is written in alternating chapters that jump between two timelines in a very jarring way; it's a dumb literary device that detracts from Saylor's skill as a writer. Third, the plot isn't much fun, it's just Gordianus visiting a series of potential suspects until things fall into place.Last but not least, the Kindle edition of this book is overflowing with appalling (and sometimes hilarious) typos due to poor text recognition software. Clearly no attempt was made to clean it up with even the most basic spelling checks. I know that's not Saylor's fault, but there's no good place to point it out except in a review. The fact is that Amazon's Kindle versions of books often do a disservice to their authors and readers, and Amazon should be ashamed to be charging normal paperback prices for digital books of such poor quality.I wish I could just say, \\"skip this book,\\" but aspects of it carry over to the next one, The Judgment of Caesar -- and that volume is excellent, so it would be a shame to miss the background you need to fully enjoy it."},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"Saylor has a true gift for his genre. He is stand alone. If you have read the preceeding books in the series, this one will not dissappoint. If not, start with the first."},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"I am a Steven Saylor fan and anything about Gordianus the Finder is something I would read. A Mist of Prophecies was a very readable historical novel. Quite a bit of true history but written in a way that keeps the reader going trying to figure out \\"who did it\\". I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in Roman history."},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"Mist of Prophecies is a tale of trouble. In this story Gordianus encounters many problems. Caesar and Pompey are fighting a war for control of the republic. Rome is in desperate economic times as inflation rages. Most people have difficulties paying rent and buying food. Merchants seldom stock their shelves. Gordianus, himself, borrows money to pay expenses and falls deeply in debt to a selfish banker named Volumnius. Bethesdia, his wife, suffers from a strange ailment which saps her energy and affects her mood. Diana, his daughter, pushes him to get work and suggests that she and her husband Davus take over the family business. Gordianus begins to feel old and useless.Then, in addition to his wife and daughter, eight more women challenge Gordianus' sanity: Cassandra, a seeress with a reputation of being mad; Culpernia, Caesars wife; Clodia, a manipulative temptress he has encountered before; Faustia, daughter of former dictator Sulla and wife of the banished politician Milo; Fulvia, Clodius' widow who married Caesar's lieutenant Curio; Terentia, the pious and proper wife of Cicero; Antonia, Mark Antony's wife and cousin; Cytheris, an actress and former slave who is Mark Antony's lover. Gordianus is convinced that one of the women is responsible for the death of Cassandra.Action begins after Cassandra's death. Gordianus, who had some secret relationship with Cassandra, arranges for and finances her funeral. The story unfolds through flashbacks and encounters and interviews with the ten women. Gordianus decides that Cassandra was poisoned. At first Gordianus avoids inquiring into the situation. After being nagged by Diana, he begins his investigation, wanting only peace of mind.Mist of Prophecies presents fascinating characters through Gordianus' interviews. The characters are encountered in their own element and most reveal themselves through their words and behavior. Gordianus, being a man, doesn't always completely understand what he sees.This is a fun book written by an excellent historian. I may read it again."},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"Saylor's Roma sub-Rosa series is excellent, and this book does not disappoint. I am not sure why I'm the first to review this book. These books should be flying off the shelves of the bookstores. They are truly excellent. Saylor's writing is quite wonderful, and his attention to detail and his historical allusions are all right on. This book is extremely interesting as it profiles seven of the most powerful women in Rome during the time that Caesar was fighting against Pompey for supremacy in Rome. We get to meet Caesar's intelligent wife Calpurnia,as well as a reintroduction to some women we have meet in previous volumes, such as Sulla's daughter Fausta and the infamous Clodia who Gordianus has always admired. We also get to see Gordianus fall in love, and it's believably handled by Saylor. We feel his pain when the woman he loves is poisoned. Gordianus sets out to find who the killer was and uncovers a hornet's nest of intrigue and betrayal. All of these books are excellent, but I really did enjoy this one. I heartily recommend this series."},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"Steven Saylor's &quot;Roma Sub Rosa&quot; stories, the adventures of Gordianus the Finder, continues to be one of the very best historical mystery series ever written. Not only is the history accurate (the First Century BCE as the Roman Republic shatters), the characters are three-dimensional and convincing, and the reader cares what happens to them. Often a mystery series will grow tired after several books, the plots becoming predictable and the relationships among the characters increasingly trivial. Not so with the &quot;Roma Sub Rosa&quot; tales. We continue to care about Gordianus the Finder and his family, even as new tensions tear them apart.&quot;A Mist of Prophecies&quot; takes place against a backdrop of the war between Julius Caesar and Pompey the Great. Although these two rivals are off stage in this novel, their agents are active in Rome, creating a dangerous urban jungle. And perhaps even more perilous for Gordianus the Finder, the chaos unleashed by the war has prompted others to also grab for power, whatever Caesar and Pompey might do. Into this turmoil steps the beautiful, mad seer Cassandra who proves irresistable to Gordianus, beset by financial ruin, family discord, and the mysterious illness of his wife.As much as I like this novel, I must discourage readers unfamiliar with Saylor's books from beginning with &quot;A Mist of Prophecies.&quot; This is a series where the characters grow and their relationships evolve. So, start with &quot;Roman Blood&quot; and go through the rest in chronological order. And when you finish &quot;A Mist of Prophecies,&quot; then you can wait with me for the next!"},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"Saylor's latest offering is remarkably different to the rest of the Sub Rosa series. The format, the prose-style, the characterisation and the historical basis move well away from the preceding set.Indeed this is the first of the novels that doesn't directly use a 'mystery' set in actual fact. At the time of the novel Caesar was about to meet Pompey at Pharsalus in 48 and Saylor only uses the references to the relatively unstable calm to place a date for this mystery. There is some dragging of historical 'fact' of the praetor Caelius in this year before Caesar's dictatorship and in some respects the tired old man ambience that permeates the entire book could be seen as echoing the sudden death of the Republic.The book takes the form of alternating chapters set in the present, as Gordianus investigates the poisoning of the ex-troupe artist/seer 'Cassandra' and the past with a series of snapshots of Gordianus' interactions with her. The denouement is reversed, actually taking place at the beginning of the novel with the mundus (Saylor actually gives some subtle direction as to where the guilty party lies) and then moves on to explain what happened.As in most of Saylor's novels it is the motive that is of utmost importance, that and Gordianus' relationship to both deceased and affiliators. We see a man struggling to accept his age and he changing times he lives in. His relationships and his reality are laid open bare to see.I suspect that Meto will make a 'return' to good graces in the future, Davus is broadly hinted at as possessing acute mental faculties and the continuance of Hieronymous is excellent. Bethseda's illness neatly places a sense of pathos into the proceedings.So, the novel: very different, as excellent as ever. However, you can't help wondering what is going to happen to the Sub Rosa series as time continues to pass for Gordianus."},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"While Caesar and Pompey are in Greece preparing for the ultimate showdown of their civil war, Rome is in dire straits under its Caesar-appointed custodians. Food is in short supply and the economy has all but collapsed with soaring inflation and a population deeply in debt (including Gordianus). Utter chaos could ensue at any moment as several opportunists exploit Rome's weakness to gain power for themselves. As if things weren't bad enough, Gordianus' wife Bethesda has fallen under a mysterious ailment that threatens to be fatal. Gordianus and his family are in the Forum seeking food (and hopefully a cure for Bethesda) when the beautiful but obviously deranged woman called \\"Cassandra\\" (for her alleged gift of prophecy), runs to Gordianus and collapses in his arms telling him before she dies that she has been poisoned by another woman. It turns out that Cassandra and Gordianus were not strangers. They were, in fact, secret lovers. (Yes, at his age!) Since Cassandra was a beggar with no relatives, Gordianus gives her a funeral. To his surprise, seven of the richest, most powerful women in Rome (including the wives and mistresses of Caesar, Cicero and Mark Antony) come to watch her body burn. Gordianus is sure that one of them is the murderer. Keeping his grief secret, Gordianus tries to identify the killer, as he is drawn deeper and deeper into Cassandra's complex world. Who exactly WAS Cassandra? Where did she come from? Why was she there? Was she a genuine seeress? A clever actress? A spy? Or all of the above? If she was a spy, who was she working for and why?A MIST OF PROPHECIES is a more conventionally \\"Agatha Christie\\" structured mystery than the previous volumes: a murder is committed, the suspects identified and then interviewed to discover the killer's identity. I was sure I had correctly guessed the murderess and her motivation at the end of Chapter 13, but I was wrong! Once again, what really makes the novel worthwhile are the colorful details of daily life in the Roman Empire. This book doesn't have the depth that some of the previous volumes have (e.g., THE VENUS THROW), but it's one of the faster-paced entries in this series and a lot of fun. At this point, there is only one more volume in this series after this book. I really don't want it to end! But A MIST OF PROPHECIES hints at the intriguing prospect of Gordianus' daughter Diana and her husband Davus entering the family business as a team. So maybe it won't be over!"},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"In the hotbed of intrigue that is Rome in 48 BC, Caesar is away chasing Pompey in their struggle for Empire, the populous is divided in their allegiances and life goes on. The wives, daughters, lovers and family members of the power brokers of Rome are all caught up in this most recent tale of Gordianus the Finder. It is a departure from the last two books in the Roma Sub Rosa series that concentrated on political maneuverings and military operations, now returning to a more \\"human\\" centered tale involving the women of Rome; giving a face to historical figures that went without more than casual mention in the histories written by men, for men, about men.This is probably Steven Saylor's most non-linear novel to date. It weaves back and forth through the events surrounding the murder of his latest case, who also happens to be his mistress. The story telling has been taken to a new level in this novel, and Steven Saylor deserves the highest accolades for his work here. Am I being too enthusiastic? I think not. A truly wonderful tale that is highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"\\"Mist of Prophecies\\" is the latest installment of Steven Saylor's Sub-Rosa series. Immediately it is one of his best and most enjoyable works to date. The book is good enough to be read on it's own but is best enjoyed by checking out the previoius 2 novels, \\"Rubicon\\" and \\"Last Seen In Massalia\\", (Checkout the great review by the reviewer Booksforabuck.) Changed by the vicissitudes of time, we see our protagonist, Gordianus the Finder older and more worldly and confronted with the tragic death of his intriguiging lover Cassandra. A seeress of unknown origin who dies in his arms and who's prophecies were urgently sought after by some of Rome's leading matrons. At the funeral, no one attends except the very same group of women observing the funeral rite from a discrete distance. Here is an excellent view at the behind-the-scenes look at the feminine Roman mindset. There are numerous flashbacks that reveals the plot and Gordianus' state of mind in an interesting way that is at once personal and prosaic. Notice, as we age it is natural to reminisce and Gordianus does that in a such a way to make his dilemma of loss and pain all the more real and convincing. Looking back at the past plots from the earlier books (makes you want to re-read, the Venus Throw and Murder On The Appian Way), brings Mist of Prophecies in sharp focus to the state of affairs in Rome, (the fall of the Republic) and the rise of Ceasar.The similarities between ancient Rome and our world and are so close that there is much to consider; economic upheavals with a poplulation deep in debt, war, rogue politicians causing trouble and plenty of grandstanding and intrigue to keep you awake at night. A must read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"Mr. Saylor once again creates a masterpiece that allows that individual not familiar with the history of Roman Empire to slip through time and experience a fascinating culture. Mr. Saylor's offering to his readers is not only on par with the excellent standards he established for himself in previous works in this genre but exceeds the expectations of his readers. One experiences the sights, the smells, the thrill of political intrigue, the desperation of a man advancing into years and trying to convince himself that he is, if not the man he once was, not the elderly individual he believes others see him. If I taught a course in this time period, I would want to use one of Saylor's novels for supplemental material. He is concise and historically accurate and a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"The reader should be aware that this novel is a change of pace from Rubicon and Last Seen in Massilia: there's far less action. Gordianus investigates a young woman's murder by questioning the handful of people who attended her funeral; there is danger, but most of it is associated with rioting crowds in the Forum.The structure of the novel is inspired. Chapters recounting the investigation alternate with chapters in which Gordianus recalls successive encounters he had with the young woman--all memorable because newsworthy events were taking place at the same time. Bit by bit, we see a political crisis play out, even as we learn more about the enigmatic victim...and our old friend Gordianus. It's all tied together in a highly satisfying conclusion, with a surprise development that left this reader panting for the next book.I do have some quibbles with Saylor's portrayal of Gordianus's family. He describes their home life in some detail, yet never mentions daughter Diana's little son. Two novels ago, son-in-law Davus couldn't swim; in the last novel he had to and did--which might have been believable. But now he's an apparently strong swimmer, taking a dip in the Tiber for pleasure. Gordianus muses about his son Eco, and Eco's wife Menenia, having said things that seem out of character. That might be explainable. But he also reflects that Menenia and his own wife Bethesda have never gotten along; that's totally inconsistent with what we've read before."},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"Gordianus the Finder is accosted in the marketplace by a beautiful young woman. She staggers towards him and dies in his arms. The woman is known as Cassandra by many, but this is not her real name, but a name given by the people who believed she had the true gift of prophecy. lots of people would pay handsomely for this gift, others would do anything in their power to supress it. Cassandra has had the ear of some of the most influential people in Rome, people who would stop at nothing . . .Obsessed with Cassandra's death Gordianus sets out to investigate. What he uncovers has serious implications concerning some of the most important women in Rome and puts Gordianus in serious danger of losing his own life.Saylor brings the sights, sounds and smells of Ancient Rome to life yet again, surely this is how it must have been."},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"&quot;A Mist of Prophecies&quot; was a disappointment. Granted, it was an above average novel, but it had the potential to be much more.The novel opens in Rome in 48 BC when the city is in tumult and the city government is hard pressed to maintain basic law and order. There is an alleged prophetess who goes under the name of Cassandra and who like her Trojan namesake is widely believed to be able to forsee the future. However, she is poisoned and detective Gordianus the Finder decides to try to figure out who's responsible for the dirty deed.So far, so good. However, the plot unravels from there. Gordianus decides that the killer must have been one of the seven prominent women who went to Cassandra's funeral although it is not clear on what basis he makes that determination.One problem with mystery novels set in past historical times is that the detectives are invariably private citizens who do not have any legal power to compel folks to talk to them. Nor do they have any sort of investigator's license to give them legitimacy. So, the authors of these novels generally have the suspects answer just about every question put to them by the hero except the one that would establish who done it. When a suspect refuses to answer a particular question, you know right then and there that this person is either guilty or a red herring.In the case of &quot;A Mist Of Prophecies,&quot; the reader can figure out who the villainess is early on in the book since the author, Steven Saylor, failed to establish a plausible red herring. The guilty party in this novel just about did everything possible to make it easy for Gordianus to determine her guilt so much so that she might as well as gone around in public with a target painted on her back.While the mystery part is weak, the historical part is the novel's strength. The reader learns a lot about Roman history during this important time period in a way that holds the reader's interest. Additionally, the novel is well written and has richly drawn characters.Overall, I give it 3 out of 5 stars, but it could have been so much better."},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"This latest Gordianus the Finder murder mystery novel is far more somber in tone, slighty slower in pace, and is a little convoluted in the telling than previous ones. So if you're looking for a Gordianus installment that is in keeping with \\"Roman Blood\\" and \\"Murder on the Appian Way,\\" you might be in for a disappointment. I'm a staunch fan and am a real addict for the series, so that my lauding of this latest Gordianus novel can be seen as a personal bias. I liked this book quite a bit. The mood and the tone reflects Gordianus's state of mind completely -- his fears for what the current political upheaval could mean for Rome and her people; his anxiousness over his wife's ill health and their financial woes, and his apprehension over his estrangement with his son, Meto. Tying all these emotions together is his fascination for the mysterious young seeress, Cassandra, and his guilt over his feelings for her. The backdrop to all this emotional angst is the power struggle that is going on between Julius Caesar and Pompey, and the anxiety that everyone feel as they anxiously await the results of this conflict.\\"A Mist of Prophecies\\" opens with the funeral of the mysterious, Cassandra, a young woman who had the uncanny ability to foresee the future. But who exactly Cassandra is and where she hails from is a mystery, for Cassandra seems to have suffered from a form of amnesia. And one day, while Gordianus is shopping at the market with Bathsheba (his wife) and Diana (his daughter), Cassandra bursts upon them much agitated. She collapses in Gordianus's arms and dies after claiming that she has been poisoned by a woman. Because Cassandra has no family (and because, it is hinted here, of his relationship with her) Gordianus decides to foot the bill for her funeral. He also privately resolves to investigate her death. And at her funeral, Gordianus gets his first intimation of just how high Cassandra flew, for seven of Rome's most prominent women from rather important and powerful families attend her funeral. And they include Terentia (Cicero's wife) and her sister, Fabia (a Vestal Virgin); Antonia (Mark Anthony's wife); Fausta (the tyrant Sulla's daughter, who is also the wife of Milo, leader of the rabble); Calpurnia (Caesar's wife); and Clodia (the disgraced sister of Publius Clodius). Perhaps the mysterious 'she' that Cassandra referred to is one of these seven women? Grappling with his grief and anxiety, Gordianus begins his determined search for Cassandra's murderess, an investigation that is steeped in a danger all of its own as Gordianus begins poking and prying into the affairs of these rich and powerful women...As I noted this mystery unfolds at a more sedate pace than previous Gordianus mysteries and in a more circular manner as well, as chapters dealing with the investigation are juxtaposed with Gordianus's memories of when he first saw Cassandra and how they met. I suppose that one could describe this novel as a tender elegiac to Cassandra -- an old man's tender memories of the young woman he cared for. I liked the book for it's poignancy and it's tenderness. I also liked this novel because I thought that it belonged to the female characters of this mystery -- to Cassandra and Diana (who seems to understand what it is her father is going through even if she does not approve), and to the seven patrician women who may hold the key to the mystery of who murdered Cassandra and why. Of course we're only really treated to a thumbnail sketch of these women, but it did make for fascinating reading to read of the wives and daughters of the men who made Rome tremble and shake. I loved \\"A Mist of Prophecies\\" and fairly devoured it in one go. Steven Saylor did a fantastic job of getting the feel and mood of Rome (at that particualr time) right, as well as informing and relating to us the political realities of the period. \\"A Mist of Prophecies\\" is a wonderful read, and one that (in my opinion) should not be missed."},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"Mist continues to illustrate Saylor's sure touch as a novelist and firm command of the historical sources and details that he weaves into his plots and settings. The earliest novel, Roman Blood, centered on Cicero and his defense of Roscius under the dictator Sulla. This latest takes place in 48 BC and culminates, historically at least, in Caesar's defeat of Pompey at Pharsalus.Saylor speaks in his author's note about the fact that the words of many of the men from this period have survived, but that none of the words of the women survive directly. So, part of his purpose, and certainly a large part of his technique, in Mist is to present a series of important women.The central woman of the story, already dead by page 1, is Cassandra, a beautiful young, mad (?) prophetess who, in the flashback of chapter 2, falls dead in Gordianus' arms, in the forum, gasping out \\"Poison. She's poisoned me.\\" We don't know the exact relationship of Cassandra to Gordianus from what we discover in chapter 1, but we know it was sufficient for him, even though in serious debt himself, to pay for her funeral and celebrate it, virtually alone, right up to the funeral pyre. However, at that point some others appear to watch the burning, and these are among the most powerful and remarkable women in Rome.The two questions that arise for Gordianus are: who killed Cassandra and why did these women come to see her burn. This presents a challenge to Gordianus, a tease to the reader, and a structure for Saylor. In fact, the first 16 chapters alternate between present action, including interviews with each of these women and flashbacks to Gordianus' meetings with Cassandra, so that the even numbered chapters, 2 through 16, all start with a variation on \\"The first time I saw Cassandra...\\" and most of these flashbacks are dated in Gordianus' mind by something Marcus Caelius was doing that day. Thus Saylor weaves the private story of Gordianus and Cassandra (if it is a private story) with the public story of the (off-stage) conflict of Pompey and Caesar and the in-Rome machinations of Caelius, who is setting himself up as a demagogic opponent of both the major men, relying on raising the hopes and expectations of the poor and debt-ridden in Rome. On the fringes of the story (for most of the novel) are the comparable machinations of T. Annius Milo, who is trying to raise the country-side after escaping from his exile in Massilia (where he was last seen in the previous novel).Each of the women who attended the funeral pyre gets a chapter worth's of investigation (the even-numbered chapters), and each emerges as distinctly different in personality. Saylor is very good here at making them all fascinating characters, each in different ways.Terentia tells about her marital troubles; Fulvia tells how Cassandra's prophecy of Curio's death was detailed and correct, 2 days before it was reported at Rome; Antonia, who got a very negative prophecy from Cassandra, asserts she was a fraud and in league with Antony's mistress, Cytheris; Cytheris admits she put Cassandra up to the prophecy about her rival Antonia, but says she doesn't know whether, otherwise, Cassandra was truly possessed or acting, which she was trained to do; Fausta says what Cassandra prophesied for her didn't make sense to her, because she needed much plainer speech, and no, she wouldn't divorce Milo, because Rome would look negatively on the daughter of Sulla if she divorced twice, and Gordianus notices that Fausta looks a bit beaten up and her doorkeeper, an ex-gladiator, seems to dominate her; Clodia is still the Clodia of old, with a lustful eye for Gordianus' handsome son-in-law, Davus, and harsh words for her old lover, Caelius, but nothing to say about Cassandra, other than that she can tell from Gordianus' demeanor that he and the seeress were lovers; Calpurnia, the only one to summon Gordianus, knows much about Cassandra, since Calpurnia runs Caesar's spy network in Rome, and surprises Gordianus with her revelations.One of Calpurnia's other revelations involves a relationship between two other major characters that neither Gordianus nor we had guessed, and that points Gordianus to his prime suspect. We are sure now who the killer was and why, but the why changes as Gordianus interrogates his suspect, and then she explains her relationship differently than Gordianus had surmised and Gordianus sees the murderer cannot be her. A bit of reflection shows Gordianus who the killer must be and why.Saylor, as always, writes and plots well. His historical detail is full and accurate and his accounts of historical events correct. Of course, he inserts Gordianus into all of these and also attributes motives to characters that are not historically attested, but they are not dissonant with what we know or would guess. One slight literary cavil would be that Gordianus explains a lot of the detail to us, the reader , (e.g., about lictors), but it is not clear who his audience that he is narrating to is and why, if they are Romans, they would need to be told details that any of his contemporaries would already know. It might have been better if the character Gordianus had been explaining some of this to another character who was a foreigner or otherwise had some reason not to know.I recommend Mist of prophecies to any reader who likes a good novel or an interesting interpretation of events in late Republican Rome. I'm eager to see the sequel, to find out whether Bethesda recovers, whether Gordianus and Meto are reconciled, and who the murdered person will be. One of the royal family of the Ptolemies or their retainers, such as Pothinus? One of Caesar's staff?"},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"I've really enjoyed Saylor's roman novels, but this latest continues the decline noticeable in the previous couple. The plot involves Gordianus' personal life in a fairly implausible way and the historical setting of this particular year in Roman history (i.e. the history of the city itself, not the republic/empire) just isn't as vivid as in previous installments. I'll probably get the next one, but more out of duty and a diminishing hope that Saylor will do something new - but plausible - next time."},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"For those long-time fans of Saylor's Roma Sub Rosa mysteries, \\"A Mist of Prophecies\\" is a deeply satisfying return after several years' gap between it and Saylor's \\"Last Seen in Massilia.\\"The shocking conclusion of Massilia is referenced, but Gordianus' problems with his own family take backstage to the chaos of Rome during Civil War. Both Pompey and Caesar have moved east to the ultimate battle between them for control of the Roman world. Left behind, the capitol seethes in financial collapse, rumor, and fear. Into this, a beautiful, half-mad seeress, Cassandra, explodes into Gordianus' life. Dying in his arms in the Forum, we then backtrack through Gordianus' meetings with her and her involvement in the intrigues taking place in the paranoid world in which Caesar and Pompey, far away, are determining Rome's future. In discovering why she died, we meet some of Rome's most famous women, each of whom may be a suspect and each of whom is deeply involved with the desperate civil struggle playing out all around them.The women are sketched with particular vividness. We have met Fulvia and Clodia before in earlier novels. I particularly enjoyed Caesar's wife, Calpurnia, whose small but highly memorable part in the mystery makes her far more interesting than the little that is known from history. Old friends Milo and Caelius also help turn the plot.Saylor easily balances the personal woes of Gordianus with the the larger canvas of war and intrigue. I found it consistently satisfying and, in its surprise ending, I suspect we may look forward to the next in the series as a completely different change of pace.Although I missed actually seeing Caesar and Cicero in the novel (both are in the East), this is a fun, refreshing, and energetic read and - as always with Saylor - you will learn something about Rome. Enjoy it!"},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"Steven Saylor's \\"A Mist of Prophecies\\" gives us a glimspe into the political and social power of Roman women as the Republic was dying. Gordianus' prefered methods of discovering the truth, conversation and observation, are tested as he talks to seven very important women who showed up at the funeral of a young woman who seems to have been gifted with prophecies. While Saylor does a good job with the conversations and giving us a view of Roman life there are multiple threads here that aren't as well interwoven as I would have liked. For example, I have nothing against jumping around in time but since there was a consistant pattern of when this was going to happen, I got a bit lost every now and then. Also there are many things going on in Gordianus' house that we see briefly or which are mentioned briefly but that do not really seem to make the Finder as concerned or as thoughtful as a father or husband as we might expect given his character in earlier books. Are we to assume that this is a comment on all men, that even the best and most observant will stray?"},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"This novel continues the marvelous and vivid life of Gordianus and his family.

Like \\"Rubicon\\" and \\"Last Seen in Massilia\\", this book focuses on the Gordianus family, putting politics and intrigue on a back burner.

Grow up."},{"Title":"A Mist of Prophecies","review":"As a PhD candidate at Harvard specializing in Roman-Greco Studies, I can say with all certainty that what Steven Saylor knows about Roman history is something akin to what Richard Nixon knew about money laundering and cover-ups: next to nothing! This is the most contrived, ridulous kind of pulp fiction which, frankly, is tainting the Mystery genre by sheer virtue of its contrived settings and implausible, bombastic twists. Saylor -- a \\"hack\\" writer whose only credential is a humble BA from some southern school -- attempts to veneer a Mystery story over the only thing he knows anything about, namely history. And his knowledge of the latter is shaky at that! Saylor is a long way from finding his writer's \\"voice\\" and it doesn't seem that he ever will. Why any subsidy publisher would bet good money on such a weak effort is more of a mystery than even Saylor's books. Saylor's peculiar genre is a hybrid ad absurdum that may better qualify for the tag of \\"mutated\\" rather than a genuine cross-genre effort.

Marvin's slaying is only the first in a string of violent events that include bombings in Miami, and the murder of the Moores, a couple who worked to bring the vote to Florida's African-American population.Determined to bring Marvin's murderers to justice, Reesa's family sets off a string of events that eventually lead to a federal investigation and federal trial of many of the town's KKK members.Why don't they teach this in school? I had no idea of any of these events until I read this novel. How very sad."},{"Title":"Lay that Trumpet in Our Hands","review":"WOW! What a read! This is an important story told beautifully. Some of the narrative is lyrical. Other parts will chill you to the bone. It is a story that will stick with me for a long, long time. Told from the point of view of a young girl in 1951 Florida, it takes the reader into the civil rights movement with heartbreaking intimacy. Compared, on the cover, to To Kill a Mockingbird (something that's almost inevitable when the story deals with a pre-pubescent narrator talking about racism in the South), I found it a \\"different bird\\" altogether. It stands on its own as a fine piece of literature. Book discussion groups, take note! And all others simply looking for a book that will provoke thought and feeling - look no further."},{"Title":"Lay that Trumpet in Our Hands","review":"Susan Carol McCarthy tells an amazing story of family, friendship and personal strength through the eyes of a young girl, Reesa, living in central Florida in the 1950's.Two families become entwined when the KKK intimidates, stalks and randomly murders a young man, Marvin Cully, because he is black. The young man's death is a turning point for Reesa McMahon because the ugly world of racism is unveiled before her young eyes. Marvin Cully's family and Reesa's families are friends, and Marvin's death draws them even closer. Reesa's parents must make decisions to do what is right, even at the risk of endangering their own family.The early Civil Rights movement is explored, with the founder Harry T. Moore joining the McMahon's and the Cully's in trying to expose and bring to justice those responsible for Marvin's murder. This opens the window on the KKK and more violence and terror is unleashed.This is a story that is both beautiful and heart-wrenching. It is a story about friends, faith and families that make definitive choices to do the right thing. It is also about innocence lost when wrong and right collide, leaving moral courage stamped in fire upon a young girl's soul.I met the author at a book event in Tampa. She spoke about the historical accuracy of her book and told of her decision to write this book based on her father's actions in that time. Also at this event was Evangeline Moore, the daughter of Harry Moore, and she told of her view of events of the time and of her parents violent murder.This is an amazing book that is an honest and insightful view into the thoughts and lives of those in the early days of the Civil Rights Movement and a foresight of changes that were to come."},{"Title":"Lay that Trumpet in Our Hands","review":"Florida is hardly the place one would look to find the hotbed of violence and hatred that was the Ku Klux Klan in 1951. However, as Susan Carol McCarthy tells us in her highly effective debut novel, at that time, it was. Reesa McMahon's nightmare begins in spring of that year when a nineteen year old black youth named Marvin Cully is killed. Marvin was her friend and worked as citrus picker in her father's orange grove. This event sets off a wave of violence throughout the state. Bombs explode and people are killed as far south as Miami. The NAACP and FBI get involved and eventually Reesa's father, Warren, is involved as a sympathizer for the blacks. This leads to an eventual clash between Warren and the local black community versus the KKK.Susan Carol McCarthy displays a prodigious talent at writing realistic historical fiction. There is much to be admired in this work. The civil rights era is brought fully to life in her hands. There is a great sense of place in that the reader could almost smell the fragrant citrus groves of this small central Florida town. However, most impressive of all is her depiction of the characters. They are both empathetic and realistic including the dialogue they speak. In a sense, it is a coming of age novel. It represents a clash between childhood innocence and the harsh realities of the adult world comprised of racial bigotry and hatred. Remnicent of TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, LAY THAT TRUMPET IN OUR HANDS is a microcosmic saga that reveals the triumph of good over evil in the framework of a small southern town. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Lay that Trumpet in Our Hands","review":"While reading this book, I kept saying to myself and my husband, \\"I didn't know that or did you know that. . .\\". In other words, this book is based on facts of historical events involving the KKK and the FBI that occurred in Florida in 1951-1952. However, this story is far from boring; it's told from a young girl's perspective as she grows up emotionally. Not only does Ms. McCarthy tell a story of fearful circumstances but also personalizes it so that we rout for this girl, her family and the community. Every anecdote ties together perfectly. I especially didn't want to read about a \\"rattler race\\" in a dry sinkhole, yet I couldn't stop myself. So will you."},{"Title":"Lay that Trumpet in Our Hands","review":"This story may have been written for young people but as a senior citizen I found it to be an interesting and compelling story of what wasn't so good in the good old days when segregation was still causing heartache especially in Florida.The author actually lived in the area she wrote about and did a lot of research of the Civil Rights era.This book had many heartwarming parts and also brought me to tears. My friends and I all read the book and then went out to lunch at the inn that was mentioned in the book. I liked the book so much that I read it twice.After I read it I gave it to my husband and he enjoyed reading it too."},{"Title":"Lay that Trumpet in Our Hands","review":"I loved this book. Ms. McCarthy writes simply and beautifully. I was raised in Central Florida and could recall some of the events mentioned in the book. What I loved the most about the book was the relationships, the use of poetry and bible scriptures. I think this book is a 'must read'."},{"Title":"Lay that Trumpet in Our Hands","review":"\\"Lay that Trumpet in Our Hands\\" has been compared to \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\", and I think the comparison is warranted. With a young, spunky girl as the narrator, troubled racial events taking place, and the relationships between people at its heart, using this book to bridge to the denser classic novel will help kids make the transition. I'm planning to use it with my 8th grade students; I might question using it with younger students.It isn't only a great book for teaching purposes, though! Pick it up and prepare to connect with the characters and become immersed in the story."},{"Title":"Lay that Trumpet in Our Hands","review":"I don't see the rating that I put on this book for the last time so maybe I didn't rate it at all. Why? I don't know. This book was one of the most excellent and intriguing books I've ever read in my life. It was so interesting to hear about a white person's perspective on the KKK and the plot was fabulous. Although I wish she wouldn't have had reason to write this story, I really did appreciate it. Thanks again!"},{"Title":"Lay that Trumpet in Our Hands","review":"Well-written and engaging - you CARE about the characters, and the quiet acceptance of monsters in the community will both intrigue and disgust you.

He loved the book and talked about it constantly after he was done.It made a big impact."},{"Title":"Lay that Trumpet in Our Hands","review":"As a fictional account of an actual event, this was very well written. The author's fictionalized view could very well have happened the way she wrote it. I became intimate with the characters; I know exactly what they look like , how they sound when they speak and the expressions on their faces at different times throughout the experience. This, to me, are signs of a good book."},{"Title":"Lay that Trumpet in Our Hands","review":"This is a great book for anyone who was not alive in the 50's.

Worth your time if you're interested in this historical era."},{"Title":"Lay that Trumpet in Our Hands","review":"I found this book to be enjoyable and well written. While some have suggested the writing is somewhat simplistic, I thought it true to the narrator's (main character's) perspective. This is a book that is well balanced, constructed with an even pace, and informative. As historical fiction, I checked on the events discussed and found the reporting to be true. It left me trying to get into the KKK's thinking and searching for anything justifiable in their devlish intentions. The characters were well developed and REAL. I dislike books in which the heroic figures triumph over impossible odds. Instead, the main characters experience fear, threat, a crisis of faith, and doubt as they do what they know is right. This book was tragic without being gruesome as dark secrets of the recent past were explored. I am going to recommend this to my book club."},{"Title":"Lay that Trumpet in Our Hands","review":"This was a book club selection, chosen because we live in Central Florida. I've lived in this community since 1966 and had to go check to see if the facts in this fictionalized story were truth - they are.The writing itself is on a more juvenile level - very appropriate material for middle school reading."},{"Title":"Lay that Trumpet in Our Hands","review":"I must say, it is seldom that I find a book so well written. I never thought I would find a book about my tiny cracker town! I lived in the city for 30 years and it is very realistic.The book itself was a wonderful story about light over coming darkness. In many ways, I almost felt like I was reading something akin to that movie we all love, \\"It's a Wonderful Life\\" meets \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\". When evil strikes this tiny town, people of courage band together to fight it and good over comes evil.Reesa's family settles from the North into a quiet, sleepy Orange Grove community. It is only when a good family friend, mistaken for being someone else is murdered as a racist act. Grief stricken, the family determines a clever way to circumvent the evil law enforcement officials who don't bother investigating and beat the Klan at their own game.This book is full of Florida History. As a Floridian, I find that most of the history written is either on the Native American's or more present day. Seldom does anyone take on the more hidden stories. Whereas, Rosewood takes on the acts of the Klan just 2 hours North of Central Florida, it was much a more sterile account since most of the survivors were gone.The characters were well drawn and believable. Cudos to Ms. McCarthy, she is a master story teller. I also admire her for telling the story. I particularly enjoyed how she ended her story, something that is a challenge for many writers. Rarely do I find a story that puts a lump in my throat.I wish the ending were more true to reality; that everyone in this town had changed for the better, that a next generation would rise let go of their need for supremacy and embrace the brotherhood of mankind. Yes, things are a bit better, unfortunately, most of the people, who ran this town more than 50 years ago now have passed the torch to their offspring and amazingly some are even still in power! Now they cloak their animosity more effectively but the hatred and fear is still present. So, I pray that the Lord will Lay the Trumpets in Our Hands and that the True Light will soon overcome the darkness."},{"Title":"Lay that Trumpet in Our Hands","review":"Whether you loved, hated, or somewhat like To Kill a Mockingbird, its guaranteed you'll love this book. I had to read this book for an advanced Engish class and I dreaded reading this book, but after reading a couple of pages, my whole mind changed. If totally recommend this book to everyone, from the mature reader to the less developed reader. Great piece of literature."},{"Title":"Lay that Trumpet in Our Hands","review":"This is an excellent novel which I greatly enjoyed. It describes, from the viewpoint of a young girl, the experiences of a family in the fight against racism in Florida in the 1950s. The most striking aspect of this is the description of living in a society whose basic assumptions are different to one's own. Most of us have experienced people making off-color/racist/sexist comments in our presence (although nowhere near as overt nor as excessive as those expressed by some of the characters in the book). It is interesting to see how this family copes and compare their reaction with one's own and imagine how one would cope in the same situation.The book is well written and is easy to read. The characters are well defined and the story beautifully paced.I would recommend this book to teenage as well as adult readers."},{"Title":"Lay that Trumpet in Our Hands","review":"Several of the reviews outline the plot...it is the powerful feeling and emotion that can be shared with the characters. I believe it is truly a lesson in the feeling of humiliation and shame for having this be a piece of our history. The inability to relate comes with upbringing and the joy that you cannot relate to the KKK. It is suprising how our author weaves this tension and builds and builds. You really want some sort of resolution to spare pain for the family and the reader. WOW."},{"Title":"Lay that Trumpet in Our Hands","review":"Reading this book was like being in central Florida in the 1950's. Carol McCarthy is an excellent story teller. I've read the book twice and put it up on the shelf to pull down in a couple years to read again."},{"Title":"Lay that Trumpet in Our Hands","review":"I'm a huge fan of historical fiction and this book definitely rates near the top of my list.While reading Lay That Trumpet in Our Hands, I was stricken with many emotions. Susan Carol McCarthy weaves a heartbreaking story of life in central Florida during the years of 1951-1952.It begins with Reesa McMahon a young northerner who resides in Florida with her parents and two younger brothers. When her best friend Marvin, a young black man who worked in her parents' orange grove, was murdered by the KKK, Reesa is thrown into a world where she is forced to come to terms with the deception and brutality of the local government and become an adult when she should be enjoying childhood.If you're like me, this book will amaze you with what we didn't learn in history books. I'm not sure why, but I never thought of Florida as a \\"Southern\\" state. This book reveals the truth behind one of the worst times in the Civil Rights Movement, and introduces new heroes who will forever be remembered!You WILL love this book!..."},{"Title":"Lay that Trumpet in Our Hands","review":"I have lived in Central Florida for 5 years and, until I read this book, had no idea how prevalent the Ku Klux Klan was here in the 1950s.

Some of the aircraft covered like the carrier version of the P-80 Shooting Star were kind of unexpected. Of course the old standbys of World War II are included: Wildcat, Corsair, Dauntless, Avenger. Strangely missing is the Hellcat, but this is a minor thing.Some of the unepected aircraft include the PB4Y Privateer, the Navy's version of the B-24. Another is the Martin P6M Seamaster, the jet powered flying boat that worked quite well but got cancelled to provide money for the Polaris sub project. Another is the Pitcairn OP-1, the first rotary-wing aircraft used by the Navy. It wasn't a helecopter but an Autogyro. This is the first time that I've lot of this information.Along with the descriptions of the planes, there is quite a bit of well researched information about each plane.

From what I can tell from the sample pages, this edition is just a reprint of the original, with a new cover.Why the Yockey essay needed translation is an interesting story in itself, which Professor Oliver briefly recounts in his companion piece. Yockey, an American, wrote The Enemy of Europe in English and then translated it (or had it translated) for publication in Berlin in the early 1950s.The plates of the German book were destroyed and the English original entirely disappeared. However, one copy of the German typescript survived, and this was then \\"retroverted\\" into a slightly stilted Anglo-American idiom. Not a perfect replication of the original, but as good an approximation as was possible to attain.Oliver's essay is vintage RPO--feisty, erudite, entertaining, viperish. Yockey's piece may be inaccessible to most people who haven't read any of his other writings. His political stance really defies categorization. He was a man of neither the left nor the right, a visionary without any slogans or nostrums for the immediate future. The uninitiated will find him an infuriating mass of contradictions. For example, the enemy of Europe referred to in the title is the United States of America. But Yockey was himself a patriotic American as well as a Europe-firster. To explain how all this fits together one would have to give a detailed analysis of Yockey's philosophy of history.The closest thing we have to a present-day Yockey is Spengler--not Oswald, but the columnist in the Asia Times (atimes.com). If you don't have the stomach for Spengler in the Asia Times, then don't go anywhere near Yockey."},{"Title":"The Enemy Of Europe/The Enemy of Our Enemies","review":"Francis Parker Yockey's 'Imperium' is probably the single greatest philosophical & political work since Plato's 'The Republic.' Unfortunately, its somewhat dense, overly subtle, rather lengthy, and frankly too difficult for many people to read. This book, which Yockey intended as a sort of explanatory epilogue to 'Imperium,' may be better suited for the purpose of inspiring already committed souls, and winning new minds to the sacred cause of the West. The fact that this volume contains a lengthy discourse on its contents by yet another of the foremost intellectuals and patriots of the post-1945 era, Dr. Revilo P. Oliver, is a much appreciated bonus."},{"Title":"Ocean Floor Mysteries : The Amazing Mystery of the Great FACE on the Pacific Ocean Floor","review":"The author has the talent to combine topics from different fields in an astonishing and interesting way. The face on the Pacific Ocean and the other geographic features combined with the God of the Bible is a very strong hint for non-believers that God is reality. The book shows profound proof for God's existence - however, some ignorant people will probably say &quot;I can't care less&quot; or &quot; Oh - that's interesting&quot;. I recommend this book for any person who is interested in real facts - it shows valuable insight in a topic which a generation ago could not be written about due to lack of technological advance."},{"Title":"Ocean Floor Mysteries : The Amazing Mystery of the Great FACE on the Pacific Ocean Floor","review":"The book is very interesting but Lloyd and Dean forgot one little detail;The Face is staring at Michigan.

With this startling topic, I should first explain what it is not. It will not likely change anyone's theology. It does notglorify Mary or any mortal human. And it will not start a mass pilgrimage to see a burnt tortilla. When I spoke with the author, Iwas pleased to learn he had a similar, somewhat conservative Baptist background that I have myself. So now to tell you whatthe book does reveal.New mapping technology only available in the last few years has shown a strange phenomenon on our planet. The Biblical planof salvation is carved into the Earth's geography. Much of it is under water and can only be verified with current technology.Using NO computer manipulated images, which could falsify the observations, just current generation Rand McNally maps, youwill see startling imagery that has been hidden from mankind until now.I am giving this credible recognition merely because anyone can scorch a tortilla, but only our creator can shape a continent andmold an ocean floor.Mr. Carpenter shows a few \\"teaser\\" images on his Spiral Update News Web page...Personally I find the Pacific Face and the \\"Kneeling King\\" formations to be the easiest to distinguish and the most startling as totheir relation to scripture. I am not totally convinced of his interpretation of several of the other images, but the reader is free tooffer suggestions to Mr. Carpenter for his next release. He makes no dogmatic statements of interpretation, but I feel the 2images I pointed out tend to speak for themselves. Give it a look yourself and see what no previous generation could haveseen. Have a recent globe and your Bible handy to cross reference several passages.*Ken Rasmussen aka \\"Late Night Leroy\\" is a journalist for WebToday Magazine."},{"Title":"Ocean Floor Mysteries : The Amazing Mystery of the Great FACE on the Pacific Ocean Floor","review":"Lloyd Carpenter's book, The Amazing Mystery ofthe Great Face on the Pacific Ocean Floor, firstgot my attention, then it got my undivided attention,and then it got my utmost consideration. How did Mr.Carpenter's book manage to so completely focus mythinking? (I mean other than by its most singularthesis.) It did so by providing me with a rareexperience in the field of Judeo-Christianstudies: the opportunity to interpret new facts.Almost all of Judeo-Christian interpretativescholarship is based on the study of the samenever-changing scriptures. The most recentscriptures are found in the Book of Mormon,and they are over one hundred and fifty years old.Mr. Carpenter's discovery of the Great Face, andits accompanying phenomena, provides us with theblessing of new material to consider in the searchfor a meaningful spiritual connection with the divine.As anyone with any experience at all in religious studieswould expect, Mr. Carpenter's book also provides hisinterpretation of the discovery. His interpretationis based on a most fitting premise: What science revealswe must interpret; and when science reveals somethingextraordinary, extraordinary interpretation is required.Mr. Carpenter gives us a whole new set of facts,and they are more than fresh--they are exciting!*Randal Bates is a California attorney specializing in Constitutional Law."},{"Title":"Ocean Floor Mysteries : The Amazing Mystery of the Great FACE on the Pacific Ocean Floor","review":"I was immediately impressed with this work. It follows that God would do this since He put the story of redemption in the star constellations, why not also in the earth? &quot;Deep calleth unto deep...&quot; Many people will not see it (admit it) no matter how obvious it is. I also think it interesting that the band &quot;YES&quot; has an album from 1973 called &quot;Tales From Topographic Oceans&quot; which I think is exactly what this is. And like two of that albums four songs titles say: &quot;The Revealing Science Of God&quot; and &quot;The Ancient Giants Under The Sun&quot; I'd say YES to both. It's for real.I have put a map of the world up on my wall and bought several map books. I even showed the people working in one book store the face in a very good map book as I was checking out, where the ocean floors were displayed and showed them the Kneeling King. I don't think they were convinced but I am. My roommate thinks I'm off on yet another flight of fancy because I believe this is true. Well, I just see God's handiwork. I see also Lloyd Carpenter's sincerity in all that he says and how he presents everything. I believe God has revealed these things to those who are humble and hidden them from others. I will never look at a map of this Earth the way I used to but now with tremendous awe and wonder and humility and thanksgiving to our glorious creator who loves us so much. To me the figure of Jesus is so clear.

Carpenter's contribution to the people of the world, &quot;The Amazing Mystery of the Great Face on the Pacific Floor,&quot; I was puzzled about the truth of this mysterious face as it revealed itself to me. I could see a believable representation unfolding of the face of our Father, our living God, and the Creator of all things. I asked God, &quot; where have you been hiding this man, Carpenter, all this time?&quot;The obvious question is, how does all this comes into place? Surprisingly, this happens when we read the amount of biblical and topographical lay out relating to the Face on the Pacific Ocean Floor. I believe that if God did lay the foundations of earth and it is his footstool, he is fully capable of giving us physical evidence of this king. God is fully able to say what he is about by carving his weeping face on the Pacific Ocean floor. &quot;Where wasn't thou when I laid the foundations of the earth? Declare, if thou has understand?&quot; (Job 38:4) (Isaiah 6:3; 1 Cor. 10:28; Isaiah 66:1)Because of scripture, the concepts of the eye of God, weeping and tears flowing, God's affection, God's praying hands, and his final revelation through Jesus Christ is spiritually, topographically and archeologically plausible.I write this as a tribute to Lloyd Stewart Carpenter, who has done a superb job of a full investigation of the mysterious phenomenon of God's face on the Pacific Ocean Floor.

The only thing disappointing about this book was that it had to end."},{"Title":"A Nest of Sparrows","review":"This book was one of the best I have read in a very long time. This was my third book by Deborah Raney and the best thus far. It was an \\"edge of your seat\\" kind of book. I could not put it down. It was sad, happy, intense & sweet. My every emotion was exposed in this book. When I finished reading it I loaned it to a friend who loved it as much as I did.

In this touching story of a man who opens his heart to the three orphaned children of his fiance, Raney gives us a look into the hope that is found in faith that is steady and real. But be warned: tissues are a must through to the end."},{"Title":"A Nest of Sparrows","review":"A Nest of Sparrows by Deborah Raney is an absolutely beautiful story about how sometimes God makes us wait for the longings of our hearts. Wade Sullivan loves Starr Parnell and her three children with all of his heart, but when tragedy strikes, he has to put his faith in the Lord that he can keep the family together. Raney does a fantastic job at developing the relationship between Wade and the children through the quiet, everyday moments of making supper and bedtime routines. It's those things that really make a family, and she captures the heart of it. I was a bit concerned that the biological father would be another stereotypical 100% bad non-believer, but even he had depth to his character. Dee wasn't as well rounded as I would have liked, but she was believable and likable. Even the secondary characters had depth in this book. This book teaches one of the harder lessons of faith. Sometimes it's impossible for us to understand why God does the things he does, and then it seems even more impossible when He tells us to wait."},{"Title":"A Nest of Sparrows","review":"This book was a HOLT Medallion winner, RITA finalist, finalist for the National Readers Choice Award and The Booksellers Best Award.

I just finished it for the second time and am now sending it to my cousin who is a missionary. Deb Rainey has you crying and empathizing with the characters and especially Wade who tries so hard to make a home for his fiance's children, after her sudden death. When she dies, Deb transports us to heaven as she leaves her body and that gave me chills. I could not put this book down and I already new what happened in the end. Dee is a wonderful character too, as the social worker that tries her best to keep the children with Wade. It is romantic and not overdone.Deborah Rainey is an excellent storyteller and takes her readers to some of the \\"hard places\\" where we would rather not go but are rewarded when we do."},{"Title":"A Nest of Sparrows","review":"Deb Raney captures your emotions and squeezes them on through to the last page of her dynamic novel.

I was very disappointed that the novel doesn't draw more from reality on these topics. The character representing CPS is completely unbelievable. The contant reassurance that children placed in foster care are \\"resilient\\" and that foster care doesn't hurt them are completely unrealistic, and it's also unrealistic to think that all foster parents are loving and wonderful. The author also wraps up the plot line far too neatly, as a man who has been abusive of multiple people over many years suddenly vistis his lawyers, prepares paperwork, and turns over custody of his kids to a non-relative, all within a few days time. In real life, abusive people don't do things like this. This novel is shameful in the unrealistic picture it portrays of abusive parents, Child Protective Services, foster care, and the children who suffer in these environments. The author does a true disservice to readers who think that she has painted a realistic picture of these very important issues in our society today. The author would have better served her readers by painting a realistic picture, seeking to educate her readers, and not merely entertain them with a fantasy designed to entertain and sell books."},{"Title":"Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder: The Latest Assessment and Treatment Strategies","review":"This covers all the general topic to address this problem.

There is only 5 pages of text eplaining how to date these photographs and about half the text is used to give you a brief and very general history of early photography.

She writes without the condescension that sometimes mars others in this genre, and her descriptive prose is really outstanding. You really get a sense of the smell, the light, the &quot;feel&quot; of life on a small Scottish croft (farm).My main caution is that &quot;Loud Halo&quot; is the 3rd of a series of books on the same subject, so I did feel a little as though I had been dropped into the middle of a conversation; characters presumably carefully introduced in the earlier volumes Beckwith assumes you know well at this point, which is sometimes a bit confusing. Thus, you might be better off starting with &quot;The Hills Is Lonely&quot; then carrying on only if Beckwith suits you (I predict she will)."},{"Title":"The Loud Halo","review":"Lillian Beckwith never fails to warm my heart or \\"feets\\".

Although I am not sure this book gave me any one technique or approach that makes me a better Christian witness, I have used principles from the analysis of Jesus' approach to this woman within attempts to give a Christian witness.

The author writes in a way that makes you feel like you are being &quot;discipled&quot; by a true friend.

I never led another person to faith in Christ . . . until . . . someone gave me a copy of this book. It was so simple, honest, and natural that it changed my life. Now, years later, I have been present when several dozen persons have experienced a new birth of faith in Christ.For years this book that helped me so much was out of print. I am glad that a new generation of Christian is learning from this master of evangelism."},{"Title":"HOW TO GIVE AWAY YOUR FAITH","review":"How To Give Away Your Faith is an ingenious book that points the followers of Christ to where their ministry should be focused: on showing and telling others about Him. Paul E. Little's book is very helpful in showing where our attitudes should be in witnessing (see Chapter 2: The Effective Ambassador) and how to do so properly (see chapter 3: How To Witness). In addition to these essential areas, Little explains common questions that non-Christians and some Christians ask (see Why We Believe, chapter 6). Probably the most important part of this book is Chapter 5: What Is Out Message? It is crucial for Believers to know what they believe, how to express such things, and what relevant facts must be shared in witnessing.There are simply too many intriguing scenes in this text to mention here, so I will simply state those that most affected me. It is amazing that somewhere in every chapter was a concept I had been longing to grasp, something I knew I had needed to know. And then there were such things I had heard before, yet saw in a new light (such as the \\"Roman Road\\" in Chapter 5: What Is Our Message?). In my sincerest opinion, it is essential that the entire book be read. I have learned more than I ever thought possible with this book. Paul Little covers almost every known topic needed in witnessing.Just so you know, this book (though revised) was originally written in 1966. And so, society having changed slightly since then (and since it was revised in 1988), the dialog and certain phrases, etc. are not completely relevant (yet still understandable). Such things as neighbors having close friendships are mostly restricted to television now in our busy 21st-Century society. Also, words such as \\"phooey\\" and \\"outlandish\\" are used every now and then. Yet, this book is still widely read, used, understandable, and effective. Its importance cannot be understated. Evangelist Billy Graham was quoted describing How To Give Away Your Faith as \\"A tremendous help in witnessing.\\""},{"Title":"HOW TO GIVE AWAY YOUR FAITH","review":"Paul Little's classic work, How to Give Away Your Faith, offers a simple yet often times profound look at one of the \\"hardest\\" tasks of the Christian life: evangelism. Witnessing is hard. Most Christians try to stay away from it and those who do evangelize often prove to be more of an embarrassment to the faith than a witness. How are we to faithfully proclaim the gospel of Christ to a world in need? How do broken clay jars carry an eternal message of hope and life to the thirsty and starving? In seeking to answer such questions, Little charts a helpful course for those who seek to be Christ's ambassadors to the world.Be Real! The world's need for Christ is real and his help is a necessity. Christ and Christianity are the only real answers to the world's need. We must be aware of this need and we must sincerely and truthfully proclaim the wonders of his name. It is our duty to live a life of genuine faith and sincerity of mission because superficial Christianity is empty and meaningless. Our focus should be ultimately placed on things eternal while seeking to remedy things material. Our goal is to have others not just assent to the facts of Christianity but to believe in the Christ of Christianity.How then are we to witness? First, Little highlights the necessity of evangelism for our own personal spiritual growth. It is necessary to witness the power of the gospel. Then we must obey. Evangelism is a matter of obedience. Obedience to Christ brings forth proclamation of his truth. Little proceeds to list seven steps toward active evangelism. First, we must have contact with others in a social context. Secondly, we must seek to establish a common interest with the purpose of bridging communication. Then we must provoke an interest in spiritual things. Fourthly, we must recognize when we should stop and when we should continue on sharing. We also must not condemn those whom we are witnessing too for their various sins. Sixthly, we must not become sidetracked. We must stick to the main message. Lastly, we must call them to repentance. We must call them to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ that they might be saved.How do we handle those \\"ticklish\\" awkward situations? Our desire is to have the unbelievers with whom we are in contact to begin to respect us even though we are different. As they begin to respect us so they will also begin to listen to us instead of viewing us as weird or insane. But awkward moments will come and the best thing we can do is to be prepared for them. We should anticipate difficult situations and have alternatives to comfortably work through them.As ambassadors of Christ it is our duty to proclaim his message. The messenger must know and understand the message for the purpose of being a faithful and knowledgeable ambassador. Little sums up the gospel message in Jesus Christ himself - \\"who He is, what He has done, and how He can be known in personal experience\\" (56). He suggests following the pattern of problem, diagnosis, cure for setting forth the message of the gospel.Further, ambassadors cannot just know the message but they must also believe it and live it. We don't have all the answers, but we nonetheless must be ready to give a reason for the hope within us. There are many questions, which non-believers have, but their basic problem is one of moral unbelief. They have rejected their creator and traded his truth in for a lie.Christ is the answer to those questions, which are asked. However, he has left it as our duty to show the helpless and lost the importance and relevance of Christ in answering those questions. Christianity is true because Jesus is the truth. He is the relevant truth the world needs.So how are Christians to witness to a corrupted world without compromising our holiness? It is our duty to reach out to the world, but we must not succumb to worldliness. We must recognize that all of our life is God's and we are to live as unto him and for his purposes. We should live all of life cognizant of being stewards of God's time and we must strive to live a life of constant witness to the truth.The gospel is not just for a one-time salvation event; the gospel is for life. Faith in Christ, the object of our salvation, must continue throughout the Christian life. We are in a daily battle but with Christ it is a victorious battle. We battle against our secret self; against sins both external and internal. This battle must be fought with the Sword of the Spirit and it must be waged through the power of prayer. We also battle over time and priorities, which must be aligned with God's prerogative. In doing so we will have fought a victorious battle.Witnessing is not optional for the Christian. In fact, as Little has shown, it is vital to the Christian life. It is a matter of obedience to our Creator and Redeemer. Little, offers a helpful guide toward developing better witnesses. While he offers various witnessing helps he goes beyond the task of evangelism and hits the witness himself. This is where Little is most valuable and while this work will be used for some years to come."},{"Title":"HOW TO GIVE AWAY YOUR FAITH","review":"The book had many positive and negative aspects. In one example Little says that a Christian may allow a roommate to leave pornographic magazines around the shared area but he or she should put his or her \\"foot down\\" when the roommate invites someone of the opposite sex to sleep over (82); however both circumstances should not be tolerated. A few pages prior, Little mentions, \\"Do not condemn the other persons and do not compromise your own convictions\\" (75)-tolerating pornographic magazines to be left out in the open is a compromise and a possible source of temptation. Christians are called to be holy, and to say nothing about the porn magazines is the same as condoning it. The Bible exhorts that Christians are to \\"take no part in the worthless deed of evil and darkness (Eph. 5:11 NLT).\\" The Christian should ask that the roommate keep porn magazines in his or her own personal living space.Little mentions that there is an \\"absence of an explicit biblical standard\\" regarding alcohol consumption. He states that French Christians often drink wine because it is part of their culture (149). There is a certain people group in the United States who was infamous for making \\"moon shine\\" and would probably consider alcohol consumption as part of their culture. Just because one is accustomed to certain practices does not mean that the act is acceptable. Christians are called to put an end to selfish desires that impede on a relationship with God (Galatians 5:24 and Romans 21:1).Little asserts that praying over a meal before eating is not a \\"witness vehicle\\" so he suggests that Christians ought to pray with eyes wide open so as not to offend anyone (79). Jesus states, however, \\"For whoever is ashamed of Me...of him the son of Man also will be ashamed (Mark 8:38 NKJV).\\" Praying in public may not be a witnessing tool, but Christians should not be afraid of what others would think if he or she prays silently before a meal.On a positive note, the inclusion of study questions and the suggestions for group leaders would be helpful for a church evangelism class. The questions evoke a response from the student, forcing him or her to make practical applications of the chapter's content. For instance, one of the questions in chapter five, \\"What is Our Message,\\" asks, \\"What would you reply to a person who said, \`I'm glad Christ will forgive my sins but I haven't got anything to repent of. I'm as good as the next guy'? (103).\\" Another from the same chapter asks a question but also poses a challenge, \\"Prepared with new insights from this chapter, would you like to contact someone in order to explain or clarify the gospel or to help the person continue in Christ? Consider doing so this week (103).\\"Little explains that sometimes non-Christians refute or seriously doubt the reliability of the Bible. To this, Little counters by asking for specific examples, which he observes very few people ever give (121). In fact Little insists, \\"We don't have to be answering questions all the time. We can pose a few questions for him, too\\" (114). For example, Little's question for those who deny Jesus Christ as the only way to God is \\"Since you don't believe Jesus Christ was the Truth, which of the other three possibilities about Jesus Christ do you believe? He was either a liar, a lunatic, a legend or the Truth\\" (114).The first edition of Paul Little's book was published in 1966 and was updated by his widow, Marie Little, who republished it as a second edition in 1988. It is amazing how the examples are still relevant. Little's quest to help people present the good news in a \\"relevant\\" way and to communicate the gospel effectively to those who find it strange or foreign was achieved (13). Not only does Little equip people with the purpose, method and challenge of evangelism, but also devotes several chapters on strengthening the inner spiritual qualities of Christians. Two reflective questions he posed were, \\"Are we convinced that our behavior is giving glory to God?\\" (153), and \\"Am I doing this and not doing that because of love for Jesus Christ and a desire to honor and glorify Him? Or is the real reason a cultural bias that won't hold if I move from one social or cultural group to another?\\" (158). Little believed that an \\"inner spiritual reality\\" of spending time with God in prayer, worship and fellowship is crucial for becoming an useful witness (190). Little's book prompts the reader to realize and to act according because \\"the greatest favor you can do for others is to introduce them to Jesus Christ\\" (11)."},{"Title":"HOW TO GIVE AWAY YOUR FAITH","review":"Paul E. Little's book How to Give Away Your Faith (IVP) was first published in 1966, a few years before the popular evangelist was killed in a tragic car accident. Since his untimely death, his wife Marie has overseen two revisions of Little's book (1988, 2008).How to Give Away Your Faith is sometimes described as \\"the classic guide to evangelism\\" perhaps because of the way in which the book addresses practical issues surrounding personal evangelism. Today, I will summarize How to Give Away Your Faith and tomorrow, I will offer some areas of agreement and critique.A SummaryLittle begins his book by challenging his readers to take a good look at the world in which we live. One may wonder why a book on evangelism begins with a brief analysis of Western culture. Little gives the answer to that question by insisting that Christians should know both their Bibles and the people around them (24). We should be attentive not only to the big-picture problems in our world, but also to the issues being faced by the person next door.Little believes there are two essential ingredients for faith: initial commitment (conversion) and love and obedience to Jesus (33-4). Obedience is a sign that we have true faith in Jesus Christ, and this obedience includes our evangelistic efforts.In the second chapter, Little describes the effective ambassador of Jesus Christ. He dispels some of the myths surrounding evangelism, including the attempts of some to express an artificial enthusiasm or the doubts of others as to whether or not they can engage in evangelism if they have moral imperfections (42-49).Little challenges us to use our personalities and talents in order to be \\"diplomats,\\" and this diplomatic role implies that we must have non-Christian friends. \\"If we are serious about representing Christ, we need to think through how we can be the best friends possible to non-Christians,\\" he writes (49).Little offers us a number of suggestions in how to cultivate these friendships:sharing mealtimes,participating in new activities,and getting to know the people in our neighborhoods (49-52).Next, Little shows us how to go about witnessing by pointing to Jesus as our primary example. He analyzes Jesus' encounter with the Samaritan woman at the well in John 4, and puts forth some basic, practical principles for evangelism.\\"These... are our eight principles: meet and know non-Christians personally; establish a mutual interest in conversation; arouse a person's interest by life and word; gear explanations to people's receptiveness and readiness for more; accept and even compliment rather than condemn; stay on the track; and persevere to the destination\\" (75).How to Give Away Your Faith is filled with the practical insight from an experienced personal evangelist. One chapter seeks to help Christians overcome some of the social barriers that sometimes put them in awkward positions.How should Christians respond to those who use profanity?How can Christians give thanks before meals when sharing them with non-Christians?According to Little, the \\"guideline for a right attitude in hurdling social barriers should be the ambassador's goal: to get close enough to gain a hearing for the message of reconciliation through Jesus Christ.\\" (80) Little shows how this single-mindedness can help us overcome some of the more difficult social situations.The central section of How to Give Away Your Faith focuses primarily upon the message that Christians are to proclaim as well as the reasons why Christians believe that message to be objectively true. Little writes:\\"Ambassadors communicate a message. Many Christians are ineffective ambassadors because they're not sure of the content of their message and are unable to communicate it clearly to others\\" (92).In defining the gospel, Little turns the spotlight onto Jesus.\\"The gospel... is Jesus Christ himself - who he is, what he has done, and how he can be known in personal experience\\" (94).From there, he sketches some of the basic facts that give a framework for our thinking. These facts include the identity of Jesus Christ, his diagnosis of human nature, the fact and meaning of his crucifixion and resurrection, and how one becomes a Christian (95-101). These basic facts can be incorporated into a variety of gospel presentations.The rest of the book focuses on training in apologetics, the relevance of Jesus Christ for a number of societal issues, the effect of worldliness upon evangelism, and how Christians can continually cultivate a passion for personal evangelism.Little recognizes that evangelism is connected to other vital aspects of the Christian faith, including discipleship and personal holiness. Therefore, he deals with these other subjects, since they affect evangelistic practice.StrengthsThere is much to appreciate in Little's book. Readers will sense Little's experience in personal evangelism. The strength of this manual lies in the practical nature of Little's insights. His directions are borne out of experience and passion, not merely theory and academics.It is encouraging to see that Little makes room for tough questions regarding the Christian faith. One of the reasons some people give for their lack of evangelism is that they feel ill-equipped to answer tough questions.Little offers some preliminary answers to hard questions about Christianity. These answers point us in the right direction and whet readers' appetites for going deeper into understanding why we believe what we believe.Likewise, Little's emphasis on apologetics keeps him from basing reasons for belief solely in the experience of believers. He clearly believes that Christians will have a conversion experience that results in a personal relationship with Jesus as Lord.But he does not allow this experience to overshadow the objective truths of Christianity. He wisely avoids making his case for Christianity's truthfulness by appealing to subjective religious experience, a mistake made by many today.Also helpful is the way that Little delineates the biblical truths about Jesus and thus holds the spotlight on Jesus, not the personal testimony of the evangelist.WeaknessesHow to Give Away Your Faith is a helpful volume in many ways. Still, there are a couple of sections that could be strengthened.First, it was good to see Little emphasizing the importance of Christ's resurrection. (Some evangelistic strategies focus on the cross to the exclusion of the empty tomb.)Unfortunately, his unpacking of the resurrection's meaning is somewhat reductionistic. According to Little, Christ's resurrection proves his divinity, and it means we can have a personal relationship with Jesus today (98).Both of these statements about the resurrection are true. But the Gospels and the preaching of the apostle Paul lead us to a richer understanding of the resurrection, one that goes beyond mere apologetic proofs for the deity of Christ and leads us to the biblical teaching of God's kingdom community.Resurrection morning is the start of God's new creation - the kingdom of God being inaugurated now, even as it has not yet come in its fullness. The disciples experience the power of Christ's resurrection, not merely so that their relationship with the living Savior can continue, but also that they may form the people of God, the new humanity, a beloved community of faith that has been \\"reborn\\" and now serves as the sign of the wondrous future that God has in store for the whole cosmos.The reductionist understanding of the resurrection creates the next problem for Little's proposal: the local church is mentioned merely as \\"follow up\\" (104-8). Thus, the creation of the community of resurrection faith is not seen as central to the gospel presentation itself.To his credit, Little emphasizes the need for local church participation. Yet, he clearly views the church as a little more than a place for fellowship with like-minded believers. There is little sense in this book that the creation of the ekklesia was one of the primary intentions of the atonement.How to Give Away Your Faith shines light on both the strength and weakness of the evangelical approach to personal evangelism.Its strength lies in its emphasis on personal salvation and individual conversion.Its weakness lies in its relegation of the doctrine of the church to \\"follow up,\\" an evangelical tendency which generates the unfortunate situation in which people make decisions for Christ but fail to see the importance (indeed necessity) of being incorporated into a local manifestation of Christ's body. The church is seen as an afterthought, something to follow up with after individual salvation has taken place instead of being seen as the central platform for God's grace to flow out to the wider world.ConclusionHow to Give Away Your Faith is one of the better books on evangelism that I have come across. Filled with practical insights and spiritual fervor, Paul Little's book continues to resonate with audiences today.Despite a couple of flaws indicative of the atmosphere of evangelicalism in Little's day, the book contains engaging examples and motivational insights into the nature of the Great Commission and our responsibility to fulfill it."},{"Title":"HOW TO GIVE AWAY YOUR FAITH","review":"\\"Witnessing is that deep-seated conviction that the greatest favor I can do for others is to introduce them to Jesus Christ...But, many Christians are ineffective ambassadors because they're not sure of the content of their message and are unable to communicate it clearly to others.\\" So writes Paul Little in How to Give Away your Faith, which is certainly one of the most widely-read and successful books on evangelism ever written.Published in 1966, and re-released by Little's wife last year (Little died in 1975), this book is a sort of evangelism-for-dummies. Much of what it says seems common-sense now, but was not so 40 years ago. In fact, much of what seems obvious in it, is obvious precisely because of the popularity of this book.Little's thrust is that Christians are to be ambassadors for Christ, and they should be out proclaiming the Gospel to the world around us. He stresses the life-style that the evangelist leads should be marked by holiness, and the attitude the evangelist has should be friendly. Grumps and worldly people make terrible evangelists, Little points out, because the goal is to actually show people that the Gospel transforms our lives.How to Give Away your Faith is an extremely practical book--more so than just about any other book on evangelism I can think of. Little divides evangelism up into two categories: one-time encounters (cold evangelism), and on-going encounters (relational evangelism). He then gives specific ideas and observations about each category. For example, he points out that one-time encounters tend to go deeper more quickly, perhaps because of they anonymous nature of the conversation. He then gives lists of ways to facilitate these conversations.For relational evangelism, Little gives helpful examples of how to transition relationships with friends and neighbors into conversations about the Gospel. His examples are challenging, and effective. He gives advice on how to meet neighbors, how to start conversations, and how to challenge people to make decisions for Jesus. He encourages you to consistently ask your friends what their opinion is on things, then listening to their answer. The more you ask, the more they talk, the more likely they will be to listen when you explain the Gospel.He also spends a chapter detailing the content of the Gospel. This book does not present a method-driven approach to evangelism. Unlike most current evangelistic training, Little does not give a \\"memorize these points and have this conversation\\" approach. He gives multiple different outlines, and certainly gives the reader enough training to have a conversation that centers on the Gospel.There are weaknesses to this book. Some of his examples are certainly dated (computers are called \\"thinking machines,\\" and the threat of a nuclear holocaust is mentioned several times; he reminisces about the days when kids played \\"cowboys and Indians\\"). The book closes with chapters on worldliness, weaker brothers, grey areas, devotional life, and secret sins. The content of those chapters is good--especially the weaker brother one--but the connection to the rest of the book is unclear and they seem terribly out of place.It is helpful to remember that this book was written 40 years ago. Little takes a strong stand in favor of Lordship salvation, and also warns against Christians who say that God speaks to them in an audible voice. But he also talks about \\"making the Gospel relevant\\" and gives advice on making listeners \\"more receptive\\" to the Gospel. It is most likely that these words (\\"relevant\\" and \\"receptive\\") had different nuances then, but they still stood out as being unhelpful.Today when you witness (or teach others to), you most likely understand that evangelism is more than plowing through Bible verses and spiritual Laws. When you think of evangelism, you probably think of having conversations with friends and neighbors about the Gospel, and you probably view that as an essential part of Christianity. While How to Give Away your Faith may seem elementary, it is also at least partially responsible for engraining those assumptions into the fabric of today's evangelicalism."},{"Title":"HOW TO GIVE AWAY YOUR FAITH","review":"The book came in new condition as advertised and was the exact title and author that was advertised.

Who does she think she is? Mildred's daughter was a snob that could never accept she had no reason to be.... watching Mildred pull herself up by the bootstraps and making something of her life.... the fact that the romances in this novel made mine look normal.... hearing about LA in the thirties... never knowing what strange, horrific turn Midlred's life would take next.The only drawback was at times the twists and turns became predictable in and of themselves; the idea that you could never get comfortable with the plot was great, but obvious eventually.Great read- nothing horribly complex, but still solid."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"I read about Mildred Pierce in an introduction to another book written by another well-known author. I decided to order it, and it definitely lived up to its billing. To top it off - just a week later the film of Mildred Pierce, starring Joan Crawford, was on television. I watched that through to the end as well.This was a very dark novel, and one which aroused strong feelings in me, and I expect in others as well. It illustrates the extreme relationship a mother has with one of her daughters, even though the daughter is a thoroughly despicable character, even as a child. She is the taker, and the mother continually the giver. But it is so well written, and these personalities so strongly drawn, that when you finish, you will STILL hope that somewhere along the way, the daughter gets what's coming to her. Unfortunately, you have to imagine that, as the book ends with no clue as to what happens in the future to the mother or daughter.In spite of it's being emotionally wrenching, I loved reading this book - and have ordered Double Indemnity by the same author. Hope it is equally engrossing."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"If you watch the movie, please do read the book. The film just skims the book.The story is a 'crime' fiction but not in the conventional sense. The crime isa crime involving the heart vs the mind. Need vs want.

(YOu can only be used with your own permission.) The doormat may slowly wake up to her doormat status but she resists because she is so desperate to win the cold hateful user over. She will never win. And the User will laugh all the way to the bank. The doormat justifies being a doormat and the user knows how to keep her there with her own permission. This confict causes her to lose Bert (who lovse her, but leavess.)Veda is SO much more vile in the book. You want to spit. But then you ask yourselfwhy are the adults allowing her to talk to them the way she does? AH.Veda. She is as one charcter says: a snake. and her mother is a doormat.Mildred is bitten but keeps coming back for more.I thought the book ended well .. not rushed at all as one commentator suggeted.It begs for a sequel. Would Mildred melt once again, if Veda came back? heh!If you feel as though at times YOU are a doormat and want to stop being one, this is a good book for you. If you're a 'Veda' type you'll find it ... to say the least, amusing.(Veda was well just Veda. A parent of such a child would have to learn to simply let her be; kep your distance , and your wallet closed.)"},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"James M. Cain's \\"Mildred Pierce\\" is a noir novel in which the femme fatale is not the mistress, but the daughter. This is a story of a mother's unconditional love for a she-devil child. It is something of a painful reading, because the characters are so terribly vivid that you fell sorry for some, and hate some others.\\"Mildred Pierce\\" is all about character development rather than plot - what doesn't mean there is a narrative. The narrative is developed throughout the characters' arc. There isn't a single flat character in the novel. They all somehow surprises the reader - they change, they may change back, but, at some point, they are different from the beginning.Cain's writing is above the pulp average, it is labored, it is complex and profound. His insights into the human soul bring another layers to the story. He doesn't need to explain much but once his characters acting we can easily follow them, because the interest in them never declines.\\"Mildred Pierce\\" can also be a cautionary tale. Mothers, beware! No matter how blind you are to your kids' fault, they are human and, therefore, likely to commit good and bad acts. Poor Mrs Pierce."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"I was inspired to read Mildred Pierce after hearing Wesltey Strick, screenwriter and novelists, discuss his new novel on Elvis Mitchell's NPR radio show \\"The Treatment.\\" Strick said to get in the mood for his own writing, he reread Mildred Pierce and I was intrigued. I had read some other Cain novels and knew he was a master of terse crime fiction but I wasn't prepared for the psychological insight and complexity evident here. His descriptions of American gaucherie and philistinism are unparalleled. His complexity between the mother and daughter is unforced.The plot, about a Billy Goat husband who leaves his pretty wife for a trashy woman in Southern California circa the Depression, begins simply enough, but spins into penetrating psychological pathology.His ability to capture America's sense of the American Dream and bad taste reminds me of Paula Fox's novella Desperate Characters and a masterful essay by William E. Blundell's \\"My Florida,\\" published in the 2005 edition of The Best American Travel Writing."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"This book is impossible to find in libraries. I was pleased to be able to find it at Amazon.com. I had seen the movie with Joan Crawford over 20 years ago. Typically, most movies are different from the books in their portrayals and &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; is no exception. However, this is a book to be re-read."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"Mildred Pierce proves the old adage that love is blind. Mildred proves that with the men in her life, but even more so with her daughter. Mildred is like many people who can't see the faults in her child, and even when she does she squeezes her eyes even tighter shut. I found this book to be much more captivating than Cain's more popular The Postman Always Rings Twice. This book is timeless, and the characters as believable today as the day they were driven."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"This is a classic story of a family destroyed and a mother's attempt to shield her daughter.

The situation worsens until the climax and Mildred must then choose between herself and her daughter.Always suspenseful and engaging, the characters in Mildred Pierce are very down to earth and believable. Although I am French and not American, I could identify with Mildred, her hopes and her fears.This is a great book and highly entertaining."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"(Audiobook review) I saw the movie \\"Mildred Pierce\\" (many times) well before I listened to this unabridged audio CD. Although the first half of the book is very much like the film, I was riveted to Cain's prose. He has a masterful way of drawing a character with words and vividly brings 30s era California to life. His characters are tough talking, rough around the edges and usually motivated by either money, sex or in this case, a hopeless case of unconditional love. If the book falters, it is the final chapter, which seems to come abruptly with an unsatisfying conclusion. This is perhaps because of the movie, which I have to say was adapted brilliantly and more effectively. I won't go into the details and give the ending away here but it is much different from the film. The narrator (Christine Williams) is good but perhaps a tad shrill and grating when voicing the male characters."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"A remarkable story of human relationships, complexities, perseverance, and weakness!All too often people turn a blind eye to what they refuse to believe, or perhaps can't comprehend - and we see this played out in the interactions of Mildred and her daughter Veda!

Even though I had seen the movie and so knew more or less how the story would unfold (or thought I did), I still couldn't put the book down. The Washington Post said that &quot;James M. Cain is the poet of the hard-boiled school of the American novel,&quot; and that compliment is well deserved. I was immediately drawn into the story and stayed completely absorbed until the last page. As others have mentioned, the book is much darker than the movie, and more complex as well. I went back and read the last chapter over a few times just to savor the ending again. The first time it was so startling that I couldn't quite believe what I had read. This is just one example of the power of Cain's writing. It's simply remarkable."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"I never met a James M. Cain novel I didn't like and this one was no exception. The title is of the lead character who rises to great success during the Depression with a series of restaurants in early California. However, she has one big problem: the daughter she raised alone, Veda. Veda becomes a singer and also a master at deceiving and betraying her mother. Veda does not even consider her mother's spouse, her stepfather, off limits. This showcases the same intense Cain focus on a twisted relationship but this time it is on the mother-daughter relationship, arguably a more powerful one than the lover-lover one. This was made into a movie starring Joan Crawford, who won an Oscar playing Mildred. I thought this film version went too over the top though and veered into being maudlin and soap operaish. Stick with Cain's novel, the far more complex work."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"Mildred Pierce is one of those 'tough as nails, heart of gold' mothers who should an inspiration to all women. She kicks out her dead-beat husband, works her tail off to keep food on the table and her daughters happy, and has the guts/brains to start her own successful business. So what's wrong (and why did James M. Cain bother to write about her)?Unable to face reality, Mildred is the victim of her own blindness to her rotten eldest daughter's ways. Not only is her daughter unappreciative, she actually ridicules her mother as being some uncouth and ignorant embarassment. Mildred's toughness melts when confronting her monster daughter, much to her detriment. While a heartbreaking story overall, the ending is especially moving ... have your hankies ready.Perhaps many folks reading this review has seen the famous film adaption (starring Joan Crawford) of Mildred Pierce. While the film generally carries the intent of James M. Cain's written word, there are several differences. Obviously Hollywood wanted to over-dramatize, or simply invent scenes. As much as I like the movie I enjoyed the book more; I found it to be more personal , intense and believable.Bottom line: required reading by all mothers, strongly recommended to everyone else."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"It's inevitable that most readers should go into this book with the excellent film version starring Joan Crawford in their minds. However, the two are quite different beasts, which is a credit to the strength and originality of both.This is not a crime novel as the film implied, but a tough Depression era story of a woman determined to get by in a world of snobbery and class prejudices that even she herself cannot deny that she holds. When she becomes a single mother, Mildred is ashamed to have to take on a job as a waitress to keep her children in the relatively wealthy lifestyle to which they are accustomed. With nothing more than determination, she becomes the mistress of a restaurant empire and a wealthy businesswoman. But none of this is enough to endear her to her spitfire daughter Veda, whom she both dislikes and passionately admires.It comes as a surprise that the Mildred of Cain's novel is more a Veronica Lake than a Crawford, a short-skirted coquette who uses her physical as well as mental assets to achieve what she needs. More complex is Mildred's relationship with Veda, and the character of Veda herself, a swaggering, overbearing, thoroughly nasty piece of work. If you thought Ann Blyth's Veda was unlikeable, meet this one! It's even more clear here that Mildred's motherly love has turned into unhealthy obsession. Unlike the film, the monster that is Veda is never really exorcised here.It's the ending of the book which lets the rest down. The final quarter seems hasty - it smacks of an author who is getting a little tired of his characters and has run out of hoops for them to jump through. And while the book closes on a bleak sort of denouement, no real sense of conclusion or capitulation is gained. It should be noted that the ending is considerably different to that of the film, which, to my mind, ended things in a more satisfying matter - which admittedly had a classic crime story structure to its advantage.Nevertheless, Cain's plain-spoken, tough-minded style and his talents as a storyteller make this a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"James M. Cain's reputation as a master of the noir genre rests largely on his phenomenally grim 1934 story &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice,&quot; 1935's &quot;Double Indemnity,&quot; and this 1941 classic &quot;Mildred Pierce.&quot; No other noir writer's reputation-whether Raymond Chandler, Dashiell Hammett, or Cornell Woolrich-rests on only two or three stories. How is it possible to sustain a literary legacy based on two, maybe three stories that you could read in three single sittings? Think movies. You can thank Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler for Cain's enduring legacy. These two guys collaborated on the script for &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; the film, a film that has since become one of the classics of American cinema. And don't forget Joan Crawford won an Oscar for her work in the screen version of &quot;Mildred Pierce.&quot; Too, if memory serves correctly, there are two film versions of &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice,&quot; one of them starring Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange. If I were a writer, I wouldn't be too enthusiastic that my legacy rested on film versions of my stories. From what I've read of the noir masters, Cain isn't nearly as good of a storyteller as Chandler, Hammett, or Woolrich. He isn't as good as Jim Thompson or David Goodis either, for that matter. He's still good, though.Fortunately, although it isn't as noir as &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; or &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice,&quot; &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; is a wonderful story embodying several key elements of the noir genre. The novel is the story of Mildred Pierce, a young, leggy housewife and mother in California trying to make the best of a bad situation during the Great Depression. Like millions of other Americans during those trying times, Mildred's financial situation falters when her husband Bert's unemployment threatens to cost the family their home. Since Bert is also cheating on his wife, Mildred eventually forces her man to permanently leave. This situation leaves our heroine caring for her two children, Veda and Moira, without a source of income. Thanks to a helpful neighbor mixed up in bootlegging, a Mrs. Gessler, Mildred obtains enough support until she finally lands employment as a waitress at a Los Angeles hash house. Pierce is a tough lady, full of pride and ideals about what a woman should do in life, but economic uncertainty forces her to make tough choices. Her no nonsense attitude, along with her abilities as a fine cook, soon allows the woman to build a small restaurant/pie shop. A few more years of hard work finds Mildred with three restaurants and a bursting bank account in a time when people still stand in bread lines. She's a success story.Cain is not content to allow his readers to bask in the glow of Mildred's success. As tough of a woman as she is, as careful about business as she is, Mildred Pierce has two problems that threaten to permanently destroy her life. The first problem is Veda, Pierce's eldest daughter. This girl is your archetypical snob, a young lady so enamored of the finer things in life that she will stop at nothing to obtain social position and wealth. Mildred recognizes her daughter's failings, but insists on doting on her while showering the girl with expensive gifts. Despite all the attentions she receives, Veda loathes her mother. She considers the idea of Mildred working in a restaurant unconscionable, and constantly works behind the scenes to heap scorn upon her mother. The second problem involves men. Mildred Pierce cannot seem to find a good man, as she soon discovers after hooking up with a somewhat wealthy loafer and snob named Monty Beragon. It isn't too long before Veda and Monty hit it off to the everlasting detriment of Mildred. Although both depend on Pierce for money, they can't stand her seemingly lowly status and plebian manners. You can rest assured that events will soon reach a frightful denouement, one loaded with shattering emotional conflicts that wreck lives and destroy relationships.&quot;Mildred Pierce,&quot; in my opinion, is even better than Cain's noir novellas &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; and &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice.&quot; You won't find a crime like murder anywhere in the story, nothing requiring a crafty cover up or the presence of law enforcement officials. The book instead focuses on the unhealthy relationship between a mother and a daughter both proud and spoiled in their own ways. In many ways, this destructive relationship is worse than the illicit affairs of the protagonists in the previously mentioned two books: Mildred and Veda hurt each other innumerable times, and go on hurting each other until the bitter end whereas Cain's other memorable characters quickly reach a point of no return. There is no end to the emotional suffering of the characters in this story, although despite what other readers have thought the conclusion does hold out a glimmer of hope that Mildred will overcome her weaknesses and rebuild her shattered life.Don't worry about the lack of a juicy crime, though, since other aspects of the story intrigue immensely. Mildred Pierce as a character is quite wonderful; you simply can't help but like the lady despite her flaws. Conversely, Veda as drawn by Cain is one of the great evil characters of literature. You'll gape at her soulless machinations, wondering how she gets away with such despicable behaviors and fervently hoping for a serious comeuppance. Too, it's nice to get a look at pre-World War II California, an atmosphere that Cain makes excellent use of throughout the story. I recommend heartily that all beginning Cain fans read &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; alongside his two other masterworks. Sadly, it seems many of his readers tend to overlook this non-noir noir classic. I'm glad I didn't."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"I'm a big fan of Hammett, Chandler, Ellory, and a few others who can take you inside the minds of people you'd never want to meet, yet might resemble a little too much. But as time goes by I'm beginning to lean towards Cain as the master of the noir genre, and this as his masterpiece.As much as people love the Curtiz/Crawford film, its wellspring is overall a much finer, deeper work. Where the movie panders to its audience by including a murder that doesn't occur here (and needn't), Cain never once takes the easy route of administering easy moments of \\"justice\\" (read enough noir and that word will never seem the same...). He knows how people work, and it ain't very pretty most of the time, and he ain't afeared that we'll be unentertained when things go all too realistically.Our heroine here is in most respects a very sympathetic lady, and we start pulling for her right out of the gate. But Cain doesn't let us off that easy. He also shows Mildred's various flaws, the fatal one being her obsessive love/worship/need for the respect of her daughter Veda. After a while any sane reader has to start disliking Mildred a bit for this myopia, and wondering how a woman so bright in other matters can be so blind regarding her daughter. Yet Cain paints her portrait so thoroughly, blemishes and all, that we must eventually forgive her this tragic blindness and thus suffer with her as she is mistreated ever more hideously by her demon progeny.Veda is so ruthless, and ruthlessly portrayed, that it gets a bit much at times, and we begin to lust for her comeuppance. What makes Cain so intensely unforgiving, and accurate, is that she never gets it. It's a bit hard to take for those of us used to neat, clean endings and summarily dispensed justice, but it rings all too true, and that's the hallmark of this genre. Add to that Cain's sharp eye for self-serving action and painfully sharp ear for the motives lurking beneath our everyday banter, and you've got a book where no one is a hero and everyone is all too human, as good sides mingle with bad sides until we're forced to look at ourselves a little more unflinchingly.And that's a sign of great art.Cain delivers the goods here in so many ways, and his feel for the mind of women is very rare among male writers, if the praise of so many women for his works is anything to go by. He surely has no fear of showing many men for the callow bums we can be, and also showing how it is that women can be taken in by the charm of many a cad. He also sees through the vanity of the female, and how it can easily become an Achilles heel. No one is innocent in Cain's worlds.All that said, this isn't exactly what I'd call a \\"satisfying read\\". It's a little too accurate about homo sap in general, and can be unnerving in its harsh portrayal of our endless deceit and egotism. But if you like literature because you like to learn more about yourself, and us, and the weirdness that we hath wrought upon each other and this world, James M. Cain is waiting for you.And Mildred Pierce is a dame you'll never forget."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"Required reading for all natives and denizens of Los Angeles. A dark romp thru our fair city. Accompany Mildred as she traverses LA's golden past- shop with her at Bullocks Wilshire, sweat bullets in the passenger seat as she navigates the Glendale freeway during the flood of 1938, pine for Pasadena, pray that her girls get into Marlborough, imagine singing at the Hollywood Bowl, and marvel as our heroine with the great gams builds an empire out of chicken and waffles - of all things! Mildred is no ordinary pie maker, she's Los Angeles incarnate. Joan Crawford may have won an Oscar for her portrayal in 1945, but Cain's 1941 novel more evenly balances Mildred's capacity for good against a city steeped in bad seeds. And while the film presents Mildred's daughter, Veda, as simply spoiled and shrill, Cain's study presents her as the fully fleshed out viper to which all true divas secretly aspire. Read it and weep. ~ Lili N. Barsha 5/2008"},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"Probably more famous as a celebrated 1945 movie starring Joan Crawford,Mildred Pierce (Keepcase)James Cain's novel \\"Mildred Pierce\\" (1941)is set in the gritty world of Depression-era Los Angeles in the 1930s. Cain is famous for the noir writing of his shorter and earlier novels, \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\" and \\"Double Indemnity\\", which also became classic films. Unlike these books, \\"Mildred Pierce\\" does not involve the murder of a husband by his wife and her lover, but it includes and expands upon the themes of sex, greed, and class of these two earlier books. It also portrays a world of pervasive philistinism. Unlike its predecessors, much of the focus of \\"Mildred Pierce\\" is on the mother-daughter relationship and upon ingratitude. Although related in the third person (unlike the confessional first-person narratives of Postman and Double Indemnity) in a clipped, hard-boiled tone, the novel is an introspective character study of its heroine.When the book begins, Mildred and her husband Bert are living in a Glendale, California in a middle-class home that the couple can no longer afford. The marriage is breaking up as a result of Bert's affair with a woman named (Maggie) Mrs. Biederhoff, who appears to have been widdowed for about a year. Mildred is left with the job of raising two young daughters, Ray, 7 and Vera, 11, faced with a heavy mortgage, no job, and no skills other that her ability to bake pies. Mildred also has a lovely figure and gorgeous legs. She soon falls into a relationship with Wally, an unscrupulous lawyer and former business associate of her husband. But Mildred has ambitions. At first she proudly spurns domestic work, but she eventually takes a job as a waitress in a hash house, where customers grope her legs but where she determines to learn the business and make something of herself. Mildred uses what she learns at the hash house and her skills as a baker to open her own restaurant and, eventually, a chain of restaurants, which succeed aided by the repeal of Prohibition.Besides showing Mildred's rise as a woman entrepreneur, Cain shows her sexual relationships with Wally and with a rich idler named Monty who loses his fortune during the Depression. Monty sponges off Mildred, and his interest in her is limited to sex and to her body. Mildred maintains through most of the book an ambiguous relationship with Bert, whom she divorces to secure the property she needs for her restaurant. Of the two daughters, Veda gets most of her mother's attention, for her apparent musical talent and her snobbery. Veda mocks her mother and spurns her love, which Mildred want to gain at all costs. Mid-way in the novel, after a torrid weekend affair between Monty and Mildred, the younger daughter Ray dies from an infection caught at seaside. Her death and funeral are portrayed in detail. Mildred redoubles her efforts with Veda and with Veda's piano lessons.Among many other things, Cain portrays the harsh competitive side of the world of classical music when Veda learns from a reputed conductor and teacher, Treviso, in no uncertain terms that she has no talent for the piano. Shortly thereafter, however, Veda becomes a famous singer. In an astonishing scene between Treviso and Mildred, Treviso compares Veda to a poisonous coral snake with no thought of anything but herself. He advises Mildred to stay away from her daughter. This is advice that few mothers would take. The relationship between Mildred, Veda, Monty and Bert leads the novel to a crashing climax and ending.The focus of the novel is on Mildred, but the novel portrays well many secondary characters. Broadly, the characters in Cain's world are driven by lust and money. There is also a strong component of class jealousy. The male characters, including Bert, Wally, Monty, and a young man named Sam, who is the victim of an extortionate scheme of Veda's are weak, lazy characters, ruled by their sex drives. Mildred is a much more complex character than any of the men. For all her faults and her ultimate downfall in the novel, Cain evokes sympathy for her. Some of the other women, including Mildred's friend Ida, from her hash house days, and her neighbor Mrs. Gessler, receive convincing-multi-faceted tough portrayals. Besides showing character, \\"Mildred Pierce\\" has a strong sense of place in showing Southern California in the 1930s. The book includes an extraordinary scene of a furious rainstorm which Mildred braves in her attempt to break up with Monty who is siphoning off her money and her ambitions.\\"Mildred Pierce\\" is a dark portrayal of people and place. It succeeds through its unremitting emphasis of sex, greed and human weakness and through its picture of Mildred. Strong but flawed female characters are relatively rare in American literature, particularly of Cain's time. This is a book that deserves to be read and remembered.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"Having loved the film, I looked forward to reading this classic novel upon which the film was based. I must say, just as the movie kept me riveted to the screen, the book likewise kept me riveted to its pages. Darker and even more compelling than the film, the author tells the story of Mildred Pierce, a divorcee with two children who is caught in the throes of the depression of the 1930s but manages to make something of herself.Professionally successful, Mildred has a talent for picking the wrong men and an irrational devotion to her eldest daughter, Veda, who is morally twisted and totally monstrous. Unfortunately, Mildred does not see her daughter for what she truly is, until it is too late.Masterfully written and thematically complex, the writing is intense, hard-boiled, and, though redolent of a bygone age, as relevant today as when it was first written. There is an undercurrent of a permeating malaise throughout the book that culminates in a shattering climax. Believe me, you will feel Mildred Pierce's pain, as she discovers how sharper than a serpent's tooth it is to have a thankless child, when Veda delivers the unkindest cut of all. This book is a winner and a true American classic. Bravo!"},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"There are only two words to describe this book: wow and bravo. Each of its 17 chapters is a compelling mini masterpiece of storytelling.The title character is a young financially challenged mother who is forced to fend for herself in the decidedly unfriendly milieu of Depression era Los Angeles. After considerable struggle and plenty of hard work, Mildred eventually becomes a successful business woman.But while Mildred is achieving economic independence, her daughter Veda, a precocious 11 year old at the novel's onset, matures into a hateful, greedy young adult who makes her mother's life a living hell.Author James Cain has offered up a virtuoso performance in the writing of this wonderful novel. Chapter 1 is pure genius. It starts off with images of perfect domesticity; a husband doing yardwork and a wife decorating a cake. Then it suddenly spirals downward into the abyss of irretrievable family break-up. Each subsequent chapter is masterfully built on the one before to paint a vivid picture of Mildred's world as she wends her way through the obstacle course that is her life.Mildred Pierce is a gripping, page turner of a novel. An enthusiastic 5 stars."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"An interesting but dated account of poor Mildred's climb to the top. The move has more impact and more drama but the book is interesting in that Mildred uses sex to advance her career. The Vida of movie fame is a way more interesting character. Not a bad read but if you're expecting the same story as the famous Joan Crawford movie, you're in for a disappointment."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"While Mildred Pierce is not one of Cain's most famous books I found it surprisingly engaging and liked it a lot more than I thought I would. Mildred Pierce is a middle-class, married woman in the 1930s. Her husband is in financial straits (not unusual for a family during the Great Depression) and he find relief in the arms of, surprise surprise, another woman. When Mildred finds out about the affair she's had enough and asks her husband to leave. Now a \\"grass widow\\" with two children to raise on her own and no income with which to do so Mildred tries to \\"hook herself a man\\" a failed venture she, for some reason, continues throughout the rest of the book. Cain takes us on Mildred's job search as she travels from department store to department store apply for jobs that don't exist with hundreds (if not thousands) of other unemployed women. Finally Mildred falls into a job as a waitress and starts to make a little money, supplemented by her pie baking business. In addition to Mildred's job struggles and man-hunt Cain adds another layer to his story, that of Veda, Mildred's oldest daughter. After Mildred's youngest daughter dies Veda becomes her whole world and we see Mildred burying herself in debt to please her snobbish, purely unlikable daughter. As the book twists to its expected but still astounding conclusion Mildred becomes less of a heroine, less of an \\"I can do it\\" woman, and turns into a fragile woman betrayed by the only thing she ever loved.As a whole Mildred Pierce is simplistic. The plot isn't totally unique, the twists aren't unexpected. It's just the story of a woman trying to find her way in the world while raising her child. Yet something about Cain's way with words add a depth to this character that a lesser author wouldn't have been capable of. This isn't your average \\"struggling-single-mom-looking-for-love\\" chick lit. Even though you don't have gangsters, rum runners, or private dicks this novel is full of those noir characteristics any \\"dime-store\\" detective novel fan would love. Mildred has spirit, just not enough to overcome her flaws, to some extent I think you could make the argument Mildred Cain is a tragic hero(ine). (At least using the most basic definition of the term). She loves her daughter almost obsessively, but in a way that makes you feel sorry for her rather than her daughter. Veda doesn't realize how lucky she is and you want to scream at Mildred to let her daughter go and never come back. Instead Mildred does what any other loving mother would. She fights with her daughter, hates her at times, but always wants to find a way to bring her daughter back into her life. I couldn't stand Mildred for some of the stupid things she did, but at the same time couldn't helping seeing how realistic they were. While Mildred might be a frustrating character you can't help but admit she feels human. Veda, on the other hand, feels anything but.There isn't much mystery or intrigue in Mildred Pierce but it moves fairly quickly for the kind of book it is. Definitely falling into the \\"femme fatale\\" noir category it may not appeal to those readers who aren't interested in that genre but fans of Great Depression drama won't be disappointed. Now, don't get me wrong, when I say this book is well written I'm saying this in the context of the noir-genre, so don't pick it up expecting a brilliantly written human interest story in literary-fiction style because you'll be disappointed. This book is gritty, dark, poignant, and heartbreaking in a way that reminds you of black and white movies and flickering street lights."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"Mildred Pierce is a young mother with two children, and he husband is seeing another woman. She decides he should move out, but she cannot support herself or her girls with no job, so she reluctantly searches for work. Because of her experience baking and selling pies, she finds food service, and her pride makes her lie to eldest daughter Veda who looks down upon her mother for working. Mildred tells her she is only learning the industry so she can start her own restaurant, and the because of the pressure to impress Veda, she does.For those who have seen the Joan Crawford film of the same title, this book will be a surprise because it plays out quite differently. It is much more about the relationship between Mildred and Veda and the way Veda forces change in Mildred who is \\"decidedly middle class.\\" There is less action and suspense and more development of the relationships between the characters.This book is also noteworthy because it is written by a man who specialized in suspenseful yarns that turned into great noir movies. This one portrays a very realistic series of woman who, though flawed, are strong and likable."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"This was an interesting twist on the original Mildred Pierce. Kate Winslet is not Joan Crawford, but she did a good job."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"Mildred Pierce is a true masterpiece. The title character has an iron will, which is completely neutralized by her overwhelming maternal instinct to unconditionally love and provide for her children. But because so many of the people she surrounds herslf with belittle her, she does not realize her own worth. Her desire for the good opinion and affection of those who scorn her is her one flaw. It makes an otherwise strong woman vulnerable. And this vulnerability leads her to make bad choices. Over and over, she is humbled, mocked, scorned and riduculed, overtly by her own daughter, and less obviously by her boyfriend. Yet despite it all, she manages to start a business during the Great Depression which pulls her out of poverty to give a better life to the one person in her life who is least deserving of it. She is entirely too human. Any woman could find herself in the same situation, and given the same circumstances, many women (including myself) would likely make the same ill-advised choices.For me, the mark of an exceptional book is one I can't stop thinking about after I've finished it, and this is most certainly true of Mildred Pierce. . . .** WARNING *** * * SPOILERS * * ** * * * DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK YET * * * *Did Mildred regret remarrying Bert after the reason for doing so ceased to exist? I got the distinct impression that she didn't really love Bert, or Monty for that matter. She felt affection for Bert, and physical attraction to Monty, but did she really want to be with either one of them?And assuming that Veda kicked Monty to the curb as soon as she found herself a rich man (or got tired of him spending her money), would Monty feel remorseful about how he treated Mildred? If he had come knocking on her door, either to apologize or attempt to reconcile, would Mildred have given him opportunity to speak? I suspect she would have, because she really didn't have it in her snub someone who appeared penitent (how many times did Veda take advantage of Mildred's compassion). Without doubt, Mildred would have given Veda another chance, despite her declaration that she not come back at the end of the novel."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"Cain's 1941 materialist, melodramatic novel describes building up and losing a restaurant business in southern California during the 1930s Depression in the context of a mother-daughter affair of love, ego-idealism, and reptilian cruelty and ambition. The female body and voice are major preoccupations in the story, along with ruthlessness, the workings of capitalism, marriages, shame, class-consciousness, and failure. The book is primarily character-driven, and focused on analyzing working-class female psychology when men cannot get work; but the main point seems to be that female ambition and a mother's love for her daughter can destroy a marriage, leaving dad to pick up the pieces. This message gets announced in the opening image of the novel as Mr. Pierce shores up avocado trees in his yard against the anticipated weight of ripening fruit. Veda, the musical daughter-from-hell, becomes a fetishized object of desire. The book adds up to an account of costs of achievement with detailed description of who pays and why. Social influences of the 1929 stock-market crash, Prohibition, and Roosevelt era politics help to create this peculiarly American tragedy of snobbery and misplaced idealism."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"Having watched the DVD of this book I was keen to read the story. The detail of the times and the strength of characters made this a wonderful read. The DVD does not and cannot give the depth and breadth of the writing.

I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"I bought this book for my mother and she loves it! When I gave it to her, she got so happy.

It's true literature. I will be going back to reread so I can analyze the writer's craft. It's full of irony, twists, and interesting characters."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"Most of us know \\"Mildred Pierce\\" through the 1945 Joan Crawford movie of the same name, and HBO has produced their version of \\"Mildred Pierce,\\" but many may not have realized both versions of \\"Mildred Pierce\\" are based on the novel by James M. Cain, I know I wasn't, so I took the opportunity to see what Cain's novel was like.If you are familiar with the plot of the 1945 movie, the story is essentially the same, although the novel is more linear and doesn't have the noir elements of the movie. Mildred Pierce, a \`grass widow,' which is depression era parlance for a divorced woman, needs to support her family of two children because her husband can't find a job and is carrying out an affair with a married woman. Mildred finds she only has skills enough for restaurant work and making pies. She quickly learns the restaurant business and opens her own restaurant, which in short order becomes very successful. Her daughter Veda, who seems to have been born a snob, continually humiliates Mildred and those around her she considers of a lower social status, (where or why Veda feels this way we're never told) shows an interest in and talent for playing the piano and as she grows older becomes an operatic singer. On the eve of opening her first restaurant Mildred meets, and has an affair with Monty Beragon, a faded aristocrat who's fortune's are in decline.Cain who was a contemporary of Ernest Hemingway and like Hemingway worked as a journalist. Cain was obviously influenced by realism and a journalistic approach of who, what, where, and how to novel writing. A style that leads \\"Mildred Pierce\\" to a lot of shortcomings. With it's roots in realism \\"Mildred Pierce\\" can at times can read like a restaurant procedural. No dramatic tension is built up, there's not much action, and not much internal drama, denouement happens but without a real climax, it feels flat, like a painting without dimension.There's no character development to speak of. Even though the novel is titled \\"Mildred Pierce\\" and centers on about 8 years of her life we learn nothing of Mildred beyond what happens in the story. Veda who is Mildred's major antagonist, literally as well as in the literary sense, the closest we come to being given an explanation of where Veda's snobbish attitude comes from is early in the novel when we're told Mildred considers Veda to have some great talent, something Mildred feels about herself, and something Mildred also has no evidence of, in either Veda or herself.Cain's lack of character development leaves many of the characters a blank slate leaving the reader to draw conclusions about the characters with little or no backing support. And it makes one wonder if Cain intended them or if the reader is reading too much into the plot.We can easily see where Veda gets her attitude from, Mildred. It is Mildred who throws Bert out because his business failed and he didn't deliver an anticipated fur coat. It is Mildred who, running out of money for her family, chafes at the prospect of having to take a job where she has to wear a uniform. After Mildred does take a job in a restaurant her pride won't allow her to acknowledge it and she hides her uniform from her children. When Veda does discover the uniform and the truth, she wields it as a complaint against Mildred. Did Cain intended for us to learn about Mildred through Veda? Is Veda supposed to be a mirror of Mildred? When Veda learns she isn't getting a piano for Christmas she rebels against Mildred, an echo of Mildred of throwing Bert out.There's very little information, background or insight into Bert. We're told that he made a lot of money in real estate, developing the subdivision that they live in, and one of the streets bears the Pierce name. Why over the course of years does he remain available to Mildred? Yes, they have children and Bert does seem to have an enlightened attitude towards remaining in the children's lives, but he also makes himself emotionally available to Mildred. Could it be we don't know that much about Bert simply because Mildred wasn't that interested in Bert aside from what he could give her?Is Monty sort of another mirror? What Veda could have been, a spoiled snob with a hedonistic attitude but essentially harmless. But that then begs the question what is the difference between Monty and Veda? What made Veda so venomous? Or is Monty just another ineffectual Cain male?Part of the appeal and longevity of \\"Mildred Pierce,\\" especially to women, is because of it's inferred proto-feminist elements. All the men seem incapable of finding work or engaging in constructive pursuits. Bert's fortunes have already been mentioned. Monty seems quite happy to take Mildred's money and be a kept man. Even Wally, who is the most employed male character in \\"Mildred Pierce\\", is a lawyer of questionable ethics. This reversal of stereotypes from a male writer of Cain's generation is highly unusual. The closest we come to male sexism is the music teacher, Treviso's assertion that Veda is the way she is because she's a coloratura soprano.In various synopsis' of \\"Mildred Pierce\\" she is credited with ambition, creating her pie business and a string of restaurant's through hard work. But is Mildred ambitious? \\"Mildred Pierce\\" does depict scenes of Mildred succeeding through hard work and educating herself on the restaurant business. But her first idea to support after kicking Bert out, is to try and become a kept woman. Throughout the book at moments when Mildred needs something that Bert has, and while she may momentarily feel guilty about \\"picking Bert's bones\\", she goes ahead and takes what she wants.Or is \\"Mildred Pierce\\" a post-depression/post-war morality tale? Mildred in the end discovers love may have been the answer to all her problems. That the avaricious pursuit of money and using it to try and control the men in her life, lead to where all morality tales have since Greek Tragedy, the downfall of the one trying to avert tragedy.\\"Mildred Pierce\\" is a portrait, in the fine art sense. In something like the \\"Mona Lisa\\" or \\"Whistler's Mother,\\" we see a portrait of a woman and while we may wonder at who the subject of the painting may have been, we still accept it at face value as a work of art. The tone and realism behind \\"Mildred Pierce\\" is reminiscent of an Edward Hopper painting.Although, a lot of the shortcomings of \\"Mildred Pierce\\" and Cain's writing bothered me, and that may be because of the separation in time from the era and world in which \\"Mildred Pierce\\" was created, or some of the antique language Cain uses, I still found myself interested in the story and kept reading because it involved me to the point that I wanted to see what would happen next."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"My first introduction to this story was seeing the description of the original film on cable. I never took time to watch the movie or read the book. However, the previews of the miniseries on HBO, grabbed me and I bought the book from Amazon. Although the story's setting is an era that feels like long ago, it was a surprisingly current tale. It demonstrates the complexity of womanhood - balancing the responsibilities of family against one's own talents and desires. It causes one to analyze the consequences of navigating that balance. Mildred is a great heroine, in my opinion, and one that all women should read about to reflect on their own inner strengths that my be dormant. The relationship between Mildred and her eldest daughter was great to analyze.

It's funny to think about the fact that it was written by a man - what must he think of us gals? I haven't really gotten into analyzing it to that depth, but maybe one day I will and this review might embarrass me. I better cut it short. The book is fantastic. The mini-series is great.

I was actually astonished he could pull off a whole book from a woman's point of view.The book is not melodramatic--Joan Crawford's movie version is very melodramatic. The book is a fascinating view of the hardship of a 1940's single mother and her singular obsession with her daughter, Veda. Veda matches Mildred's obsession with obnoxiousness.

The content of this book was a little unusual for the 1940s. I was surprised that the book has a totally different ending than the movie. I have seen the movie several times, and decided to read the book. I am so glad I did, and my husband really enjoyed this book too. Mildred is a great character. She was a woman before her time. Stepping out to have her own business. Not too many women in those times would have had the courage to do such a thing. Her daughter, Veda, is a BRAT. Mildred is a \\"disney land\\" parent. She thinks the more she gives the more her daughter will love her. This is a good example for divorced parents today.

Cain is one of the fathers of the noir novel (along with Hammet and Chandler) with novels as \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\" and \\"Double Indemnity\\" that were soon turned into films and became cornerstones of the noir cinema, as it did the cinematographic version of Mildred Pierce.Mildred Pierce is not, however, a noir novel strictu senso. There is no detective, and if there is any crime it is not particularly remarkable, the characters don't take a walk in the wild side or through the asphalt jungle. The plot tells the story of Mildred, a still young woman trying to make ends meet after divorcing his former middle class husband, now unemployed due to the Depression. In her quest for a future (from proud wife to diner waitress to fast-food entrepreneur) she has to deal with her pride, her pretentious and viperous daughter, her decadent playboy lover and the close social categories of the 30's.For some it could be an elaborated melodrama, but Mildred Pierce reads like a noir. The wisecrack-saturated dialogues are those of a hardboiled crime novels, as are the social schemas. Finally, Cain discovers settings that latter became classics of the Californian and American noir imaginary: the diners, the first fast food chains, and the posh restaurants by the sea.Mildred Pierce is a great book and a portrait of a time.

My gut reaction to this story is it's a cautionary tale about child/parent relationships. Mildred's relationship with her daughter Vera is completely flawed. Mildred spends the entire book trying to earn Vera's respect. She gives in to Vera's every whim and actually spoils her rotten. Vera is cold, calculating and disrespectful towards her mother. Mildred makes excuses for Vera's behavior, even when it's completely inexcusable. Just because you have a child, doesn't mean this child will love or respect you. Also, \\"spare the rod, spoil the child\\" comes to mind. Not that Vera should have been actually beaten, but she needed to learn some hard lessons. Vera is treated like a princess and Mildred is her servant.Mildred is not a complete victim in the story. In fact, where she is a victim, she is a victim of her own folly. On a whole, she is a strong woman with many faults. She can also be manipulative, just not in the cruel way that Vera operates.I loved that the story was set in my hometown of Glendale...but I wish that they had more positive things to say about it!

The number of racy scenes made it scandalous, as well as the personal life of Mildred. This book tells about life then from its background details. It also educates about starting a small business. Adopting a life of leisure can be poisonous to a small business owner. Most of all it is a warning about certain personality types; you may encounter them in your life.

How did Cain do it? Any of it? His insight into what one reader called \\"the blindness of mother love\\" is astonishing. And the plot! It's one of the most well-crafted, surprising, fully-connected-to-characterization-and-setting plots, like a Willa Cather novel with a hard-boiled narrative voice. It's a much richer, more compelling, novel than the Postman Always Rings Twice, Cain's most famous work. When I finished reading the book I wanted to read it again, backwards, to see how it was constructed.I felt the same way when I finished reading Atonement.Of course that means I'd have to read the last chapter twice in a short period of time, and the last chapter is the one flaw. It's like Cain shrugs his shoulders and says he really wasn't writing a great American novel, that it was all about the plot and not the characters all along. So it has this Perry Mason ending.

She knows better --- he's going to see his mistress \\"and then unbutton that red dress she's always wearing without any brassieres under it.\\" But it's not the mistress that annoys her most. It's the way, in 1931, he's without work and not exactly looking for any.So far, so ordinary.Then the author steps in: \\"They spoke quickly, as though they were saying things that scalded their mouths, and had to cooled with spit. \\"That's James M. Cain, folks, the master of the quick, dark truth.When Cain wrote \\"Mildred Pierce,\\" his fame and fortune were assured. In the 1930s, he had published \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\" and \\"Double Indemnity.\\" These two short, brutal novels had scandalized the bluenoses and become bestsellers. He'd found a formula that, in a repressed culture, never fails --- serving up hot, illicit sex and then punishing the lovers.In \\"Mildred Pierce,\\" he adapted the formula and, in the process, wrote what I believe is his best novel. Here the shapely, sexy woman is a wife and mother who wants to stay married. She throws her husband out as a statement of self-respect. It's a costly gesture. As a friend says, \\"You've joined the biggest army on earth. You're the great American institution that never gets mentioned on Fourth of July --- a grass widow with two small children to support. The dirty bastards.\\"Mildred's assets are few. She can bake. And she's got a bod for sin. \\"Her brassiere ballooned a little, with an extremely seductive burden.\\" Although she's got great gams, she feels she's slightly bow-legged, so she takes short steps when she walks. To great effect --- \\"her bottom twitched in a wholly provocative way.\\"It's not long before two realities collide. She has no trouble finding a lover (and discovering that she enjoys sex) --- but it's impossible to get a job. For one thing, she is without qualifications. For another, she fears that her eldest daughter, the beautiful and haughty Veda, will scorn her if she wears a waitress's uniform or becomes a clerk in a store.But a waitress she becomes. And money flows in. Veda is, as expected, horrified. She says Mildred has \\"degraded\\" the family. Mildred's response: She spanks Veda silly. To no point. Veda crawls to a couch, laughs and whispers: \\"A waitress.\\"It is then that Mildred realizes that she fears her daughter's judgment, \\"her snobbery, her contempt, her unbreakable spirit.\\" She resolves to open a restaurant, to be a waitress no more. And she thanks her daughter for prodding her to aim higher: \\"We'll have something. And it'll all be on account of you. Every good thing that happens is on account of you, if Mother only had the good sense to know it.\\"On the eve of the opening of Mildred's restaurant, she spends the weekend with a society swell and becomes his lover. Back home, her younger daughter has spiked a fever and is in the hospital. The death scene is terrible. Even worse is Mildred's reaction: Thank God it wasn't Veda.Death and birth collide: As she buries her child, Mildred opens her restaurant. It's a great success. But we have half a book to go, and this half is a slow-mo train wreck --- the story of Veda's evil ways, her schemes to escape her mother and Mildred's shameless effort to win her love.You think your kids have foul, disrespectful mouths? Listen to Veda: \\"With this money I can get away from you. From you and your chickens and your pies and your kitchens and everything that smells of grease. I can get away from this shack with its cheap furniture. And this town and its dollar days, and its women that wear uniforms and its men that wear overalls.\\"Through it all, Mildred is Mother Courage. Her will and her work ethic dazzle. But can Veda be redeemed?In the movie --- directed by Michael (\\"Casablanca\\") Curtiz and starring Joan Crawford, her shoulders so padded she could be a linebacker --- the story is changed for greater dramatic effect. In the book, there's no need; this time, the female is punished and punished and punished, though she's done nothing to deserve it.\\"Mildred Pierce\\" is twice as long as \\"Postman\\" and \\"Double Indemnity\\" --- and, say I, twice as satisfying. Face it, you're not likely to take a married lover and then kill his/her spouse. But most parents have, at one time or another, a child whose ingratitude is sharper than a serpent's tooth. Well, here's the worst case --- read it and weep for Mildred, then count your blessings."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"I re-read this novel after recently seeing the movie again. I remembered that Cain's novel felt darker and dingier than the movie, but I had forgotten how different the novel was.Mildred Pierce was filmed at a time when Hollywood still needed to punish evil. James M Cain knew that evil frequently fares quite well in the world.The movie is a lot of fun all on its own, but don't confuse it with the much more complex novel."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"I must have watched the original movie version with Joan Crawford a dozen times in my life, and I loved it except for the one line Crawford delivers at the bedside of her dead daughter: \\"I will never forget you!...\\". I always cringed at that moment. Clearly, whoever wrote that line was not a parent, nor was Crawford or she would never have accepted to say it.I never considered reading the novel until the new adaptation with Kate Winslet came out. I rented it out at Netflix and was quite pleased with the result, though a little mystified by the differences in the two versions. I decided to borrow the audio book through our library network and was amazed to discover how truer to the novel this newest TV version was, right down to the dialogs. I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Mildred Pierce\\", greatly admired the narrative, and the way Cain was able to bring Mildred to life so convincingly, with her many strengths and flaws.Having worked all my life to support myself financially, I initially despised Mildred for looking down at a position that would have enabled her to support herself and her two daughters quite honorably, but in the end, it turned out to be a smart decision considering her future as a career woman. I cannot imagine why anyone would turn their nose down at a working woman and found Monty downright despicable for accepting Mildred's money, but despising her nonetheless. As for her relationship to Veda, again, it is well observed, somewhat disturbing and ultimately very sad. I heartily recommend this novel as a solid drama without the soul searching tedium of some modern books."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"Although this book is set in the 1930s depression, eighty years on and it fits extremely well into current climates. I for one love reading about strong women, women with the odds stacked against them, because when their up against it, their sharp wits for survival kick in. The lead fiction character in this book Mildred Pierce shows us she's all woman, who also works to the best of her ability under pressure. Mildred separates from her unfaithful, unemployed husband and sets out to support herself and her children. After a difficult search she finds a job as a waitress, but she worries that it is beneath her middle-class station. More than that, she worries that her ambitious and increasingly pretentious elder daughter, Veda, will think her new job demeaning. Mildred expands on her pie-selling business with work she comes across success, but in life failure seems so close to the edge. Veda enjoys her mother's newfound financial success but increasingly turns ungrateful, demanding more from her hard working mother while openly condemning her and anyone who must work for a living.First time reading this book, have not seen the HBO miniseries but I have seen the 1945 film with Joan Crawford, both under the same name as the book, but I found the book coming from another angle, less violence, different in many ways and hands down as always the best. This is a powerful story line, focusing very strongly on the mother, daughter relationship. Mildred Pierce aspirations are not for herself but for her children; she doesn't want to be rich so much as she wants them to feel entitled. She's a great believer in womens rights, but she knows that, as second-class citizens, women can raise themselves up only through work. Mildred works hard so that Veda can realize her dreams. But Veda is more conventional than her mother and more of a performer; the only audience that interests her is male, and she sets out to upstage her mother with snobbery and cunning. This author writes about very tough times, even in the face of tragedy he shows a womans strength, he keeps love and hope afloat, but also asks that painful question, what happens when betrayal comes from those closest?A classic thats highly recommended.

Mildred Pierce -- and I always pictured her as Joan Crawford, of course !! -- is one tough cookie and a woman to be reckoned with. She's a woman before her time and a lady I am sincerely glad I met.After Mildred kicks out her husband Bert, who hasn't worked in quite some time, she finds herself alone with her two daughters and no income. Stuck with all the finances and bills,along with two mouths to feed, Mildred hits the streets looking for work. There are not many jobs available in 1931 and Mildred prefers to be picky which is somewhat funny as she has absolutely no job skills. She interviews for several jobs, but doesn't care to be a waitress or house keeper as these are jobs that are totally looked down upon. Mildred even turns down a job solely based on the fact and worry of what her daughter will think of her.While Mildred is not skilled in any one specific job market, she happens to be in the right place at the right time and ends up with a job. Fate deals her a good hand and she decides to not care what others would think and takes a job as a waitress. She works hard and long and starts to enjoy her work, meeting new and interesting people, and bringing in some cash.Although never having worked before, she catches on quickly and new opportunities stick out their necks in Mildred's directions. Not one to be shy, she seizes the day and makes the most out of these situations. She's an excellent cook and baker, pies being her specialty. Mildred starts a side job making pies for the restaurant where she currently works. Her pies are out of this world and she soon makes a name for herself. She moves on to bigger and better things and soon is the owner of her very own restaurant that specializes in chicken, waffles, and of course, her famous home-made pies.Mildred finds that owning your own business is a full time job. However, she finds she has a knack for business and soon is living the good life. Along the way, she still remains friends with her ex, Bert. She also has some other men in her life, each one of them being totally different and unique in his own way. For such a tough woman, Mildred has a softness for the usually lazy and free-loading men who come and go in her life, and gets hurt along the way.While she is wrapped up in her professional life and busy with her work, Mildred is also bringing up her two daughters, Ray and Veda. Ray is a sweet and happy little girl. Veda is another story entirely. Veda is the original ice queen, an emotionless piece of work, a girl even her own mother must be wary of. Veda is cruel to Mildred, only caring about herself. She belittles Mildred, plays people against her, she is a hellcat and a troublemaker, not caring who she hurts or uses along her path. Veda wants what Veda wants and she doesn't care who she steps on to get what she wants. Veda is Mildred's weakness, her heartache, and her enemy. Mildred will do anything for Veda, no matter what.Join Mildred as she makes a name for herself, using a rolling pin and her brains. Meet the men in her life -- Bert, Wally, and Monty. Watch as she leaves her lower class life and works hard to make herself comfortable in the upper-upper class. Cry and feel her pain as her daughter walks all over her, uses Mildred, and in the end, does the unthinkable. Veda is a character I soon won't forget, but Mildred is the shining star of this book.Written and published in 1941 by James M. Cain, this book has been made into a movie and also a HBO mini-series, neither of which I have had the pleasure of seeing. I think I would opt for the original movie. James M. Cain also wrote THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE, DOUBLE INDEMNITY, SERENADE, LOVE'S LOVELY COUNTERFEIT, and THE BUTTERFLY. Totally Cain published 18 books, some that hit the big screen. What an extraordinary author he was!If you haven't had the pleasure of enjoying MILDRED PIERCE yet, this is one book you will want to put on your to-be-read list. I highly recommend this book and full intend to read more of Cain's work.Thank you.Pam"},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"James M. Cain's Great Creation Gets a New LifeSunPost Weekly March 24, 2011 | John Hood[...]By now you've all heard the good words regarding the recast of Mildred Pierce. HBO's five-part miniseries, which was directed by Todd Haynes and stars Kate Winslet in the titular role, has already been praised to the high heavens, and it'll undoubtedly work as well on television as it did on the big screen. Yes, as you also probably know, this source material was originally tackled back in 1945 by Michael Curtiz, who earned a remarkable six Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture, and led an incredible Joan Crawford to an Oscar for Best Actress.What you also probably know is that said source material -Mildred Pierce (Movie Tie-in Edition) (Vintage Crime/Black Lizard)- comes from none other than James M. Cain, whose 1941 novel of the same name remains a classic of the hard-boiled genre he so successfully dominated (if not created). If you've not yet read Cain's classic; now's your chance. Because the vigilant folks at Vintage have re-racked Mildred Pierce in a nifty new package. Better yet, the book can be read as if it were written yesterday, only this yesterday was made of sterner stuff than which we've become generally accustomed.Indeed the parallels between Mildred Pierce's Depression era setting and our own Recession ring truer than one might expect from a work written 70 years ago. Many of the men have fallen on the proverbial hard times, and many of the women have been forced to step up and make it on their own. Of course, to 21st century eyes this kinda development isn't necessarily novel. But the manner in which Mildred Pierce makes it is as fresh and inspiring as any success story ever told.Naturally, Mrs. Pierce's riches-to-rags-to-riches story serves only as a backdrop to the various intrigues brought about by her having to leave the house. And it's those very intrigues which give the tale its torrent -- and its devastating impact on all who come in contact with the once and future little lady.Leading the wayward is daughter Veda (originally played by Ann Blyth; now by Evan Rachel Wood), whose sole goal in life seems to be to make her mother as miserable as possible. When she's not scheming against mommy, Veda divides her time and talents between music and men. And the results, as you might suspect, are just what she intends.Haynes, best known perhaps for the equally home-wrecking Safe and Far From Heaven, tapped Guy Pearce to play the role of the dashing Monty Beragon, and considering he's superbly handled everyone from cops (L.A. Confidential) to kings (The King's Speech), it's a cinch he'll pull this off with the customary aplomb. But it is Evan Rachel Wood's turn as Veda which has all the tails wagging, and not just for the nudity either. Then again, it's said an actor's only as good as who he or she plays opposite. And with Winslet sharing the screen, she's been given the best.Nevertheless, if you really wanna see what's gonna make this recasting so great, go back to its initial creation. Pick up a copy of Cain's Mildred Pierce and give it whirl before Sunday's showing. Then you'll know firsthand just how and why this miniseries got to be so damn major."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"...that nobody else has reviewed this book. It stands alone, in my experience.Everybody knows Cain as a writer of exceptional thrillers; \\"The Postman Always Rings Twice\\" is a perfect example, and he's also responsible for \\"Double Indemnity\\". This work, however, is completely different.There is a nice degree of suspense, and the story is engaging, but the obvious crimes are not perfectly-planned murder so much as crimes against the human spirit. It's a tale of Depression-era survival in the face of treachery and deceit... but not in the way you'd think, since it's the story of a housewife raising two children on her own, using her wits to survive.The virtues of the story aside, this is a perfect view of late-Depression California. Cain rivals Chandler in the imagery of his prose, bringing to vibrant life the soul of a lost generation and their strivings in a way that stands in stark contrast to today's rampant apathy."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"Why is this listed under crime? The only crime in this book is that Mildred loved her daughter too much. I liked it because the main character changed over time--she wasn't a stagnant character like in so many novels. Very interesting novel, I recommend it."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"I found it to be a metaphor for the destruction of the old class order by the Depression. Still fairly shocking content; especially the mental cruelty. In James Cain's own words, \\"Only an act of high consecration could atone for this.\\""},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"for daughter. I can only say that the service and price were good.

It must have been controversial at the time for a woman to divorce her husband and start a business."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"This book is a lesson to all mothers - cut the umbilical cord w/your children as soon as it looks like they want independence - Mildred Price sure needed a \\"kick in the head\\" before she realized how unhappy she really was until she cut that cord!"},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"I'm wondering if Cain maybe was one of the first to move in a direction which has since become a road way too travelled. Maybe it was original to move away from murders, light comedy or romance and into something a bit more focussed on character, into family drama, into personal scandal and money as key plot points rather than car chases or predictable \`boy gets girl' machinations. But you throw in a bit of wealth and extra-marital sex and this felt - post 80s TV - way too soap opera familiar. There may be a little insight into personality and manipulative relationships, but the characters are generally just a bit too extreme to treat them as particularly realistic - they're exaggerated for effect, for scandal, for titillation.Maybe if I hadn't turned off/over this sort of fare a hundred times before it might have held more interest for me, and perhaps as a model it held more than derivations usually do, but I really didn't feel that much for anyone in the story. In the forties, too, I suppose it would have held more tawdry appeal with Mildred's indifference to marriage when approaching sex: enjoyably shocking to some; reassuringly realistic to others who didn't usually see characters with these sorts of values at heroines. But while in one way it's sad that this sort of sexual immorality is unlikely to shock contemporary readers, in another there are good things about them no longer having some forbidden appeal; stripped of taboo a modern reader is perhaps more likely to see the shallowness more clearly and lose interest.That's probably part of it too: Mildred may have been a bold new heroine at the time - not the usual victim of men who we pity as she's hauled off to a convent or something, but a woman who fights her way through to financial and sexual independence. And I realise that in my comparatively post-feminist world I'm less open to be impressed, \\"Independent woman (yawn) - a dime a dozen these days\\". In my field my boss is a likely to be a woman as a man, and gender to me is incidental to how well they'll do the job. As such Mildred's gender was similarly less relevant to me: she just became as shallow as the misogynists she overcame, rating everyone by money and social status, and using people rather than befriending them. Actually, now I mention it, there really isn't that much misogyny in the book: people are far more essentially interested in your income, and Mildred approaches sex in pretty much the same way as her partners.I know Cain is respected, but maybe I need to look somewhere else. He's a capable enough writer, and you do get a bit of a taste of the time, but fairly soon I lost much empathy for Mildred and her twisted ideas of what mattered. There didn't seem to be anyone in the book with alternative values - does this reflect on Cain?"},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"I saw the Joan Crawford movie before I read this book. I will say I LOVED them both. The book is much different than the Joan Crawford movie. The book keeps you hanging on. After I read the book I watched the mini series with Kate Winslet. I did not like that as much. I will say it followed the book almost word for word BUT the book just seemed so much better. Also Iwill say the mini series was MUCH too long (approx. 4-5 hours). To see the book on the screen just did not meet up to my expectations. I would say READ THE BOOK it is the best of the 3, then watch the Joan Crawford version of the movie."},{"Title":"Mildred Pierce","review":"I started to watch the new TV series of Mildred Pierce and found it dated and stilted; still, my book club chose to read Cain's book so I did.

I love whatever \\"hard boiled\\" fiction is. . .the term which seems to be used most often to describe Cain's book. It is dark, sad, and oh so so readable. Not dated.

Elizabeth Luard's writing is so relaxed and lovely, she describes the years she spent bringing up her children in London and in Spain. She tells funny little anecdotes and describes the smells and sights of Spain and France. This is a MUST for any woman of any age, anyone having children or who has ever had a mummy. I cant tell you how much I adore this book, and how much my family and friends have enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Family Life","review":"This is a great book which makes you realize how much is missing from many families nowadays. Elisabeth's re-telling of raising her family while traipsing through Europe makes one wonder how much richer one's own childhood would have been if our own parents had done the same.If at times a little idealistic (whosoever heard of such near-perfect children?) it is still a wonderfully written, heart-warming book great for every occassion where an easy read is wanted. It's one of the best books I've read in a long time. I found it in a second hand lending library and couldn't bear to give it back!The recipes throughout also sound wonderful and complement the story perfectly, although I haven't had the chance to try any out.The last couple of chapters dealing with the author's daughter's death is a sobering touch which brings the novel back to earth - bad things do happen. It is a bit of a shock after such a pleasant jaunt to have a death drop in your lap - but I suppose real life is like that!If you're willing to put your cynicism aside (patches of minor pomposity and smugness in places) and take the book for what it is - a rosy view of how the author raised her family, you are guaranteed to enjoy this thoroughly."},{"Title":"Family Life","review":"It took me a while to warm up to this book...Luard's writing style takes a bit of getting used to-- a sort of posh/bohemian thing that, to me at least, seems unique to British writers.But Luard's writing about her daughter's illness is amazing. It's loving, moving, beautiful, and terrible. It's also shocking, because the tone of this memoir very abruptly changes from this jovial story about an eccentric family's travels to a different, much more serious, story altogether. I don't think I have ever been so moved by a book."},{"Title":"Family Life","review":"They call it freelancing because you have the freedom to go wherever you want. This is what both Luards (Elisabeth and Nicholas) did, and managed to live in Spain, France and the English countryside with their children for much of their youth. I have to admit it took me a while to get into the book. Maybe it is the style, slightly purplish. Once the family moved to Spain, though, I read with more interest. When foreigners write about my country or my region, one of two things may happen: they got it or they didn't. I am happy to report that Elisabeth belongs to the former camp. For one thing, her portrayal of life in a small village in Andalucia in the 70's was excellent and veracious. The episode with the donkey had me laughing. One thing that annoys me, however, is how many Spanish words were misspelled. It's not mesa camella, it's mesa camilla, it's not spontaneo (italian?), it's espont&aacute;neo! I have encountered this with other English-speaking authors writing about a Spanish-speaking country. Is a Spanish editor so hard to find?Elisabeth discovered her love for food along the way, and the book is peppered with recipes in every chapter. There are times when the recipe fits in very well, like for example when she is describing a specific dish or mentioning how each of her children demanded a different birthday cake. Then, there are times when the recipe's appearance is somewhat contrived (for example, lentil soup: \\"It was time for strengthening lentil soup all around\\"). The recipes are, for the most part, very easy to follow, and although I haven't tried any yet, they do look good.Nowhere is Elisabeth's writing style more esoteric than when it gets to the chapter about her daughter's death. It was hard at times to follow what she was meaning, and it took a bit of reading and re-reading to figure it out.This is an interesting book for those of us who come from the South of Spain or the South of France, or the Hebrides, or who enjoy reading about food."},{"Title":"Family Life","review":"this is an account from Elizabeth Luard of bringing up her family in Spain 40-50 years ago. She was married to one of the co-founders of Private Eye, an exciting man but appalling as a husband. But he is rarely mentioned and she sprinkles the book with delightful recipes and sketches. She seems to have been a lovely mother - tremendous fun - and very good with people. They were always short of money although her idea of poverty maybe not the same as other people's. The book took me back to when my own 3 were little and revived many memories. I couldn't wait to read her most recent book,an autobiography written after her husband died."},{"Title":"The Street of Crocodiles: Writers from the Other Europe","review":"Awe and perhaps a bit of terror are the appropriate responses to this work. Schulz wrote like a man possessed by the spirit of creation - his sentences are alive, they breathe and hiss with color and form as a revelation of the world is made. His control of imagery incarnate in language slides and shifts from the most gracious to the most grotesque. Beyond it all is a vision of the cogs and gears upon which the cosmos turns, a radiant pattern from the Baroque era. Schulz dropped down to the mythopoeic essence at the core of time and crafted stories that told more of his childhood than any more literal record could've.Ten stars, and sadness for the premature passing of one of the greats."},{"Title":"The Street of Crocodiles: Writers from the Other Europe","review":"The Street of Crocodiles, by Bruno Schulz is a book of short stories published by Penguin Classics. It includes the first sixteen stories of Penguin's other publication,The Street of Crocodiles and Other Stories (Penguin Classics)which contains all thirty-two stories. So if you've read the longer version, don't bother. I accidentally picked this book up thinking it was a novel. Imagine how dumb I felt.To me, Bruno Schulz, for all his literary fame, is a difficult author to read. The plot of his stories is simple enough, nothing new there, but the way he writes taxes my powers of concentration to the very limit. It's beautiful writing, no question, with sentences rich in description and metaphors and similes galore. For example, \\"Beds unmade for days on end, piled high with bedding crumpled and disordered from the weight of dreams, stood like deep boats waiting to sail into the dank and confusing labyrinths of some dark starless Venice.\\" I love it. Unfortunately, however, I sometimes have to re-read the paragraphs or the entire page to make sure I don't loose track of what's going on. Like I said, it does take concentration. But if you're looking for a book of truly interesting short stories, deliciously well written, I highly recommend this one.

I had heard of and read of Bruno Schultz as a writer of the Shoah(The Holocaust) but the events of the Shoah are not a direct part of this story. The Shoah connection is given in the fact that Schultz was murdered by the Nazis.The book itself I found disconcerting, bizaare, and difficult. It is filled with descriptions , word- pictures which seem at the one hand beautiful, and on the other somewhat unreal. I suppose what bothered me above all is the narrator's tone and relation to the events which are happening.As the major action of the work relates to the physical and mental deterioration of the narrator's father I was taken aback by the lack of human sympathy displayed . In fact the whole disconnectedness of the human beings in the book to each other is another thing which makes the work so troublesome.There is a world in this book, a mind in this book which is not like anything I myself have experienced even in reading.But however beautiful some of the images given by this mind it seemed to me so fundamentally alien that I could not really grasp it."},{"Title":"The Street of Crocodiles: Writers from the Other Europe","review":"You know that painting by Vincent van Gogh of a stiff wicker-bottomed chair, just a chair sitting patiently without a butt upon it?

Shall we also mention that Schulz spent his entire life as a teacher in that seemingly dreary town, and that he was murdered in the street by an SS officer of the Nazi occupation in retaliation for the murder of that officer's 'pet' Jew by the officer who was protecting Schulz while Schulz painted his -the officer's - child's nursery? Shall we venture to imply that insensate rage and fear of humanism is a universal psychological marker of nationalism and rightist conservatism? No, let's not assert, mention, or venture. Let's not crack the lid of Pandora's lunchbox.Schulz's only other surviving works -- \\"Sanatorium under the Sign of the Hourglass\\" plus three short stories -- are also available, translated by Celina Wieniewska.

Therein we get the sense of grandeur in so many of these passages.We succumb to our will and write something, compose something, paint something; our reason does its thing and usually says, what a crock of self absorbed s....

The descriptions burst out and shock with their unexpected brilliance."},{"Title":"The Street of Crocodiles: Writers from the Other Europe","review":"I was just reminded of this book by persecuted Polish author/artist Bruno Schulz while perusing somebody else's reviews. The Street of Crocodiles was a strange passage when I read it many years ago. It was recommended by the original owners (the wife) of the amazing Cannio's Book Store of Sag Harbor. This book was too important to not weigh in with my 5 stars but I have nothing new to add to the other descriptive 5 star reviews. You must be disposed to like this sort of thing, though. It so haunted me, I bought ten copies and gave them to friends. Some felt as I did and others did not. The imagery is haunting. Some scenes are as vivid as they were when I read them decades ago. For artists, his book of drawings is excellent."},{"Title":"The Street of Crocodiles: Writers from the Other Europe","review":"I hadn't heard of Bruno Schulz until, in the mid 1990s, I saw Simon McBurney's Theatre de Complicite play based on this novel.The book's characters are unbelievably haunting, despite its complete lack of dialogue. No wonder Polish writer Bruno Schulz is best known for this novel, though it is little more than 120 pages. It is easily one of the most poetic and riveting novels of the 20th century. It was also Schulz' first. It was published in 1934 as \\"Cinnamon Shops.\\"Schulz was an artist before he was a writer. And in this novel, he paints with his words. (He had come to writing in thanks partly to the encouragement of the poet Deborah Vogel.)The novel opens with a scene from his family home. In July, when his father had gone \\"to take the waters,\\" Schulz was left with his mother and elder brother, \\"prey to the blinding white heat of the summer days.\\" Together, they dipped into a large volume of \\"holidays, its pages blazing with sunshine and scented with the sweet melting pulp of golden pears.\\" On luminous mornings, his mother Adela returned from the market \\"like Pomona emerging from the flames of day.\\" Everything that follows is a sensory feast.Schulz' images are sometimes surreal and the events of the book, bizarre and often amazing. His father, for example, being enamored of birds, virtually becomes one. He moves into the attic where birds of prey visit.The first edition was illustrated by several of Schulz' masterful drawings and etchings, made in his earlier artistic mode, all of them reproduced elsewhere. One entitled \\"The Table\\" illustrated a scene at the family house which the book elegantly retells.Born on July 12, 1892, Schulz was the third and youngest child of a merchant who lived and worked in Drohobycz his whole life. This novel, like all his artistic and written works, reflects his close connection to his family and place. It is filled with his uncles, aunts and cousins, though one can never tell precisely where the reality stops and the fantasy begins. The lines are seamless, as in an exquisite pastel.In 1939, the Soviets occupied eastern Poland. Schulz' friends helped him to stay in Drohobycz, though he could no longer teach. But in June 1941 when the Nazis occupied eastern Poland, Schulz was forced to live with the Viennese Nazi Felix Landau, who had a taste for art. Landau boasted of keeping a Jewish artist slave alive--on one daily bowl of soup and slice of bread. Schulz survived Landau's \\"protection\\" for a year. But, as the introduction notes, the Gestapo went on a rampage on Nov. 19, 1942, killing more than 150. Karl Guenther, a rival to Landau, shot Schulz in the head. A devoted friend buried him at night in a Jewish cemetery which has since disappeared, along with Schulz' grave.Schulz entrusted most of his writings to friends for safekeeping during the war. Most were also snuffed out, and his works lost.The true extent of his genius will probably never be known. We are fortunate that this book emerged from Poland before Schulz' world was consumed in flames.--- Alyssa A. Lappen"},{"Title":"The Street of Crocodiles: Writers from the Other Europe","review":"Bruno Schulz's fictional world is as strange, unique, and fascinating as any you'll ever encounter. He builds each story from a physical, natural detail or a phenomena, and imbues it with such hypnotic and poetic intensity, that what should be an ordinary world is transformed into a dream-drunk and febrile one. There is no gratuitous surrealistic maneuver, but an original world view, and this alone, would you agree, is a rare and treasurable thing in literature.The stories all deal with the narrator (Bruno) and his family when Bruno was a child. Each story starts out with a beautiful description of the milieu, then moves into stranger grounds where psychological unease mixes with facts. Kafkaesque would be the word applicable to describe Schulz's work (as there even is a story about a man turning insect-like... in this case, the father, not the son) but as researchers surmised, there is no real evidence that Schulz was influenced by Kafka.What makes Bruno Schulz's prose so heartbreaking is its ceaseless and painful yearning to remember the past; almost every description is a metaphor that is drenched in almost extrasensory feeling. In consequence, every object, every motion, and every emotion remembered by Schulz throbs with a realism that is hot-wired to our subconscious, to our collective and private myths.If you like reading, you must read Schulz."},{"Title":"The Street of Crocodiles: Writers from the Other Europe","review":"In this diminutive collection of stories, Schulz paints a complex portrait of the landscape in his childhood in Poland. The stories evolve more from the physical landscape than that of the characters, giving an intense life to inanimate objects. A sense of hidden madness, and threads of unspoken desires and fears permeate the book. Schulz writes of his father's creeping insanity, the strange landscape of his small shop, and the forboding accompanying the end of the world with the approach of a comet. While Schulz's imagery and simile get a little repetitive, the atmosphere of living objects and mysterious confluence of life is compelling and hypnotic.His input continued to illuminate not only the character of his uncle but also the world in which he wrote and lived. There is often a lyrical, often somewhat pastoral quality to much of Bruno Schulz's writing. The external reality so closely associated with the subjects and settings of his work are widely regarded as bleak and burnished. The world he represents in his stories is not necessarily in keeping with the images often associated with Poland during his lifetime, he was a writer influenced by the imagination..."},{"Title":"The Street of Crocodiles: Writers from the Other Europe","review":"The Street of Crocodiles is the story of a year of Schulz' childhood, an obviously fictional year, but a time that was mundane yet fantastic, commonplace and bizarre. Through his child's eyes, events, sensations, ideas and thoughts are conveyed with brilliant, dazzling imagery, vivid, almost too-bright pictures are painted with words in a way that is both surreal, magical and ordinary.The novel is split into thirteen chapters, each of which focuses on a different part of the Polish city of Drogobych, or on an aspect of Schulz' home life. 'Birds', for instance, is the story of his father's obsession with the winged creatures, beginning with the importation of rare bird's eggs from Africa, Holland, Hamburg, and ending with a vast aviary in the attic, with arranged marriages between different species of birds and, finally, with his father joining the birds, perching and squawking and flapping his wings. Or, 'The Street of Crocodiles', the false namesake of the book - which was actually titled 'Cinammon Shops' in Poland - a decadent, dirty arrangement of streets and buildings where anything and anyone is a commodity for purchase and use. However, The depravity, the immorality, the cheapness of the Street of Crocodiles is so great that they fail even at being depraved, revealed to instead be a mockery of a corrupt suburb, a sham crudity, a false crime. The other stories are similarly bizarre, by turns brilliantly insightful - The Birds chapter, while suitably odd, could also quite easily be read as a man's attempt to occupy himself upon a forced retirement, and failing because he doesn't know of any other life but work - or delightfully, guiltily weird and interesting.As an author, Schulz had an amazing gift for painting pictures with words. In addition to each little story having a main, plot-driven theme, they all have a secondary, emotional theme. An early chapter, describing Schulz' wandering through an abandoned part of his home which opens up into a field of flowers - yes, you read that correctly - is brilliantly depicted: the golden field of stubble shouted in the sun like a tawny cloud of locusts; in the thick rain of fire the crickets screamed; seed pods exploded softly like grasshoppers. Or there is, in a later experiment of Schulz' father gone awry, this homage to animals: Animals! the object of insatiable interest, examples of the riddle of life, created, as it were, to reveal the human being to man himself, displaying his richness and complexity in a thousand kaleidoscopic possibilities, each of them brought to some curious end, to some characteristic exuberance. The narrator's useage of adjectives, verbs and nouns - or more specifically, the selection of these words - changes as the focus of the chapter changes. While awaiting a dirty train in The Street of Crocodiles, the vocabulary changes from a mild array of purely cataloguing words to 'snake', 'squat', 'coal dust' 'heaving breathing' 'strange sad seriousness'. The 'Gale' chapter, about, unsurprisingly, a fierce gale, is an elemental delight, the words ravaging us just as the weather ravages the characters. It allows Schulz quite possibly his most brilliant line: They blinked in the light, their eyes, still full of night, spilled darkness at each flutter of the eyelids.It is interesting, when reading The Street of Crocodiles, to see just how much Schulz anticipated both the magic realism of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, and the fantastic whimsy of Italo Calvino. Their style, techniques and ideas are found here, in juvenile form, intermingled with a skill that takes the breath away. Schulz' pen was unfortunately darkened much too soon, thanks to a case of petty internal politics between SS soldiers, which resulted in the Polish Jew's death, and it is our great loss."},{"Title":"The Street of Crocodiles: Writers from the Other Europe","review":"To me, truly sophisticated writing lies in the writer's skill in using inventive and colorful similes and metaphors to communicate with his reader. The point of figurative language is not to veil the message but to elevate it from the mundane and create fresh new worlds of images and perspectives.Bruno Schulz not only understood this concept but was one of its greatest practitioners. In his short but incredibly rich \\"The Street of Crocodiles,\\" summer has a \\"senile intemperance...[a] lustful and belated spurt of vitality,\\" rays of August heat form a \\"flaming broom,\\" the moon acquires \\"milky reflexes, opaline shades, and the glaze of enamel,\\" a cockroach's sudden emergence from a crevice is described as \\"a crazy black zigzag of lightning,\\" and newly hatched baby birds are \\"lizards with frail, naked bodies of hunchbacks...[a] dragon brood.\\" Every page of this magnificently odd little book is filled with such gems.Not quite a novel, but more than just a collection of stories, \\"The Street of Crocodiles\\" is a set of loosely connected chapters about Schulz's boyhood in the small Polish town of Drogobych in the earliest years of the twentieth century. His use of figurative language instills his recollections with a dreamlike quality that hovers between reality and fantasy, such as in the chapter entitled \\"Cinnamon Shops,\\" where the young Schulz's errand home to get money for his family waiting at the theater becomes an exotic journey into the intersection of his mind and the city. In \\"Nimrod,\\" Schulz writes about the puppy he adopts and its delicate, meticulous process of learning about its environment. But the central episode would have to be \\"Tailors' Dummies,\\" in which Schulz's eccentric father declaims eloquently on the relationships between God and Man, and Man and Mannequin.Beautifully translated into English by Celina Wieniewska, this book belongs on every shelf of intelligent bizarre fiction next to the likes of Kafka, Borges, and Thomas Mann."},{"Title":"The Street of Crocodiles: Writers from the Other Europe","review":"I became acquainted with Bruno Schulz by way of a literary critic who mentioned John Updike's admiration of the Polish writer's gift for metaphors. Now Updike is no slouch himself at composing breath taking metaphors. The admiration of an American master for Schulz piqued my curiosity. I found and read Sanatorium under the Sign of the Hourglass which led to my acquiring The Street of Crocodiles from Amazon Books.Aristotle considered metaphor making the paramount skill for a writer to cultivate. My collection of Schulz's works -- 26 short stories -- exhibits an approach to style comparable to Kafka. Of the two, however, I think Schulz the more optimistic. Also, Kafka is not nearly so fond of metaphors as Schulz. Such a line by Schulz as 'she unloaded sides of meat with their keyboard of ribs swollen with energy and strength' indicates a mind with a knack for seeing similarity in differences, the hallmark of a metaphorist. If this sip of Bruno Schulz appeals to a reader, a vat more awaits his palate in this book.There are writers who create fiction largely unrelated to their lives. Barbara Cortland wrote romances set in previous centuries. Louis D'amour set his stories in the old west. Agatha Christy was a queen of murder mysteries though she never got even a traffic ticket. Bruno Schulz is not in this category. He belongs to those writers who write close to home. Kafka and Joyce are likewise members of this illustrious and fascinating group. They spin the dross of their lives into golden prose. I can not be so audacious as to declare their domain the best in the literature's empire, but in my opinion a visit to them is well worth taking.The engaging introduction to The Street of Crocodiles provides a reader with the salient facts of this little known artist. Bruno Schulz's genius and life ended in the Nazi oppression of European Jewry. Nothing can be done to erase that dark icy period. Some atonement is possible, however, in the recovery of this author's works and their ava! ilability on the internet."},{"Title":"The Street of Crocodiles: Writers from the Other Europe","review":"This is an excellent novella. It's a thin book, but not a quick read. You should read carefully and savor the beautiful passages and the exquisite details. This book carries a great literary observation of both the beautiful and the ugly, each written with equal accuracy.It's essentially about a Polish father whose mental health is rapidly deteriorating. But, of course, the story is not that simple.I'll quote one part I think properly exemplifies his writing: \\"Sometimes at night, the Demiurge would appear at the bedroom window, bathed in the dark purple glare of Bengal fire, but it only looked for a moment benevolently on my sleeping father whose melodious snoring seemed to wander far into the unknown regions of the world of sleep.\\"Bruno Schulz seems to go relatively unrecognized amongst US mainstream literati, but he should never be overlooked. He was one of the great contributors to European literature.Certainly worth the Amazon price of about $9.00.This is the only of Schultz's pieces I've read, but I look forward to reading more."},{"Title":"The Street of Crocodiles: Writers from the Other Europe","review":"Only in the last 25 years or so has Bruno Schulz become recognized in the English-speaking world as one of the leading European writers of the first half of the 20th Century. His recent rise to acclaim in this country mirrors, with a lag of only a few years, that of Joseph Roth. By one of those strange quirks of coincidence, Schulz and Roth have some very similar biographical facts. They both were Jewish and born in Galicia (then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, now in western Ukraine). By my calculation their hometowns of Drogobych (Schulz) and Brody (Roth) were about 100 miles apart. Schulz was born in 1892, Roth in 1894. They both attended the university in Lvov, at times that may have overlapped. They also both spent time in Vienna between 1914 and 1918. And, sadly, both were victims of the Nazis: Schulz was shot and killed by a Gestapo officer in the streets of German-occupied Drogobych in 1942; Roth, in despair and exile in Paris, drank himself to death in 1939. (Roth had fled to Paris from Berlin on the day Hitler assumed power in 1933. Schulz visited Paris for three weeks in the summer of 1938. Did perchance they ever meet, either in 1938 in Paris, or earlier in Lvov or Vienna?)But that's the extent of the similarities. Roth wrote in German and his fiction is rather firmly entrenched in the German literary tradition. Schulz wrote in Polish and his fiction is pretty much sui generis.Schulz published only two books. The first is THE STREET OF CROCODILES, originally published in 1934 under the title (in Polish) \\"Cinnamon Shops\\". The book actually is a collection of short stories -- or, more accurately, fictional episodes -- all set in Schulz's hometown of Drogobych. All are narrated in the first person, and many feature the narrator's father, an elderly and extremely eccentric (even loony) cloth merchant, which was the occupation of Schulz's real father. No doubt the episodes are autobiographically informed, and probably they also have some psychological roots in Schulz's relationship with his father.But otherwise the stories or episodes of THE STREET OF CROCODILES bear little resemblance to reality. Instead, they are woven from, to borrow Schulz's words from one of them, \\"a fabric of nightmares and hashish.\\" CROCODILES is the product of an extremely fecund and wide-ranging imagination. Again and again reality dissolves or disintegrates and is replaced by dreams, fantasies, and myths. Schulz's fictional universe is especially rich in its visual imagery, which, in turn, is especially characterized by a profusion of colors.This is my first experience reading Schulz, and I will have to let it ferment for a while before formulating opinioins about what CROCODILES might mean and whether it is great literature. My initial sense is that Schulz created CROCODILES as an imaginary world much more interesting and exciting -- titillating, even -- than the rather drab reality in which he was existentially imprisoned. I also am confident that Schulz is a significant author of the 20th Century, for literary reasons above and beyond the tragic facts of his life and death. But whether he is in the pantheon of literary greats is for me still an open question."},{"Title":"The Street of Crocodiles: Writers from the Other Europe","review":"I first heard about this book through the pages of the 5-star novel \\"The History of Love.\\" What is most unusual about it is the author's lack of intention to actually publish his writing. This book is a manifestation of personal letters he had addressed to a geographically distant friend. It is by no means an easy read. The language is powerful and supremely complex and requires absolute focus and sometimes the need to reread a paragraph a few times to truly appreciate the intense magnitude of brain power that this author possesses. This is a book of highly exaggerated proportions. Schulz takes \\"magical realism\\" to another level.Convoluted ideas that twist into abstract thoughts walk through dark alleyways and emerge triumphant. This is how I would describe Schulz's writing. This is not the sort of book you can breeze through but rather, like a dense and flavorful truffle. You will want to savor every word, let it sink in and roll it around in your grey matter before you can appreciate its true meaning and beauty. There is real depth and symbolism in Schulz's writing. That said, it is certainly not for everyone. If you're looking for a lighthearted bedtime read, skip this book. On the other hand, if you're looking for mental stimulation and a book that truly promises an escape from reality, you won't be disappointed by this street of crocodiles."},{"Title":"The Street of Crocodiles: Writers from the Other Europe","review":"This book was an excellent surprise. I had never heard before of Bruno Schulz, a Jewish Pole who taught drawing in the small town of Drogobych (in today's Ukraine). He was a shy and lonely bachelor who was shot to death by the Nazis in 1942. This is of course a book by an eccentric. It has been said that it is Kafkaesque / Proustien, but I don't agree. It is neither a struggle against the absurd nor the angst for accurately recovering the past. It is a collection of vignettes, surely autobiographical, whose only common thread is the presence of his family, especially the eccentric and manic - indeed, a total lunatic - father, and the maid Adele, a model of order and efficiency, very likely harassed by the father. The boy Schulz himself appears, sometimes as participant, but most of the time as witness of the wonderful - be it extatic, horrific, or weird - events he recounts.It has been also said, possibly with reason, that the tales read like transcriptions of dreams. Indeed, in dreams \\"reality\\" is connected with absurd images, inoppportune appearances, dislocations in the flow of time, paradoxes and other visions. The character of the father dominates the book, an enlightened madman, sometimes irate and others submissive, hiding for months in chests and corners of the house by the main square. Everything flows and things fly. There is glory amd misery. There is testimony and dream. There are poetic evocations like the chapter \\"August\\". There is a wonderful chapter where the father collects and breeds birds, exotic and colorful, in the attic, until Adele, fed up with the filth, frees them and she turns the sky of Drogobych into a jungle of a thousand colors. There is a whole treatise on mannequins, \\"The Second Book of Genesis\\". There is a chapter of enormous tenderness and humor about the friendship between the boy Schulz and a puppy named \\"Nimrod\\", an ironic name given the fact that Nimrod was a mythical Babilonian hunter and warrior who built the Tower of Babel. There is the chapter on \\"The Cinnamon Shops\\" (the original Polish title) which is probably, along with Hermann Broch's \\"The Death of Virgil\\", the most tangible and extraordinary onirical experience I have ever read. Schulz misses a theater show when he goes back home to fetch a sweater, but he gets lost in a vivid, confusing and awesome dream, in which time becomes flexible and the world turns backwards. \\"The Street of Crocodiles\\" of the title, is his peek at the bad neighborhood, to sure perdition, to potential sin, to the world outside home's nest. All the rest of the chapters are also immensely enjoyable. It is a book worth rereading, with torrents of images, full of poetry, the little known work of a soul that was gifted, articulate, lonely and full of light."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"'Vampire$\\" by John Steakley is novel about rag-tag bunch of American vampire hunters for hire. These guys live for the thrill and horror of killing vampires, and in-between they get drunk and act stupid. The vampires themselves are truly monsterous and powerful. Forget Bela Lugosi.While I found the characterizations of the vampire hunters to be a bit weak and very uninteresting, the portrayal of the vampires and the methods of battling them to be very well-written ... and fascinating. The battle sequences are exciting, violent and unpredictable. So I find myself trudging through the dull narrative about the vampire hunters' lives while anxiously awaiting the next battle sequence.Bottom line: forget about the vampire hunter soap opera and read the book for those terrific vampire-killing sequences.

To bring my opinion out quite bluntly, I believe this novel was inches away from being a waste of the paper it was printed on. Let us take in mind the plot: drunk guys getting hired by local governments to destroy vampire infestations. I find it kind of humorous. The plot is supposed to be revolved around hunting vampires and a majority of the book is the nervous break down of one of two main characters or a drawn out story of the past told by a character that I would not even consider human. All in all, I simply believe this book lacked a concretion of plot. Nearly halfway in to the novel, the plot changes, but it is never really solved.

Once that happened it turned from the Jack Crow story to the Felix story. Crow was by far the more interesting character, he had human flaws and weaknesses, while Felix was perfect in every respect.

Had the movie been true to the book, that would have been one bad a%# movie."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"So I finally spot this novel I've read so much about on the net....what a letdown. I was expecting so much more, you know, like maybe some insight into the vampire myth, some great characters, geez, even a good story for cripes sake. What I got were cardboard characters, weak plot and run-on sentences like you wouldn't believe. Save your money &amp; time and read Interview With a Vampire instead. This same review score can also apply to Steakley's Armour as well. Sorry folks, overrated in my book, anyway."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"This is not a boring book, oh no, but it has some major faults. Here's one, which pretty much killed the last part of the book for me, and hence, no real payoff: **SPOILER WARNING** the reveal of the bigbad vamp, the one we've heard but not quite seen, the one pushing all the buttons, the one that ~ heck, it would have been more satisfying if Steakley had just said, \\"Aw, it's Dracula\\" ~ ?? Yeah that one. Turns out he's actually NO ONE WE'VE EVEN HEARD OF UP TO THAT POINT IN THE BOOK. So when Felix says, \\"The bastard's name is...\\" you will respond with, \\"I'm sorry, WHO?\\".No punch. A lynch-pin disclosure in the book and it lacks any dramatic impact. Steakley tries to tell us all about him then, in the few paragraphs before he gets wasted by Team Crow anyway, but you won't care.Why didn't he make it one of the George Bushes? J.R. Ewing? That would have been more interesting."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"This is, by far, the best vampire novel I have ever read--and I've read a lot of vampire novels! I couldn't put this book down. I didn't read it, I inhaled it! If you've seen the John Carpenter film version of this book, and haven't read the book...READ THE BOOK!!! The movie doesn't even come close to the excellence of Vampire$. So, if you are in the mood for a gripping novel about vampires and those who hunt them, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"Now this is what I call a book! Non-stop action is the appeal of the novel Vampire$ and that is what you get. The blood flies in this tale of Vampire$ Inc. and the hunters that run it. Jack Crow is the lead vampire hunter in a story about the tightly wound group he leads. You just can't take your eyes away from the inticing (how the heck do you spell that!) writing by John Steakley. The ending will amaze anyone. One of the best buys I have ever had!"},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"One of the most raw, grittiest and frightening vampire novels I've ever read. Don't get me wrong, I devour such authors as Michael Romkey, Anne Rice, Laurell K. Hamilton and numerous others, but this one still rates very high with me.If you've seen the movie, forget it. This happens to be a very close friend of mine's favorite book. His birthday was the 28th and the movie came out on the 31st (of October 1998). We decided to get him tickets as one of his presents. Never more have I wished I could take back a gift. The movie was hideously bad and so untrue to the book.If you saw the movie and thought, &quot;that could have been better&quot;, read the book. I guarantee you will NOT be disappointed."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"I watched the movie before I read this book expecting them to be relatively the same. But the are completely different. John Carpenter, although it is a great movie which I give 5 stars, did a crummy job at putting the book on film. The only things they had in common is that the main character is Jack Crow and that they hunt vampires. However, even though the book isn't what I expected, it was still a great book that I couldn't put down. I recommend it highly for someone who is interested in vampires, but if you are just reading it because you saw the movie, don't be surprised if you find them very dissimilar."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"The idea of the Catholic Church sposered vampire hunter troupe is an itreaging one opening up a new line the fight against evil. Gone are the bookish Professor Van Helsing and the 'chosen' cheerleader Buffy Summers, replaced with a gang of hard fighting, hard drinking killers with pikes, crossbows and dinamite led by Jack Crow, a chain smoking corse giant of a man who effectivle runs the fighting side of the agency known as Vampie$ Inc. This all changes as the S*** hits the fan. the hunters become the hunted as an ancient vampire decides that Crow has gone far enough and must be elimenated or turned. The Book is almost in three parts, part one is the told primarily for Crow's perspective, the second is the history of Davette's relationship with a 'master' vampire and the third is from the persective of Felix, a gunslinger who becomes a reluctant member of Team Crow. All in all a wonderfull story with plenty of action and suspense. Well worth a read."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"I've read several vampire books (Anne Rice, Stephen King, etc.) and found this one to be it's own unique story. After reading other user reviews about how the book is much better than the movie, I'll avoid the movie, but I'm definitely going to look up some other Steakley books to give them a try. Steakley writes with a raw language that cuts to the chase, and I found it refreshing in how the characters interacted with each other with such honesty and (for the most part) open emotion."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"I've had this book for close to 15 years. Let me tell you, as an author myself....I completely envy this novel. This has to be one of the greatest works of vampire fiction ever written. The heroes are realistic, and they do a job that often ends up killing them. Forget about the not so great movie version of this book. This is a high octane action piece that will have you on the edge of your seats!!!!!! I wish i could give it more stars."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"Terrible.'Armor' was a good book. This is cr@p. Throwing us into the middle of a vampire vs humans fight is fine, but it was all so self conscious and over the top. I suppose those who like the vampire movie by Tarantino would like this. I gave him about 60 pages. That's over an hour of my life I'll never get back... The dialogue is cheezy, the characters have no depth. It's like someone took a comic book and removed the pictures. Yuck."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"i first bought this book when i had just watch the movie and thought this is going to be a good read. boy was i wrong in a way it was nothing like the book which blew my mind to hell lol the one thing i will never understand is why in the hell did they go to that town knowing dam well that they had been set up by the mayor? and i think no writer know,s a dam thing about smoking cause i have never read a book where they have bought a pack of smoke,s just fyi.but i really love this book and i also agree that he should write another book and i wish that one day they would make one movie just like the book was written. thank,s though for writing this one. i also got this on audible.com thank,s guys"},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"I enjoyed this book a lot - Steakley's writing style was witty and unique. And the subject matter is probably something any lover of vamp stories will enjoy.The only thing I had an issue with was the way everything concluded.SPOILER(S):The 'final showdown' was anti-climactic, not nearly as intense as many of the other battles which had been depicted throughout the book. This was especially disappointing, because the dude they took down was THE Master Vamp; how could he have been eliminated so easily? I'm still scratching my head over that part ... maybe I missed something.I also felt that the last scene(s) was/were drawn together a bit sloppily - perhaps hastily is a better word. I think it could have been expounded on a bit more so the reader had a clearer understanding of just what had happened. However, this may have been simply part of the author's style. As I said his writing was unique - which included the fact that not everything was spelled out word for word ... sometimes just a quick blurb here or there, and you were left to fully piece together the final picture. Not sure if that makes any sense, but if you've read the book perhaps you know what I'm talking about.One thing that really disappoints me is that the author hasn't written a sequel. I think this story is deserving of one - however, even without a sequel the book is solid enough."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"This is a really good vampire novel! It is in-depth, and gripping start to finish. I would definately recommend this to any vampire fan(preferably age 15+). I give it 2 thumbs up!(I've watched the movie and I'd definately say to read the book instead!!!)"},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"John Steakley's \\"Vampires\\" is a fun horror/action tale which follows the adventures of a team of Vatican financed vampire killers. The tale does a wonderful job of creating a dark world where the forces of good and evil are in state of constant war. While the book is generally entertaining it pales in comparison to John Carpenter's 1998 film adaptation. The film takes the book, which is good but lethargic at times, and gives it a more kinetic spin. It was a liberal adaptation to be sure, and Carpenter changed much, but it generally worked. I wouldn't recommend this book to those who have already seen the film, but for those looking for a fun novel equal parts action and horror, you may enjoy Steakley's work."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"I really love the way Steakley writes, but as far as content, this book does leave something to be desired. Don't get me wrong, I loved the book, but I think it could have been beter. This book centers around Jack Crow and Felix (as it says on the copyright page this is a different Jack Crow: this is a different Felix) Jack Crow is an experienced vampire slayer who winds up loosing most of his team in the beginning of the book. He then starts to build a new team, this one centered around Felix a modern day gunfighter. Many intentional references to Steakley's other book; Armor. i.e. Character names and the Antwar Bar. Steakley's writing style is all that keeps this book from being just another vampire book. The John Carpenter movie Vampires was (very) loosley based on this book i.e. Both of them had a main character named Jack Crow who hunted vampires."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"I read this book awhile back and enjoyed it. For some I can see how it lost it's flare though. It took some time to get into and the story line was hard to follow at times. But once you found that line it was had to put down. My favorite caraters were Felix and Davette (I don't know how to spell it and I am not going to go look for the book). All in all it was a good book, and killed the movie they are not close. The storys are totally different."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"its been quite a long time since i read the book &quot;VAMPIRE$&quot;, so i can not quite remember the storyline, but i do remember that i liked it very much...what brings me here, is that i started watching a movie, and it started out like the book did, and i was thinking &quot;this seems so familiar&quot; and then the vampire says &quot;jack crow&quot; and i automatically remembered the book...so is the movie (which is currently a new release in video stores) based on this book? just wondering :)"},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"I read a lot of horror books, many of which deal with vampires. About one in ten is good (an unfortunate low number), and about one in a hundred is great. This one is. The other two (concerning vampires) that springs to mind are Carrion Comfort (a novel approach by Dan Simmons) and the original Dracula (and yes, Bram Stoker's film sucks). Anne Rice, well, that's for the kiddies and supermarket crowd.Steakley manages to make the vampire a completely believable &quot;thing&quot; without any mumbo-jumbo &quot;flying around in the night&quot; stuff. That makes it a scary book (which is why we read horrror in the first place, yes?). The pace is just right, the cast is great and the story's premise is stupendously brilliant. It is actually hard to pinpoint any specific reason, but this is a GREAT book. I've even reread it several times (I've had it for close to ten years, and NOW I am writing a review, that should say something), and it is a great read even the second (or third) time around.Steakley is one of the authors I run through Amazon's search engine every now and then, hope shining in my eyes. Sadly, only the two same hits ever come up (the other is &quot;Armor&quot;, an awesome 5-star sci-fi story I also fully recommend)."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"I mean that. &quot;John Carpenter's Vampires&quot; was a decent movie, if a bit trite (a black cross? reverse exorcism? please...), but this book is anything but trite. It is vulgar, edgy, dark, and very very good. Forget the limp-wristed characters Anne Rice writes about. Steakley's vampires are a monsterous lot, full of violence and horror. Brian Lumley's books are a much closer comparison, and that is high praise in deed (for me, anyway). It doesn't hurt that I grew up not ten miles from Cleburne, Texas, and it was a kick in the pants when I saw the city represented in the book (it's a small, dusty, Texas town without much of note), not to mention the fact that John is from there. On a side note, his dad's dealership has moved to Fort Worth, I believe.Anyway, before I digress further, go buy this book! It was action aplenty, characters that just grab you by the lapels and shake you, and a story that never tires no matter how many times I read it. This is a first class American vampire novel. Forget about Rice. THIS is was a vampire book *should* be."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"I am an avid fan of the vampire genre. I read this book five years ago. At first, I thought it was one of those foolish parodies, like Doon, because of the cheezy dialogue and antics of the character Cherry Cat. However, I decided to read on and give it the benefit of the doubt. Well, neither the dialogue nor the antics got any better, but I have to admit that I liked the book regardless. Another one of your reviews stated that the reader laughed, cried, and clapped their way throughout the story. I believe that this is what makes this book so good. Some may say this is an excellent book whilst others may say that it is a waste of trees. However, it succeeds in taking the reader through a myriad of emotions and that, if nothing else, earns it a &quot;moving read&quot; review from me. My advice to anyone interested in reading this book, don't let the cheezy dialogue fool you. Underneath that is a pretty good story."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"After being shaken to my very core by &quot;Armor&quot;, I ran to the book store to find anything by John Steakly. At the third one I finally found Vampire$. While not nearly as intense or gripping, this book merits reading. Incidentally, the movie unforgivably omits the character Felix. Anyone who knows Steakly's work intimately couldn't do such a thing. The idea of vampire hunters for hire is a novel one and Jack Crow comes off like Abraham Van Helsing in a steroid rage. The role of Felix was made for Gary Oldman, an emotionally crippled killer with a dead on shot. I liked the idea that these guys listen to SRV. The dialogue is stardard Steakly; Hemingway influenced, stream of consciousness banter that is very real sounding. Kind of like sitting in an empty bar in the afternoon, smoking cigarettes and drinking beer, listening to a great storyteller spin a yarn you half believe and half don't want to. Besides the names of the main characters, another thread tying Steakly's books together is the emotion he conveys in his writing. The emotional level in his books reaches high levels, you really feel for the characters, even if you don't like them. I definitely recommend this book if you like vampire stories, and who does'nt. While not as fully fleshed out as the very gothic works of Anne Rice or Brian Lumley's British Necroscope, the American twist on the vampire theme is interesting. In a way, this is the definitive American vampire story. And whether you liked Vampire$ or not, for God's sake read &quot;Armor&quot;. Long live Felix."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"Jack Crow and his Team don't fool around. They go after the vampires with stakes, crossbows and dynamite while wearing chain-mail. And they go after the vampires during the DAY, because this professionals prefer to have the sun as backup.They get paid LOTS of money, they play hard, they drink hard and they have the backing of the Church. How good can it get?Team Crow are doing great till the vampires decide enough is enough. And the Masters, the powerful vampire elders, who are the ones coming after him also know his name. The book is ten times better than the movie that was based on it (not that the movie was bad - but you know movies and the books they're based on). John Steakley is a great author. I would also suggest his sci-fi book - 'ARMOR'"},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"I picked this up because I hadn't been able to get to the John Carpenter movie version. About halfway through I noticed how much the writing and characterizations -- especially the wonderful, male adolescent view of women! -- reminded me of Heinlein's stuff from the late 40's through Glory Road. (There may even be an homage to the old man, although Steakley's Dr. Harshaw is no copy of Stranger in a Strange Land's). And this was before I saw the reviews of &quot;Armor&quot;! It's good, old Saturday Evening Post action writing, with an economy of words that makes the action even tighter and faster. Steakley's monsters are monsters, his heroes are heroes, the women are women, and his priests are noble enough to make boys all over the USA feel safe around clergy again. His vampires love opera and hate rock and roll, and in his universe, (like our own) rock and roll WILL set you free -- even from hateful vampires. This book predates the &quot;Buffy&quot; stories, but it shares with them the idea of vampire slayer as a chosen, doomed child. I think most &quot;Buffy&quot; watchers, even us girls, will enjoy Steakley. I would have liked a little more back story. I wonder if there's an &quot;author's cut&quot; of the manuscript that was sacrificed to the demands of the mass-market paperback marketplace? I'm looking forward to reading &quot;Armor&quot; even if it is a shameless Starship Troopers knockoff, and even more if it turns out not to be. And I'll be interested to see where and who Jack Crow and Felix turn out to be next time."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"Jack Crow is a gothic hero. In a world that refuses to acknowledge the horror that stalks the nights, Jack has been charged with banishing these horrors to hell. And it will cost him.Vampire$ is one of the few novels written by the enigmatic Steakley. The most amazing thing to me about this book is that in so few pages the author manages to develop the characters so fully yet keep the action going at a blinding pace. The characters are flawed human beings yet they manage to rise above their situation to do what must be done. Brilliant."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"I have a thing for vampire stories, I have always consumed them. Unfortunately, supernatural is a difficult subject to dabble in without coming across ridiculous. Rarely do you find an excellent story, and when the story is good enough, it is immediately insulted with follow up formula books. This story is excellent. The characters are three dimensional, the dialogue is interesting, amusing, and thought evoking. I found myself hoping the characters wouldn't encounter any more vampires so they could stay alive. Usually, I am squarely in vampire court. The underlying story of the men and their relationships/friendships, is well worth the read. If you are a Texan, or have ever served in the military, you won't find yourself blushing at the adult language presented. I thought that it was a fairly accurate depiction of dialogue in a high stress environment, but I remember learning the myriad of contexts one could drop the \\"f\\" bomb in during basic training, so perhaps I am not as easily offended as others. Of course it contains a damsel in distress, which I also found a delightful addition.I do not reread books and I have read this book three times. I have purchased it three times as well, since whenever I lend it to a friend with high praises, I never get it back. (as a matter of fact, this will be my fourth purchase and the reason for today's visit to Amazon).I concur with the reviewer that often enters John Steakley to see if he has written another book, only to be disappointed when nothing else pops up. I wish the writer would continue writing..."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"John Steakley's first novel, Armor, ranks with my top ten books of all time. If you haven't read it, it's even better than Vampires. I have long awaited a sequel to Armor, which I hope may still come. I was happy to stumble across Vampires, which is also well done, but left me a bit depressed. Any fan of Armor will see many parallels in these two books, aside from the obvious reincarnation of the Jack Crow and Felix characters (in name only) from Armor. The &quot;Antwar Saloon&quot; was cute. As with Armor, we have a powerful character endowed with extraordinary strength and a sense of duty to wipe out evil, despite the toll it takes on his loved ones and his own psyche. You find yourself enthralled by the action, but drawn into a morose, visceral world where the characters all have pretty depressing lives but are connected by a kind of macho doomsday comaraderie. You can really feel how immensely TIRED everybody in the story is. For all of its action noir, it's a great read. Just keep the Prozac handy."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"I first saw John Carpenters movie and found it rather lousy, full with adolescent jokes and bad acting (even by James Woods). That's why I was suprised when this book got good reviews and decided to buy it.I like this book - a lot. There's almost no likeness with the movie, apart from the character names. The feeling is different from every other vampire-book I've read (and they are many). There's a whole team hunting vampires - sanctioned by the Pope. It's more of a war-story than an ordinary Vampire-tale. And the vampires aren't the ordinary clich&eacute; vampires, as they have become after Anne Rice. They have great powers of mesmerizing, but inside remain the same sloppy and unclassy people as when they died.The characters are good, the best part of the book, and you really get into the story. The only times I stopped reading was when I had to go to work. Don't miss this one, if for nothing else, only for Gunman Felix, one of the most interesting characters ever invented."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"First: Unique, original text that is NOT a clone of other Vampire books/flicks.

Fourth: A must read if your into the Vampire Genre"},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"I took a couple of days off work after Christmas to get some work done around the house and play with my kids. Instead, I sat in a chair and did NOTHING until this pulse-pounding book was finished. If you're looking for introspective vampire angst and mush (a la &quot;Interview With a Vampire&quot;) this isn't for you.

But don't make any other immediate plans...."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"I don't know what the rest of you thought of this book but I loved it.

ITS GREAT."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"This book packs a non-stop in your face attitude. It is easiley one of the best books i have ever read. It has not one dull moment in the entire book. The dipictive fight scene's are wild and horrorifing. It is a must for anyone who likes books on vampire hunters."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"A Vampire/Modern-Day Western/Thriller extreme, this is one of the coolest vampire books I've read since the Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter series. This isn't vampires moping and complaining about living forever, this is vampires in the tradition of From Dusk Till Dawn-sick, evil, malevolent creatures who need to eradicated. While the movie is good-James Woods IS Jack Crow, HANDS DOWN, its a totally different plotline, while the first 30 minutes could have been taken almost completely from the novel, and is incidentally the best section of the film, I would love to see another film/miniseries based totally on the novel. All in all, I myself have thanked Mr. Steakley for his amazing book, lets hope Felix and Co. come back again."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"This is a book to read and re-read again! You can't absorb it all in one visit. The characters are rich and seductive and you ache for each one of them, be they good guys or bad. It's detailed with familiar acurate Texas sights and lush with breathing characters that draw you into a completly believable plot... I have lived in Dallas all my life, and now I'm watching for these guys/vampires as I drive down the street! Light a candle and read the first chapter...take a sick day, keep reading... this book will stick in your head for weeks."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"This book is less about Vampires and more about the men who hunt them. This is what makes this book very good. Instead of just throwing a bunch of stakes around, the book delves into the characters and finds out how being a Vampire hunter can ruin your life. Though the book changes a bit in the middle, to a more Anne Rice type feel, the thrill of the hunt is in every page. Great read"},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"This is a two day book to me. What I mean by that is that you don't eat, sleep, drink, water the dog or cat for the duration of those two days so that you may read this book. I really didn't put it down. I don't know if I should curse John for letting my studies fall behind or thank him!"},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"John Steakly is an incredible author, with such books as Armor, which not to mention kicked *#!, and Vampire$, quite the thriller, a little, say, morose though. I thought that Crow was a well put together character, even if he was a little macho. (hah! a little?) This is a great book anyway, why, that even makes it better! This is second only to Armor. Go get it! It's great!"},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"Great action/adventure story of a team of hard-core vampire hunters for hire. A fast paced book that has men who are men and vampires that are vampires. Interesting characters, both hunter and vampire. All in all a great read that does not over-analyze the vampires psyche as some books in this genre do. The Vampires are not &quot;tortured souls&quot; who doubt themselves and their unnatural thirst. Instead they revel in their un-natural existence and display an arrogance worthy of their powers. As a side note I think that the new John Carpenter movie &quot;Vampires&quot; that is due for release Oct.30,1998 is based on this book. I do not know this for a fact but the previews of the movie that I have seen look very much like the novel."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"I picked up this book because I saw and liked the movie. The concept of a crew of workaday vampire killers and their specialized equipment intrigued me. I hoped there would be more of that in the book than there was in the movie, but I was disappointed.And what a tough read! Macho men and women as envisioned by a Sci Fi conventioneer. The painful chapter about the tragic heroine lifted from bad gothic romances was almost unreadable and killed whatever momentum the book had. More shallow than most comic books.Stick with the movie even though it falls apart towards the end. James Woods is terrific."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"Ok....I watched the movie which was based on this book, and following the usual logical path that the book is always better than the movie I was sure I would love this book.Turns out that there ARE exceptions to every rule. This book did absolutely nothing for me and I had many gripes with it but I will list just a few so you can get the point.1)There is a guy named Cherry Cat.....yea that's right. One of the \\"big tough\\" vampire hunters is named Cherry Cat. I know I know, you are reaching for the Jack Daniels and revolver already...but wait there's more.2) All of these so called \\"tough guys\\" seem to break down and sob at the drop of a hat....now I work at a hospital and see people die a lot and I never cry....but these guys hunt vampires..a very manly profession and the abundance of tears and \\"touching\\" moments in this book may have you checking the title again just to make sure it is about vampires.3) There are more complaints but I will close it out with this one. The main character (Jack Crow) says the words Rock 'n' Roll about every two pages when he decides it's time to stop crying and attempt to be manly. This is cringe inducing for me and it made me want to stop reading....I, unlike Crow, am a man so I finished the book...I did not enjoy it though."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"After reading the glowing reviews of the book, I ran right out and got it. Well, it is nothing like the movie, and thank God that John Carpenter got a hold of this and made it into something entertaining. The book gets boring quick, unless you like long passages about how 'lovely' a girl is, and unfinished sentences about monsters. The book actually had less atmoshpere than the movie, if that's possible. And the movie definitely has a better storyline and ending. Rent John Carpenter's Vampires again, for all of the above, and the acting, scenery, and music.The movie is wonderful."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"than it got real boring.

With about 70 pages to go I decided I could not take it anymore and gently placed it into the garbage can."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"This book sucks; It's so bad I only read up to chapter 9 (not enough even half way through it). Too many characters think that they are so clever that frankly they are just annoying. The plot could be interesting; but, the author does not know how to deliver it. I recommend this book for the trash can only."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"This book started off good (it has a lovely dedication)...but then it starts glorifying the Catholic Church???

After 30 pages I gave up and refuse to read it anymore. I was also disappointed because John Steakley's ARMOR is one of the few books I have read several times. I would rate ARMOR an 8 or 9. (It would be a 10 if there was less Jack Crow and more Felix.) I have regularly scanned bookshelves for a new book by Steakley so this was a bitter disappointment"},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"Steakley's book \\"Armor\\" is one of my favorites. It is right up there with the Forever War and Starship Troopers. Perhaps my expectations were too high."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"I just finished reading the Vampire$. I felt terribly cheated that John Carpenter's movie out shines the novel on which it was based. The novel is overly 'campy'. The writing is fast and poor, and leaves you to wonder how some of the characters get from one end of a room to the other. It is as if John Steakly just sat down and wrote this book in a day. Read it if you must, there are plenty of better vampire books out there."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"John Steakley's &quot;Vampire$&quot; falls into the category of &quot;great concept--lousy execution.&quot; That Steakley is not a terribly creative writer is immediately apparent to anyone who has read his sci-fi epic &quot;Armor.&quot; Though that novel is pretty good, one has to question why, other than abject laziness, would he use the same two names (Jack Crow and Felix) who were the heros of the previous book? The first scene of &quot;Vampire$&quot; starts out scary, but decends into gratuitous violence. From there, the novel stalls, spending over a hundred pages on uneffective character deveolpment. The mood is all wrong. If vampires WERE real and stalking the earth, one would think that governments would have more urgency about destroying them and that those who do the job would be a little more organized. I also found the religous aspect of the story baffling. Quite frankly, the whole novel lost comprehension for me well before the halfway mark. I would love to see it rewritten by someone who is able to give its great concept true justice."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"Easily one of the best and most entertaining vampire books out there. When evaluating a book I always ask myself would I read the book again, would I recommend the book to a casual reader, and would I recommend the book to a serious reader of the book's genre. All three are check marks regarding this one. I've read it multiple times, people who don't necessarily enjoy horror/vampire literature have enjoyed it, and active horror/vampire literature readers have enjoyed it as well. In fact, this is a book that every person I recommended it to also recommended it to someone else. Yes, it's that entertaining. The only negative associated with this book is the movie adaptation. Do yourself a favor, skip it. Cheers."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"a pretty good book,not as good as armor though, even though the two main characters, Felix and Jack Crow (if he sets it in a different time period shouldn't he at least give them a different name. Vampire$ has several other references to armor (the antwar saloon being the most obvious) which I'm not sure is annoying or not"},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"I read Vampire$ a few months before the movie arrived in theaters and I love it. This book has been probably the best book I read that year. Then I went to see the movie, it's good, but if you have read the book, do yourself a favor, don't see the movie. If you've seen the movie you'll notice that it's a good movie, but a bad adaptation of a great novel.Vampire$ is something different, when you read this novel, you need to forget about other Vampire classic novels (like I am Legend, Interview with the Vampire, etc), this is totally different and it will blow your mind away. I'll love the way Steakly introduce the characters, specially the mysterious Felix, which turn to be the main character of the novel, not Jack Crow (like the movie). The way John introduces the characters, the way he developed them, amazing.If you like a good Vampire, action, intriguing novel, Vampire$ is your choice. When you read Vampire$ (if you've read John Steakly's Armor), you'll say \\"What a coincidence, in both of his novels, the main characters are the same, Jack Crow and Felix\\". But, most intriguing is that in both novels Felix is this mysterious guy that you want to know more about him."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"Don't let the movie of the same name fool you; Carpenter mangled this book in film. This and Armor (by the same author) are two of the most engaging sci-fi/horror novels I've ever come across. Steakley's unique style of writing has a way of keeping the reader glued to the book, forsaking such luxuries as food and sleep. Both books are a MUST HAVE."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"Steakley takes all the old vampire lore and tosses it out the window. Just stakes thru the heart and sunlight. Crow and Felix are to of the most original characters I've ever read. For all his drinking and swearing, Crow shows his true humanity in his feelings for his comrades. The master vampires are mean,vicious and down right bloodthirsty. I read this book in two sittings. And thats only because I had to go to work. All in all it's a great read for fans of the genre."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect when I picked this one up, but it was great!

I loved the whole book!"},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"Alright...i've read this book five times now &lt;and counting&gt;. I love the plot. Jack Crow is a grand hero and taking him in with the rest of the team there could have been a winning series here. (especially the hint of werewolves hehe) The movie with James Woods is good, also, but it is NOT the book. The basic concept is there but that is it (and thats sketchy) I personally feel (along with one of my best friends) that the ending cheated us out of a toatlly wonderful book. I do love it but...but but but...the ENDING could have been handled so much better. The author seems to have gotten bored with his own story and twisted it so it would end."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"Vampires, by john steakley, is a great book with little things that could have made it something incredibly fantastic. First off, it's nothing like the movie, except for the first chapter or so. So dont start looking for similarities. It's actually better than the movie. If the movie had been just like this, it would definitly have gotton a lot further. The book has some great characters. my favorites have got to be Crow,for being tough as nails. Davette, for being a so heartwarming, and Felix, just cause he was so unusual. This book has some great action scenes that are greatly detailed and wisely written. It also has one 50 page chapter that just feel so erotic at first then makes you feel so frail. But you can FEEL it. It's great! My only gripe with this was that the characterization could have been just a little more detailed. I also would have liked the final battle scene with the master vampire to have been longer and more intricate than just 2 pages. Overall, this book ROCKS!!! I would definitely recommend it to fans of vampires or those into dark and violent sci-fi fantasy, like myself. If you fit that catagorie, THEN BUY THIS NOW!! YOU WON'T REGRET IT, I GUARANTEE YOU!!!"},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"Maybe its me, but when I read &quot;Armor&quot; I was very impressed, but I think Mr. Steakley needs to find some new caracters and names for his Heroes. Vampires$ was slow, spent to much time telling us how the vampire killers blew off steam and if &quot;Felix&quot; got anymore depressing it would have done us all a favor if the Vampire would have killed him. WHY would Vampires be in Texas, for the steers. Please. Write more like &quot;Armor&quot; but stay away from vampires. oh yah the movie SUCKED and I love John Carpenter."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"i was thrilled to see that someone didnt follow the anne rice tradition of romantisizing the vampire.Jack Crow is a hero in his own right.dont base your opinions on the movie...this one is a MUST read."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"This is one of the best books I've read in a long time. Even the fringe characters are three dimensional. The vampires are perfectly written to be the bad guys. They are Evil incarnate with a capital E...perfect villains. The heroes are tired, gritty, resigned to their destinies, and, more importantly, real. If you are looking for soul-jarring, bone-crushing, good-old-fashioned Good verses Evil, read this. PS The book is nothing like the movie; it has merit."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"This book was great, I read it after watching the film which was good as the film had no bearing on the book, if you like the book watch the film but do not envisage it as the same, there are characters in this book who stand out like Felix and they left him out of the film. all in all a top class book"},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"I reak this book because I read &quot;ARMOR&quot;. this book ranks right up there with armor"},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"It's been a while since I read the book. In fact, I lost the book, couldn't remember the name or author and when I saw the movie recently, it fell into place. But, you're right, there was some stuff cut out(duh..like any book turned movie). Nonetheless, the movie wasn't all bad. But, the book is definitely action-packed. Didn't we see more of the Slayers at the beginning, the original team? I don't remember. I thought they killed everybody rather quickly in the movie. Maybe I'll read the book again."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"I thought that this book was one of the best I've ever read! I have read many Anne Rice books about vampires, and heard that the movie for this book was awesome. I must say that this book is one that you can easily visualize the scenes as Steakley has them written, just reading the descriptions of the vampires deaths and such gave me the creeps! Awesome book. I'm about to start Armor now."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"Well, I'm not usually interested in vampire books due to the amount of other stuff out there, but this one blew me away!

I've never regretted buying this book. It's the best horror novel I have ever known and I'm proud to own this book."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"John Steakly may very well be the most interesting author that ever lived to think of such a compelling horror story and be able to put it into words makes that author very good. I saw the movie and loved it also, I have not read any other John Steakly books but definetly plan on it in the future. John thought of this book very well, and where did he come up with some of those names, there sweet, but weird. So i highly recomend this book to you if you like books with vampires it may very well be the best vampire book ever made. read it under your own risk though, it's scary!"},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"It's not often that one reviews a book about a team of vampire-hunting rednecks by talking about the emotional truth and core of the book. So I won't. It's there, though.This is a quick read, and one that you'll zip through after the first few pages. It concerns a man named Jack Crow, who is more or less the Vatican's official vampire killer in North America. Jack has been killing vampires for three years, which is the longest anyone's done that and survived. Jack is more than a little burned out--seeing everyone he's known for three years slaughtered by creatures that move faster than the human eye can track can take all the enthusiasm out of life.The most fascinating and realistic part of this book (to me) was that the vampire hunters just plain didn't know much about their prey (who are TOTAL EVIL, not misunderstood goths). Various plans are used over the course of the book, and some of them work. Many don't. There just isn't enough information to make a better plan.Anyway, if you hated the movie read the book. Carpenter managed to excise almost everything that made the book worth reading (including a character that Kurt Russell *should* have played) when he made his film."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"Ok folks, in brief let me say that I habitually re-read my favorite books. Bearing that in mind, for me to have read this one over 30 times is still an amazing feat. The characters are real, their reactions real, their emotions real, all of which makes the fantastic (and terrifying) situation they are in all the more striking. Some of my other favorite authors are Robert Jordan and Julian May, both critical favorites. John Steakley, with Vampire$, takes the top spot by far."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"This is possibly the best Vampire book that I have ever read. Forget about the Ann Rice vampire, forget about how the vampire &quot;feels&quot;. The vampires in this book are out for blood, human blood, Steakley never lets you forget that. What makes the book truly entertaining however is the psychology of the hunters. They know that death at the hands of a vampire isn't pleasn't, and they know that as hunters one day their luck will fail and their friends will have to drive a stake through their hearts. But they keep going Great book"},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"Vampire$ was a good book which I thought was well written. The main reason I decided to leave a review was to comment on an earlier review. The reviewer stated that he/she had stopped reading the book after 30 pages because of the foul language. I believe the langauge was meant to fill out the main character and show what kind of man he was (doing the job he did). It bothers me to see someone stop reading because of such a small point as language then comment (giving a bad rating 1#) on the book without having read the whole thing."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"I READ BOTH BOOKS ARMOR AND VAMPIRE$ AND I THOUGHT THEY WERE BOTH GREAT.

The first two chapters left me laughing like a lunatic on crack and completely entranced. Read the whole thing in one sitting. The description of the deputy in the jail nearly made me wet myself.On the more serious side, this work flew along and was action packed until you got into the scenes retelling the tale of the female protagonist. I found it rather blah for about 15 pages, then it picked right back up in the same hell-bent-for-leather style that made it so much fun to read.I recently saw the movie and brother....did that massacre a good book. I almost walked out half way through! I was ashamed the plot of the book was not upheld and that I had subjected my friends to such an awful defamation of a wonderful book.I recommend the book heartily!"},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"I picked up this book because of the qoute at the start. This book was amazing from start to end I could not put it down. If you are looking for something different in a vampire novel this is it.

If you were faced with a real Vampire who would you call... Vampire$!"},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"This book is very good. I tell you it is nothing like the movie at all accept for the names of two charecters and the fact that they kill vampires. The charecters are very interesting. Felix and Jack being the coolest.

Then we have Jack Crow a behemoth of a man who has spent so much time doing government work he can get away with basically anything. The story is a very good read I have read it four times now."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"This is one hell of a book. It's a heroic story about good vs. evil, but the good guys are human, and don't want to be there. They're big manly heroes, but very human. That's what sets this book apart from many Vampire books. The heroes aren't unstoppable forces for truth and good, they're people doing what they do best, and doing what they must do. The Vampires are ungodly (pun not intended), and the methods needed to slay them, extreme. The methods needed to slay the Vampires are part of the fun of the book, which makes this a must buy for all fans of vampire hunting fiction. Plus it is riddled with absolutely hysterical humor, and an intense story. This book does it all, action, emotion, humor, story."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"Man, I hated all vamps stories, but then I loved the movie. I even bought a used copy from Blockbuster. A few days ago a got this book, and I couldn't stop reading. Good for a hot afternoon in the couch!

From beggining to end it will draw you in with the exploits of Jack Crow and his band of merry vampire hunters. It starts with intense action and it doesn't stop there. The plot is genuinly captivating and orignal with interesting characters and blend of horror and action. You've got people you would love to hate, or just want to hold. You have words so well writen that they breath life into a tale so well done you will find it hard to put down. As all books go, Vampire$ is far from perfect, at points you'll want to just give up, but then it gets so much better, you'll wonder why it crossed your mind. Some of the characters are artifical, but for the most part Steakly does a good job of going deeper than just a standard hero and villian story. You'll also find the end far from dissapointing. I reccommend Vampire$ to anyone who loves a good story, and I even recommend the movie. Sure you will be dissapointed if you expect the book, but John Carpenter does make a very interesting premise, and you'll love James Woods portrayal of Jack Crow."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"The most interesting characters in the book were the vampires ,although the reader gets only a small taste of the life the creatures lead.(Although the small portion of the book devoted to one vampires life is fantastic). Instead the pages focus on a bunch of human characters making alot of small talk and doing alot of thinking out loud. With six to eight characters going back and forth thinking and talking the pages are a jumbled mess, almost unreadable. Last but not least I don't care for inconsistencies. If a vampire can rip through steal like paper then he or she can certainly dirty there hands and dig a hole, they are not going to be forced to come out in the sunlight by a few knucklheads."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"This is definitely one of those cases. First of all I am a huge vampire fan. I don't go so far as to dress as one, but I am a big fan nevertheless. I've watched the John Carpenter film before I read the book. The stories are not related at all, a big plus for the book. I loved the story of the novel and it's unique approach to vampire slaying which thankfully, made it to the film. Now for the bad. The writing felt like it was written by a child. Not even in a simplistic innocent way, but by some fifth grader doing his best horror-noir impression. The character development really suffers from this, as well as the dialogue. I found myself confused with a lot of the scenes, having to flip back a few pages just to clarify what had just transpired.Overall, I'd say stay far away. Try I Am Legend by Richard Matheson, which even though written in 1954, still delivers the goods for a vampire novel."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"This is the best Vampire book I have ever read.Very Very good Read !"},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"Best vampire book I've ever read.

And &quot;John Carpenter's Vampires&quot; is just that--a movie &quot;very&quot; loosely based on Steakley's book. Can't wait 'til they do it right the next time. Anyway, have fun with this book.

During the time when things were totally Rice infested, it was nice to see a movie about vampires with balls. After watching the movie again last month I decided to finally check out the book the movie was supposedly based on. This may have been a mistake. First off, the book and the movie are two entirely different beasts. The only thing Carpenter really takes from the book is Jack Crowes name and the fact that Jack runs a group of vampire hunters. Other than that, Carpenter basically created his own story altogether, in fact I'm not even sure why they claim the movie is based on the book. As for the books story, it isn't horrible but most of the characters are fleshed out in a very mediocre fashion. The author spends a considerable amount of time to describe one characters history while never fleshing out some of the bigger characters in the book. To keep this short, this is one of the few times that I have to say the movie is a lot better than the book. Steve Niles has a far better grasp on writing vampire fiction than Steakley, so check out Rumors of the Undead instead of this flacid attempt at vampire fiction. One other thing, the movie went out of its way to not touch upon the whole Anne Rice vampire look, there were no billowy white shirts and pirate pants going on in Carpenters classic. The book however, the vampires dress exactly like Lestat. I think Steakley may have read one to many Rice novels prior to writing this book.Just sayin'"},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"I was very disappointed with the expletives used LIBERALLY throughout the book.

Having just read this book immediately after reading _Armor_, however, it is clear to me that both books are meant to be variations on an &quot;Eternal Champion&quot; theme. Not only do the names of its two main characters repeat (John Crow and &quot;Felix&quot;), but there are other clear indictions throughout the text of this intent. Both books, by the way, are excellent. Now, if Steakley would just write more in this pantheon -- or anything else, for that matter!

I enjoyed the characters of Jack Crow and Felix, the balls to the wall vampire hunter and the old west gunfighter, kind of the new to the old twist. The book makes the vampires out to be more the monsters they are then in old movies and that heroes can have bad days too and don't always win over evil."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely. It doesn't give in to the 'Anne Rice' version of the vampire; none of this 'noble vampire' absurdity. The vampires in Vampire$ are not noble, misunderstood fellows, they're monsters, dark and evil and without the slightest mercy or humanity in their hearts. The vampire hunters are believable, too- i particularly enjoyed the Jack Crow, Cherry Cat and Felix characters, even though they were a wee bit too macho and overblown. The book accurately depicts the horrible fears and stresses placed on the vampires, but as a trade-off, it's a little depressing. Also, drinking, cussing, and violence abounds- proceed at your own risk. There are several flaws and poorly done sections to this book, but overall, this is an interesting and thoughful adventure. I enjoyed the quality of the writing and plot, as well. Highly recommended. Also, read Steakley's earlier book, Armor,which in many ways is even better."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"John Steakley doesn't miss a beat in this bone-crushing novel of combat, friendships, and the miseries of living and dying that follow the professional vampire hunter. Most of the book is fast-paced and keeps you hooked, although there is a lull here and there. This isn't the type of vampire novel where vampires run around kissing people and singing \\"Kum-bi-yah\\" like Dracula did in the horrible movie remake of Bram Stoker's excellent book (Poor old Bram must've rolled over in his grave, especially since they called the movie \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\"). Unfortunately, Steakley's book, Vampire$, was similarly mutilated via a John Carpenter C-section when it was reborn on the big screen. Anyway, the point here is that John Steakley's vampires aren't poor, misunderstood, fuzzy creatures that just need love and kindness. They're completely evil, ruthless, and powerful, and thus require hard, dangerous men to hunt them down and kill them. That's what Team Crow (Based on the name of Jack Crow, the main character) does for a living. In a sense, Team Crow is like a special forces team, but trained to kill vampires instead of people (And don't try to tell me that \\"Vampires are people,too.\\"). Anyway, it's a great read if you like some action and a lot of raw, intense combat. I also recommend ARMOR, also by John Steakley- totally different genre (ARMOR is sci-fi) but a great book.See you all at the ANTWAR saloon.Until then,Rock and Roll."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"First off, how can you not like a vampire novel with the name of the author is Steakly. *LOL*. You know it's going to be a good read.Before I get started, I just wanted to say how bad the movie to this book is. If you've seen the movie, and not sure if you want to read the book, I urge you to forget the horrid movie, and sit back and enjoy VAMPIRE$.Meet Jack Crow. Crow has a foul mouth, quick temper, liked his wiskey, and is a vampire hunter. He hunts vampires for money, a lot of it. The reader will accompany Crow on a few slayings. You'll meet his team and get to know the characters, and their background. I really liked the char. Cat, what a hoot. He's adds a lot to this book. What impressed me the most was they last slaying that the reader will read about. The Team has to come up aganist a master vampire...at night. Why you ask? Read the book and find out.Steakly has an amazing writing style. Through interesting plot twists, and fasntastic char the reader will be drawn in and will be fighting to put the book down.

While this premise may not be the most original and demands some significant leaps in logic, it has the potential of being the basis of a good, no nonsense, blood and guts, good versus evil vampire story - in other words, a real fun read. There are several action scenes in the book that almost live up that that potential. Unfortunately, the rest of the book, which is most of it, is padding. The characters are two-dimensional and cliched and their motivations unexplained or unconvincing. None of the characters is fleshed out enough to cause the reader to care about them."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"This book to me was a mash up of horror, Tarantino-esque storytelling and a spaghetti western. This is a very good thing. The story follows Jack Crow, a former DEA agent turned Vatican sponsored vampire hunter for profit and his team of vampire hunters. The story starts with a successful day of vampire hunting followed by the team getting slaughtered by a very pissed off master vampire that same evening. The surviving members, Cherry Cat, Crow, Carl and Annabelle rebuild the team with a new tough as nails priest, a deadly gunman/former drug runner and a rookie deputy sherriff and go looking for some revenge. The story is well written with great dialog and real characters. The team drinks, smokes and parties hard and acts even harder. They also have a true dread of what they do and live like today is the day they die. My only problem is the pacing of the story. It starts out strong, and towards the end, there is a chapter (interlude) that slows the story to a halt. The interlude could have been summed up in two or three pages. Either way, this was a great story. I easily recommended Vampire$ to horror fans or vampire novel fans. At least real monster vampire fans, not the lame Twilight/True Blood sort."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"While never been a very good reader. I recently have begun to engulf myself in reading anything that intrests me that I can get my hands on. Even going back to the library. (which I hadnt done sice high School) I picked this up from the local book/movie store for about 3$. Not sure how good of a read it was going to be.I was thrilled!! This was amazing. The characters are vivid, real, and as personal as being with close friends. Even tho they all wish they were true tough guys. Annabell is one heck of a lady, tending to all these 'boys'. Which realy touched me. Im like Annabell some times im the only girl in my house of 4 boys!Im sure wishing this came in Kindle format. Since Im expecting my new Kindle in the mail tomarrow. I would definately read this book again."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"Like most people who eventually try to find this book I think, I had read Armor first and was hoping that Vampires would somehow trump that fantastic experience. It doesn't. The book is still interesting to read (I had trouble putting it down), but I don't believe the characters are nearly as interesting as those in Armor. I don't believe the characters are nearly as well fleshed out, they feel like sketches that the author tried to build a plot line around, but can't quite support the weight. This book would benefit from another hundred pages.It can be rude in parts, but I don't think it's that big of a deal. It does have the same John Steakley feel: \\"I won't give you the exact details of the context, so you'll have to pick it up from context clues.\\"I enjoyed it."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"If you've seen the movie, forget all about it while you read this book. Nothings the same except a couple character names and one or two scenes. This is one of the better Vampire books around, altho the psychological aspects didn't come through as much as they did in Armor (a 5 star book which every sci-fi fan should read). The little references to Armor (Felix &amp; Jack Crow, the Antwar bar) are cute but actually detracted from it for me"},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"Loud, proud and full of adventure. A well written story of Vampires with such a seductive,bittersweet agony and the Men who hunt them. This is a general review. I would not want to spoil your pleasure by giving any away. All I can say is 'Supernatural.'"},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"It's not your typical story. Nothing is predictable, the characters are memorable, and the story is unbelievable. Good versus evil. It sounds like a simple concept, one that has been done a million times before. Steakley's vision of a world of vampires that are more than able to fight for their existence as as they are perscuted by the Vatican. It is the characters who face a seemingly invincible foe who possesses an intellect armed with an incredible weapon - knowledge of who is after them and why. This is what makes this story so facinating, the hero's are not the only one's capable of logic. It is a story that doesn't ignore reality while staying true to the legend of vampires. An excellent read with an anti-Hollywood ending."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"I read at least 200 books a year and this has become one of my favorites of all time. Vampire$ is one of the few books out there that you can not put down once you open it. It has great characters and storylines and should become a classic horror novel along with the likes of &quot;IT&quot;, &quot;Dragon Tears&quot;, and &quot;Dracula&quot;. All in all the books rocks!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"I had just seen Blade and it reminded me of Vampires. So I did some Vampires searching on the net. I thought it was a good change of pace from the traditional vampire novels. I shudder at the thought of some one who is a vampire fan not likeing this book. It is still my favorite form of the media vampire. There isn't a movie or book that tops it.Mike McKayIf any body knows of a sequel to it please email me, or if they want to comment on my review."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"Although not the quintessential vampire book, and drawing more on the Americanized vampire than than those of classic literature and mythology, this book had me laughing and crying and clapping throughout. I enjoyed this book so much that I read it five times over a six month period.Though it is by no means a small book, Vampire$ packs a great amount of character development into it's relatively tiny package. In addition, the flashbacks add a great amount of depth that would otherwise be lacking.This book reads like an action movie is viewed...it is a definite page turner, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a fun read. I don't recommend it to those who think they know it all about vampires."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"Great Idea! Vampires exist; they are evil incarnate; the Vatican knows about them and hires mercenaries to deal with them. The book is best when it is dealing with the mercenary team doing its work. Facinating! It loses steam when it branches out to the Felix story and to the love interest. Also, I did not care for the dispatch of the key vampires. Steakley spends the entire book building our interest in the two main ones. One goes out very ordinarily, one goes out in a paragraph and a third that we did not know about takes out Crowe. But I pick. This book was fun! I can hardly wait for the movie."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"GOOD GOD !!!!!!!!!! I LOVE THIS BOOK !!!!!!!!!! I just read the novel by John Steakley...WOW... ABSOLUTE Genious!!!..better than the slow n' sluggish &quot;literary classics&quot; like Dracula or Interview with the Vampire. This book puts you over the edge...once you start reading..you can't put it down...God I hope Steakley makes a sequel ???!!! Any fans please email me"},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"I just finished reading this book at around 5:00 am this morning and I have to say that it was one of the best I've read. With a great premise and excellent execution of the plot, right down to the action and battle scenes. This book was a complete value and I heartily suggest you pick it up and give it a chance. It was wonderful."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"Steakley's &quot;Vampire$&quot; is not a book for the philosophic. Instead, it broaches the idea of the vampire as a monster. Gone are the ponderings of the more inactive protagonist (such as Louie in &quot;Interview...&quot;) and instead we meet, and learn to care, about a group of hunters who try not to think too much about what they do! It is only through action that they all attempt to deal with situations which would drive a normal man mad. This wonderful blend of human personalities linked to the common cause, the erradication of Vampires, made for a new slant at an old genre. It is worth the read."},{"Title":"Vampire$: A Novel","review":"From Jack Crow's opening epigram to the richly realized denouement in which the material expression of evil incarnate collides with that of good incarnate, this novel is a streak down a dark highway atop the blade of the sharpest knife you can find. The characters are filled with unresolved anger and guilt; they are credible and affecting. The book never descends into cheap gore for effect, nor does it take the ascetic route. Steakley has wed the abstract and material on a level to which best-selling horror authors aspire but rarely achieve. I bought it just after it was released. I'm still scratching my head trying to figure out why this novel hasn't become a BIG BESTSELLER. Maybe it has, and I missed the furor. Probably the best (and most well written) Vampire novel I've ever read."},{"Title":"Global Beat Fusion: The History of the Future of Music","review":"I loved it!

An interesting perspective on the global music scene and its evolution"},{"Title":"Global Beat Fusion: The History of the Future of Music","review":"Talk about having your finger on the pulse! Derek Beres has both hands and feet on it. Beres dives deep into the world music world and makes a compelling case for his thesis that the music we will be listening to in the future (and many of us are already listening--and dancing--to) will belong to no single national or culture but instead will be a true global fusion of influences, styles, attitudes and, of course, sounds. Beres explains the relationship of the traditional to the progressive, puts the music into its proper spiritual and cultural perspective and, most of all, brings it to life with vivid descriptions and poignant insights. No dry hype-filled treatise on the latest pop trends, Global Beat Fusion is a living, breathing guide to a place we haven't yet been but will be visiting very soon."},{"Title":"Global Beat Fusion: The History of the Future of Music","review":"If you like yoga and you like music, you'll love this book! It's anabsolute must!"},{"Title":"Three ways of thought in ancient China","review":"This work is one of the very few great English language classics in the exposition of traditional Chinese thought. It is delightful reading. Its author, Arthur Waley, remains long after his death the premier translator of traditional Chinese and Japanese literature. The pleasure of reading this book for the first time, years ago, influenced me in great measure to complete a doctorate in Far Eastern Languages and Civilizations. Today, it is the first book I recommend that my students read as an introduction to traditional Chinese thought; the book gives a clear glimpse of the value systems of people in China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and Singapore right down to today. Three Ways of Thought in Ancient China, by Arthur Waley, is a book not to be missed by any educated person. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Three ways of thought in ancient China","review":"Mr. Arthur Waley has proven that a good work can stand the test of time. First published almost 60 years ago this work does a wonderful jobof explianing the differences between various schools of thought not just in China but in the rest of Asia.The differences between the teachings of Chuang Tzu, Mencius and The realists may not seem like much to us westerners but these three groups have all done a lot to shape Asia.The thing I like most about this book is that it is short and broken up into three parts. Therefore your mind doesn't do a blowout trying to digest all the material and you can study each school indivudally.Overall-Great book, most of the stories are very deep and will hold some meaning for everyone if you are just willing to listen."},{"Title":"Three ways of thought in ancient China","review":"If ancient Chinese philosophy is new territory for you, definitely start by reading this book. Arthur Waley's style is very readable, combining short translations with insightful commentary and analysis. I found the stories from Chuang Tzu to be especially entertaining. Before this, I read Waley's translations of \\"The Analects of Confucius\\" and the \\"Tao Te Ching\\". These were good but they left me with more questions than answers and they were a good deal drier in their approaches. For those with a casual interest in Chinese philosophy this book will scratch your itch. For those interested in learning more it will guide you in right direction. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Three ways of thought in ancient China","review":"It's easy to give short shrift to a book that hopes to summarize three major traditions of philosophy in just over 200 pages. What makes this brilliant is Waley's assembling views of Daoist, Confucist and Realist thinking in the form of imaginary colloquia between the various philosophers.The result is an introduction, for the Western reader, to the rich and highly conflicted intellectual background of Chinese civilization.As China becomes more of a world power, this little book, even without mention of Maoist thought and legacy will remain a good, short introduction to the foundations of that world.Lynn Hoffman, author of bang BANG"},{"Title":"Three ways of thought in ancient China","review":"Three Ways of Thought in Ancient China is a book that opens the door to Chinese philosophy. Some of the writing may be familiar, such as Confucius while other lagalist writing sounds more Machiavellian. A good book for an introduction to Chinese philosophy, much of it reads like poetry."},{"Title":"Creating Textures in Pen and Ink with Watercolor","review":"This is a wonderful book for anyone interested in pen &amp; ink drawing. Instead of trying to explain techniques in detailed text, it shows you step by step with color illustrations. It is written for all levels &amp; the instructions are easy to follow.There is information on types of lines, value and contrast. A wide variety of techniques are also covered. These include, dry surface, damp surface, wet on wet, spatter, blotting, impression, stamping and salt &amp; alcohol.It shows how to draw &amp; paint metallic objects (gold, silver, iron, rust), baskets, pottery, brick, stone, marble, granite, textiles, clouds, weather, earth textures, rocks, wood, trees, leaves, foliage, flowers, fruit, &amp; eggs.Another section includes instruction on drawing transparent objects such as glass, eyes and many varieties of water. There is also a section on animals covering butterflies, animal hair, scales &amp; feathers."},{"Title":"Creating Textures in Pen and Ink with Watercolor","review":"A better title would have been, &quot;Creating Textures in Pen &amp; Ink, Enhanced with Watercolor.&quot; 75% of each texture comes down to &quot;make a detailed ink drawing&quot;. The other 25% is enhancing that ink drawing with watercolor. The pen &amp; ink predominates everywhere. If this is the style of drawing you desire (e.g., detailed drawings where pen&amp;ink predominates), then you will probably give this book 4 to 5 stars. I was looking for watercolor texture techniques and was disapointed.With that said, the drawings are very well executed and the instruction quality moderate. The author relies too heavily on step-by-step examples as a teaching tool. The addition of color greatly enhances the pen &amp; ink drawings, with spectacular results."},{"Title":"Creating Textures in Pen and Ink with Watercolor","review":"As a new botanical illustrator working in mostly in watercolor I have often found rendering realistic fine detail and texture a difficult and frustrating task. This marvelous book introduces the artist to a new approach that produces detail and textural effects that are both effective and fairly easy to achive.The illustations are beautiful and the explanatory text is clear, to the point, and easy to follow. The book is well organized; starting with the various pen and ink methods and how they can be combined with watercolor techniques. This is followed by the demonstration of how these techniques can be applied to achive realistic rendering of multitudes of surface textures from apples to zebras and almost everything in between.."},{"Title":"Creating Textures in Pen and Ink with Watercolor","review":"I recently checked this book out from the library and found it to be an excellent resource for me, a student new to these media.

Good for the well-seasoned beginner."},{"Title":"Creating Textures in Pen and Ink with Watercolor","review":"Although I think art instruction books should be owned in their paper versions, I bought a few on my Kindle for practical reasons. I'm about to relocate overseas and knowing how much it costs to ship your stuff, it's always better to travel as light as possible. My problem with all the books containing illustrations (and especially this one) is that the formatting is just awful. Although it is clearly stated that this book is optimized for larger screens, the size and resolution of the pictures are smaller than you can imagine. Not only are the images tiny but they are of very low quality. On the Kindle for PC software, you don't even have an option to zoom in on the pictures (maybe the developers should think about this for an upcoming update) so you are stuck trying to decipher Claudia Nice's explanations. Yes, most of the \\"text\\" in this book is in the form of images! Instead of keeping just the pictures and reformatting the text so you could change its size, the publisher went the lazy way and just scanned the whole pages which resulted some sort of a low resolution pdf-like book that you can't zoom in. The \\"Look Inside\\" preview is a trick as the very few pictures that you have access to are much better than those in the actual kindle book. I feel like I've been ripped off. The worst part is you can't even return the book."},{"Title":"Creating Textures in Pen and Ink with Watercolor","review":"Painting with Watercolor, Pen & InkWARNING!!!! I purchased both the referenced books by Cladia Nice thinking that the two books would be different.

The author should remove the smaller book for sale and/or be very clear that by purchasing the title \\"Painting with Watercolor ...\\" the customer would receive the same materials and save about $20.00.

Thank you so much."},{"Title":"Creating Textures in Pen and Ink with Watercolor","review":"I bought this book when I was just beginning watercolor. The book is awesome to look at, but a bit on the overwhelming side for someone just beginning watercolor. However, the contents of the book is well worth the investment.I had experience in the distant past with pen &amp; ink and was fascinated at the way that Mrs. Nice put the two mediums together for very realistic pictures.There are pages with many illustrations of examples of textures in each medium, and many contrasting examples of textures using the same object so that you can easily compare the different effects of each technique. I find these pages invaluable and something that I refer to over and over. These reference pages are worth the price of the book.However, once you get past these pages, there are breathtaking examples with many notes listing colors used and information useful for duplicating the same texture. The topics range from natural subjects, to man-made subjects, such as marbles, glass, rusted metal, and blue jeans!Also of great interest to me is the small section of eyes from both man and animal.This book is a treasure trove of information for anyone interested in capturing realistic textures of almost anything. It is a book that you will not only gaze at for fun, but also refer to again and again."},{"Title":"Creating Textures in Pen and Ink with Watercolor","review":"The information is good but nothing out of the ordinary and nothing more than one would expect a beginner watercolorist to know. The illustrations exemplifying how to apply the techniques are unimpressive. 90% of the illustrations are mediocre, the hatching is repetitive and the end result looks like every subject depicted is made of the same texture; namely hairy lines.

I'm really trying to like the kindle versions of books. (I have Kindle for Mac) They just aren't working out for me. This book is filled with PICTURES of hand written TEXT - that means you can not zoom in on the kindle version and you can't see what the hand writing says.An example of what I'm talking about can be seen if you go to the \\"Look Inside\\" section for this book and look at the hand writing on the page with the pelican heads or on the page with the leaf and rocks. Then hit the zoom out button on the browser ONE time. On my Kindle that is how small the print is. If you can read those lines the book will probably work for you. Remember you can't zoom in or out of pictures on the Kindle.Also, just in case someone working for Amazon reads this - Seriously! it would be so easy for you guys to allow the computer to read text to speech.

Claudia Nice is a master of the pen and ink medium and the instructions and illustrations in her book make this an essential addition to any artist's library.As do most technical books, she begins with a listing of materials needed to accomplish the techniques that follow, and some basic application techniques, pretty standard for any such book. Although I do not so easily dismiss the crow quill dip as she does, it is a matter of little disagreement. I find rapidographs somewhat limiting, but what of that? It is a minor thing, a matter of personal taste.What follows the introduction is nothing short of extraordinary as she demonstrates techniques for achieving the textures of wood, stone, water, hair ... all exceedingly useful in that artists and illustrators are constantly called upon to produce them. These are practical techniques that every illustrator needs to know.The table of contents provides a sampling of the kinds of techniques covered from the illusion of transparent objects, the glisten of metals, the textures of vegetation and how to create full landscapes. It is richly illustrated and the narrative is just detailed enough to inform but not so much as to be ponderous. Instructions are specific to each illustration, so this is an excellent quick-reference when you need a specific texture in your work, but I highly recommend reading it through first. The wealth of information presented here is such that you will put it to use immediately. I will be returning to it frequently in my illustration work."},{"Title":"Creating Textures in Pen and Ink with Watercolor","review":"I like alot of the techniques in the book.

Claudia Nice provides us with plenty of visual examples of the techniques she uses. She covers a variety of subject matter from still life to landscape.

The remaining chapters are divided into types of textures and techniques, i.e., metal, fur, trees, skies, etcetera. This is where I found myself wishing for more detailed instruction. Don't get me wrong, the information that is provided is useful and the images show nice pen & ink detail, I just want more detail about how to accomplish the textures shown with watercolor. I would also like (and expected) to see at least 3 or 4 more step-by-steps as on p.37 with the surf and ocean waves.

Some pages illustrate the two- or three-step process to complete a scene (sunrise, breaking surf) or feature (wooden shakes, stone wall, polished silver, eyes) - that's very helpful.

A must for any visionary."},{"Title":"Making the Gods Work for You: The Astrological Language of the Psyche","review":"This is a terrible book! There, I've said it. Very bold words to say in light of all the other rave reviews. I hope I can explain myself...&quot;Making the Gods Work for You&quot; tries tackle more than your basic sun-sign astrology book. It covers your birth chart, which is comprised of all the planets positions relative to your birth time and location.To me this means covering three items:1) The role and psychology associated with each of the eight other planets, the sun and the moon.2) The types of astrological interplay. This is a neat way of saying it means something special when three planets align in a triangle, or four planets in a square, or two planets &quot;crossing&quot; each other, and so on.3) How to determine your own birth chart.As you can guess the book falls down in at least one of these categories for me.The good news is the book excels at the basic explanation of the planets; associated personality types, inner strengths and struggles, etc. Very well written and a quite enjoyable read.The book provides a reference to a website where a free, basic birth chart can be obtained online.However, the book fails utterly at connecting the two. There is no explanation of the meaning behind the planets' relative positions. None. Nada.Maybe all nine planets were aligned at my birth time. Or they form two perfect squares. Who knows what that means? Not you from reading this book.Of course you _could_ pay money on the website to get this explained... ;-)"},{"Title":"Making the Gods Work for You: The Astrological Language of the Psyche","review":"What kind of cognitive dissonance must the author have suffered when Pluto was downgraded from a planet? Her made-up babblings about the connection of the planets to psychology are too goofy for anyone who knows anything about astrology or psychology. At least she is right about astrology being connected to mythology. You can see and hear the author babbling in person on YouTube.There are so many good books on Amazon, it's a shame that space (and paper and ink) would be wasted on this book."},{"Title":"Making the Gods Work for You: The Astrological Language of the Psyche","review":"With Saturn as my ruling planet and in a placement in my natal chart that I find rather uncomfortable, I always have found myself living with Saturn as my weakness.&quot;My Saturn's in my __ th house, sorry I just can't do that task&quot;.Ms. Casey's book offers a new manner of looking at your planets, seeing them not as weaknesses but as opportunities and gives the reader hints on how to find their positive aspects.I highly recommend this book for anyone who has felt controlled by any part of their chart or boxed in to a corner...or worst yet...forever stuck with what you were given natally."},{"Title":"Making the Gods Work for You: The Astrological Language of the Psyche","review":"A very intelligent, practical friend of mine makes astrology part of her life. (How did she know i'd find my dream job in June?) Well, to understand astrologicial thinking better, i bought this book. Very lively writing, clear, with quality humor. The author writes many things i've heard previously only from my friend, not from other astrology books. I read bits of it over the phone to my friend, later brought it to her. Now she's having a great time reading it, and i'm still waiting to get it back....THAT's a sign of a good book!"},{"Title":"Making the Gods Work for You: The Astrological Language of the Psyche","review":"This book is recommended for astrological novices and those with a general interest in metaphysics. Casey manages to put a fresh face on the main components of astrology (signs, houses, aspects; but the majority of the book is devoted to the planets) in present-day english and with a decent sense of humor. Casey incorporates mythology and beliefs from around the world to give her writing a well-rounded and comprehensive feel. She also gives equal time to both the benefic and malefic influences of each of the planets. Those with more than a beginner's level knowledge of astrology will probably be somewhat disappointed with this book, as its focus is on the psychological and spiritual. A well-written chapter with some chart examples would have shown readers the earthly applications of Casey's spiritual concepts, and could have made this book a much-used astrological teaching primer."},{"Title":"Making the Gods Work for You: The Astrological Language of the Psyche","review":"I'm a professional astrologer....this is required reading for all my students.

Kay"},{"Title":"Making the Gods Work for You: The Astrological Language of the Psyche","review":"This is an outstanding reference book on the meaning of astrology and of each constellation and planet. While I've read parts of it straight through just out of interest, it's even more helpful and interesting when I have a question about a particular constellation or planet and really want to get more understanding.The author has a more powerful purpose for astrology than allowing one to find out what's going to happen. The author feels that the importance of astrology is that it can one attune one to the forces guiding our lives and so work more in alignment with them, capitalize on them even. Thus the title, \\"Making the Gods Work for You.\\" This is a much more powerful look at astrology than the usual.The writing style is also unusual. It's in the direction of stream of consciousness as if the author is channeling the cosmic consciousness, a deep source of eternal knowledge -- which she may well be doing. Sometimes the writing is poetic and/or funny. While the book is well-organized into each constellation and planet, due to the writing style, it can be slow-going. So, I usually read a few pages at a time as I need the information. I've needed to re-read parts over and over so that I can take in section as a whole, kind of like being able to swallow a bite of food rather than just read a logical description of what it tastes like.This is an outstanding reference book for attaining deep understanding of each planet and constellation as well as astrology itself."},{"Title":"Making the Gods Work for You: The Astrological Language of the Psyche","review":"I love this book:)Caroline is an inspirational Astrologer and author. She creates in this book some wonderful imagery and insights. She offers practical spiritual solutions to the age-old problems of life itself.The book starts with the signs of the Zodiac and then is divided into 'the planets' going backwards from Pluto.I liked the way Caroline adds her quirky experiences around the world, including what happened when she climbed up a Great Pyramid...She adds lots of rituals for various planetary challenges, which I especially enjoyed. You would have to be into the more esoteric side of life to enjoy this book, which for me added to it's charm.Super!"},{"Title":"Making the Gods Work for You: The Astrological Language of the Psyche","review":"This book is a delight. Caroline Casey has a degree in semiotics and a marvelous wit, describing planetary energies through anecdotes, myths, and sacred wisdom, all with a light heart, and a reverent irreverence.Perhaps it's best to share a quote. I take this from the section on Uranus:&quot;To grow shiitake mushrooms, one plants the spores in a stick and lets it sit for a year. Then you must strenuously pound the stick to awaken the dormant life within. For the same reason, during midlife and Uranus transits, we get pounded. Like the spores, we are comfortably snoozing when suddenly, &quot;What the...?!&quot; Thump! Thump! Thump!We invoke Uranus by posing the question, &quot;If I feel agitated, restless, or on the brink of a discovery, where in my life do I want lightning to strike?....&quot;If you've got your basics down and want to know more about the planets, or about your transits, this book is such a good choice."},{"Title":"Making the Gods Work for You: The Astrological Language of the Psyche","review":"I chanced upon this book going for half-price in an Australian self-help centre. Had I not stopped to look beyond the cheesy purple cover, I would have missed one of the most intriguing and thought-provoking adventures in astrology ever.The difference between reading an academician's view in astrology and that of a layman is huge. For those who aren't ready to go straight into the depth and heaviness of Liz Greene, and want to get out of the tabloid astrology type reading, yet don't want to read candid, matter-of-fact portrayals such as Linda Goodman puts it, Caroline Casey provides a fresh, witty, reverent and yet playful spin on the planets and signs. It's the difference between reading Jung's academic works and reading his made-for-the-normal-person 'Man and His Symbols'.Treating each planet in terms of archetypes, suggesting little rituals for honouring each, and drawing on her own experiences as well as that of myth, it's not your average read. What I especially love is her playful writing style, as well as her comprehensive treatments of each planet.For instance, with the difficult Pluto, Casey redefines what it means to deal with the trials of death, rebirth and transformation: she teaches how to honour the darkness, describes the stages of descent, to release control through broad techniques of ritual and incantations, leaving it up to the reader to do as she wishes.This is not a how-to book, but is for the person who wants to see how these archetypes play out in her life, and how to honour them whilst struggling through them, and realising, as Casey says at the end, 'making the gods you.'"},{"Title":"Making the Gods Work for You: The Astrological Language of the Psyche","review":"Beware! Yes, be aware. A spell has been cast and tossed into the sea of eternity. There is no escape. What fun. We have a conspiracy of mystics here. I have listened to Caroline Casey's radio program. Although she is clearly creative, intelligent and entertaining, often I have found it redundant, even bording contrite - due mostly to the callers. I always had the feeling that if Caroline could emerse herself in the extended contemplation and focus that comes with writing a book, we would get a truly valuable piece of work. And so it is. Making the Gods Work for You is a living, breathing, dancing alchemy. Fun, insigtful and practical. Whether you know the language of Astrology or not, makes no difference. One thing that got a me smile out of me is how she likes to use the word fierce alot. I did not find anything fierce about it. Dynamic, yes. What was imparted throughout the book is a graceful, delicate, in-depth and respectful offering of the fullness and magic of life. She enters honestly into all the dimensions of ourselves as represented by the signs and planets and invites the reader to explore, experiment, doubt and dance with the scariest parts of ourself - from the most condemend to the most reverent - seducing us into the undeniable understanding that each contains the other. As an astrologer, I was particularly taken with the form of the book. It's inside out. My favorite arrangement. After the usual intro/preparation she begins the journey with Pluto. Wonderful. She then moves on to the rest of the outer planets and closes with the Sun. The layering effect is rich and full of surprises, taking the reader on a juicy pilgrimage, from here to here. She has really contributed a valuable service to our world. Read this book and have gobs of fun."},{"Title":"Making the Gods Work for You: The Astrological Language of the Psyche","review":"Caroline Casey's book is not a technical read! And yet... she conveys the intricate pattern of planetary influence with a depth that keeps me coming back to this book. She has stories that include ways of honoring particularly intense transits. For so many, learning astrology is not what they want to do. They want to understand their chart. If you have been told that you are going through a transit and you want more practical information for what that might look like... this is your book. If you are an astrologer... this book brings it back to the fine patterns in the sand that you just do not see in the other - very fine - books designed to break it down by study. What you will not get is a cooking recipe for planet in sign to house.... etc. I find myself coming back, frequently to this book to regain the respect that can be lost in too much study!"},{"Title":"Making the Gods Work for You: The Astrological Language of the Psyche","review":"A really fun book to read, Caroline has filled it to the brim with astrological and mythological information. She's one of the best writers on the subject, possessing an informed and likeable voice which she uses to teach true practical magic. She makes you realize that magic is still alive and within us all, sleeping within the subconscious, there to be used for self-transformation. If you're even remotely interested in the language of astrology, and enjoy reading authors who love the english language and use it beautifully, this is the book for you."},{"Title":"Making the Gods Work for You: The Astrological Language of the Psyche","review":"I have listened to the three hour tape completely and am in the process of listening again. I imagine I will listen to it often. What a gift this is! Caroline has so much to say and she says it packed full of wisdom that I cannot absorb it in just one sitting. I am entranced! I will be looking for more of her work soon. I want to really grasp her thoughts on this course before I go further, but further I must go! WOW Caroline's gift for weaving her subjects together left me spellbound. The way she forms her thoughts, voice strong and sure, intellect abounds, yet magickal in her delivery with bits of humor throughout. I find myself enraptured with not only her message but with the way in which she gives it. I hope that one day I might be able to attend a seminar given by her. And, the music interjected is wonderful. I find myself singing (a bit off key but when that happens I only sing louder!) We are the Witches.. I am a reader. I love the written word and have shied away from books on tape. What a grave mistake this was - fore I have found this tape to be a joyous experience especially while trapped in my car. I look forward to bumper to bumper traffic - so I may listen more deeply, red lights do not insight anger or frustration at time wasted, but rather quiet rapture, as I listen to her speak of Gods, Peoples, Dreams and Planets. It has made astrology something that I can enjoy, a way of learning that is no longer dry and boring. She has opened my eyes and allowed me to dream more. So for now rather than just awaking from the surface - I will also dream the depths. Ashe"},{"Title":"Making the Gods Work for You: The Astrological Language of the Psyche","review":"What makes this more than a sun-sign summary of astrology is the framework Casey has developed. She draws on classical astrology as well as Jungian thought, Buddhism, and other traditions to synthesize a larger perspective. Also evident is her own practice as an astrologer for many years. She writes from experience here, on several levels, so that her understanding of the planets, houses, and signs is multi-dimensional. she makes clear that astrology is a sequence of psychological and spiritual processes, not trite &quot;predictions.&quot; Like alchemy, the metaphors for the earth's laws, astrology is the set of metaphors for the heavens. Casey shows a unified field theory for the world above, and how it manifests in the world here below."},{"Title":"Making the Gods Work for You: The Astrological Language of the Psyche","review":"How can anyone praise such an intelligent, witty, visionary book so full of trickster compassion and graciousness when other reviewers are saying it so well? For thousands of years around the world, a real education which led to wisdom began with the study of numbers, shapes, music and astronomy/astrology. They were considered by antiquity as portals into the archetypal patterns which inform the entire cosmic harmony. Casey has bestowed a gift on us by revealing its astrological door and allowing us to take a tour of ourselves while pointing out the accessible tools we have to maneuver with. She has obviously done her homework and is a great storyteller. She makes us feel how the language of astrological archetypes is our native language and a scorecard for \\"ordinary\\" events which play out the timeless mighty mythic dramas. Highly recommended for those interested in re-creating the world and themselves with intelligence, joy and humor, while getting a set of timeless tools in the bargain."},{"Title":"Making the Gods Work for You: The Astrological Language of the Psyche","review":"OK,OK, I'm her sister. But that doesn't mean I'm an easy reviewer on this one. (I was thinking of signing in anonymously, as \`\`a reader in Moscow, Russia, the option helpfully provided by the Amazon-ers.) I believe in Caroline. But I believe in astronomy, not astrology. However, \`\`Making the Gods Work For You&quot; is both charming and smart. It is full of true things, coming from Caroline's very original observations on current life, and from years of real scholarship. Because the book is typed as astrology rather than folklore or myth or a kind of particularly interesting self-help, it's getting stuck (at least in the places I've been in on the East Coast) in the back of bookstores and it's not being reviewed by the big book sections. Which is a shame. I advise general readers with no particular interest in astrology to slink over to the New Age shelves and take a look at the book with the purple cover. There's none of the usual rigid, irritating predictive astrolo! ! gical stuff -- i.e. you do that all the time because you're a Taurus. Instead the book encourages the reader to pay attention to the rhythms of nature and the cosmos, and to appreciate his or her own mix of qualities, Venusian, Saturnine, whatever. (Also, and no small thing: There's more real wit in here than you'll find in two years of Jay Leno, or six years of David Letterman.)"},{"Title":"Making the Gods Work for You: The Astrological Language of the Psyche","review":"Amazing book.

This book is a gift in that it provides with a detailed narrative of the places, people, and events which conspired to deliver the UDHR at a moment in history when it was so desperately needed."},{"Title":"A World Made New: Eleanor Roosevelt and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights","review":"This is a fascinating book on the formation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights from a historical, political, as well as ethical perspective, and very well written. It shows the involvement of individuals from many countries, western and non-western, in the formation of this document and refutes the idea that \\"human rights\\" is strictly a western concept. I was in awe of Eleanor Roosevelt after reading the account of her multinational efforts, but also inspired by these other leaders who also made significant contributions to it's formation but who are now unknown to most."},{"Title":"A World Made New: Eleanor Roosevelt and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights","review":"\\"A World Made New\\" isn't really about Eleanor Roosevelt, though she does have a big part in the story. Instead, the book chronicles the diplomacy that led to the 1948 adoption of the world's cornerstone human rights document, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The book also analyses the Declaration's role in shaping a global \\"rights consciousness\\" that has slowly but surely had a big impact on international politics and state behavior. The writing is crisp, the story fascinating, and the legal explanations crystal-clear. It's a nifty, intelligent book.The author is a Harvard law prof who wants to teach us how to think about human rights in the modern world. She has two key messages. First, criticism that the whole notion of human rights reflects a \\"Western bias\\" is misguided; countries from around the world negotiated the Declaration, and every major rights tradition is reflected in the text. Second, the range of rights embraced by the Declaration far exceeds traditional Anglo-American notions of limited government and individual freedoms; instead, the Declaration is built on concepts of human dignity and flourishing that cannot be realized without education, health care, workplace justice, and other social protections.Editorial Comment: The Universal Declaration of Human Rights has influenced constitutions and human rights laws all over the world, from South Africa and post-war Europe to emerging democracies in Latin America and the former USSR. However, it is almost unknown in the United States, despite our decisive role in its creation. Of course, Americans don't know their own Constitution, either. Given the low level of legal/rights literacy in America, it's no wonder that global human rights leadership has largely passed to other countries. A people who can't be roused by the disclosure of White House-sanctioned torture camps has no capacity to lead others on these issues."},{"Title":"A World Made New: Eleanor Roosevelt and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights","review":"A marvelous account of the formulation and development of the \`Universal Declaration of Human Rights'.It really had its gestation in 1941 during the Roosevelt - Churchill meeting at Placentia Bay, off Newfoundland, during the very dark days of World War II. At that stage the spread of German Nazism seemed unstoppable. The Atlantic Charter was made with \`Roosevelt's freedoms' - freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from want, and freedom from fear.One could say that the \`Universal Declaration of Human Rights' is composed of these four main pillars.The author gives us a history of the evolution of the \`Universal Declaration of Human Rights' providing us with its' different draft forms. She also gives us excellent and vivid portrayals of the main protagonists involved. We can say they represent a wide range of humanity - Rene Cassin from France, Charles Malik from Lebanon, P.C. Chang from China, John P. Humphrey from Canada, Housa Meht from India and several others.Orchestrating and pushing through this agenda was Eleanor Roosevelt. Her prestige, her boundless energy and her unique ability to encompass and empathize with humanity at large made her able to move this \`Declaration' to approval at the U.N. General Assembly.This was no small task.It is indeed Eleanor Roosevelt's finest hour. It gives her a lasting legacy that mankind should remember for all time.The author also gives a very readable description of the meaning of the Declaration - deciphering for us the battles to make it more readable and acceptable to all members of the various committees who participated in its' writing.It was passed by the U.N. in 1948; only the Soviet bloc countries and Saudi Arabia abstained from voting. It is not a binding or legal document, but it is a goal that all countries should strive for. Countries today are judged by their adherence to it and many new countries add parts of it to their constitution. Human rights groups, such as Amnesty International refer to it in their evaluations.The author acknowledges that it is not perfect, and it creators said as much. However she argues persuasively that human rights are universal. In a fine example near the end of the book a Chinese refugee points out to another delegate at a human rights convention - \\"If you were to voice dissent from the prevailing view in China, you would end up in a jail, and there you would soon be asking for your rights, without worrying about whether they were \`American' or \`Chinese' \\".The \`Universal Declaration of Human Rights' is for mankind. As another dissident pointed out \`rights are for everyone, not just westerners'."},{"Title":"A World Made New: Eleanor Roosevelt and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights","review":"A splendid account of Eleanor Roosevelt after FDR's death, when she was the guiding force on the UN committee that crafted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The Declaration is already a foundation to a body of international human-rights law, a foundation that has steadily grown in importance over the last half century. The book does justice to it, and to her.The title is from her nightly prayer: \\"Our Father, who has set a restlessness in our hearts and made us all seekers after that which we can never fully find, forbid us to be satisfied with what we make of life. ... Save us from ourselves and show us a vision of a world made new.\\"Amen."},{"Title":"A World Made New: Eleanor Roosevelt and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights","review":"The title is a bit of a misnomer as the book is primarily about the drafting of the Declaration, and much less about Ms. Roosevelt. That said, the work provides great insights into the background of that seminal document and the \\"perfect storm\\" of events that allowed it to come to fruition. The sketches of the principals involved give it a welcome dimension of \\"human interest\\" value. It is fascinating to consider how the process was buffeted and ways in which the document could have ended up--such as the providing for the rights of the unborn.The book is an easy read, though wonks will appreciate the various drafts of the Declaration in the appendices. The author presents the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as an accomplishment of the first order, and she is right. We are all well advised to hone our appreciation of it. Reading this book is an excellent way to do so.I give it 4 stars because the last chapter is a little weak, and because of the book's misleading premise regarding Eleanor. Don't let that stop you from reading it. It's a rewarding pick."},{"Title":"Problems of Everyday Life: And Other Writings on Culture & Science","review":"This is not a \\"self-help\\" book, or a psychiatry book that tries to make you accept things no matter how grim they get in society around you-- unlike other books that popped up when I searched the database for \\"problems of everyday life.\\" This collection of articles by Leon Trotsky, a central leader of the Russian Revolution in its early years, is much more challenging and interesting.It was first written for the millions of workers and young people who were inspired to join the heroic struggles to overthrow the Czarist social order in Russia and take first steps towards building a socialist society. Full of a wonderful sense of respect for each individual and the capacities of ordinary men and women to work together to overcome society's ills.

As an archetype she is represented by Margaret Thatcher, Indira Gandhi, Oprah Winfrey, Golda Meir, and any woman who uses the fortitiude of her social and intellectual intelligence to navigate the world and claim a leadership position. The Athena archetype is the cool-heade woman, whose ability to nail the true character of a person requires objectivity and higher reason that paves the way for keen intuitive impressions. I LOVE this book's message. Athena in the psyche is activated when a woman's vulnerability and life circumstances requires a strength play. Athena removes the hijacks of emotional negative patterns and creates a laser like focus to accomplish necessary objectives. A woman's greatest gift is her intuition. In order to access high wisdom through the intuitive faculties, it is imperative to have Athena working on your behalf, when you are cool and logic is your intuitive ally ... the truth is obvious and your gut instinct will tell you how to operate in the world.

Highly recommended for those who enjoy a mystery that has a touch of the thriller and a smidgen of romance. Well developed characters and an intriguing plot. I'm looking forward to reading more by this author."},{"Title":"Capable of Murder","review":"Belinda Lawrence is summoned to England by her great aunt Jane. Leaving her home in Australia behind, Belinda heads to the small English village but she is shocked beyond belief to discover her aunt's dead body. The police insist it was an accident, but Belinda isn't buying it. She's convinced someone murdered her aunt and she intends to find out who that person is.When Belinda learns she is the sole heir to Jane's home and belongings, she suddenly finds herself in danger. First, the home she inherits from her aunt is broken into and vandalized, then her own life is threatened. She also finds herself involved with two very handsome men, but she doubts their motives. Are they truly interested in her or are they more interested in her inheritance?This is the perfect cozy mystery. It has everything from a curious heroine, to a small English village, to a mysterious old house and two men trying to be heroes to our heroine. This is the first Belinda Lawrence and hopefully there are many more to come. Three others have already been written and I will eventually be reviewing those as well.I loved that this was set in a small English village. It's been a long time since I read one with this setting and it made me feel like I was right there in that village. It was a warm, cozy feeling.The author gave us an amazing cast of characters. Belinda is the type of heroine that will be beloved and leave readers wondering what's happening to her next. I know I will be.This book had the feel of a mystery along the lines of Agatha Christie. There were many twists and turns leaving readers guessing right along with Belinda. It was fast-paced leaving me wanting more."},{"Title":"Capable of Murder","review":"Belinda Lawrence has had very little contact with her great aunt, so she was a bit surprised to receive a note requesting that she come by for a visit. Unfortunately, the visit was a bit too late as Belinda discovered her aunts body days dead on the floor at the bottom of the stairs.Though called an accident by the police, Belinda sees things a little differently especially since the letter requesting the visit had been mailed after her aunts supposed accident.With some quirky and other eerie characters, the author weaves a tale that has the reading turning the pages even though you think you have it figured out, you still want to see if Kavanagh was only teasing the reader or if there really was something afoot in this very dark village far away from the city light with overgrown gardens and mystery chambers."},{"Title":"Capable of Murder","review":"Brian Kavanagh has spent years in the Australian film industry as a writer, editor, producer, and director. He has received awards from the Australian Film Editors Guild and the Australian Film Institute for editing FROG DREAMING, as well as an AFI award for his first feature film, A CITY'S CHILD, which also won the Gold Southern Cross Advertiser Award for Best Australian Film.Australian Belinda Lawrence receives a cryptic note from her great aunt Jane, who is a bit of a recluse. She can't think what it's about, as Aunt Jane wasn't particularly friendly at their first meeting. But she is totally unprepared for her aunt's body lying in a heap at the bottom of the stairs. She is amazed even further to discover that she is the heiress in her aunt's will, bequeathing an ancient cottage and rundown garden on the outskirts of Bath, England. Belinda settles in, but it seems that everyone she encounters has a hidden agenda, making her wonder if her aunt's death was an accident:\\"'It seems my aunt had been asking around Bath for old maps. She even called personally at a bookshop and specified that she wanted a map that showed this village.'Hazel walked to the window and looked down into the derelict garden.'Which book shop?''Can't remember the name, but it's in Pierrepont Street, near the bus station. A strange place and an even stranger owner.'Hazel turned back into the room. 'You mean JACK THE RIPPER?''Do I?' Belinda looked at Hazel in alarm.\\"There's nothing like a good old fashioned English cottage owned by a reclusive woman to arouse the interest of the reader. Add a few British rainstorms, a mysterious and handsome neighbor with something to hide, a few real estate agents and lawyers with ulterior motives and it all wraps up into a perfectly packaged mystery that makes the reader shiver with delight.Hopefully this Belinda Lawrence mystery is the first of a series, and that Brian Kavanagh's first foray into mystery writing produces a good many more books.Shelley GlodowskiSenior Reviewer"},{"Title":"Capable of Murder","review":"Capable of MurderBy Brian KavanaghCapable of Murder is the first book in a new mystery series. Readers will meet Belinda Lawrence, who ends up inheriting a cottage and garden near Bath, England when her Aunt Jane dies by falling down the stairs. Belinda then finds a hidden room and hears that her aunt was looking for a map. She begins to wonder if her aunt really fell down the stairs after all . . . or if she was pushed. Seems that Belinda's garden might be worth enough to kill for. Belinda begins to investigate while meeting her neighbors Rosemary and Jacob and a somewhat pushy real estate agent named Mark. She also meets Hazel, an antique dealer. At the end of the book, Belinda and Hazel make a deal where they enter into a partnership.This was a good mystery and a good introduction to some interesting characters. This was a quick read. I do wish that some of the supporting characters, namely Mark and Hazel, were developed more but I am hoping that they do so in later books. I will gladly continue this series.Reviewed by Melissa A. PalmerMelissaenglish72@yahoo.comJuly 13, 2008"},{"Title":"Capable of Murder","review":"I enjoyed the first book I read by Brian Kavanagh, but unfortunately I felt this one was not as good. The plot began with the arrival of Belinda Lawrence at her great-aunt's cottage in response to a letter. Belinda feels that her Great Aunt's death was murder, despite the verdict of accidental death. Her reaction to finding her Great Aunt's body - and subsequent murder - is glossed over, until she faints at a second funeral and spends three days in hospital - when an overnight or one day stay would do it.She is beseiged by neighbours and others wanting to buy the cottage, has a romantic interlude with an unlikely partner - there is no evidence of \\"getting to know you\\" - I don't want to give a spoiler, but the plot of this novel, for me was chaotic.In my opinion, the story was rushed, the main character assaulted from all sides by characters who the reader doesn't get to know. And a bad fault - Belinda is using a bicycle and the reader is told that she enjoys riding in the fresh air. Without any explanation, suddenly she is driving a car.I am sorry to say that this novel was nowhere near as good a read as Brian Kavanagh's \\"Canterbury\\" story."},{"Title":"Capable of Murder","review":"When Belinda Lawrence receives a letter from her great aunt in England asking her to visit, she leaves Australia with to see her last remaining relative. Her aunt hadn't been overly welcoming to her on a visit years earlier and Belinda was curious as to the reason for her aunt's request.Arriving in Milford, outside of Bath, Belinda finds her aunt's house open and dark. Thinking that perhaps her aunt was ill in bed, Belinda walks to the stairway and stumbles, literally, over her aunt's body at the foot of the stairs.Belinda finds that she is the sole heir of her aunt's estate and now has the decision of staying in England or selling the cottage and returning to Australia. She meets Mark, a real estate agent, and Hazel, an antiques dealer. both of whom seem very interested in her aunt's home and possessions. Her next door neighbors, Rosemary and Jacob welcome her to the village and things seem propitious for staying. Jacob is a landscape gardener and it turns out that Belinda's new home may have one of the few small gardens created by a very famous landscape gardner, Lancelot Brown.The characters in this books are wonderfully defined. They all behave in a sinister manner at one time or another. The descriptions of the gardens and cottage are quite vivid. Historical information interspersed with the story is wonderful. I very much enjoyed learning about the gardens and their various incarnations."},{"Title":"Capable of Murder","review":"When Belinda Lawrence's Aunt Jane dies suddenly, Belinda is stunned to learn that she's inherited Jane's cottage in a village outside Bath. She'd only visited her aunt once before and the taciturn Jane hadn't made Belinda feel particularly welcome. The official cause of Jane's death was a fall down the stairs, but a visit to the cottage and encounters with the locals, among other things, force Belinda to think otherwise. Add an intense interest in her aunt's property from two handsome strangers and ominous events, and you've got the making of a great curl-up-with-a-blanket cozy.Capable of Murder is a short 184 page whodunit that zips along at a pretty quick pace because there aren't any of those pesky subplots to weave through the main story. Thing is, I love subplots. They add depth to a mystery and help flesh out characters, which is partly why I feel something was missing in this book. Also, I would have welcomed a few more suspects to make the puzzle trickier. Most readers will figure out who the killer is quite quickly. Still, those who love cozies that incorporate gardening into the story, not to mention a little romantic suspense, will enjoy the book."},{"Title":"Capable of Murder","review":"Despite Kavanagh's credentials in the author notes, CAPABLE OF MURDER is poorly plotted with numerous misspellings and thousands of unneeded adverbs and adjectives that any student writer would know better than to use. Either the writer is careless or the editor was unqualified. This book reads like a badly written romance novel and lacks cohesion. Suddenly the heroine is driving a car in a rain storm but the reader is never told how she came to have a car. This will teach me never to buy a book by this author or this publisher again."},{"Title":"The Orgy","review":"This intensely interesting book, part fiction, part memoir, and part stream-of-consciousness writing, has such a unique premise (a trip to Ireland to research a wild festival first hand) that it would have been a great book even without a good writing style. Nevertheless, Rukeyser's startlingly vivid poetic sentences are a key reason to read this book as well. The narrator/author's observations are so detailed that the reader feels as though he or she is in Ireland with her. By some miracle, the details never slow the book down; I found myself regretting how quickly I'd gobbled down this marvelous book (two days). I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys travel memoirs, engaging novels, or prose poems."},{"Title":"Carpenters Manifesto Rev Edition","review":"Actually, those of us who are past the beginner step will also enjoy the book. The authors write with clarity and enthusiasm, reviewing the principles or tools we learned long ago.Here are the chapter titles to give you an idea of what's covered:1.

Working techniques9. The ubiquitous box and other building components10. Furniture projects11. Room renewal12. FinishingThe book includes a few pages of useful dimensions and references, and the Index seems complete.The hand drawn illustrations are simple but excellent.I find it rather sad that this wonderful book, clearly a labor of love of its two young authors, is now ignored and forgotten, available for pennies here at Amazon. The book and the authors deserve much better.If you have a teenager with whom you'd like to share the pleasures of working with one's hands, you'd find it hard to do better than with this book."},{"Title":"Breasts (My Body Science)","review":"I've loved this series from Kane/Miller since I first read &quot;Everyone Poops&quot;, and have been giving sets of them as baby gifts ever since. They're hysterically funny, they're factual, they appeal to children and provide solid information about topics lots of adults won't even admit exist, let alone talk about. For several years I've been hoping that &quot;The Holes in Your Nose&quot; would be followed by &quot;The Bumps on Your Chest&quot; -- a book about breasts from this same series. Finally, it's here, though it is simply titled Breasts. As someone who has devoted my academic life to educating people about breastfeeding, I couldn't be more delighted. Finally, a book that is unapologetic in explaining to children that breasts are for feeding babies. A refreshing counterpoint to all the cultural messages children get about breasts as sex objects, breasts as a measure of a woman's beauty and femininity, or breasts as harbingers of death from cancer. My only teensy-weensy criticism of this book is that, contrary to the claim in the book, not all children lose interest in breastfeeding after a year or so -- around the world, including the US, many children nurse until they are 3, 4, or 5 years of age, or older, and thus are clearly able to remember breastfeeding! All in all, this is a great book. The descriptions of breastfeeding are wonderful. Highly recommended!! Buy several and give them to your local public library, church nursery, and local day-care center. Buy one for all your pregnant friends -- believe it or not, some people in the US still don't realize that breasts are for breastfeeding."},{"Title":"Breasts (My Body Science)","review":"A candid and realistic discussion of male and female breasts, and why they are different. A big focus on breastfeeding as the (only real) function of the breasts. Breastfeeding portrayed in a wonderful light and the milk production process is explained in simple terms. I began reading this to my breastfeeding 1 year-old and he loved it then and continues to love it as a weaned 3 year-old. There are many funny parts. Highly recommended to read to children who are exposed to breastfeeding and who feel breasts are a normal body part to see and know that breasts have a real and important function. Great to read to older children in preparation for the arrival of a new sibling who will be breastfed. This book is not in any way sexual or titillating and does not treat breasts as a sexual toy for adult men."},{"Title":"Breasts (My Body Science)","review":"I bought the Japanese version of this book in a 2nd-hand bookstore. Even though there were no English words anywhere in the book, I could totally understand what was being communicated by the illustrations.The children and adults drawn in the book are endearing and expressive. And I laughed outloud in the bookstore as I thumbed through it. The expressions on the characters' faces are just adorable. Adults of my parents generation were a little too shy or aloof when the topic of sexuality or body parts came up. Many adults of my generation state quite clearly that they will do it different, but it's hard to know how to break the ice on such topics when your only experience was with parents that acted as though the subject matter was taboo. My own parents were pretty forthcoming, but I know that was the exception and not the rule.A simple and to-the-point book with a simple and to-the-point title."},{"Title":"Breasts (My Body Science)","review":"I like this book for the way it presents breastfeeding as a normal, expected way to feed a baby. I've seen too many children's books illustrated with baby getting bottles and this is a fresh alternative. My kids found it silly and engaging, despite the very basic line drawings and lack of plot. It's perfect for a 2-4 year old, but I think a bit simplistic for most kids older than five."},{"Title":"Breasts (My Body Science)","review":"my son loves this. he nursed for a long time when he was younger, and he can remember it. so reading this book was pretty sweet for him. he likes these nonfiction style books!"},{"Title":"Breasts (My Body Science)","review":"My daughter loves this book! We got it when she was about 2 and now she's 3 and still loves it. I think it's great to show girls what breasts are for and how milk production works. Some of the images aren't the best artwork, but I still highly recommend this book for anyone."},{"Title":"Breasts (My Body Science)","review":"Yes, this is a cartoon book about breasts. There are no actual photographs, the cartoons are reminiscent of cave drawings, and the text is somewhat stilted (perhaps it's the translation) and often hilarious (whether intentional or not). For those who don't know (and I hope this isn't considered a \\"spoiler\\"), breasts (at least the female version) are useful--particularly for babies. Lots of babies get milk from a mamma's breast and this book covers the process nicely and with simple words and (even simpler) drawings. If you want to teach a young child about breasts, this may be the book for you."},{"Title":"Breasts (My Body Science)","review":"This book is great, and my kids love it. My children were breastfeed to at least age 1. It is an act of nature, so get over it people! I choose to feed my children the natural way rather than feed them some man made crap. This book shows and teachs even the youngest child about our bodies and what the different parts are used for. I love the whole series and applaude the writer for giving us these wonderful books about topics most find taboo."},{"Title":"The Mind of Your Newborn Baby","review":"The arrival of this book is great news! This is the long-awaited tenth-anniversary edition of Dr. Chamberlain's 1988 classic, Babies Remember Birth. In paperback format and enriched with a new last chapter, this book has the potential to revolutionize the way we look at babies, both before and after birth. Part I is filled with &quot;user-friendly&quot; information about the mind and abilities of newborns, as well as a thorough look at their development before birth. Parts II and III present evidence that babies do remember birth and are very much aware of the people around them at that time. There are many amazing stories of labor and birth, from the baby's point of view. As Dr. Chamberlain writes, &quot;Birth memories indicate that babies have an identity of their own; their parents don't give it to them. They act mindfully and build experience around a central core of self.&quot; The new last chapter is worth the price of the book all by itself. Dr. Chamberlain writes compellingly about the newborn's sensitivity, awareness, and vulnerability. He emphasizes the importance and power of the infant-and-parent connection during pregnancy and after birth. When the information in this book becomes common knowledge, we will look at our children with new respect and understanding."},{"Title":"The Mind of Your Newborn Baby","review":"This book is incredible! David Chamberlain has put a lot of research info into a concise book to help all levels of readers to understand what their preborn and infant may be learning. The author reviews the research on an infant's abilities, senses, and learning styles, and then presents it in this fascinating book. He discusses how infants in the womb know their parents voices, outside of the womb know their mother's smell, the advantages infants have of close contact with their parents, the importance of communication between the two, and much more. Chamberlain then concludes the book with many personal infant and mother recollections of birth mostly obtained through hypnosis. Life is amazing and you get a new perspective from this book on how important learning is at conception and beyond. Parents should read this for their children's sake."},{"Title":"The Mind of Your Newborn Baby","review":"This man has contributed hugely for 30 years.

Mr. Dunne, who had a considerable reputation and experience as a screenwriter, somehow convinced the powers at Twentieth Century Fox to give him carte blanche and complete access to every peculiar nook and sneaky cranny at the studio. Sitting in on major meetings with the Zanucks,writers, producers, agents, stars, attending gala openings and hanging about sets, Dunne was the ultimate fly-on-the-wall. The movies in production during the year (1967)he spent soaking up this rarified atmosphere included \\"Dr. Doolittle,\\" \\"Star,\\" and \\"Hello Dolly,\\" which means we get great dish on Rex Harrison, Barbra Streisand, Anthony Newley, Gene Kelly and Walter Matthau, to name only a few.The stories are told in a droll, straight-ahead manner, which makes the gags even funnier. One can scarcely believe the kinds of things that Hollywood Heavies utter, apparently unashamed and on a fairly regular basis.For the record, Mr. Dunne, also the author of a number of first-rate novels, was the late husband of writer Joan Didion, whose current memoir about dealing with his death - \\"The Year of Magical Thinking\\" - is deservedly at the top of the charts these days."},{"Title":"Regional diversity in environmental attitudes, knowledge and policy: The Kentucky River Authority (CDC development paper)","review":"Absolutely brilliant-people in Hollywood still refer to &quot;AD&quot; (After Dunne), and you know a book like this won't happen again. The attitude is &quot;Where you find clowns there is usually a circus&quot;, and the level of amaturism on display here is astounding. The best section has to be the one on the making of the legendary flop &quot;Dr. Dolittle&quot;-you are there as they read the disastrous preview cards. A $18 million investment is on the line, and all the producer's girlfriend can think of is stealing a silver tray from a restaurant and what dress to wear for the premiere. Hilarious, and still required reading at film study courses today."},{"Title":"Regional diversity in environmental attitudes, knowledge and policy: The Kentucky River Authority (CDC development paper)","review":"Unlike the other reviewers here, I thought the book (considering when it was written) is a bit of tame, high-level overview of the studio workings. I didn't find it boring, nor did I find it to be a great page-turner. I would have preferred a more in-depth review of the studio workings. However, it was interesting to read the names from the past and the TV shows that were described...Lost in Space, Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea...and the movies...Dr. Doolittle, Planet of the Apes...and more. I did find the parts on how Richard Zanuck decided which movies would get made and which ones didn't to be interesting - pretty much a gut feeling and a whim. I think this book is only for diehard studio fans and not the casual reader of Hollywood history."},{"Title":"Regional diversity in environmental attitudes, knowledge and policy: The Kentucky River Authority (CDC development paper)","review":"Excellent, casual writing style.

James King presents Mowat as an ambitious writer, a proud Canadian, a melancholy husband, a mischievous only child, and a passionate environmentalist. In the space of relatively few pages, King describes Mowat's very active life, remarking on every book, every beloved pet dog, many of his travels, the Second World War years, both marriages, and his troubles with publishers and editors.Did he leave anything out? Well, you can be sure that the Farley his friends and family know is still private, but not completely. This is primarily a book about Mowat's relationships with people, his moods, and his mistakes. It's a &quot;warts and all&quot; biography, but it's written with Canadian politeness --- James King is even-handed and fair. Farley cooperated with King on it, opening up archives of correspondence and submitting to interviews. He made no conditions, and King honored that with a respectful portrait.Aspiring writers should read this book. Farley had a bumpy but very successful career, starting with a controversial book (People of the Deer) in 1952. He spent the next 30 years trying to identify and master his literary strengths. His editors, his father, and his wife Claire helped him figure it out. If you want a successful writing career, you can learn a lot from this book.For fans of Farley Mowat, you get to find out how he came to write each book, how well they sold, and which books had the greatest effect on him. (Never Cry Wolf is his best-seller. Sea of Slaughter meant a great deal to him and required a lot of time and emotional strength. The Top of the World trilogy was never taken seriously by his publishers. Etc.) This is a well-written biography of a great man. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Farley: The Life of Farley Mowat","review":"\\"Farley\\" by James King is a decently thorough biography of the renowned Canadian author, activist and veteran Farley Mowat. This book is not the most exciting read, nor does it flow that smoothly; what it does do is provide the reader with an excellent overview of all the works of Farley Mowat and how they fit into the author's life experience. For any reader looking for a way to sort through Mowat's huge collection of books and decide which ones to pick up, this book is perfect.Mowat has written a huge number of books, so King's ability to catalogue them all into a cohesive and readable book is quite a literary achievement. Besides offering a guidebook and behind the scenes look at an author's life and work, King's book is a portrait of the man himself, and in a way the segment of Canadian (and American) society that identifies with him. I am referring to the left wing activist groups that champion the cause of exploited peoples (indigenous societies), wildlife conservancy and protection. Mowat was in many ways the one of original proponents of organizations such as Green Peace and the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Much of his life was devoted to these kinds of causes. The fact that he was such an articulate author who made important connections through Canada and the world at large made him all the more able to push his causes and bring awareness to the injustice and carelessness that plague mankind's darker sides. Farley was such an advocate for Socialist causes in Canada that he drew the ire of many governmental figures who disapproved of his exposure of corruption and callousness. Mowat was so indignant that some would think he went too far in his beliefs, espousing out and out Communism during the Cold War. He was even denied entry into the U.S. during the 1980's for his often outrageous activism. Though he did become quite a radical, Canadian society as a whole vindicated much of his thinking regarding Socialized programs such as Healthcare and protection of natural resources. So Although Farley remains a radical, his voice has found listeners in Canadian and American mainstream society.Farley's anti-establishment positions were quite strong because of the character of the man himself. King's book is quite revealing of Mowat's early life. An only child, Mowat grew up in several locations in Ontario and Saskatchewan due to his father's job running Canadian libraries. His father Angus was a veteran of the First World War, who upon his return became slightly disillusioned at societal norms, much like other members of his generation such as Ernest Hemingway. Angus took up writing as a tonic to heal his wounds, but he never found any success. His son Farley would undergo a similar transformation during and after the Second World War, where he fought in Sicily and Italy with his father's regiment the Hastings and Prince Edwards. This experience had profound influence on his mind and the course of his entire life, both as a man and as a writer.Farley was disgusted with brutality that is so commonplace in human nature. The war sent him on his life's mission to correct these mistaken instincts prone to destroy and kill. His wartime experience gives all his later positions credibility, as he suffered for his country and had seen what men can do to one another. As a result, his career as an author sheds light on many forms of human degradation concerning the environment and eachother. As a flipside to the coin, his other books offer simpler ways to live in harmony with the natural world, which to Farley were an antidote to the pain and destruction he and his father witnessed in the World's two largest and most destructive wars. Many authors write antiwar pieces, but the ones that have been there and seen its horror have true validity and the right to call for change in the standard that makes killing a commonplace activity in human society.King's book puts forth Farley's life and his causes with clarity, but some parts feels summarized, while others feel longwinded. A good entry point to Farley's life and work."},{"Title":"Tom Swift and his Wireless Message","review":"I believe this is the fifth book in the series, As a story, it is one of the best plotted. Some of the Tom Swift books key on an invention, then throw together several miscellaneous episodes to demonstrate the uses of that invention. An example of that sort of plot -- or lack thereof -- is seen in \\"Tom Swift and his Wizard Camera.\\" Other of the books -- such as this one -- are more story-centered. This particular story finds Tom and several of his friends stranded on an isolated small island in the West Indies.How they got there is quite a fun part of the novel. Tom has been assisting a Mr. Preston to perfect and fly an electric airplane. During a shakedown flight, the aviators get caught up in a gale. Tom is unable to turn the plane's nose into the wind and buck the gale, so their only recourse is to turn downwind and try to wait out the severe storm. After 24 hours of being carried southward at high speed, mechanical failures force the plane down on the desolate island described earlier, which the castaways dub \\"Earthquake Island.\\" The story then becomes a contest as to whether the frequent earthquakes will tear the island apart first, or whether Tom can extricate the castaways from their dilemma first. I won't spoil the story for any prospective readers.There's a good dash of humor included in all the Tom Swift books. In this particular book we have a scientist with a dire and gloomy outlook on life, predicting with great relish a long list of catastrophies. He is a \\"sad sack,\\" as the saying goes. There's also Mr. Wakefield Damon, an eccentric but wealthy man who accompanies the party, and whose money has at times funded certain of Tom's inventions.These are books for young readers-- probably targeted ideally for the Middle School kids. They are still fun to read, although nearly a century old. The \\"Wireless Message\\" novel is copyright 1911. I actually read this novel in the original format, although it appears that currently some of these old classics are coming back into print."},{"Title":"Trevor's place: The story of the boy who brings hope to the homeless : a decade later","review":"On Thursday, December 8, 1983 11-year-old Trevor Ferrell had an epiphany. That night he watched a news report that featured people sleeping on the streets. The Gladwynne Pennsylvania boy implored his family to step up to the plate for people without homes. That night the Ferrells, equipped with a pillow and a yellow blanket made the first of many nightly runs to feed and comfort the homeless. Before the year 1983 ended, the Ferrells, Trevor and his two sisters and only brother were making enough meals to feed 100 people. They became known in the area.In time, others would become familiar with Trevor's altruism. His commitment to his ministry was so strong that his schoolwork suffered. He took some time off from school to continue his ministry. By 1984, a storefront shelter called Trevor's Place was opened. By 1986, President Reagan included Trevor's Place in his State of the Union Address. Trevor's ministry reached Steven Spielberg and Mother Teresa, both of whom spoke with him at length about the service he was providing to his community.The Ferrells, led by Trevor ran the place until 1990. Trevor, then 18 attended Cabrini College and later married and had two daughters, Katy (b. 1994) and Meghan (b. 1999). At present, Trevor runs a thrift shop in his area and sometimes likes to pop into Trevor's Place, the eponymously named shelter which thrives and provides shelter, food and cheer to this day."},{"Title":"Oklahoma kickoff: An informal history of the first twenty-five years of football at the University of Oklahoma, and of the amusing hardships that attended its pioneering","review":"If you are an Oklahoma football fan, this book is a must for you Harod Keith tells the story as if you are right there during the first 25 years of Oklahoma football.

One world is the world that everybody knows. The other is a place of pure imagination-- populated by the myths, legends and creatures of lore that humans have thought about since the beginning of time. In the beginning, this parallel world is a dark and wild place and the creatures in it are gods and demons-- awesome and mighty. Imagine the consternation that mass media brings: Suddenly, the Devil is face-to-face with Mickey Mouse. When that happens, there is Hell to pay...Out of Their Minds is a charming conceit, but truthfully not one of the best of the Simak collection. I have kind of the feeling that he had a terrific idea, but never worked it out very far past the point of being a terrific idea. The introduction is great, but the follow-through is a pale shadow of some of his greater novels like Way Station or Destiny Doll.Simak fans should find this a nice digression (I love the moment with Snuffy Smith!) but people new to his work should begin elsewhere."},{"Title":"Out of Their Minds","review":"The concept behind this book is that everything the human race has imagined, from the Devil to Disneyland, exists in another world governed by all the bizarre rules we've thought of too. Not a bad idea and the characterisation works quite well. The storyline moved along nicely towards the punchline but when it arrives, the delivery isn't great. A good read but a disappointing ending."},{"Title":"Out of Their Minds","review":"Clifford Simak, 1904-88, noted science fiction author, wrote several novels that could best be described as fantasy, although I will be the first to admit that parsing the dividing line between science-fiction and fantasy can result in contentious discussions and disagreements. Nonetheless this novel, \\"Out of Their Minds\\" (1970) is in my oppinion more fantasy than science fiction. Does it matter? Well, it does to some, for sure. To the casual reader I strongly suspect not. And it is to those readers I direct my admittedly opinionated comments.Horton Smith, protagonist of this novel, is experiencing what was years ago referred to as a mid-life crises. A successful and well-known newsman Horton decides to chuck his life in Washington D.C. and drive cross-country to his boyhood Midwestern hometown of Pilot Knob in order to fish and write a novel. Strange things start happening, very strange things. A close friend is killed in a mysterious auto accident. Taking an apparent wrong turn on his journey he has a bizarre encounter with comic book-like folks and a decidedly unfriendly snake. Upon arrived in his home town most folk greet him like the prodigal son except for one group of punks who decide to give him a real country homecoming. One of the young Turks shows up dead after the encounter and Joe goes on the lam to dodge the vigilantes. The local schoolteacher who he had befriended rescues him from a pack of wolfs who just disappear when her headlights shine on them and then the devil makes an appearance.Fortunately for us readers Simak inserted a \\"document\\" into the novel - chapter 5 - that make us privy to cause of the weirdness. In the form of a letter from his friend killed in the auto accident this 11 page \\"theory\\" proposes the idea that mankind's mental evolution has created an alternative universe of sorts inhabited by all manner of our imaginary creations - cartoon characters, monsters and the Devil. Now these creations want to merge with our \\"reality\\".Simak had sufficient name recognition in the science-fiction community so he could of very easily spent his writing career cranking out mindless outer-space potboilers. His foray into fantasy shows an author who was not content with the path of least resistance but a writer who could experiment and take creative risks.In point of fact this is an entertaining novel with just enough loopy logic to keep disbelief suspended and the pages turning. May you enjoy it also."},{"Title":"Out of Their Minds","review":"Like many of Simak's books, the ending may leave you wishing for a different resolution, but it is still an engrossing read. The premise is interesting, and as usual the writing style is superb."},{"Title":"Out of Their Minds","review":"A book I read many years ago and really enjoyed.Having just read it again I found the concept still as intriguing as the first time.Mr Simak tells a good story and although it could be said this one is now a liitle old fashioned, it has a theme much more likely than the current crop of \\"fantasy Sci Fi\\"Go on read it!!!!"},{"Title":"The Portland Collection: Contra Dance Music in the Pacific Northwest","review":"For me this was not a particularly good book. Probably well written, but not helpful for me."},{"Title":"The Portland Collection: Contra Dance Music in the Pacific Northwest","review":"After the &quot;Fiddler's Fakebook&quot; this is the tune collection to own. Hundreds of reels and jigs in clear notation with, usually, good chord suggestions. Little, if any, overlap with the tunes in the FF. Very durable spiral binding, sits easy on a stand or table. Includes many recently composed tunes including my favorite, Erik Sessions' &quot;It Ain't the Heat, It's the Humidity.&quot; Many hours of playing pleasure, fast becoming a standard collection."},{"Title":"The Portland Collection: Contra Dance Music in the Pacific Northwest","review":"If you are looking to purchase a fiddle book, this is definitely the best one to buy. This book contains about 400 tunes and the quality of the tunes is fantastic. Every single tune in this book sounds great and can be ornamentated dozens of ways with plenty of room to make the tune your own. One of the best features of this book is the spiral binding. The binding is great because you don't have to constantly bend your book to get it to stay open on the stand. Another great feature is that the book is organized alphabetically so you can find your tune quickley during a jam. There is also an index which organizes the tunes by key and type which makes it really easy to come up with your own sets. There are even detailed notes on each song. Some of the notes even give suggestions on how to add some ornamentation to the tune.Overall, this book is great, but there are two things which are worth noting.-The pages are quite thin and could tear easily.-The book is very thick but it's only about 8.5 inches tall. This could make it difficult for people with weak eyesight to see some of the tunes."},{"Title":"The Portland Collection: Contra Dance Music in the Pacific Northwest","review":"While the fiddler's fakebook has a greater quantity of songs, this particular collection has consistent quality of songs chosen.

I play and teach traditional fiddle and classical violin technique in Southern New Hampshire, and can tell you that this book is treasured through this region. At sessions, if you play a tune no one knows and say \\"it's in the Portland Collection\\" suddenly almost everyone in the circle bends down and grabs that book tucked under their chair! It has become the Bible of traditional music for New England as well as the Pacific Northwest. I use it extensively in teaching and it is the primary textbook for my students as soon as they are able to play anything more difficult than \\"Baa Baa Black Sheep\\". My band has a very thick set-book, and probably half the tunes came from The Portland Collection.

We received a booklet which consisted of 8.5 x 11 in paper folded over and stapled to form an 80 page booklet.Most of the content is along the lines of what you might get from the local chamber of commerce. Some general information about the climate, a picture of the state flag, a \\"Food in Hawaii\\" section which lists McDonalds, Burger King, Subway... you get the picture.Information about real estate is rare and obvious. Like \\"Oceanfront property can be a good investment, but careful research should be undertaken to ensure it.\\" I thought that's what I bought this booklet for, but that's about as detailed as it gets. You're better off just surfing the Net than to pay for this.Pass."},{"Title":"Big Island of Hawaii Real Estate for the Savvy Investor","review":"This isn't even a book; it's a stapled set of color copies. All of the information contained within can be found quickly on the Internet."},{"Title":"Big Island of Hawaii Real Estate for the Savvy Investor","review":"I give this book 5 stars mostly because it is the only book available that I know of that has information specific about The Big Island and somebody else gave it a ridiculously low rating. It has the most commonly needed information well organized and quickly accessible like AAA travel guides. All the other books that I have bought barely mention, if at all, the Big Island and mostly go into Oahu. The book could have more details and is a little expensive, but it does have a lot of useful non tourist type photos and information. It was worth the money because it saved me from making some mistakes that I would have made. I can not understand how anybody can give this a low rating if they actually use it. When I see these kinds of reviews on Amazon I wonder if those kind of people are competitors or have personal vendettas. I found it very handy on the island in use. It saved me from asking many questions that I now know would have been stupid."},{"Title":"Big Island of Hawaii Real Estate for the Savvy Investor","review":"The book is an overview. Being a \\"visual\\" person I enjoyed the many full color photos and explanations - quick and to the point.Although the book itself does not go into great depth on real estate, it makes you aware of the relevant local issues and surveys the landscape so to speak. It puts you on the right track to get to the details quickly and alerts you to issues not found on the \\"mainland.\\" It's a very good starting point for information especially when talking to realtors.The author is an obvious resident giving information that I did not find in the guide books I had. It is the only book that I have found that is up to date about Hawaiian real estate. Things were just as mentioned in the book.It would be a good information source to someone not on the island in helping to determine if Hawaii is for them - before even visiting. There are some unexpected problems and issues in Hawaii like the Coqui frogs that are covered.Although you could use the web to find some of the information, it would probably take several weeks and lots of eye strain even if you knew what to look for.Without living there it's hard to know what to look for and you might not find out about the negatives. The book is a handy reference - which you can read in a couple of hours saving you much time.The book mentions chain restaurants (they are not in all towns for those expecting the chains to be ubiquitous) and local food including a place called Itsu's which although not fancy was very good local \\"greasy spoon\\" It also mentioned the much less expensive \\"locals\\" supermarket. These tips alone more that paid for the book.I found the actual book itself to be (overall) just fine as it had a heavy cardboard cover, good quality paper, and clear type - it held up to a week of daily use.This book is much more than \\"chamber of commerce \\"stuff.From my experience, the chamber of commerce will gloss over the negatives in their area. In this book the negatives are mentioned.To me, the book is a well balanced, honest starting point that can get you orientated and give you a running start on determining if Hawaii is right for you, and if so, what locale might suit you best, and what to watch out for."},{"Title":"The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Resistance","review":"A tale of hope and resistance. Welcome to a world where homeland security has expanded their \\"protection\\" against terrorism--not only in our airports, but right off busy sidewalks at impromptu \\"portals.\\" Passers by are treated to an inspection for weapons, illegal software, drugs, and proper ID. Of course, if they don't find any problems, inspectors often treat themselves to a good grope or other rewards from the defenseless citizens. Ah, but on the rooftops and in the shadows lurks the Black Arrow--a hero along the lines of Batman or Superman. While the book opens with an almost comic book feel, it quickly evolves into a serious, believable novel that stirs our souls the way the film \\"Spartacus\\" does.The Black Arrow is a real treasure. When was the last time that \\"Passionate\\". . . \\"Sexy\\". . . \\"Stylish\\" . . . \\"Thought-provoking\\" . . . \\"Funny\\". . . \\"Exhilarating!\\". . . \\"Action-packed!\\" . . . and \\"Tear-jerker\\" were all used to describe the same book--let alone a book about FREEDOM???The characters are real, likable, and unique. I found it extremely refreshing to read a novel with technically accurate gun battles. Without going overboard or getting too technical, the author provides the reader with a real sense of what it feels like, sounds like, and looks like to engage an armed enemy while equipped with bows and guns.The masterful word pictures allow you to feel the cold rain, become aroused by the sex, and smell the dark, dank, vast Gotham underground. This is a thriller with soul. You will go from laughing out loud, to shaking with sheer hatred, and then down to a lump in your throat--from the tear-jerking romance.If you're part of the \\"gun culture,\\" you'll feel absolutely privileged to be surrounded by serious, well trained freedom fighters who not only practice good muzzle control, but also let you in on their thoughts before and AFTER they pull the trigger. You find yourself understanding their justification for their conflict and their willingness to \\"hold the line\\"--despite their terrible odds of survival.Some of the scenes are so heinous that you may question the need to be so graphic; after all, no government could be THAT cruel. And then you recall that you've seen these stories before . . . you remember that these are real events. Vin has craftily taken the most horrific injustices to our liberties and magically made them appear as current news items in 2030. The Black Arrow is a must-read for anyone who is passionate about life and liberty.Vin has delivered a stunning first novel that is sure to be a timeless classic among such greats as Atlas Shrugged, The Count of Monte Cristo, Animal Farm, 1984, and Unintended Consequences. It is guaranteed to stir even the faintest glowing cinder of patriotism into a raging fire of resistance."},{"Title":"The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Resistance","review":"The title's taken from my own rather lengthy review posted recently on my Fnord! Spotter blog that's hosted by Blogger. If you'd care to see the rest, now you know what you need to know to be able to find it!I really loved this book; written in a stylized 'graphic novel' format set in the near future, it's a fast read even at 700 pages. In it, Vin has managed to cram in most of the salient points that have led him and others (myself included) to believe that our current government has gone wildly wrong, swerving a full hundred and eighty degrees from the way it was originally intended to operate...and in a way I found most entertaining. From the usurpation and concentration of State power in the hands of self serving bureaucrats in Lincoln's time, through the outrages of Ruby Ridge, Waco, and other atrocities, to even the petty everyday annoyances thrust upon us by the meddlesome Nanny State in everyday life, there is an illustrative cross section of government excesses presented in this book that explain the rise of the Black Arrow and those who, with him, resist this tyranny.Now, fawning State-loving critics of this book have branded it as 'didactic' and claim it exaggerates any problems with government, which they see as inconsequential at worst. I strongly disagree...as I point out in my review, complex political issues simply cannot consistently be reduced to safe, non-offensive, and easily digestible sound bites. Didactic? Nope, not in my opinion...as far as I'm concerned it uses accurate, verifiable historical accounts of the depradations of a government gone mad as needed to illustrate exactly why the book's characters decide to finally oppose the oppression.Other purportedly freedom-oriented individuals and organizations have taken issue with the alleged 'gratuitous sexual content' in the book, even going so far as to review or handle it for sale. While I certainly respect their decision to act this way, I can't agree with it. Sure, there are some love scenes, but they have a healthy, natural feel to them, as opposed to those dealing with the politicians and other oppressive thugs' (though that's kind of redundant, n'est ce pas?) creepy exploitive view of sex as an expression of power lust and aggression...a view that's accurately reflected by the antagonistic characters in the book, if history is any guide!Caligula, anyone?The importance of this book, in my own words, taken from my blog:I believe this is a seminally important work; a Rosetta Stone of a sort that I think has the potential to catalyze all the anger, frustration, and resentment that's simmering in the hearts of millions of ordinary folks today into focus...precisely where it should be, on every goon, thug, or elected official that considers the average American citizen a 'resource' to be exploited, used, abused, or simply disposed of at his or her pleasure. On every pimply creep who shed his McDonald's trainee nameplate for a badge so he could work out his sociopathy on ordinary people without having to worry about being held accountable for his actions. On every court academician who contributed to the Orwellian nightmare this country has become by legitimizing some fresh tyranny with a clever Newspeak 'redefinition' that turns common sense on its head in order to perpetrate yet another nasty crime against the public.I think that if enough people read The Black Arrow, all those aforementioned tyrants and would-be tyrants would do well to reconsider their actions lest they be faced with a future full of the sort of 'unpleasant confrontations' that Luke Skywalker warned Jabba The Hutt about...I heartily recommend The Black Arrow to liberty lovers of every cut and stripe!"},{"Title":"The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Resistance","review":"A must for those who like the relatively new genre of near-future sci-fi / fantasy involving the rise of the police state, with a happy ending.

In fact, quite the opposite. What we desperately need in America today is government. We need law enforcement. We need accountability. We need a civilized society. In reference to people who hide behind their government jobs while they blatantly violate human rights and steal both private and public property, we have none of these things. A real government is self-policing, has a reasonable degree of integrity, enforces its laws, and serves the people.Anyone who doesn't think America is under siege--doesn't think. In this book, Vin Suprynowicz presents the reader with various accounts of egregious behavior that motivate an abused citizenry to rise up. Unfortunately, these accounts are not fiction--they are drawn from actual events. If you review the Bill of Rights, you see that of the ten, only the Third Amendment still applies in our courts and bureaucracies.Just how much under siege are we? Just the confiscation aspect alone is alarming. For the average citizen, federal taxes add up to nearly 50% of income--15.3% flat tax (SS), 23% or so graduated tax, and various payroll taxes. Then you have all the excise taxes, license fees, and so on--there are 122 taxes on a single loaf of bread. Total total taxes amount to 70% to 85% of a citizen's earnings. Is being \\"allowed to\\" keep only 15% to 30% of your earnings confiscatory and punitive? You decide.And this assumes a citizen isn't an American Taliban (also known as the Infernal teRrorism Service) target enduring tax rates well over 100%. In the Hoyt Fiasco, for example, many victims of a fraud in which AT employees participated lost their lifesavings, only to later be slapped with a made-up theft-loss tax (as opposed to an income tax) equal to several decades of earnings. The idea that \\"our\\" government isn't robbing us blind may be technically accurate--but employees of \\"our\\" government have no problem robbing individuals and diverting funds to their own pockets. They have a free pass to do as they please, whether silencing a victim permanently or simply stealing 4300 computers a year from their own offices. Even the government's own GAO documents these thefts, but nothing gets done about them.The excesses, abuse, and psychopathic behavior that typify our bureaucrats and leave a wake of destruction are where the real issues lie. The theft, as extensive as it is, pales beside such documented agency abuses as shooting babies (Ruby Ridge) and burning children alive (Waco).In this book, a heroic figure emerges to free a city run by a corrupt mayor. If you think mayoral corruption doesn't cost lives, think of New Orleans (Hurricane Katrina) and Chicago (disarmament). Both cities are legendary for graft, corruption, and body bags.The book makes for great entertainment, but it also sends a message. The terrorists and parasites who have infiltrated--and now dominate--our government agencies will, of course, see the wrong message. They are, like alcoholics who refuse to see they have a drinking problem, in denial. They see their victims as deserving of the abuse heaped upon them. They care not one whit for their coworkers, who actually see \\"government service\\" as a personal mandate. Unfortunately, it takes only one terrorist or parasite to undo the hard labor and dedication of 100 decent people serving in government. The bad news is the terrorists and parasites are everywhere.The right message is simply this: Tyranny is not acceptable. If that idea seems radical, just refer to the quotes that start each chapter of this book. Such \\"radicals\\" as former US Presidents and Supreme Court Justices have voiced that same message.If you don't think we have tyranny, ask yourself why an employee of the State of California is in prison for--as a part of his job responsibilities--simply delivering medicinal marijuana. This was totally legal under the laws of California. But the feds hauled this man off to prison. That's just one example. How about the Michigan day care center, where AT agents held toddlers at gunpoint in 1984 for taxes not even owed? The governor had to call in the National Guard to free the children, but the agents involved were protected from prosecution because they \\"didn't know\\" this kidnapping was illegal. Yes, that was 20+ years ago, but since then the abuses have only gotten worse.Is it too much to ask of our elected representatives that they return this nation to a nation of laws rather than a nation of hijacked power, petty fiefdoms, and criminal enclaves? Why can't we have a nation that respects due process and the basic rights of human beings?So, what will happen if our elected officials continue to abdicate their responsibilities? Suprynowicz has given us one vision of the future. Whether today's trends will produce a violent uprising or a peaceful return to a nation where civil rights and the law matter--well, nobody has a crystal ball.This book doesn't advocate violence, but warns against it. And it does so in a way that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The book is a thriller, a romance, an historical account, a futuristic tale, and a tutorial all rolled into one very readable, very exciting text. Let us hope those in power heed the warning and start using their powers of office for the right purposes."},{"Title":"The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Resistance","review":"This excellent work should be required reading for all americans. Although unfortunately most are too sheeplike, dumbed down, servile and brainwashed to even begin to understand a small portion of what the author is saying. We had a great country once a long time ago."},{"Title":"The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Resistance","review":"An absolutely wonderful read. ... 'The Black Arrow' is a fantastic book ... the 'Gone With the Wind' of our time. Good plot action, well rounded characters, the dialogue 'rings true' ... I am, frankly, blown away; I'd read it all over again tomorrow, but I want to get itinto others' hands. I am just SO tickled it's SO good!!!!"},{"Title":"The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Resistance","review":"This is a 700 page exciting book that seems too short!! The cover 'may' deceive a person into thinking this is a different genre. It is a fast-moving, well-written action/adventure, centered on resistance to a relatively near-future corrupt & oppressive government. Good heros, heroines, complex villains, no dull-spots. I cannot visualize anyone being sorry they spent the money & time on this book."},{"Title":"The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Resistance","review":"I would still not consider myself a libertarian, but this book has taught me a lot and given me much to think about. The story is a good one of the fight against evil, except the evil is the government gone bad. Even though this is fiction, there is so much in here that can teach you the way that government should work. For those of you who hate text books, this book is a fun way to learn about libertarian ideals.Recommended for those who like a good read and dont mind learning something at the same time. As you see my name is annonymous fed, so I have to say that even working for the government, I see so much that should not be. Every bad guy in the book that died deserved what he got, and I have had to re-evaluate my thoughts on many things."},{"Title":"The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Resistance","review":"This book may be the best libertarian novel except for the Ayn Rand novels. Up until this book, Vin Suprynowicz had written nonfiction books, and this was his first attempt at a novel. In the story, a growing band of resistance fighters takes on the government of the future, which has grown even larger and more blatantly oppressive than it is now. The book starts out with a comic book feel, then becomes more like an action movie.The book goes into the origins of some the resistance fighters. The stories of government abuse are infuriating, and become even more so when you realise that they are slightly exaggerated versions of real events.The hero is the \\"perfect man\\" who is a attractive, rich, athletic rock star. The only other characters with depth are Madison, one of the fighters, and Dan Brackley, the main villain. When you read the book closely enough, you can see that the hero is a reflection of the person the author would like to be. In the biography section, Suprynowicz says he is still \\"searching for his Madison\\". I hope he finds her.The book is clearly aimed at men. There were long decriptions of weapons and tactics, which I enjoyed, but not everyone else will. The same thing goes for the explict sex in the novel. The book is 700 pages long, but, like the Rand novels, never drags. It has a bit of everything: action, romance, politics, law, heroics, and character development. This book could be made into an excellent movie, but I'm betting nobody will touch it because of its message."},{"Title":"The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Resistance","review":"Suprynowicz is an outstanding columnist, but this work of fiction is lacking. Poor proofreading yields some truly odd grammatical constructions that are hard to understand. Aside from the hero and the main villain, none of the remaining characters are very well depicted. The subplot about the stadium, from beginning to end, reads like Clancy of the past 10 years or so--very dry and boring.The technical information is good if not as densely packed as in Rawles' Patriots or BTP's Molon Labe. What Suprynowicz *does* get right is his villains: utterly believable, demonstrating the overbearing hubris and petty thuggery of the modern elected official."},{"Title":"The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Resistance","review":"Written comic book style, it is an excellent antifeminist and anticollectivist social critique about the dillemna of modern American society: how to challenge and limit bureaucracy. With more than enough fighting, sex, underground caverns and sword esoterica thrown in to keep any pulp-science fiction reader happy.The hero launches a campaign of terror against the city, State and Federal governments in a future America torn by secesion. He is a hero in the biggest and grandest sense: a supermale, superrich, superintelligent and somewhat just avenger of the bureauctarically oppressed. As a member of the bureaucratically oppressed I both envied him (I want to be him) and hated him (its not fair for one fictional character to get so many awesome qualities and substantial and hot broads).Does the campaign succeed? Does it fail? Pay the money and read the book. It's worth it."},{"Title":"The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Resistance","review":"If you like Unintended Consequences you will like this! A great book. Well written with an interesting plot, a welcome relieif from the left wing drivel we are continually subjected too."},{"Title":"The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Resistance","review":"This Black Arrow is a great read with a caveat: If you do not want well written action/suspense in the graphic novel vein (minus the pictures -- Vin does it all with words), this is probably not the book for you. I say it this way because I got the impression, from reading some of the other reviews, expectations were brought to the table that this book really wasn't designed to meet.Vin is a newspaper man and I'm glad that in the middle of all the hard, cold, grisly facts he often contemplates in his articles, he decided to put forth the effort of completing a fictional novel with some hope in it. Hope often travels through the avenue of imagination.The joy of freedom needs to be built up again in the American mind, which has been MTV'ed and D.o.E.'ed and A.D.D.'ed to death. The Black Arrow is desperately needed, far more than some super hero who does everything for you.Because I, like many others, see the kabuki of justice played out in our society and have often felt helpless against it (our country is run by a pack of crooks and traitors, selling us out to the highest bidder), reading the depictions of wrongs set right in this book was tremendously cathartic. Although it is vilified, this country has a very fine tradition of vigilantism in the face of corruption and tyranny; in fact, it was founded through this unfortunate, but necessary responsibility. The criminal activity of government officials described in this book is not all that far removed from reality and reminds us that they do it all by the permission of those governed.Books like this and the spark they ignite may be the answer to George Orwell's dark prophecy, \\"If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stomping on a human face--forever.\\""},{"Title":"The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Resistance","review":"I won't go into the political overtones or the alarming \\"it CAN happen here\\" atmosphere that is so wonderfully embellished by Suprynowicz; hopefully by now you'll already understand that part. I'll just state simply that this is an outstanding piece of storytelling and that it is eminently worth saving pennies from your lunch money to buy."},{"Title":"The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Resistance","review":"Do not start on this book if you have much else scheduled. You will likely find it as difficult to put down as I did. I loved this book. It gave me hope that freedom still has a chance in an increasingly unfree America. The dark cynicism from watching politics, the courts and the attitudes of the people become increasingly anti-freedom lifted reading this book.I hope it doesn't require the means employed to regain our freedom in this still wonderful but very troubled country. But I hope even more that enough people deeply understand and value freedom and that they dare to stand up and fight for freedom using any and all means necessary."},{"Title":"The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Resistance","review":"This book is very mixed.At its best, it presents an \\"if this goes on\\" novel of free people at the breaking point where the US Government has become a massive police state intent on preserving the state and its (many) servants at the expense of the average citizen. Clearly there are trends in the US which might well lead to the kind of clinically dead society the book portrays, and civil war might become the only answer.But, despite the veil of being set 50 years into the future, the author is really arguing that we are nearly there today. I'd like to believe there is still hope.At its worst, though, the author's anarcho-capitalist philosophy comes through with a very heavy hand. Characters go off on tirades and black-helicopter conspiracy excursions that remind one of that guy at the cocktail party that everyone learns to avoid.The writing itself is so-so: only Madison stands out as a character. When the rest converse you find yourself counting back paragraphs to see who's talking; never a good sign. But like most idea fiction, it's the ideas that are central, not the characters. Unfortunately the ideas are hit and miss and scattered. A few drafts and a good editor short of a fine novel."},{"Title":"The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Resistance","review":"I just had to take issue with the review entitled: \\"I'm Sorry Guys\\" in which Reviewer: Joshua Hiles complained that the author \\"completely ripped off Alan Moore's V for Vendetta which is about, drumroll please, a masked anarchist/libertarian taking on a corrupt goverment... Seriously this book is double-plagarized.\\"First of all, Atlas Shrugged (an AMAZING novel, by the way) was written by Ayn Rand in the 1950s, well before V for Vendetta, and took place in a totalitarian America ruled by Socialists (as opposed to Faschists in \\"V.\\" The Novel featured John Galt, who, while he wore no literal mask, was a figure of intense mystery for hundreds of pages before his identity is revealed. Like \\"V,\\" he also takes over the National PA system and delivers an impassioned speach as the leaders listen on helplessly.So, What I'm basically saying is that V for Vendetta was inspired by MANY previous sources, including Atlas Shrugged (although Alan Moore hasn't mentioned the obvious parallels to my knowledge) and this book similarly draws from previous sources. There's a big difference between Plagerism (claiming someone's ideas and words as one's own) and taking inspiration from previous works, paying homage to them and following some basic ideas, adding creativity to create a distinct product. Case in point: the movie \\"Apocolypse Now\\" is a close adaptation of the literary classic \\"Heart of Darkness\\" (Even some characters share the same names (Kurtz)."},{"Title":"The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Resistance","review":"700 + pages of action.

Its a poor shadow of Atlas Shrugged, which ISN'T THAT GOOD OF A BOOK TO BEGIN WITH.This dude also completely ripped off Alan Moore's V for Vendetta which is about, drumroll please, a masked anarchist/libertarian taking on a corrupt goverment.Seriously this book is double-plagarized, he gets one star for his enormous balls and the fact that most of you don't seem to have noticed."},{"Title":"The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Resistance","review":"For me, the only good thing about this novel was the consistent, \\"wake up and see what your government is doing\\" message. As a cautionary tale, it served its purpose, but as a novel, it left me stone cold.My first problem with this nearly 700-page story was its hero, a man who:........was physically perfect (massive shoulders and tree trunks for limbs)........had a touch of metaphysical/magical ability (he had \\"The Sight\\")........was brilliant........had vast wealth........turned down a career as an NFL quarterback to become a mega-rockstar........was expert in all forms of weaponry, both modern and antique........could get it up four times an hour and keep that up all nightIn short, I'm convinced the hero was nothing less than a Marty Stu (for those unfamiliar with the term, a Marty Stu/Mary Sue is a fictional character who is portrayed in an idealized way and who is lacking any noteworthy flaws -- a character made in the image of how the author sees himself in his fantasies)Some of my other issues with the story involved:........A cast of supporting characters so one-dimensional and boring that I never cared a whit about any of them........Pages and pages of weapons description........An absurd and pointless paean to Eric Carmen as the most underrated \\"rocker\\" ever........Many equally pointless insertions of bad song lyrics........An obsession with babies -- This obsession was so great that not only did our hero refuse to have sex with women who didn't want children, but all the \\"good\\" female characters wanted children immediately, the more the better, and brought up the subject with great frequency (here again, I became convinced that I was seeing little more than a projection of the author's wishful thinking, bordering on desperation)To top it all off, I was supposed to believe that assassinating a few low-level government flunkies was somehow going to wake people up, change their minds, and set them on the path to righteousness.It was depressing, because even though the message of the novel was serious and the author had some valid points to make, they became tainted by the unbelievability of the characters and the story. Maybe it shouldn't be that way. Maybe the ideas stand on their own as incorruptible. But if I have trouble taking the messenger seriously, how much credence am I going to give to the message itself?All in all, this book had so much less impact on me than it could have. I purchased it because I'm concerned about government abuse and because I believe in reason, individual responsibility, and self-determination. But I also like my books to be well written, with fully realized characters, interesting dialogue, and a story that goes beyond the feel of a clich&eacute;d action movie. I didn't find any of that here."},{"Title":"The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Resistance","review":"Robin Hood has been coopted to be a hero of wealth redistribution, even though he robbed from the tax collectors and gave to the tax payers. William Tell is largely unremembered except as an excellent archer. Batman and The Green Hornet are in many ways servants to the state, only going after the private criminals. The only hero one can compare The Black Arrow to is Zorro.The first thing an observant reader will notice is that all examples of government abuse in this book are taken from real life, such as the case of Don Scott of Malibu. They are only slightly enlarged, to make things bad enough to inspire resistance and revolt.Fast paced and easy to read, it seems shorter than it's 700 pages, but it is not light or lacking in detail for the enjoyment of the reader.The hero is a paragon, more than human. He is a young, handsome, wealthy, ex-Rock star at the peak of physical fitness.There is a fault with this book, but it is a fault common to most libertarian literature, in that the common criminal is missing. Some might object that the government is too strict to enable them to operate, but that is not an objection a libertarian can sustain. Others might object that they are all in government employ where it is safer for them to violate the rights of others. As sustainable as that argument is, there are always independent operators for the Zorros of the world to fight as there is never a shortage of people who want to violate the rights of others.Be that as it may, this is a great read."},{"Title":"The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Resistance","review":"I really wanted to love this book, especially considering the theme and the fact that I haven't read fiction in years; unfortunately, I can only rate it average. In the hands of, say, Harlan Ellison, it could have been outstanding, but, as written, this novel is too long and quite self-indulgent. For example, I do like the music of The Raspberries, but I wouldn't dream of inserting their lyrics into my novel (several times!) simply because of that fact. There are also frequent references to current popular (and past) culture that I seriously doubt anyone will remember thirty years from now, and \\"witty\\" dialog that consists of lines from 60's era pop songs. The entire opus seems to be a case of \\"it's my party, and I'll do what I want to.\\" (My apologizes to Lesley Gore, but this is the type of thing the author adores.)IMHO, there's too much rumination, and an overabundance of background material on things like samurai swords in the 700-page book -- while not enough actual *events* take place. Plenty of unnecessarily- detailed gore, though. It's as if the author is writing for the teenage graphic novel crowd, at perhaps a high-school reading level. Despite what other reviewers have written, I did find that the novel bogged down about two-thirds of the way through.Ultimately, and sadly, I found it a fairly superficial experience."},{"Title":"The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Resistance","review":"In The Black Arrow: A Tale Of The Resistance, author Vin Suprynowicz draws upon his skill and expertise as a syndicated newspaper columnist to write a provocative novel set in the near future of 2031 where America is ruled under the authority of a Patriot-Poindexter police state. This is a time of ID checks, invasive body searches, stacked juries, kangaroo courts, a corrupt political class, and a gray-suited police cadre known as the Homeland Security Special Forces. It is against this background that wealthy record company executive Andrew Fletcher decides to resist the all powerful police state by becoming a masked vigilante known as the \\"Black Arrow\\". The result is a thrilling, rapidly paced, 703-page action/adventure novel that also incorporates thoughtful and thought-provoking commentary on the power of the state run amuck, an unusual love story, and how a movement of the people can take back their liberties when pressed to far by those above them. Highly recommended reading -- especially for the libertarian inclined!"},{"Title":"The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Resistance","review":"Fabulous!Much more than just a politically-informed novel, The Black Arrow is a triumph of 21st Century story-telling. I read very few novels, but once I started The Black Arrow, I was hooked.There's action, there's whimsy, there's romance, and there's a sense of moral urgency. The moral urgency -- the sense that terrible wrongs must be righted -- drove me relentlessly to see how the heroes and villains would play out their destinies.Vin Suprynowicz is a journalist and columnist. His style tends to be concrete and clear, so his first novel tells a story that flows effortlessly and never baffles the reader. The Black Arrow could easily be adapted into a screenplay for a fast-paced movie.Vin also has succeeded in getting inside the heads of the main characters -- even the villains -- in ways that give a three-dimensional perspective to the whole story. It's not just \\"deep and thoughtful good guy vs. cardboard bad guys.\\" You really do come to understand what motivates the players. In addition to all of the other great characteristics of the book (as described by other reviewers), the inner views into the hearts and minds of the actors really help make the book as captivating as it is.If you like thrillers, if you like novels that weave ideas with action, then you'll very much enjoy The Black Arrow. I loved every moment of it!(Suitable for readers over age 18. Buy it, open it, and hang on!)"},{"Title":"The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Resistance","review":"Take ATLAS SHRUGGED, then substitute the 60-page John Galt speech with digestible \\"sound bites,\\" add a dash of rock 'n roll, plenty of sex, scores of commando raids, fierce samurai action, and lots of resistance strategy, and you've got THE BLACK ARROW. At 700 pages, it's a hefty book (not quite the Randian monster, though), but it never drags. It's a quick read -- and one I'm sure I'll return to several more times."},{"Title":"The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Resistance","review":"Black Arrow is a novel in the same vein as John Ross' \\"Unintended Consequences\\". It is well written, and a fast paced action story set in the future. Much like in George Orwell's 1984, the government has run amock keeping tabs on the citizens it was elected to protect. In this world, the politicians are evil, but the freedom fighters are knocking them off one by one. This was a fun read."},{"Title":"The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Resistance","review":"The Black Arrow is what every libertarian dreams of --a story that communicates the ideals of freedom clearly, without being \\"preachy\\" or condesending, and an excellent read in its own right.The plot moves and engages you. The climatic end battle grabs you and won't let go. The characters are surprisingly rich given the number of them and the amount of action. Vin gives you enough details, but keeps it moving forward. Even in the darkest hour, there is a note of hopefulness. The internal dialogue of the Arrow being willing to fight, but not really relishing it adds a rich element.The one negative point is that the book is 700 pages long. Vin, what were you thinking? Way too short. I want more!I've enjoyed Vin's non-fiction, \\"Send in the Waco Killers\\" and \\"The Ballad of Carl Draga,\\" but this is a fiction-lover's dream. Now I have something else to read besides \\"Atlas Shrugged\\". I hope the next novel comes out VERY soon."},{"Title":"The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Resistance","review":"I have long been a fan of Vin Suprynowicz' columns and non-fiction. With this book he proves that he has the ability to write an engrossing and entertaining tale as well.After finishing the book, the first thought that occurred to me was that it read like a screenplay. The action is tight, visual, and colorful, while the dialogue effectively conveys emotion as well as moving the story along. The characters are well-developed and are 'real' by the story's end. It is edgy, tight, and gripping.The only reasons I can believe that Hollywood isn't jumping all over this for the right to make a film have to do with the subject matter. Killing 'Jack-booted Thugs' is a subject that has not yet made it's way to mainstream America's consciousness. When 'Harry's War' is seen on the shelves at Blockbuster, 'The Black Arrow' won't be far behind."},{"Title":"The Black Arrow: A Tale of the Resistance","review":"This book is now truly #1 in my collection of Libertarian and freedom oriented literature. I literally could not put it down.What a story! What a man! The Black Arrow signifies each of our own desires to rise up against the ever encroaching power and abuses of our government. The story line, some of it taken from actual documented cases, and most taken stricly from the mind of the author, is spellbinding. It is all quite believable that this very scenario could play out in the not too distant future.There's a little (or a lot of) something for everyone: drama, suspense, passion, love, sex, murder, weapons, heroism, oppression, and triumph. This book has it all, especially for freedom minded individuals worried about what the future might hold for us. Read it.

The problems in the book range from easy to challenging (some just tedious) that will help and prepare students for tests and other standarized exams.

No cartoons, no shoot-em-up diversions, only the austere beaty of logic in an assimilable format for children.

Would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Geometry the Easy Way (Barron's E-Z)","review":"Read: 7/12Rate: 5/57/12: I owe my knowledge of geometry to Lawrence Leff's E-Z Geometry. Although the book claims that you will improve your grade in 30 days, that will be true, but it's going to take a long time to get through it. If you want to get the most out of it, be prepared to dig in deep and do every proof there is in the book. Like Euclid says, it is the \\"royal road to Geometry.\\" I've said this many times, and I will continue to say this: you cannot learn Geometry without doing two-sided proofs, and you cannot advance further in Geometry without memorizing the words, definitions, theorems, and postulates. Once you do, the royal road is filled with enlightenment. Euclid's 13 Books of Elements is one of the greatest, if not the greatest ever, contributions to mankind. The knowledge set out forth by his works is what shaped the thinking of men and women for the past two millennia, and all of it in a modern form can be found in E-Z Geometry. When you are mastering the book, you are essentially mastering what Euclid had laid out. Doing the two sided proofs is the real significance and an important building block in your mathematical education. Once this is accomplished with fluency, you are ready to do Calculus and advanced mathematics including proofing. Again, E-Z Geometry is a tough book, and a lot of time should be spent on it. It will be worth it for a lifetime, and you can learn so much. I know I did. If you are debating whether you want to get E-Z Geometry or something else like REA, The Humongous Book of Geometry Problems, or Schaum's, look no further. E-Z Geometry is the one to get because I've tried all of them, and I really think E-Z Geometry is the most friendly Geometry book you can possibly work with. Anyway, I've caught some errors. Here is the errata:Chapter 12: 13 is 116, not 106.Chapter 14: 42 is 162, not 169.Chapter 14: 52 is 600pi, not 1800pi.Chapter 16: 15c is 2, not 1.Chapter 17: 19 is (1), not (2).Chapter 17: 27 is y = -2x + 7, not y = 2x + 7.I can't speak for the solutions of the proof since I've done mine my own way. Now, let me tell you about proofs, something most students don't understand. There is never one way of doing proofs. If you decide to structure your proofs based on your own chain of reasoning arriving at the same goal as the author's, it is still correct as long as the reasons are valid. It means you don't have to follow the exact same way as the solution was laid out in the book or somebody else's. If it is different, it, in no way, means you are wrong. It's just style the author has, and you should develop your own style that makes it unique. There is nothing wrong with it. That's the goal of any mathematics student: to create proofs in your own unique way. It is a lot better to do that than just to make up rubbish and try to pass it off as mathematics. All in all, E-Z Geometry is the one to get if you want to master as much of Euclid's Geometry regardless of the fact not everything about it in it; you will have to seek out further information in other books"},{"Title":"Geometry the Easy Way (Barron's E-Z)","review":"I have taken geometry in high school and still had a bit of knowledge about it (even though I had to take it twice). This book takes a lot of concentration if you are not familiar with geometry, there are a LOT of typo's which is sad that someome who is trying to learn geometry is recognizing this, and if you don't notice it, it will take you down the wrong path or confuse you. But I definitely did learn from this book. In conclusion if you have someone to ask questions this book is great, and will improve your skills.

Not even halfway through the first chapter I was completely confused. If you're like me, you want to know why something is, and how do you explain it in a way that's understandable. I had a horrible time understanding the way in which they explained how to label an angle etc. On a brighter note, I think this would probably be a useful text to use with another source, such as an actual geometry textbook.

Books back in the day, covered more with dihedral angles, and proofs in 3-dimensions. This book covers the essence. Proofs that range from 8 to 13 to 14 steps as I encountered. I like the examples, and the problems are not directly the same, so they dont exactly regurgitate and to me that is learning. Congruent triangles, proving a quadrilateral is a parallelogram, rhombus, so forth is covered extensively, each chapter has exercises at the end of the chapter with review problems. Theres only solid geometry on spheres, cylinders, cubes, and prisms.They ask you to calculate the surface area and volume. There is also calculations on the volume of a cone. They dont however go into calculating surface area, lateral area of cones, or composite figures hemispheres attached to cylinders, or areas of pyramids inscribed in cones, or area of a circus tent, story problems (cylinders attached to cones) Thats my major gripe Im very fastidious for education and a consumer, I give this book 4 stars, not 5 if this was added I would have given great study tool, better exercises than watered down books. This is not even a text book, thats what makes it so unique. A student will succeed from most geometry books with this book, ample examples. I guarantee it.

It's quite readable and written with a clear, casual voice (unlike some math texts that are dry and/or confusing) that's perfect for self-study. Not to say that this is exciting material--it's basically like the transcript of a teacher talking to you and doing example problems. It's not like the \\"Calculus Made Easy\\" where it's a story about a narrator shipwrecked on an island with the Professor, Recordis, et al. The format is nice, with the theorems in boxes and the problems worked out step by step. I found this book to be much more clear and concise than a traditional textbook I ordered, which stretched out the material into numerous sub-sections and had extraneous 'mixed review' and 'discovery activity' BS. This book is near perfect (I've stopped my studies to say the words 'God, I love this book' quite a few times) but there's quite a few typos in my edition.

Wells","review":"Thanks for scholars like Nicholas Delbanco who hunt down biographical details that enrich our knowledge of famous authors lives. Here is a book that offers a savory meal for the literary gourmet. Henry James liked donuts. Stephen Crane chain smoked. Conrad the English stylist spoke with a thick Polish accent. Ford Madox Ford embellished his recollections with untruths. H. G. Wells treated offers of help with cocky independence.The author contends that for a certain interval these men associated with and admired each others literary accomplishments. &quot;South of London in 1900, a galaxy of talent assembled that beggars in accomplishment anything the English language has since produced.&quot; He provides quotations and photographs that demonstrate social intercourse between the big five. Between the initial overview and the concluding summary, three chapters provide respectively a view of Stephen Crane on a visit to England to meet the other masters of ficti! onal prose, a study of the collaboration between Ford Madox Ford and Joseph Conrad, and an examination of one of English literature's most famous disputes - James vs. Wells.I found the book informative and interesting and recommend it to any admirer of any of the five writers singularly or in combination. About those we admire our curiosity is insatiable. Did Shakespeare like his eggs over easy or sunny side up? We have his Hamlet, his Lear, isn't that enough? Some might say no. We have Crane's &quot;Open Boat&quot;, Conrad's &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;, Ford's *Good soldier, James' *Ambassadors, Wells' *Time Machine*. Still, it's natural to inquire about the virtues, quirks, and foibles of their creators. *Group Portrait* gives us a taste of the traits that rounds out these illustrious authors.A sad epilogue to which Mr. Delbanco refers in his lead chapter is that this literary summer was so brief. Crane died in 1900. Eventually the other associations wither! ed. By 1906 the friendship between Conrad and Ford had coo! led. *Boon* published in 1915 dissolved Wells' ties to James with its ridicule of the latter. For a while there was Camelot albeit a loose confederacy of brilliant writers. A genius needs a tough ego to sustain him for the long haul to fortune and fame. An alternate lesson from *Group portrait, perhaps one not intended, but nevertheless patent, is that collaboration must eventually give way to ego."},{"Title":"Complicity How The North Promoted, Prolonged, and Profited From Slavery","review":"Wow! This was one of those books I found myself carrying around from room to room, so impatient was I to resume it after interruptions. Maybe the material is familiar to serious students of American history, but for somebody like me this book was a revelation, showing how hugely significant slavery (both in the Americas and in Africa itself) was for the economies and lifestyles of the northern states. The material assembled here is utterly fascinating, and the writing is condensed and pointed, with telling choices of anecdote or quotation in almost every paragraph. The book is much more of a page turner than most histories I have read. Maybe it's because the writers are professional journalists, people whose daily job it is, after all, to make information accessible and interesting to the average guy. I also get the sense the writers were deeply moved by the material, and eager to share it. The book isn't written in a straight chronological form, but organized according to topic (for example, a slave revolt in colonial NYC, or the hounding of a Connecticut woman who ran a pre-Civil War school for blacks, or the kidnapping of freed slaves from the North, or the thoroughly horrible ivory trade's beneficial impact on two Connecticut towns), and the writers, skillfully shifting their gaze back and forth in time, are quite masterful at showing how the past leads to the present. When I had finished reading I had a much deeper understanding of slavery's power and significance. The book itself is very handsome, not too bulky to hold, inset with many well-placed illustrations - not all grouped in a center section, as they are in so many histories and biographies. My one quibble is that some of the maps and reproduced newspaper clippings, etc., are too small to be read easily without a magnifying glass."},{"Title":"Complicity How The North Promoted, Prolonged, and Profited From Slavery","review":"In some ways it's surprising that so few have been aware of the North's complicity in slavery. The very first slave auction took place in what is now New York. Even after the end of Northern slavery, Northern racism continued. Sadly, this was true in the White Churches as evidenced by the need for Richard Allen and Absalom Jones having to start the first Free Black Denomination due to White Christian prejudices. Though surprising that these facts are unknown, Farrow and her co-authors have done modern readers a great service by providing first-hand, primary sources that reveal not only the facts, but the cruel, soulless heart of the North's sad legacy of enslavement, racism, and prejudice. What readers don't hear as much of, are the inspiring stories of African American survival--through faith, nor do they hear enough of the stories of many Whites in the North, and even in the South, who did indeed reject slavery and the evil premises behind it. Of course, no one book can tell every aspect of the story of slavery. \\"Complicity\\" tells its story well.Reviewer: Bob Kellemen, Ph.D., is the author of Beyond the Suffering: Embracing the Legacy of African American Soul Care and Spiritual Direction , Soul Physicians, and Spiritual Friends."},{"Title":"Complicity How The North Promoted, Prolonged, and Profited From Slavery","review":"At just over 300 pages, this slender book is packed with one-after-another stunning revelations of the long-buried history of the North's intimate involvement in the slave trade.This isn't the history your teachers taught you; this book will open your eyes to the realization that what has passed for American history for seven generations was a lie by omission, a mythology that portrayed the North as the home of noble souls who sought to free the slaves while the South exploited them.This book will show you how the North exploited both the slaves and their masters, making them the engine for its own great wealth.The book, written not by academicians but by professionaljournalists, is a rapid and exciting read, and the writing flows so smoothly, the reader finds herself at book's end wanting more.Surely, more will come in the wake of this survey. The book teases us with many brief tellings of tales that could be books unto themselves, and it should be no less than a first window into a new era of re-examination of our greatest national shame."},{"Title":"Complicity How The North Promoted, Prolonged, and Profited From Slavery","review":"Per Napoleon: \\"History is the version of past events that people have decided to agree upon.\\"Thanks to the authors for addressing this important topic in greater detail. Histories written about debates regarding slavery during the Continental Congress made it clear that southern delegates wouldn't sign the Declaration of Independence if slavery was abolished, but that it would be hypocritical of northern delegates to portray their states as anything but culpable in profiteering from the slave trade. In 1969, Sherman Edwards, a former New York high school history teacher become composer and lyricist, even touched upon this serious theme when he brought the musical \\"1776\\" to Broadway. His song lyrics for \\"Molasses to Rum\\", performed by Edward Rutledge, delegate from South Carolina, drives the message home of the North-South-Africa triangle:Molasses to rum to slaves, oh what a beautiful waltzYou dance with us, we dance with youMolasses and rum and slavesWho sails the ships out of BostonLadened with bibles and rum?Who drinks a toast to the Ivory Coast?Hail Africa, the slavers have comeNew England with bibles and rumAnd its off with the rum and the biblesTake on the slaves, clink, clinkHail and farewell to the smellOf the African coastMolasses to rum to slaves'Tisn't morals, 'tis money that savesShall we dance to the sound of the profitable poundIn molasses and rum and slavesWho sails the ships out of GuineaLadened with bibles and slaves?'Tis Boston can coast to the West Indies coastJamaica, we brung what ye cravesAntigua, Barbados, we brung bibles and slaves!Molasses to rum to slavesWho sail the ships back to BostonLadened with gold, see it gleamWhose fortunes are made in the triangle tradeHail slavery, the New England dream!Mr. Adams, I give you a toast:Hail Boston!

Yes, it is still a surprise to many people in the north. I live in Central PA where we see more confederate flags on pickups than you see in Alabama, yet there is a cultural moral superiority over the south that exists here, and can only be worse in Massachusetts. I took African-American history in college and even I was surprised to read that the mayor of NYC openly spoke of joining the south in secession.So sorry to burst your bubble, this is a needed book. Even northerners who will admit there were slaves throughout all the colonies, a book like this shows the truth we'd like to forget about.I was a working class white kid who thought himself pretty progressive and knowledgeable on these matters. Most of my peers and neighbors haven't ever given this topic a thought. If I can still find eye-opening material, most laymen can too. And some of the lucky few who've had a college course.

The authors are to be congratulated, and the Hartford Courant should be very proud of this team."},{"Title":"Complicity How The North Promoted, Prolonged, and Profited From Slavery","review":"After the Civil War, the winner (the North), wrote the history of America to exclude the fact that Slavery was a major factor in Northern commerce. All of New England, New York, Pennsylvania, the Northwest Territory etc. had Slavery. But when the Northern history books, the ones we now use in school, were written large erasers were taken to them to exclude Northern Slavery. Many people still believe the Northern Colonies and then States never had Slavery. This book makes sure you don't make that mistake. When the Slavers (Slave ships) landed at New Orleans or Charleston, SC with their human cargo, they were not ships from the South. They were ships from New York, Boston, Rhode Island etc. The great robber-barron's of the 18th century made their fortunes from selling Blacks from Africa. And these merchants lived in the North. In addition, the Northern economy was dependent on Slave-grown cotton in the South. Cotton grown in the South was the oil that lubricated the Northern industrial revolution. As described in this book, Southern cotton was sent North for the weaving mills of New England and was shipped from Northern ports, making vast profits for the Northern businessman. In essence, the Northern economy demanded more slaves to grow more cotton and thus because the engine that drove slavery. Every American should read this book and know these facts."},{"Title":"Complicity How The North Promoted, Prolonged, and Profited From Slavery","review":"This was a wonderful source of information shedding light on a otherwise little known subject. Most people, when thinking of slavery, only tend to think it was something exclusively in the south. However this book highlights the facts about the north's sorted past where this ugly subject was concerned. It was very informative and frank about it's subject and in some areas quite disturbing. An absolute must for people interested in the truth about America's past especially regarding the practice of slavery and economics."},{"Title":"Complicity How The North Promoted, Prolonged, and Profited From Slavery","review":"This book studies the ways that the North, in particular New England, had an economic interest in the continuance of slavery in the South. From the legal and illegal slave trades to cotton mills to rum to ivory piano keys, the New England states made a lot of money off the labor and suffering of slaves in the U.S., the Caribbean, and Africa. Although we in the North are fond of thinking of slavery as not our issue, in fact the wealth of the entire United States is founded on the fruits of slave labor, and many Northerners--even abolitionists--welcomed these profits, tainted as they were. Love of money triumphs over principles yet again.The subject matter of this book is interesting and the text is supported by many images, though most are so tiny that they are not as useful as they could be. While the authors, reporters from The Hartford Courant, name some names, they aren't finally as hard hitting as one would hope. I found the lack of footnotes or parenthetical citations bothersome in a history book. The documentation is in the back of the book, but there is no signal about sources or the need to look at the notes in the text itself. I understand that I am probably in the minority of readers here, but I like my scholarly documentation to be apparent.The book was an eye-opener, and I am glad that I read it. More people should read it because it will help put an end to the self-congratulatory fairy tale of the North's opposition to Southern slavery."},{"Title":"Complicity How The North Promoted, Prolonged, and Profited From Slavery","review":"Ms. Farrow reveals reality long concealed by historical revisionists and today's PC climate: that slavery existed in the north as well as the south and was equally responsible for the \\"peculiar institution\\" blamed only upon southern states.Farrow leaves no stone unturned, from the practice of stealing free blacks and selling them as slaves to atrocities inflicted on blacks by angry white workers. It wasn't just the south; it was the entire country.It's also interesting to note that the war of 1861-1865 did NOT \\"free\\" the slaves. Southern slaves were free at the end of the war; northern slaves remained in bondage until the constitutional amendment banning slavery was passed by Congress in the fall of 1865 - months after the last shot was fired."},{"Title":"Complicity How The North Promoted, Prolonged, and Profited From Slavery","review":"Very interesting book but none of the sources were cited in the text so although it makes sense, I am still skeptical"},{"Title":"Complicity How The North Promoted, Prolonged, and Profited From Slavery","review":"I want to address only one issue that is brought up in this book. The other reviews are very enlightening for anyone who is interested in reading this book.It is simply incredible to see educated people actually trying to blame slavery on anti-Darwinists, when the fact is that Darwinism was the justification for slavery. (Racist ideas were pervasive in all societies, Darwin made them \\"scientific.\\")Any dark-skinned person with kinky hair who believes in evolution is actually asking to be considered a sub-human being. To actually believe that Darwinism was the light that opened people's eyes to slavery, and helped to overthrow it, as these authors do, is beyond belief.If you believe in evolution, as these writers do, you have to believe in races of varying development. Thus you have to believe that there are races that are under-developed, as Darwin himself believed:-\\"At some not very distant future, the civilized races of man will almost certainly EXTERMINATE and replace, the savage races throughout the world. The separation between the Caucasian races and the gorilla will be wider, because the Negros and Australian aborigines will no longer exist.\\" The Descent of Man; 1874; p178Looking back now, what a fool Darwin was for such an evil prophecy. And this man is the hero of the authors of this book. Can anything be more depraved?These writers look at the evidence in the face and see just the Opposite. Every \\"scientist\\" mentioned who were racists were also evolutionists.It's true that some used the Bible as justification for slavery, but that is due to ignorance and incorrect reading of the Bible. The word race does not exist in the Bible nor does the idea that Noah's son Ham was dark-skinned.It was Biblical teaching that all are descended from Adam that compelled abolitionists to act. Evolution is not only lacking the notion that all men are created in God's image, it teaches just the opposite. Tyrants have used it for centuries to detroy the weaker, and to see it as a positive force for humanity is truly perverse logic."},{"Title":"Complicity How The North Promoted, Prolonged, and Profited From Slavery","review":"Excellent well documented review of the real story of Lincoln's uunnessary WAR. The South , with support from the North,provided the cotton needed to make the USA 's solid export product Cotton was the crop of choice in 1860."},{"Title":"Complicity How The North Promoted, Prolonged, and Profited From Slavery","review":"This is history for people who do not read history and have little intention to change. The authors are reporters who were horrified to find slavery existed in Connecticut. After that startling discovery, they proceeded to establish that slavery was common in America. Next, they made the equally startling discovery that Northerners profited from both the slave trade and dealing with slaveholders. I feel that this was news to educated people is the most upsetting part of the book.This book attempts to be several things at once. First, the book wants to expose slavery in Northern America. The first five chapters present an account of this. The author's wishing to make their abhorrence of slavery clear, never missing a chance to \\"flog a dead horse\\". That very few are in favor of slavery never seems to occur to them. The second part of the book deals with the international slave trade and New England and New York's role. In the years prior to the Civil War, New York City has very close ties to the South and to an illegal international slave trade. The chapter on kidnapping and selling free Blacks is one of the best in the book. The last part of the book overreaches trying to prove Northern complicity in \\"race science\\" and the Ivory Trade. By this time, most readers of history will have serious doubts about the book and recognize they are reading for enjoyment not solid information.The book will appeal to those who wish to prove their anti-slavery credentials, those who wish to show America to be a raciest society and Lost Cause Tradition adherents. This last group will use the information to say there was \\"no difference\\" between North & South on slavery.The book is not footnoted. Notes, based on direct quotes, may be found in a notes section. These notes are so poor as to be useless. The best they do is direct you to the bibliography, where you find the majority of books are contemporary works. The major value of this book is in being a quick read and inexpensive."},{"Title":"Complicity How The North Promoted, Prolonged, and Profited From Slavery","review":"Three journalists from the Hartford Courant attempted to expand a series of newspaper articles into a book-length examination of \`the North's' complicity in slavery. They partially succeed. The book's early chapters explore slavery as it existed in the North, the connections between Northern industry and Southern slavery, New York City's particular role in the slave trade and the \`triangular trade' (involving the US, Europe and Africa), and a \`reverse underground railroad' involving the kidnapping of free blacks and their sale in the South. These chapters all supply useful information to fill the interstices of history, although much of it struck this reader as much less surprising than it did to the authors.The book first goes seriously off its rails in the concluding chapters when it ventures into the stories of Elijah Lovejoy and John Brown. Their familiar stories are so well known that they seem out of place in a book that strives to deliver journalistically fresh content. Certainly nothing new is added to the reader's knowledge about these men and the hatred they generated North and South.A chapter about the 19th century Philadelphia scientist Samuel George Morton who developed a \`scientific' theory of the \`races' that \`proved' the inferiority of Africans and their descendants adds less than it might have and seems like an afterthought, a rather disorganized one at that. The chapter reaches its nadir when the authors elect to cherry pick quotes from Rev. Theodore Parker and Abraham Lincoln affirming the superiority of whites. They might have at least added Parker's quote predicting the success of abolition: \\"I do not pretend to understand the moral universe; the arc is a long one... And from what I see I am sure it bends toward justice.\\"The book's final chapter is also its oddest. It concerns the undeniably horrid consequences of the ivory trade especially on the African slaves forced to transport the tusks long distances. The tusks were particularly used to make piano keys. Undeniably, Northerners made pianos and played them, but they were hardly alone in these endeavors. Like the preceding chapter, this one seems like it was added in order to satisfy the publisher's idea of how long a book should be.In a brief afterword, the authors assert that America's \`extraordinary ascent into the world arena' would have been much delayed had the country, North and South, not benefited from the unpaid labor the slaves. This assertion is necessary to undergird the author's next assertion that the North was complicit in allowing this to happen and benefited from it. As a matter of labor economics, the authors' assumption that the US economy would have suffered if it had had to rely on free labor is doubtful. Indeed, the assumption flies in the face of the \`free soil, free labor' ideology of Abraham Lincoln's nascent Republican Party, which argued that free men would work harder in a free labor society and that slavery undermined the free workers of the South.The authors also disavow any intent to \`debunk the myth of a virtuous North'. Perhaps so, but to this reader their failure to place the undeniable negative facts about the North in a broader context gives the book an unbalanced sensationalism. A reader might be excused for thinking that the only abolitionists were the few heroic leaders and not the thousands of members of a Northern mass movement. The authors cite statistics that New York State still had 20,000 slaves within its borders in 1790. True enough, but the authors neglect to relate that Maryland, North Carolina and South Carolina each already had over 100,000 slaves while Virginia had over 290,000 slaves.\`Complicity' fills in gaps in general knowledge about specific ways in which many Northerners benefited a little and a few Northerners benefited enormously from slavery. The book at least implicitly suggests an equivalency between the North and the South in responsibility for slavery that the facts do not support. The South was a slave society based on and defined by slavery; the North was not a slave society (and likely would have prospered without Southern slavery), but the North did benefit from slavery indirectly in large ways (e.g., large-scale manufacture of textiles that employed thousands) and directly in more limited ways (e.g., slave-trade shipping that benefited relatively few Northerners).The book's tone ironically undercuts a nuanced reading of history that an appreciation of the relative roles of the North and South in slavery yields. The reader might better spend his time with Howard Zinn'sPeople's History of the United States: 1492 to Present (P.S.)Edmund Morgan'sAmerican Slavery, American Freedom, Eric Foner'sFree Soil, Free Labor, Free Men: The Ideology of the Republican Party before the Civil War With a New Introductory Essay, or evenThe Bloody Shirt: Terror After Appomattoxby Stephen Budiansky."},{"Title":"Complicity How The North Promoted, Prolonged, and Profited From Slavery","review":"YES, ALL SHOULD KNOW HOW THE NORTH(BIG BUSINESS)COMPLICITY WITH SLAVERY.

The brutality of the ivory trade was very shocking and definitely needs more exploration. Any country that had the amount of free trade and labor along with never being prosecuted for the crimes has no excuse but to be the richest country in the world."},{"Title":"Complicity How The North Promoted, Prolonged, and Profited From Slavery","review":"I taught US and African-American history for 15 years. Admittedly, junior college and university level. But even in freshman survey courses, NEVER were people in the antebellum North depicted as noble people who abhored slavery. The anti-abolitionist mobs that attacked William Lloyd Garrison, the murder of abolitionist newspaper editor in Alton, Illinois, Northern bigotry regarding African-Americans, was never glossed over. Anyone in the North who recognized the evil of slavery and wanted it ended was seen clearly as an atypical Northerner.Perhaps for the lay reader this book offers revelation. For anyone who's read much about antebellum society, this is not an eye-opening surprise."},{"Title":"Complicity How The North Promoted, Prolonged, and Profited From Slavery","review":"No matter how much of this book is true, it certainly doesn't tell the whole story. The abolition movement in the North was very powerful, especially among certain Christian groups. Thousands of the men in the North who volunteered, and they were all volunteers at the beginnning of the Civil War had the moral purpose of ending slavery in mind. But with modern historical revisionism, all white men are bad, all persons of color are good! I've seen this time and again in current \\"histories\\" of the period. Certainly you can find racists anywhere you go in this world; the world of today and yesterday. Dwelling on the perceived evils of the past, committed by some, but not all, will not solve the evils of today. Therefore, what is this book worth to our modern society?"},{"Title":"Complicity How The North Promoted, Prolonged, and Profited From Slavery","review":"To say this is an important book is an understatement. Understanding of the issue of slavery and how it functioned and who benefited is broadened to include the North as well as the South. For many of its readers this book is revelatory, imparting knowledge that is new and mind-expanding. One's innocence that might claim lack of participation or material reward from that which is called the peculiar institution is banished. This book is essential reading for anyone willing to grapple deeply with how that institution has affected the core of American society and the world at large."},{"Title":"Complicity How The North Promoted, Prolonged, and Profited From Slavery","review":"You may not have heard very much about it in school, and you definitely will not not hear about it in the national media, but the north was also very much invovled in slavery up to the civil war! When the question is asked \\"What was the main reason for this terrible period in our history?\\" the typical answer is SLAVERY! Taking this train of thought to its end, the true answer is \\"PROFIT\\" (power/money). I am very much a believer in capitolism, but not at the expense of human beings! I believe this book demonstrates many powerful people in the north sought profit over people, as did the southerners who owned slaves. Let us not forget the fact that many fellow Africans made profits from selling other blacks into slavery. So now you see that there are guilty parties on all 3 points of the triangular trade! If you are very much interested in American History, I highly recommend this book to you for a fair and balanced look at American slavery. If you maybe somewhat interested in this subject, I believe you'll find some very interesting informatiom in it also."},{"Title":"Complicity How The North Promoted, Prolonged, and Profited From Slavery","review":"Absolutely superb history. Book should have won a Pulitzer Prize.This book makes the \\"government school history\\" obsolete. I've never defended the South's participation in slavery or ever tried to rationalize it.But the questions raised from \\"Complicity\\" I have is why hasn't this story been told before? Why has it been sanitized, minimalized and largely ignored? I'm not taking about the professional historian who is aware yet I've never seen the professional historian try to impart this history into the mainstream culture. All this is is very telling. They'll be a Mississippi Burning Part 6 before this history will go Hollywood.I guess the victors really do write the history."},{"Title":"Complicity How The North Promoted, Prolonged, and Profited From Slavery","review":"While I knew most the basics of Northern states' slaveowning and its eventual phaseout, and that, pre-1807, Northern shippers/sailing captains made plenty of money on the slave trade, the post-1807 info, as well as the way this book pulled so many things together, is still very good.That includes the financial tentacles of the New York Cotton Exchange and the economic impact of cotton itself, with the South producing 2/3 the world's cotton and exporting half of that total. Those two tidbits alone should help readers understand more of why Southern fire-eaters held out hope either that the North wouldn't oppose their secession or that Britain would intervene.Hypocrisy in interdicting the slave trade is also exposed. The British had taken the lead in this, but Americans charged they were hypocrites because British traders still brought goods to Africa that were important in the slave trade. Meanwhile, the U.S. government had negotiated a deal with the British that only the U.S. Navy could interdict U.S. ships off the coast of Africa. Unfortunately, until just before the Civil War, the U.S. Navy didn't actually do much interdiction.Beyond that, though the fact of the North having slaves was known to me, the authors still do a good job of illustrating details of slave life, slave purchases, advertisements for slaves and more.Also, a slice of the North's antebellum intelligencia is found highly complicit in the pseudoscience of racial studies, including the 19th-century fad of phrenology.And, for those unfamiliar, the authors show just how much of a minority position abolition was in the North.Finally, this book has several helpful maps, illustrating the triangular trade, where all in Africa slaves came from and more."},{"Title":"Complicity How The North Promoted, Prolonged, and Profited From Slavery","review":"This book is a hard read in terms of the subject matter it is covering. But it is an easy read in terms of it being well written and having examples and supportive arguements. Overall, I felt it was a major eye opener and definatley a must read for any northerner in better understanding the history of this area. You will be surprized."},{"Title":"Complicity How The North Promoted, Prolonged, and Profited From Slavery","review":"I highly recommend \\"Complicity,\\" and as my review title suggests, itis way overdue. Many historians realize the truths revealed in the book, but most Americans have no clue.As a southerner I accept MOST of what is commonly attributed to the South from the 1600's right on up. I myself abhor racial prejudice, and my southern parents raised me that way. As an amateur student of history, however, it has always burned me up, and still does, when the North is made out to be perfectly innocent and \\"against slavery,\\" and everyone in the South in favor of it. That's why I was very happy to have read \\"Complicity,\\" and I think it should be added to every American history teacher's list of required reading in high school. I think it's especially credible since it is written by Northerners who are writing about the history of people and events in their own states. I really wish that the authors would continue their research to include Reconstruction up to today, examining the attitudes among many people of the North which are usually considered to be found only among \\"southern rednecks.\\" My husband is from Long Island and he remembers prejudice more virulent there than any that he's experienced since being married to this Southerner and living in the south.Regarding what one said about why the book might not have sold a lot of copies--it's hard to face the truth about what your own ancestors might have done. It's much easier to cling to the lie that it's all the South's fault.In the end--we all should, every day in every way, in our thoughts and actions, wipe out racial prejudice in ALL parts of the USA, and learn from the mistakes of the past."},{"Title":"Complicity How The North Promoted, Prolonged, and Profited From Slavery","review":"This book, written by 3 Connecticut journalists (certainly not Southern/Confederate sympathizers) exposes many dirty little secrets about how the North in many ways looked the other way when it came to their economic interests and slavery. The book title says it all.Easy to read, but informative. My only knock on the book is that towards the end it begins to wane a little, but it's a small complaint. It held my attention well and I recommend it to anyone who wants to find out more hidden truths about the Civil War that for some reason isn't talked about much in government school history books or the media. It's a great companion piece to \\"The Real Lincoln\\" by Thomas DiLorenzo, and \\"In the Course of Human Events.\\" Also worth mentioning here is \\"One Nation, Indivisible?\\" by Robert F. Hawes Jr.This book gives truth to why some people in the south call the Civil War \\"The War of Northern Hypocrisy.\\""},{"Title":"Complicity How The North Promoted, Prolonged, and Profited From Slavery","review":"Complicity is well researched and documented. It is investigative journalism at its best. The content is difficult to read for human suffering is painful and powerful stuff. The authors shed light on a staggering hypocrisy that existed then and continues to exist to this day for the truth is shamefully hidden in the dark corners of the North's history. Do as I say...not as I do; perceptions of moral superiority based in depravity; speaking out of both sides of one's mouth; greed and avarice. The purveyors of moral ethics in our society have long excoriated the South for its past dependency on slavery and never hesitated to remind us in the most insidious ways of that association; it pervades our country's cultural history. The authors of Complicity do not exonerate the South for holding to the institution of slavery, nor should they, but they do demand that the North shoulder the burden of guilt. I doubt that will ever happen. An analogy kept running through my mind as I read story after story of how many of the great financial empires of the Northeast were built in large part on the profits of the slave trade: The addict becomes helpless and dependent on his addiction; the dealer perpetuates the addiction for greed. While both are morally reprehensible I think the dealer is far more evil than the addict."},{"Title":"Complicity How The North Promoted, Prolonged, and Profited From Slavery","review":"Having read approx. 50 books on the history of slavery as it relates to the colonies and later the USA, I've always known that an essential piece of the puzzle was missing. I'm a southerner, born in Texas but with all of my ancestors from KY and VA. I'm a VMI grad and retired Army officer. Throughout my travels both in the US and abroad, it's always \\"the South\\" who takes most of, if not all, the flack for the evils of slavery. Frankly, after 55 years on this earth, it's gotten a bit stale and borish. Finally, someone appears to have tackled head-on America's dirty little secret- the North was just as responsible for American slavery as the South was. Neither could have survived or prospered without the other. I have no doubt this work has caused major concern in the New England area and has probably been near being banned in many libraries. It certainly won't end up being on the \\"must read\\" list of the \\"enlightened\\" living north and south of the Mason-Dixon Line. I hope my northern brethern will learn to take it (the truth) for what it is without too much of a backlash toward these extremely talented journalists. I truly applaud them for such a courageous effort toward telling the entire, unadulterated truth, at least to the best of their ability (certainly more info will be uncovered about this subject). Bravo to all of them. I trust that all well-read Americans will buy this book and really ponder its message. I'm marking through my softcover copy and now intend to buy a hardback version as well with the intent of getting the authors to autograph it; it's that good!"},{"Title":"Complicity How The North Promoted, Prolonged, and Profited From Slavery","review":"If you think you know American history and the history of slavery quite well, think again: COMPLICITY: HOW THE NORTH PROMOTED, PROLONGED, AND PROFITED FROM SLAVERY will challenge almost every belief you've held and introduce many starting new thoughts. The truth is, the history of slavery has been rewritten since the Civil War: whitewashed and glossed over. The North's shameful secrets come fully to light in COMPLICITY, which proves the North's own economic structure was as dependent on slavery profits as the South. This startling expose is a 'must' for any definitive American history collection, whether it be for a high school or college library or for a public library collection.Diane C.

Southerners have often been frowned upon for their involvment in slavery, almost as if they were the only ones profiting from the horrible treatment of another race; where as the north \\"supposedly\\" came to the rescue.

The single most sanitized, airbrushed aspect of American history exposed and it is just the first layer. For years yankees have cloaked themselves in moral superiority and racial enlightenment they never really possessed nor deserved. NY as the American city with the second highest slave population in 1776? Check. Slavery as an economic engine that created the industrial revolution, owned, run, and funded by prominent new englanders?? Yep. A trade that continued even after the slave trade was banned here in 1808? Correct. Oh, lets not forget the pianos that occupied almost every living room in the north AFTER they defeated the evil South and abolished slavery. The keys were made in new england, from the tusks of elephants transported by slaves they bought in the interior of Africa and SOLD when they reached the coast. The motive for this book was no doubt to strenghten reparation arguments. The unintended consequence?

We, as Americans shouldn't try to hide from our past, no matter how sordid. Slavery was more widespread than was taught in schools.

It was also wonderful to hear her openly admit that the African slaves built America and made it into the prosporous and wealthy nation it is today.

With much sensitivity and without being in any way judgemental, the author takes us along her own journey as someone \\"on the fence\\" who finally came to the conclusion that abortion is \\"too wrong to be a right\\".The abortion industry has cleverly cloaked abortion in the mantle of women's rights and women's \\"health care\\" but will not address the issue of the abominable abuse of human rights of the little pre-born baby girls who are aborted. Marybeth Hagan shows how abortion proponents are eager to de-humanize the preborn even when science has more and more exposed that deception. What Planned Parenthood still calls only a clump of cells has been shown to have amazing human capabilities to the chagrin of abortion proponents who have to find new ways to defend it.Page after page the author presents indisputable proof that the idea of abortion as an acceptable part of a civilized and humane society is based on a lie, from the eugenic inception of Planned Parenthood whose foundress was notorious Margaret Sanger to the final legalization of it in 1973.Ms. Hagan's research is impeccable and she backs every statement with facts, demonstrating that the emotional and religious objections to abortion are only a part of this complex issue.This is a book that definitely will make you choose on which side of the fence you will be."},{"Title":"Haircuts at Sleepy Sam's","review":"I'm an Elementary School Librarian and when I read HAIRCUTS AT SLEEPY SAM'S the kids are thoroughly mesmerized.

These literary images *may* be more Christian patriarchal fantasy than real. &quot;Women in Old Norse Society&quot; looks at the reality of women in the Viking Age, using the Icelandic Sagas and the recorded Laws as the main sources of information. Jochens argues that the sagas are both historical and literary sources.Paganism lasted much longer in Scandinavia than the rest of Europe, which meant women there enjoyed a more equal relationship with men for a considerably longer time. Jochens explores the Pagan-Christian conflict very fairly, looking at both the advantages and disadvantages the shift to Christianity brought for women. For example, in pagan times women had little say in whom they married, and Christianity brought the advantage of female consent. Jochens looks in great detail at important female issues such as marriage, reproduction, leisure and work. Especially fascinating is the &quot;economics of homespun,&quot; or how women's economic contribution of woven cloth eventually became the main medium of exchange.One of my favourite aspects of Jochen's writing is her frequent use of Old Norse words, clearly explained, adding a fascinating linquistic layer. She references her work meticulously, making it a very scholarly read, yet it is highly readable for anyone interested in women's history."},{"Title":"Women in Old Norse Society","review":"It is amazing how much information she managed to pack into this book, without overwhelming the reader AND with keeping it interesting.

She covered all facets of Norse society and also noted the differences between how the Icelandic and Norse cultures developed over the years. It is definately a book that I recommend for anyone interested in historic Norse society, especially the female culture."},{"Title":"Women in Old Norse Society","review":"This is a very interesting book. She uses Christian books to understand women's role in Pagan Iceland. It seems to me she goes out of her way to find female suffering. If the Christians say something negative about the Pagans.

My 11 year old looks forward to changing the page everyday, and even my 6 year old will occasionally say, \\"I like that one, Mom!\\". They are a great start to our day and a pleasant reminder throughout. They are so inspiring, that I often keep them and strategically tape them to my bathroom mirror and other places around the house where my family will notice them during the day. The only problem is that I haven't found any of them that I want to get rid of yet!!! I am a big fan of the I Can Do It Conferences, as they are so uplifting! These calendars were sold out at the last two conferences that I attended, so I was pleasantly surprised to find them on Amazon! When I found them, I proceeded to buy several for friends as New Year's presents. Buy this calendar and you will be uplifted too! Even if Jan is over, you still have all the rest of the year to benefit from them!"},{"Title":"I Can Do It 2005 Calendar","review":"Perfect for starting the day on a positive note.

Her voice on the CD is so calming and her words so wonderful to listen to. I highly recommend this book to those who want to feel more empowered about their life"},{"Title":"I Can Do It 2005 Calendar","review":"This book is like my little bible for me: it is my kaleidoscope of Life. Louise Hay deals with 8 essential topics: Health, Forgiveness, Creativity, Prosperity, Job Success, Romantic Relationships, Stress-Free Life, Self-Esteem. At the beginning of each chapter, she gives explanations about each subject and ends the chapter with 20 affirmations. At each affirmation, I give to myself a mark over 10 (1 is minimum, 10 is maximum), so this scale shows me how far I am on the spiritual growth path. When I make a progress from 8 over 10 to 10 over 10, for example, which takes me some weeks or months (it depends on the difficulty of the subject and the speed of my evolution), then I am very glad. When I am able to give to myself 10 over 10 at each and every subject, then I would be able to say that all of my needs are fulfilled."},{"Title":"I Can Do It 2005 Calendar","review":"Excellent!

I ordered Hay's new DVD \\"You can heal your life\\" and was so moved by it and the accompanying DVD with full length interviews (I bought the expanded version), that I searched for more Hay material. I purchased I Can Do It and not only read it and underlined parts, but I have created cards with affirmations on them to carry in my pocket each day. I listened to the CD that comes with the book for several weeks and have so incorporated the material into my thinking that I'm much more aware of the negative thoughts I'm hearing from others and thinking myself. I immediately change my thought to a more positive one. I have given a copy of the book I Can Do It to both of my grown daughters and one of them has just told me how much she loves it, though I haven't heard from the other one yet. This is a total bargain. Buy it. It will change your life for the better."},{"Title":"I Can Do It 2005 Calendar","review":"I love Louise L. Hay and this book and cd it just great.

You can experience wealth, health, romance, self-esteem, job success, creativity, and a life released from resentment and pain.\\" ~Louise L. Hay, author of You Can Heal Your LifeIf you are looking for a way to create more happiness in your life, these cards can inspire you on a daily basis. The beautiful tiny box holds 60 affirmation cards a variety of subjects. You can read about romance, wealth, health, forgiveness, creativity, overcoming stress, job success and self-esteem.Lately I've started to believe that you truly do hold the keys to your future. You can literally dream your future into life. Although, I am also convinced that you need a lot of encouraging books and encouraging people in your life to overcome life's immense and at times overwhelming hurdles. If you can find just one person who believes in you and a few books that bring an encouraging message into your life, you really can heal your world.Louise Hay shows this positive philosophy in her \\"I Can Do It Cards.\\" There are immediate and essential things you must do to heal your life. One of them is to encourage yourself daily. You can't give up and let yourself fall back into negative patterns that are defeating and harmful to your life. These cards encourage you to look at your life in a more positive way.The first card says: \\"Love is all there is!\\"Then, on the back: \\"Love is powerful - your love and my love. Love brings us peace on Earth.\\"I adore this card:\\"I love myself exactly as I am. I no longer wait to be perfect in order to love myself.\\"Back of Card: \\"The greatest gift I can give myself is unconditional love.\\"While we often hear that we should love others \\"unconditionally,\\" but how many times do we hear that we should love \\"ourselves unconditionally?\\" These cards are a wonderful reminder. The colors (lavender, blue, pink, yellow, green and orange) on these cards are beautiful and there are pictures on both sides. There are pictures of steaming cups of tea, sandy beaches, butterflies, angels, lots of hearts, treasure chests, flowers, birds, stars and I even found a picture of Louise's book: \\"You Can Heal Your Life.\\"The \\"I now do work I love, and I am well paid for it\\" card sounds just wonderful and I hope that reading this card will make some of my dreams come true in 2004.Louise L. Hay is a metaphysical lecturer and the best-selling author of 27 books. Her works have been translated into 25 languages.The \\"I Can Do It Cards\\" may just be what you need to move to a higher level in your awareness of life. There are so many beautiful places we can go. Sometimes we just need a little motivation. You can put these cards on your refrigerator, in your pocket, on a bulletin board, leave one on a co-workers desk or even slip them into a card for a friend. In that case, you might need two boxes. :)~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"I Can Do It 2005 Calendar","review":"This is a book with the book-on-tape, read by the author, enclosed. I CAN DO IT is all about affirmations and changing your life with affirmations. The spoken word on this CD is incredibly powerful. Louise supportivly walks the reader (and listener) through a discussion on the usefulness of affirmations for several areas including health, wealth/prosperity, job happiness, relationships, self-esteem and stress. She then gives sample affirmations for each catagory. I listen to the CD when I drive, as suggested on the CD cover, and I feel empowered to create the life I want! I drive around saying affirations out loud, including \\"I am totally adequate for all situations\\", so empowering!"},{"Title":"I Can Do It 2005 Calendar","review":"We have all heard about positive affirmations. This book is the only one - I was able to find - that will teach you how to do affirmations properly. Illustrations on the book are beautiful. And the book itself is so small one can carry it in the purse, or a pocket. I was pleasantly suprised to find out that book had a CD in it. So, if you just feel like listening to Ms. Hay's pleasant voice you can just do that and still find it calming and fulfilling. You will look at your life differently. Once I finished the book, I went ahead and bought Louise Hay's \\"Wisdom Cards\\". I just like the way she explains things and the way she teaches we should live our life."},{"Title":"I Can Do It 2005 Calendar","review":"Louise Hay is a legend and a true inspiration. This book is no exception. Through the pages, you will find hope, inspiration, and meaning. This is the kind of book where no matter what page you open, you will find something that will uplift your consciousness and you life. \\"I Can Do It\\" is a timeless classic. On page 49 it states: \\"There aren't any problems that don't have solutions. There aren't any questions without answers.\\" And then there is wonderful wisdom and guidance that follows. This book will make a great gift, especially to one very special person - YOU.Barbara Rose, Ph.D. author of Stop Being the String Along: A Relationship Guide to Being THE ONE and Know Yourself: A Woman's Guide to Wholeness, Radiance & Supreme Confidence"},{"Title":"I Can Do It 2005 Calendar","review":"Louise Hay is an inspirational lady that I admire. I listen to her CD in my car everyday instead of listening to the radio or music. It is an incredible way of realizing how fortunate we are in life. Most importantly that we can create anything we want in life. Good or bad. It is a choice. Louise helps to make the right choices and to believe. Afterall, she never finished high school and came from an abused home. Look at her success. One day I hope I am fortunate enough to meet her."},{"Title":"I Can Do It 2005 Calendar","review":"I have really appreciated all that Louise Hay's has done throughout the years, but the CD that comes with the book spends way too much time on the negative. I thought it was suppose to be inspiring affirmations. Instead, each track starts out for the first couple of minutes on how bad we are, I can't even listen to the CD. I can see mentioning on the first track that we need to be aware of how many negative thoughts are ruling us then go onto how we can improve those negative thoughts. You are supposed to focus on what you do want so I guess I will have to make my own CD. I still appreciate all Louise Hays has done, this review is just to express my confusion on what I thought I was purchasing, \\"positive affirmations\\"?"},{"Title":"I Can Do It 2005 Calendar","review":"This is a really nice book filled with positive affirmations that are positive, and life affirming. It's easy to read, and I love just picking it up and opening it to any page where there is always a message for me that I can use to make my life better. It also makes a nice gift because it's colorful and cheerful. It's one of the better affirmation books I've read. I really enjoyed it!"},{"Title":"I Can Do It 2005 Calendar","review":"This CD is excellent for changing one's negative thought processes into more positive ones.

It's great for all areas of your life, including health, prosperity, relationships, etc. I cannot recommend it enough!"},{"Title":"I Can Do It 2005 Calendar","review":"Louise Hay has a way of making you believe in yourself and in the power of positive thinking. This book is great because it comes with a CD you can listen to, and it's broken down into subjects so you can work on whatever area of your life you need help with at the time, e.g., finances, relationships, etc. I've noticed a definite improvement in my life since listening to the positive affirmations. I have her I Can Do It! calendar too, which has daily positive affirmations and reinforces what you learn from her books. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"I Can Do It 2005 Calendar","review":"All of Louise Hay's calendars from prior years have been inspiring and helpful to me in achieving my goals.

Louise's affirmations are great re-minders of the deeper truths that lie beneath the illusions of daily life on this dimension. I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 based on my disagreement on one main point (my personal sore spot). She states: \\"I believe that we create every so-called illness in our body.\\" I cringe at that statement - which is also the position of the Abraham teachings (most of which I love) that we create our own illness always, \\"no exceptions.\\" - then I go on to enjoy the rest of the CD.Louise Hay describes her own journey of identifying the emotional cause of a dis-ease that had manifested in her body. Upon working through those issues, she found healing. I agree it is valid that stress and aberrant thoughts wreak incredible havoc on the body. But is it valid to claim everyone creates their own illness in every case? Hmm.Babies ... animals ... previously happy and care-free people ... something appears to be missing.I would love for Louise or Abraham or any of the other LOA teachers to explain this to me. Would they suggest to someone born with a deformed face or with Down's Syndrome that they could turn it all around if they learned to think differently? I've found zero documented cases of this ever happening, or of someone changing their eye or skin color with affirmations, a dwarf growing taller through visualization, or anyone alive today with the ability to move a mountain with their mind.Not saying it isn't Possible. I, for one, can only agree with the statement \\"we create every so-called illness in our body\\" if I take it deeper. I'm talking soul agreements, pre-birth choices, karma and the like. Taken in the context of this incarnation alone, the statement is a great tool for those of us who have struggled with 20, 30, 40+ years of health problems to judge ourselves as being somehow spiritually inadequate. My own book, \\"The Collective Awakening,\\" addresses some of these painful gaps.The Collective Awakening: Messages Along the Path of Awareness"},{"Title":"I Can Do It 2005 Calendar","review":"I am a big fan of Louise Hay and I like her affirmations.

She tells how she rose above it, changed HERSELF first, and lo and behold, her husband did too! For those who choose God's way but struggle in a difficult marriage, this book really puts it into perspective. It's funny and interesting, yet is Scriputrally-based and a serious aid.

(The King's high way series)","review":"I bought this book after searching for a Let Go and Let God book.

When God saved me, he saved my marriage and I've been kicking the enemy away from my wife for 5 years. Well, since then the Lord has been testing me, like he did Abraham. I rebuked the enemy and STOOD firm on God word and it seemed like the more I trusted God the worst things got. I mean really bad for me and my wife. Well, I did what Nancy talks about in this book. I had to get real with God and keep the faith alive. The reason I am writing this comment is so other men will read these words coming from a man and read this book.

She studies with a famous vocal coach in hopes of some day making a career of her singing. One day, she gets lucky; another woman ran away from a production to be with her lover leaving a space to fill in a production. Left with no other choice, the producer picks Coralee. She is transformed into Madmoiselle Coco, a scandalous society girl. To generate publicity, the team leaks to the press that Coco was romantically linked with a famous Argentinian whose plane was recently lost at sea, hence giving her the name The Demi-Widow. However, the man is recovered, and Coco finds herself in a spot.This easy-to-read book is an excellent piece of fiction. It reads like a 1930s backstage musical, filled with glamour, scandal, and romance. It is a wonder that it was never filmed.One might not expect that Mary Pickford, the woman who captured America's heart in the silent era playing children and young fiesty girls, would write such a book, but she does so with ease.

This particular book looked like a humorous quick read, which it was. Actually, it read too fast (took me under 1 hour) and took constant jabs at American business and culture. Written by a French author, I wasn't surprised by the blatant anti-Americanism, and I would guess her cynicism towards business culture will be received the wrong way by many readers in France, where this book has already sold 300,000+ copies. In fairness to the author, she did also poke fun at French laziness and their long time high unemployment rate. I think most Americans who read this book would get a good laugh from this humor, but I seriously wonder how many French will take this advice seriously?

There is a blacksmith section showing the tools used and some basic forging techniques.There is a lot of discussion of power transmission, such as flat belts, V belts, shafts, bearings, couplings and such. It shows how to align an electic motor so that the pulleys on the motor and the machine will be in line with each other.This is not a project book. It doesn't have plans on how to build something. But if you have a machine like a hammer mill, a lathe, an air compressor, a blower, a furnace, or whatever, big and mean, this book shows how to put a sling on it, lift it with a crane, move it, build a floor to put in on, put it where you want it, line it with other machines, put a motor on it, line up the pulleys to power it up, bolt it down, lubricate it, and even a little about how to build a roof over it.You will have to have a big pocket to put this book in."},{"Title":"Audel Millwrights and Mechanics Guide (Audel Technical Trades Series)","review":"I wondered where the great Audel brand had gone until I saw this book, probably one of the most known books of all the old Audel's I have in my collector's library.

Despite being written almost 50 years ago, the book's strong point is not its selection of Lincoln's writings (although that is quite good), but its masterful biographical sketch of Lincoln by Stern. Almost seven score since Lincoln's death, there is still no other satisfying BRIEF biography. In about 200 pages, Stern has managed to capture, in skilfull prose, all the important facts while still having room for some less-wordy, interesting comments. Each important event is succinctly captured in a couple paragraphs. I like that Stern actually calls Lincoln &quot;neurotic&quot; in certain personal aspects. I also like his passages on Willie Lincoln's death, emancipation, and the war's closing. There's really not enough room for any heavy politically-influenced interpretations of issues like those in modern long biographies,and that's why Stern's sketch can't be considered outdated. Some people may not like the short description of Lincoln's assassination, and I thought Stern spent too much ink on Lincoln's final attempts to compensate the South. Since the book predates the most comprehensive, closely-inspected collection of Lincoln's letters, there may be some inaccuracies in the writings reproduced here. However, the selection is an excellent one, linked together well with intros by Stern. I can't imagine this was an easy job for Stern and I'm lost why it's been virtually ignored. But all in all, I can only repeat, if you want to know the most about Lincoln in the fewest words, and have your interest held throughout, just buy this book and you're set!"},{"Title":"The life and writings of Abraham Lincoln","review":"This book is out of print, but you can get it used through amazon and others. It's a great collection of Lincoln's speeches, correspondence and other writings, and it includes an approx. 200 page biography. The bio was written around 1940, and no doubt there's more recent scholarship missing, but we're spared the fashionable speculation about whether Lincoln was gay or some other insignifica which seem to be focal points for so many contemporary biographers and historians. Stern, as the reviewer on amazon says, \\"wisely respects the mysterious alchemy by which a plain man became a statesman; this respectful anthology seeks only to present Lincoln, not to explain him.\\" The bio's a useful bonus, but the real matter belongs to Lincoln, and there's 700 pages of it beyond the bio.

These angelic figures are juxtaposed against, or subtly integrated with, various landscape and architectural views.

They do not describe at all what distinguishes a certain city or period fom another - instead they hone in on one or two paintings, yak about it for a while and leave the reader to infer what they mean.

It presents a new way of understanding evolution. The book teaches us how environmental induction of purely phenotypic events, including learning, can drive evolution, and why a plastic and modular phenotype should replace mutation at the center stage of evolutionary thinking. It is my prediction that this book will precipitate a revolution in thought within biology, but that this will take time, as has any major new idea. Biologists in all fields related to evolution are encouraged to read this work.The book contains a masterful synthesis of biological facts and theories on the broadest of scales. It unites all disciplines within the biological sciences. It is not, however, merely an impressive review. Rather, it captures a vast collection of data and brilliantly organizes it around a set of fundamental principles about development and evolution from which the main messages of the book are crystallized. Whereas many of the concepts may be described as relatively simple, contemplating the connections between them, as well as their overall unification, becomes an infinitely more challenging and fascinating task. It is from this unification that West-Eberhard's coherent theory of development and evolution blossoms. Expertly guiding the reader from individual concepts to coherent theory, West-Eberhard captures our imagination at every twist and turn, and catapults the reader's mind in a myriad of unexpected directions. The writing is crisp, clean and captivating. The book is filled with exciting and highly felicitous examples from natural history, touching upon the lives of all kinds of organisms, from prions to elm trees and African elephants. The pages are richly textured with detailed examples, illustrations and various intellectual gems. One such delight is a discussion of Darwin's pangenesis theory and how it fails in light of sterile castes in the Hymenoptera.The book's main contribution to modern evolutionary biology is the revolutionary idea that environmental influences on development, not mutation, are the first order cause of design. This view is a fundamental alteration of emphasis in a field obsessed with genes, genetic drift and mass selection. The book places major emphasis on the importance of genetic accommodation, which occurs when developmentally-mediated changes in the phenotype are molded by quantitative genetic change. The hypothesis of genetic accommodation can be understood as beginning when the environment induces a phenotypic change. This change imposes a new selective regime onto pre-existing polygenic variation. In this way, we are encouraged to understand genes as &quot;followers&quot;, as opposed to &quot;leaders&quot; in evolution. The variants can be inherited in subsequent generations if the environmental conditions inducing them are recurrent, and if there is genetic variation underlying the population in the developmental capacity to produce them. Natural selection will favor the spread of a particular environmentally-induced variant when it has positive effects on individual fitness. Although both mutation and environmental induction are considered important modes of initiation of new phenotypic variation, West-Eberhard's argument is that environmental induction is in fact more important.This thesis challenges the modern gene-centered view of evolution, and in so doing, drives the final nail in the coffin of the &quot;one-gene-one-phenotype&quot; illusion. The book encourages the view that a unified science of evolution can only be achieved with a thorough integration of development into evolutionary biology. To this end, Mary Jane West-Eberhard's treatise is an enormous success. By showing how environmentally influenced development contributes to the origin of novelty in all organisms, the book provides a key missing component of a modern evolutionary theory that biology has been lacking since Darwin. The book is essential reading for all graduate students, researchers and teachers of biology."},{"Title":"Developmental Plasticity and Evolution","review":"This book is meant to educate - to lead away from the sterile debates of causation as NATURE OR NURTURE. It is a monumental achievement by a careful thinker (recent recepient of the SSE's Sewall Wright award), and it will likely change the way you think about how genes and environments interact through development to affect phenotypic expression. If you have ever been confused about ideas in evolutionary process and how phenotypes arise, this is a book you should read. West-Eberhard's treatment of the more-difficult ideas is comprehensive - with enough examples to appeal to the backgrounds of most readers. The book is full of wonderful details of animal behavior, plant biology, the social wasps West-Eberhard has watched her whole life, and much, much more. It will spark much new research - perhaps for decades to come. It will become a citation classic. She has taken on one of the more contentious of all modern debates. For that, for her exhaustive discussion, and for the power of her conclusions, she will be criticized and rediculed. Take my advice: buy the book, read it, think about what it says, and decide for yourself . I think West-Eberhard's achievement is an awesome contribution."},{"Title":"Developmental Plasticity and Evolution","review":"Darwin developed his theory of evolution without knowing much about the mechanisms of heredity. These mechanisms were rediscovered in the 1900's as part of the science of genetics. By the 1930's a school of evolutionary thinkers came to the realization that Darwin's theory could be further developed by recasting it in terms of population genetics. The resulting synthetic theory of evolution has ruled mainstream biology ever since. But genetics has not stood still in the meantime. The rise of molecular biology has made possible a new discipline, evo-devo which seeks to explain how the genes control development. Evo-devo has developed a new approach to evolution. While the synthetic theory tended to see evolution as a matter of the loss of old genes within a population or the fixation of new ones, evo-devo has found that large parts of the genome are conserved over vast periods of time and shared by widely divergent phyla. Evolution has produced diversity by modifying the mechanisms which control the expression of these ancient genes. New ideas are now required to explain how this kind of diversity evolves. West-Eberhard proposes that genetic control mechanisms can be exposed to selection by the phenotypic adaptation of organisms to new kinds of environmemt. This phenotypic adaptation ultimately drives evolution. The germ of this idea had been put forward by J. Baldwim more than one hundred years ago but neither Baldwin or anybody else knew about evo-devo and the idea had little influence. Now its time may have come."},{"Title":"Developmental Plasticity and Evolution","review":"For any evolutionary biologist interested in how evolutionary events are molded and modulated by phenotypic plasticity and developmental processes this book is a &quot;must have&quot;. It is a huge, widesweeping review and synthesis of the problem of development and evolution. It will remain as the benchmark for the field for many years. No one can approach this subject without having read this book. In perspective it ranges from the molecular to the macroevolutionary, but always manages to maintain a highly readable style."},{"Title":"Developmental Plasticity and Evolution","review":"For me, West-Eberhard's Developmental Plasticity and Evolution is the most far reaching integration of evolution, ecology and development since Darwin's Origin of Species. This is not merely a review of the literature, it is a book with a definite point of view. In the preface she writes: &quot; The universal environmental responsiveness of organisms, along side genes, influences individual development and organic evolution, and this realization compels us to reexamine the major themes of evolutionary biology in a new light&quot;. Like The Origin of Species, this book is meticulous in bringing evidence to bear on each issue. Meticulous does not mean boring! The lucid prose is full of passionate intensity and you follow the author's thinking as you both grapple with each challenge. Along the way, we learn a lot of fascinating biology used as examples to bolster particular ideas.Who should read this book? Anyone interested in understanding the forces at work in the origin and nature of biodiversity. Undergraduates and graduate students with few vested interests in maintaining narrow disciplinary approaches are the most likely to truly enlarge their world view from reading this work. Will you agree with everything in this large and courageous book? Probably not. Just as we are constantly examining Darwin's propositions, this book challenges us to defend and expand our current thinking. Understanding the interrelations of genes, developmental processes and ecology and their consequences for evolution is an ongoing task and this is the kind of book to shape the discourse in the emerging evo-eco-devo integration for at least a generation to come."},{"Title":"Developmental Plasticity and Evolution","review":"There seems to be a consensus in evolutionary biology that this is an important book representing a major advance in our understanding. However, most of the biologists saying this haven't read the book; or have, perhaps, skimmed a chapter or two. The reason for this is simple: this book is far too long, far too dense, and far too abstruse. There is a lot of potential here; rewritten as a 150-200 page book with a good editor, it could have been an excellent and influential book. At 640 pages of text with constant grammatical & spelling errors (Lamarck only has his \\"c\\" about half the time) and writing that is, even by academic standards, hopelessly tangled, this is bound to be only an excellent decoration for the academic bookshelf.Nonetheless, for those willing to take the long slog through there really is a lot of value here. There are just so many more enjoyable ways to spend one's time..."},{"Title":"Developmental Plasticity and Evolution","review":"If you never fully accepted the &#34;simple&#34; gene-based model (the Modern Synthesis) of Natural Selection, this is the book for you!"},{"Title":"Developmental Plasticity and Evolution","review":"West-Eberhard has produced a 794 page tome that chokes the brain and deadens the senses. On the reverse cover, it asks a question about the picture on the cover, and refers to a chapter for the answer. As far as I can see, the question is never addressed.This reveals two of the books problems. First, its grandiose aspirations, to be a new 'Modern Synthesis,' and to bring developmental biology into the fold, are never backed with a strength of data and arguments that equal her claims. Secondly, the book is a morass of arguments, constantly pointing to other parts of the book. I started drawing little circle around each time we were referred to another chapter, but I quickly stopped as my pages became tangled messes of circles.The writing is murky at best, and the reader learns to treasure moments of lucidity, as they are long in coming. The structure often seems backwards, confusing, and generally awkward. This tome is in dire need of a biologically educated editor. Her tone is often confrontational and bullying towards other authors.Technically speaking, her ideas within are vague, and while she lays out a clear path for phenotypic plasticity leading evolution, the reader quickly realizes her definitions of concepts like 'Phenotype' are so nebulous and removed from what any other average biologist uses that to argue against is to try and staple Jell-O to your roof. At times, she attempts to have things in two different ways - arguing phylogenetic inertia isn't a relevant or especially frequent, but also wanting traits to remain perfect and unexpressed for absurd periods of time.The mathematical treatment of the subject in this book is non-existent. This is almost unforgivable, in a topic that clearly needs a mathematical treatment to establish its true importance in any given system beyond the examples given. Its testable predictions are rare in coming, often muddied in content, and frequently overlap with predictions made by alternate competing hypothesis. Those looking for a research programme had best look elsewhere. It definitely has not, and will not, sway any sceptics.Its sole, redeeming quality is that it aggressively challenges the readers pre-existing notions of evolution, and forces the reader to reconsider long-held notions. But for those of us with limited time, a more succinct volume could accomplish the same introspection."},{"Title":"Developmental Plasticity and Evolution","review":"Dr Eberhard's volume offers a comprehensive & scholarly treatment of a difficult but timely subject.

West-Eberhard never convinces me that she even understands much of the elegant work done by these scientists, or if she does, writes so poorly as to bog the reader down not so much in jargon, but poorly defined broad concepts that do nothing to advance the ideas of the book. &quot;Development&quot; appears as every other word in the introduction, yet exactly what the author's definition of &quot;development&quot; is continually eludes the reader. Couple this with the fact that it seems as though she struggled with this book for many years (a scan of the references reveals them to be sadly out of date - my quick look found the most recent to be 1997), and you have a book that may have helped shape thought in this area 10 years ago, but is simply an afterthought in today's booming expanse of scientific knowledge.

How could two people be so important to each other, and then... they just don't seem to make time for each other anymore? What happened? How do you fix it? Should you fix it?Seasons of Friendship is a study of the Book of Ruth, of the relationship between Naomi, an aged widow, and Ruth, her young daughter-in-law, also a widow. The author takes us through their relationship, using the metaphor of the changing seasons to describe the changes in their lives and relationship.The author also uses examples from her own life, and encourages the reader to examine his/her own life, to discover the changing seasons and the cycle of life. As the stories unfold, an understanding of the nature of friendship evolves, so that the reader begins to understand which friends have helped most at different times, and how better to be a friend to others at different stages of their lives.Best of all, by understanding our own lives and the nature of friendship, the book encourages us to develop our friendship with our Creator, who invented the concept in the first place.I have used this book in small groups, where it has been wildly successful. Women have commented on how healing it is to understand the friendships they have had, especially the ones that just seemed to stop for no reason.

It also reveals that the real friend in all friendships is God himself."},{"Title":"Margaret Cavendish: Observations upon Experimental Philosophy (Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy)","review":"Eileen O'Neill's annotated, unabridged edition of Margaret Cavendish's Observations on Experimental Philosophy, (part of the Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy Series), is a solid contribution to the history of metaphysics. It has not appeared in print since its second edition in 1668. While considerable work on Cavendish as a literary writer, e.g. her letters, poems and plays, has been done in recent years, less has been done on her work in metaphysics. O'Neill's labors will undoubtedly change this fact. This modern edition makes this work accessible to scholars in the history of philosophy and philosophy of science. It offers critical annotations which situate and clarify this work for the modern scholar, although it may be the case that not enough is said about Cavendish's reliance upon the Scholastics. However, O'Neill does a more than respectable job cross-referencing Cavendish's philosophical arguments with classic specialists of the period in philosophy of science. Readers can look forward to a helpful bibliography as well.O'Neill's 26 page introduction details Cavendish's political and social environment so that not only her philosophical contributions are reconstituted, but also the historical circumstances surrounding them. Cavendish represents one of many female writers in the mid-seventeenth century, but is the only one to publish works in philosophy under her own name. Thus Cavendish is an important figure on several fronts. Philosophically she outlines a system of natural philosophy, which rejects Aristotle, Hobbes and Descartes. Religiously, she proposes an atheistic system of nature and politically, she calls for a platform which includes women as cognitive, rational contributors to the problems of science and philosophy. This edition of Observations will appeal to all respective disciplines.The strength of O'Neill's introduction is her discussion of the Stoic influences on Cavendish. O'Neill has done her research to this end. While her brief overview assumes a learned fluency with this era of philosophy, and remains silent about many aspects of the Observations it can still be useful for the disciplined novice. O'Neill is able to delineate how Cavendish's materialist system of nature, with its reliance upon animate, self-moving, non-divisible bodies harkens back to Stoicism. Further, she previews concepts which mature in Cavendish's writings and carry less resemblance to Stocism such as her bifurcation of the Stoics \\"active principle\\" into the \\"sensitive\\" and the \\"rational\\". The introduction also cashes out Cavendish's primary objections to Epicurean Atomism, and her reservations regarding a mechanistic account of natural change. O'Neill takes great care with this latter issue and sets out Cavendish's main arguments. If the introductory essay lacks for anything, it is a discussion about the scholastic influences on Cavendish. The format of the Obervations is clearly reminiscent of Aquinas' Summa, with the problem-response-objection-counter response style, yet no real mention of this fact is made. However, O'Neill does not ignore this issue as is illustrated in the several footnotes which allude to the Schoolmen.O'Neill offers good footnotes with references to figures such as Hobbes, Boyle, Aristotle, Power, Bacon, Descartes and Hooke. Often, the references are to lesser known works by these authors. Thus, it is clear that serious Cavendish scholars will need to be especially familiar with these works. In this regard, O'Neill tends to offer more detailed and frequent annotations in the sections of Cavendish's work which consider issues in early modern philosophy of science and Atomism, than she does in the considerable section Cavendish spends on the issue of the problem of perception. There is no question that this well researched, documented and annotated edition will allow the labors of Cavendish to be revisited and her voice to once again be heard."},{"Title":"The CISM Prep Guide: Mastering the Five Domains of Information Security Management","review":"I bought this book because there is no other book available (prep guide) that covers the CISM.

I brought this book along for class (and CISM certified instructors) to see since the sample exam questions within are quite a different focus than those found in the ISACA's 3 prep books. Today's review session had notes provided directly from the CISM sponsoring organization. The ISACA's sample questions provided today didn't delve into the technical level found in this book's sample exam questions. I agree with a previous reviewer, this book seems to have more of a CISSP focus than a CISM focus at this time. I will focus my prep efforts for the Dec 2006 exam on the 3 books from ISACA (Exam guide, Q&A & Explanations, & Q&A and Explanations Supplement.) However, I will keep this book as an additional resource for my next year's prep for the CISSP exam.

The big book of the spiritual wisdom of the ages. From all the great wisdom traditions, east and west, this is the most comprehensive anthology I've ever seen. All the major themes of mankind's search for The Real are treated. From creation to sacrifice to magic to illusion to reality to visions to suffering, death, metanoia, prayer, grace, ecstacy, truth, union, the esoteric, the list goes on and on. Mr Perry has wisely organised this large book [over 1,000 pages] into a very accessable treasure trove of the world's greatest wisdom writings. Well referenced, indexed, foot noted, the book is awesome on many levels. Here you have quotes from the Bible, the Koran, the Buddhist Sutras, the Bhagavad Gita, Shakespeare, Plotinus, Ramakrishna, Meister Eckhart, William Law, Thomas Aquinas, Kabir, Lao Tzu, Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi, Black Elk, Plato, and hundreds more. This beautiful book all by itself makes a fine library of both ancient and modern writings by the great prophets, seers, sages, mystics, and scholars who have sought to speak their deepest truths. I buy books all the time, this is one of those rare ones you fall in love with completely. With very few exceptions, I know of no more wonderful book of essential knowledge than this one. Along with the massive amount of wisdom assembled here by Mr Whitall N. Perry, the book is further enriched with a great introduction by Huston Smith and a beautiful foreward by Marco Pallis.

This is an encyclopedia of the wisdom of the religions of the world, collected by themes and, from the first page to the end as if it were a spiritual journey, so you begin reading passages about \\"spiritual death\\" and you end with the highest level, which is \\"union with God\\". Mr. Perry has taken a lot (a lot) of care in quoting the sources, so that they're not out of context. And you have almost 1.200 pages of wisdom in its purest form from the most orthodoxes sages or saints (or both). The notes and introductions to every chapter (and every chapter has its own sections and subsections so each one is relatively short) are clarifying and taken to the minimun, so to not to interrupt much the quotes.

With its extraordinary index of sources, the book is the nearest thing to a whole religious library compressed between the covers of a single book. Nothing appears to have been left out or be missing.Awareness is documented throughout all the pages of this book, as keys used at different stages of the Way to unlock the gate of Unitive truth, transcending distinctions of religious form. Its author can bear witness to an ultimate truth: that by living his own form faithfully and intensely a man will live all 'other' forms by implication.This book gives testimony by those who had opened the 'heart's eye' throughout the spiritual history of mankind. In it, one finds a fertile source of reference and inspiration.Although the author primarily had in mind the man or woman of serious spiritual intent, it may be of service to historically or academically minded students just as it may come as a manual, handy to equip oneself for meeting with others who are like-minded from all parts of the world, to all advocates of religious understanding at an oecumenical level.In Switzerland in 1973, shortly after its first publication, I had the opportunity to find and read through this book. My own copy has remained a personal treasure."},{"Title":"Fun with Phonics","review":"My 3 1/2 year old absolutely loves these books.

H.","review":"To say that Steiner's work is controversial would be an understatement, and the controversy is probably well-deserved. This book is an expanded version of what first appeared in the KENYONG REVIEW, and it sometimes has a padded feel to it. The book is clearly at its strongest when following the Israeli team as it seeks to return the captured Adolf Hitler to San Cristobal, where he will be? This is part of the story--what would happen if Adolf Hitler was brought out of a South American jungle to a world that, for a variety of reasons that Steiner acutely outlines, would rather not be reminded of Hitler. There are several interludes where various intelligence services in several countries ponder this question, but I find these portions more of a drag on the story.Where Steiner is at his best is in first trying to provide a sense of the horror that Hitler represents. Then, in an ambiguous ending, he has Hitler explain himself. This, more than anything else, has been the source of a firestorm of criticism of Steiner. Critics say that by having Hitler at center stage in the last chaper, spouting his venomous justifications for his actions, suggests a sympathy for Hitler's thinking. These critics seem to ignore the exceptional passages Steiner has written about the impact of Hitler's horror on an individual like Lieber, who is the driving force behind the decades long search for Hitler. Some have even suggested that Steiner's words not only justify or mitigate Hitler, but place the blame for the Shoah on the Jews themselves. Nonsense. Steiner has bravely put forth for all to contemplate, how seductive evil can be to those predisposed to hate. More than that, he has set forth a story of pain, its continuing effect on people, and how we must learn to live with its memory.This is a brave and disturbing book; it will challenge any serious reader to work one's way through the unthinkable and unimaginable. There is no easy explanation for Hitler or the Shoah, and Steiner does not try to offer one. What he does offer is the freedom for the individual to think about issues that others would rather not have raised."},{"Title":"The Portage to San Cristobal of A. H.","review":"There is nothing in recent literature quite like this little book. I have a feeling that it will take its place alongside &quot;First and Last Men&quot; and Voyage To Arcturus&quot; as classic works which are little-read, yet never quite go out of print.This book is only accidently about Adolph Hitler. Its true theme is the power of language."},{"Title":"The Portage to San Cristobal of A. H.","review":"At it most pedestrian moments, George Steiner's novel &quot;The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H.&quot; is a &quot;what if&quot; story in which young Israeli Nazihunters find Hitler in the Amazonian jungle thirty years after the end of the Second World War. The genesis for the story comes from the historical disappearance of Hitler's body after his suicide as well as the apprehension, trial and execution of Adolf Eichmann. Now we know that Stalin had Hitler's remains brought to the Soviet Union to prove that the madman was indeed dead, but the idea of holding Hitler accountable for his sins is certainly compelling. While this book does not provide a formal trial, it does raise some fascinating questions.There are a pair of chapters in Steiner's book that stand out from the mere mechanics of capturing Hitler. In the first the question on the table is what would you do with Hitler once you had him in custody? Here is a man responsible for the deaths of millions, who remains in our minds the greatest mass murderer of the past century no matter what truths come to us about Stalih's purges. How do you extract judgment? Without access to the hellish inferno of Dante's imagination, what punishment could ever hope to provide closure? The fact that a satisfactory answer cannot be found does not detract from the merit of the line of inquiry.The second important chapter is the last, where Hitler is allowed to speak. The value of this chapter is that it gets beyond the memory of history to the heart of the evil. There is a fatal tendency in the modern world to equate Fascism with Hitler and the Nazis, which means anti-semitism and the Holocaust. The common folk on the street today would point to skinheads as being fascists. But Fascism is a dynamic built upon the Struggle for Order, a world in which the ends justify means that a democratic populace should scorn. Ultimately Steiner speaks to the ironic level on which Hitler achieved a victory of sorts, having cast the world in the image of his own ideology. Certainly the Cold War, which was still in bloom when Steiner wrote this book, is an example of the fascist ideology, where the demands of &quot;national security&quot; becomes a justification for blind obedience.Reading these two chapters is well worth reading the entire volume, which is but an evening's read. Certainly you can give over one evening of your life to consider the issues raised by &quot;The Portage to San Cristobal of A.H.&quot; and come to terms with them on your own. Hitler has become a caricature and while it is difficult to see him for what he truly was, this book definitely looks in the right direction."},{"Title":"The Portage to San Cristobal of A. H.","review":"This is a brilliant entry in the genre of &quot;what if?&quot; stories not because of its topic - the conclusion of a decades-long hunt for Adolf Hitler by a weary group of Israeli agents - but due to the stylish and daring writing of its author. A warning though: I read this book several years ago, and lent it to a friend who has since moved, so my memory of it cannot be trusted to be perfect as I have not been able to reference it.Not knowing the history of the novel or of its author, aside from what was on the original dust jacket, I think it is nonetheless fair to say that it was written not with any genre market in mind, but for the readers of so-called &quot;serious&quot; fiction. Steiner seems interested not just in his subject matter or the development of plot and story, but in the very structure of his sentences: of how we read and understand the English language. I don't pretend to be a student of modern literary trends, but I found Steiner's occasional forays into highly styalized language to be challenging and interesting; if anything, they drew me deeper into the novel.The novel is structured so that we alternate between following first, the now ragtag and isolated group of Israeli agents who are hot on the trail of a World War II-surviving Adolf Hitler; and second, the reaction to the news of Hitler's imminent and then actual capture by the Israelis in the capital cities of a number of interested nations. And we are not talking about public reaction, but the responses of foreign service and intelligence officials, of politicains and bureaucrats, of ruling circles capitalist and communist (the book was written in the 70's) to the news that Hitler is alive and that the Israelis - the Jews - have got him.Steiner naturally posits that the Israelis, on behalf of the murdered six million, will want to take Hitler back to Israel to stand trial for the Holocaust. But they are not alone in having a claim on the butcher. The Germans are interested in bringing their former leader to justice, and the victorius Western Allies (the U.S., Britain and France) want to grab Hitler to place him in front of a world tribunal, a la the Nuremburg Trials. The Soviets meanwhile want to make sure that their cover story for their variation on a &quot;Kennedy autopsy&quot; isn't blown. The Israeli team find themselves in a race; can they get out of the Amazonian forest they found Hitler in before the West can send their own commandos to grab him out of their hands? And does their own government really care anymore?Steiner addresses the philosphical question of who has the right to pass judgement on a criminal. Each stakeholder gets a chance to express their point of view, their motives for wanting, or not wanting, control over Hitler. The most moving and powerful chapter of the book is, not surprisingly, that which presents the Israeli, or more particularly the Jewish, case (Lacking a &quot;Jewish state,&quot; would not the Jews still have a legitimate claim on Hitler?). Unsure if they can hear him, the control agent for the Israeli team of hunters sends his men a radio message to remind them why they must be the ones to try Hitler. His is a harrowing recounting of the crimes of the Holocaust, large and small, mass and individual. It is like a primal scream crossed with stream of conciousness. Steiner jerks tears here, but why shouldn't he?Perhaps the one voice missing from the book (and it isn't Hitler's - the Fascist madman gets a chance to defend himself in the end) is one that speaks not for a specific group of victims, or for the geostrategic interests of various bureaucrats and elites, but for all of the victims of Capitalism, Fascism and Inter-Imperialist rivalry.If I had written this novel, I might have drawn the connection between capitalism and fascism, both in Germany and as world systems where the latter is created to save the former from proletarian revolution. I would have therefore had to consider the responsibility of the American, British and French ruling classes, as well as the German, for Hitler and WW II. Moreover, I would have had to discuss the criminal misleadership of Stalin over the world Communist movement,and the failure of the German Social Democrats and Communists in preventing the Nazi seizure of power.Steiner, I am sure, does not share my Trotskyist political analysis of the rise of Hitler, Mussolini and fascism in general. That's OK. But it would have been nice if there were one voice in his book that took a truly internationalist view of the capture and fate of Adolf Hitler, one voice that spoke as sincerely for all of the victims of fascism and Nazism as did the spokesman for the Jewish fallen.That one caveat aside, I think this is a brillant and challenging novel, as beautifully written as it is topical. I am especially happy that it will soon be back in print. It is an important work of fiction, and of philosophy."},{"Title":"The Portage to San Cristobal of A. H.","review":"I first read \\"The Portage\\" completely unaware of the great controversy which had surrounded the book during its initial publication, learning of it only after finishing the book and reading the author's afterword detailing the controversy that arose upon the book's original publication in 1970/71. Steiner has described the book as a philosophical text written in the guise of a work of pulp fiction; I'm not so sure of that.Most of the work does follows the standard drama of your typical thriller: the book opens with an Israeli Nazi-hunter team finding Hitler deep up the heart of the Amazonian backwater, with flashbacks used to let the reader in on the events leading them to him. The central part of the book is the struggle referred to by the book's title: the Israeli plan is to abduct Hitler from these backwaters in Brazil to the Venezuelan city of San Cristobal, where an Israeli plane awaits to take him to trial in Jerusalem. During this time, we are given glimpses of how the rest of the world reacts to the rumors that Hitler still lives and has been found. The drama throughout most of the book comes from two sources: firstly, will the team get Hitler, now in his eighties (the novel takes place around 1970), through the malaria-infested swamps and rainforests alive? Secondly, even if they do, will they get him back to Israel before the rest of the world learns of his existence and intercept him for their own trials?I don't wish to spoil this drama, so I will skip to the ending. What makes the book more than a simple work of alternative history, and what has made the book quite controversial, is its ending: Hitler is on trial, and the man put in charge of Hitler rises to give his opening remarks. But Hitler, who until now has been mute, almost catatonic, will have none of it. After shouting his lawyer into silence, Hitler launches into a sweeping, ten page list of arguments that ends the book. The book essentially ends with this speech, a fact that seems to have created much of the controversy, inasmuch that many critics seem to believe that such an ending serves as an implicit approval of Hitler's arguments (that is, because no one is allowed to refute Hitler, the book de facto supports him). It is an unfair criticism, in my opinion, as texts should be allowed to show disturbing characters and ideas, if only to let them fail on their own merit, or to let the reader decide for him or herself.I won't spoil the ending by detailing the arguments Hitler makes, other than to say that Hitler takes the concept of \\"blaming the victim\\" to new heights of rhetoric and imagery. He doesn't deny the Holocaust, but (attempts to) justify it in ways you have likely never come across before. Forget the usual theories regarding Hitler - that he feared he was part-Jew, that he got syphilis from a Jewish prostitute: by the end, Hitler is not only blaming the victim, but creates an argument bordering on blasphemy and full-on disturbing (and disturbed).Steiner's work outraged many, who felt that Steiner should have, ironically, listened to the advice the Israeli team's handler gives them early on in the novel: under no circumstances should Hitler be allowed to speak, because his evil rests in his mastery of language, his charismatic ability to seduce the listener with his arguments and appeals.The book is shocking, but I'm not sure if that shock manages to sustain itself into any deep or meaningful insight. I would recommend that those who read this check out two relevant books, if they can. One is \\"The World Hitler Never Made,\\" by Gavriel D. Rosenfeld; the other is \\"Explaining Hitler\\" by Ron Rosenbaum. Rosenfeld's book deals with the growing number of alternative history works (in literature, film, and television) that reference Hitler and/or Nazism, from Robert Harris' book \\"Fatherland\\" to the Star Trek episode \\"The City on the Edge of Forever.\\" Rosenbaum's is just what the title indicates: an examination of the various theories and explanations given as to how and why Hitler became Hitler.Both books feature sections on Steiner's novel; Rosenbaum's book also features what I can only frankly describe as a bizarre interview with the author himself. Rosenfeld makes the case that Steiner's work represented a growing Cold War disillusionment with the notion that in defeating Hitler, humanity had defeated its greatest evil. The discoveries of the evils committed by the likes of Stalin, Mao, and Pol-Pot (amongst many) seemed to only confirm that humanity remained as evil as ever, if not more so, and that, ironically, the Holocaust-related notion that \\"we must never forget\\" not only didn't stop evil, it may in fact help fuel it (by keeping alive the seductive allure of Hitler's words and imagery). Steiner's Hitler, then, is meant to be seductive and persuasive, because Steiner is showing the irony of what Holocaust studies and Shoah memorials are doing: by keeping the image and voice of Hitler alive, they also keep his most diabolical assets - force of personality, the rhetoric, the seductive power of evil - alive as well. It's as if, one might say, a work like Spielberg's \\"Schindler's List\\" creates as much evil as it hopes to prevent, and as such it would be better to indeed forget, to just forget and move on, rid of the allure and temptation that evil possesses.For Rosenbaum, the character \\"Hitler\\" of \\"The Portage\\" is unforgivable: he calls him \\"Steiner's Frankenstein\\", the created monster that the creator cannot control. While this gives him a bias against Steiner, his interview nonetheless begins with him giving the author several attempts to take the easy way out. Steiner doesn't, and in fact turns the book on its head. The novel, he states, isn't meant to show the fallacies of Hitler's arguments (which some defenders of the work have claimed occurs), but to actually put forward the argument that the Jews might indeed be responsible for their own Holocaust, and that the world might actually be better off if they'd never existed. Steiner, in this interview, seems obsessed with the idea of breaking the boundary of what is taboo, especially (what I take to be) the sensitive taboos and other undiscussable topics within Jewish communities (Steiner himself is Jewish). I found the interview interesting because it changes how you view the book, so you may want to refrain from reading it until once you're finished with the novel itself.I apologize for giving so much space to discussing works other than the one I'm ostensibly reviewing, but I think a work like this, given the nature of its ending, is really helped by doing some outside reading. Using Rosenfeld, it is interesting to see how \\"The Portage\\" works in relation to a number of other 'Nazi alternate history' works that came out at the same time. Rosenbaum too is quite useful for context, although quite honestly Steiner comes across as somewhat unhinged by the time his interview in that book comes to a close.So, overall, why the three stars? It is a decently entertaining book, readable in an evening as other reviewers have mentioned (this brevity being a good or bad thing, I don't know), and I disagree that it drags in the middle sections - some of the international settings, such as those that deal with a retired Red Army doctor and another with East and West German lawyers are quite interesting capsule stories in their own right (it should be said, though, that the book was written during the Cold War and all the international intrigue in the plot falls completely within that now somewhat dated framework). Hitler's words at the end are shocking and, so to speak, \\"novel\\" enough to make them seem much more explosive or thought-provoking than I suspect they really are.Ultimately, however, especially if you read it in conjunction with some additional reading as I've described, the book does become an interesting study of the question of how artists approach dangerous subjects. How do you invoke Hitler without invoking the charismatic who seduced millions into evil? Can works be considered critically apart from their authors? (Steiner was often labelled a \\"self-hating Jew\\" by critics of the book; his resultant bitterness from this is quite apparent in the Rosenbaum interview)It raises some interesting questions, but ultimately it is not the philosophical novel Steiner seems to have envisioned it being. It is really more a pulp work that makes dangerous use of a real-life villain. Not a bad read, but not quite the challenging or provoking work it might have been had the overall plot and story been fleshed out."},{"Title":"The Portage to San Cristobal of A. H.","review":"I just read Portage for the third time, and it's a breathtaking experience. Steiner manages to distill into 170 pages a breadth of perspective and intellectual challenge that will stretch any mind. The core event is a simple thought experiment -- capturing Hitler and hauling him out of the Amazon. But the \\"adventure\\" narrative is interrupted repeatedly by apparent digressions central to the theme of the book. My favorite is the elderly, classically educated German lawyer who is also, incidentally, an ex-Nazi officer. It begins with an almost frivolous analysis in music theory, and ends by presenting in simple detail the implications of the discovery of Hitler.The book is a narrative tour-de-force. Reading it the first time, you will probably find (as I still do) that the chaos of the trek through the jungle is as impenetrable as the jungle itself. There are five men, all Jews, in the party, and although each is carefully situated in his own character, it is almost impossible to keep straight who is who, who is speaking, what they are speaking about. Having read The Lost City of Z recently, I can appreciate how well Steiner describes the physical challenges of crossing the Amazon basin. The trek is a chaotic nightmare we burst free of occasionally to listen to Americans, the British, Russians, and French and Germans ruminate on the implications of the capture and how to respond to it. And the book ends, most maddening, at just the right moment.As for the flame of controversy over the last chapter: Steiner responds to it in an Afterword not to be missed. His response runs to five pages, but it can be summed up in two words: \\"Read, idiots!\\" Yes, Hitler is given unanswerable arguments to justify himself. Yes, he is fundamentally correct on every point. Yes, in no uncertain terms, Hitler is the nightmare child of Judaism. But that is not the whole story, of course, and the answer to Hitler's speech is in the early pages, in Leiber's Kaddish. If Hitler's persuasive arguments trouble you, read that part again.This is a stark, brutal book, for all its craft and elegance. It demands that humankind recognize that Hitler is our darker self, no more alien than the soldiers of the Seventh Cav who rode into the Little Big Horn eager to \\"kill me some Sioux\\" or the children burning scorpions at the beginning of The Wild Bunch.Hitler has become a bogey we can reject, the thing we are not, a Judas goat we can kill for our own sins. Steiner's unwelcome message is, Look in the mirror of history."},{"Title":"The Portage to San Cristobal of A. H.","review":"AH was not the incarnation of evil nor was he a force of nature. He was a very common man who was as much a sponge and a mirror of his world as he was an actor upon it. If anything he was a clown which is what made him laughable out of power and deadly once he achieved it. Steiner understands ALL of this and his morality tale gives an insight into the nature of our nature. It is as much a lamentation as it is an argument but either way it is an enlightenment."},{"Title":"The Portage to San Cristobal of A. H.","review":"In this novel, Adolf H. did not commit suicide at the end of World War II, but escaped to South-America. After he is captured, he can defend himself for his crimes. His defence contains the same items as these developed in another book of the author 'In Bluebeard's Castle'. Adolf H. took revenge by organizing the holocaust because mankind was blackmailed three times in an absolute manner: by one terrifying almighty God, by the limitless love of his son Christ and by Rabbi-Marx, who wanted to create heaven on earth.I found the first part of the novel 'the chase of Adolf H.' rather average.The second part 'The defence of Adolf H.' is a powerful text, but I prefer the treatment of the same themes in his book 'In Bluebeard's Castle': a bold and compelling conjecture about the subconscious motives of the holocaust."},{"Title":"The Portage to San Cristobal of A. H.","review":"This little novella gives Steiner the opportunity to argue that Hitler was the benefactor of those he ostensibly opposed. The plot is that Jews set out to capture the ninety year old Nazi leader who is hiding in the jungle. When they catch him they are confronted with the problem of trying him in the jungle or bringing him back to civilization. They try him in the jungle. Hitler is given the opportunity to defend himself. He does so in an eloquent speech. Hitler argues that Stalin was slaughtering millions while he was still an unknown. Hitler, by persecuting the Jews, made posssible the creation of the Zionist state which mirrors his policies.As Hitler concludes, the Indian guide of the captors proclaims: \\"Proven!\\" Whether this means Hitler has proven himself guilty or proven his case is left for the reader to decide. The novella was later converted into a play by an Englishman and ceated great controversy.It is clear that Steiner was raising all sorts of issues that organized Jewry would rather not have addressed. The deliberate ambiguity at the end invites open thinking which is precisely what the powers that be do not want. Steiner is, of course, impliedly attacking the stae of Israel and its policies. It is a cute approach and one sure to annoy as many as it delights."},{"Title":"The Portage to San Cristobal of A. H.","review":"What would you say if given the chance to confront one of the most hated men of the last century? What if your loved ones had suffered and died by his hand?Welcome to one of the most disturbing and controversial books ever written. The basic premise is simple: It's 1977. Jewish Nazi-hunters have discovered that Adolf Hitler did NOT die in his F&uuml;hrerbunker, and have tracked him down in a remote hideout in the Amazon. Their goal is to take the 90-year-old man safely and secretly through the jungle to San Crist&oacute;bal, so that he could be taken back to Jerusalem to stand trial.However, this is no mere \\"what if\\" piece of historical fiction. Rather, it is a philosophical look into the nature of evil and the power of language. Throughout the relatively short novel, dozens of characters are introduced, but very few (if any) are developed to an extent where readers really get to \\"know\\" them. Instead, Steiner gives glimpses into the minds and bureaucracies of people and nations impacted by Hitler's reign of terror.When the story was first published in 1979, it sparked a firestorm of controversy. Most of the controversy revolves around the final chapter, in which Hitler finally speaks in his own defense. Readers have rightfully been repulsed and horrified at the brute force of Hitler's logic and rhetoric as he not only justifies himself, but claims that the Jews ought to be grateful to him; after all, he says, would there have ever been a Zionist state without the Holocaust?Many critics have believed that Steiner -- a Jew -- was himself justifying Hitler's actions, by virtue of giving A.H. the \\"last word\\". The book ends without any rebuttal to the four points given in his self-defense. The actual final word is spoken by an Indian guide named Teku, who simply says, \\"Proved.\\" Many have questioned whether he meant by this that Hitler had proved his own case, or whether he was incriminated by his own testimony, but I think the actual answer to this question is very subtly hidden in the name Steiner gave this native guide: \\"Teku\\" is a Hebrew word meaning \\"the question remains undecided\\". I believe that readers are meant to come to their own conclusions.I did not get the sense at all that Steiner was in any way sympathetic to Hitler. Most of the first sixteen chapters are devoted to the horrors of the Third Reich, particularly a long monologue by a Jew named Lieber which acts as a counter-balance to Hitler's monologue at the end of the book. Instead, the message that I felt Steiner intended to communicate with me, the reader, was the idea that evil can be very seductive; Hitler's speech is a very unpleasant (but important) reminder of the power of words to persuade otherwise sensible people to believe all manner of atrocious things. We must remember that Hitler was a master communicator, who convinced millions of people to follow him and accede to the implementation of his \\"Final Solution\\". Should we be shocked at the idea that a justification of Hitler's crimes could actually be made to sound reasonable? If we think something like that could never happen, we invite history to repeat itself.There are also some other very important philosophical questions raised in this novel. What does revenge actually accomplish? Can any measure of vengeance bring closure for the families of victims? Can someone become too old to stand trial? If one man, no matter how evil, has been made to be a symbol of the evil actions perpetrated by thousands of individuals, is it possible to give him a fair trial? Who gets jurisdiction to try him? The continued relevance of these questions is evident in the recent proceedings involving 91-year-old John Demjanjuk, the last Nazi war-crimes defendent, who in 2011 was found guilty by a German court of 28,060 counts of accessory to murder.This is certainly not a pleasant nor easy novel to read, but it is an important one. We need to be stretched, and reminded of our own propensity for evil if we are to stand any chance of resisting or opposing it. This book is a challenge worth facing."},{"Title":"The Portage to San Cristobal of A. H.","review":"I recently reread this novel in order to review it for a book club. In doing so, I have read the earlier reviews on your site.I am quite surprised that the firestorm of criticism that met this novel when originally published almost 20 years ago is not reflected in at least some of the reviews by your readers. For my part, I count this absence as a positive reflection upon the Amazon reviewing community. That firestorm was solely a consequence of Hitler's speech presented in his own defense in the final chapter. Primarily Zionists and European \\"new right\\" nationalists involved in this strong criticism dislike the fact that Steiner, an ethnic Jewish author of significant stature, is anti-Zionist and views the creation of Israel and its national policies as betraying the Jewish people's moral (and highest) contributions to human discourse. Steiner would see the Jewish gift as transcending, what is in his view, a narrow nationalistic, materialistic perspective represented by Zionism. One can rationally differ with Steiner's views about Israeli middle east policy, the consequences of the creation of the State of Israel and its ongoing policies toward the Palestinian people, or the rationale of Zionism generally, but it is another matter to castigate any author holding the view that Zionist nationalism has contributed to the enormously dangerous dilemma in the middle east, both for the people of Israel and the rest of the world.On an entirely different score, none of your reviewers has yet mentioned what a fine example this novel is of the Socratic method applied to creative writing. The author, whatever his personal beliefs, remains neutral on all issues he raises. He grants the reader the ultimate gift -- the right to decide for his/her self the value of the competing ideas presented. As Steiner himself has said when commenting upon this book, fiction gives a freedom of openness and presentation that is less available in the nonfiction or essay format. According to Steiner, the \\"fictive\\" presentation gives the reader greater access to the ideas and draws the reader into the story, allow him to become a participant in the resolution of the issues raised. This is another way of saying that creative writing, i.e.., fiction, can often reveal truth in a more effective fashion than the nonfictional presentation of \\"facts.\\" This is quite an acknowledgment from someone who has made his career as an essayist, not as a author of fiction.Finally, from a literary perspective, there are many, many wonderful descriptive passages in this book. To pick a few examples, the character Charlie, the CIA agent on the ground, is an acute portrayal of certain predominant American traits as seen from an outside perspective -- characteristics of the entrepreneurial instinct, materialism, and cultural banality. Character Gideon B's fever dialogue is marvelous writing, as is the discourse of Rothling, the old Nazi soldier, now attorney, who riffs (among other topics) upon music and the closed-in caution of the Post-WWII German generation. Whether you agree or disagree with the views and feelings presented through these characters and others, Steiner leaves that choice to you. In any event, the writing is generally fine, and often quite exceptional.This novel is about many topics -- the nature of evil, the power of words, the connection between revenge and justice, communal and individual responsibility, the role of metaphysics in \\"giving comfort\\" in the face of horrifying adversity, the tenuous role of \\"art\\" in humanizing mankind. Steiner, for his part, through the gift of fiction, provocatively lays these complex topics out and leaves it to us, the readers, to sort them for ourselves as we see fit. That is the ultimate gift an author can give the reader."},{"Title":"The Portage to San Cristobal of A. H.","review":"I read this book at the recommendation of someone who I trust. I might not be that guy for you, but I'll try to help. The central storyline of _The Portage to San Cristobal of A. H._ is that Hitler did not die in the bunker but instead escaped to the jungles of South America. Committed Nazi hunters have found out where Hitler has been hiding and they capture him and work their way out of the jungle. Overall, I enjoyed the book. As a reader, I think the highest praise I can put on a book is that it inspired me to write. This book did just that.Without granting too much of a spoiler, I think the most interesting thing Steiner does is humanize the character of Hitler. He presents him as a frail old man but with a still-powerful mind. Many will have mixed emotions about the ending, but this shows the power of the author's idea. There are a couple of critiques though from my perspective. The first is that there are several chapters that do not have to deal with the main storyline that are presented and seem like filler. I think the author is trying at points to show juxtaposition or contrast to give context, but for me it seemed like filler. The book is short anyways, yet it seemed padded out. This filler means there are many characters who are presented, too many for such a sparse narrative. The ending is also challenging, but if you have an open mind it will grant an interesting perspective on events of the past."},{"Title":"The Portage to San Cristobal of A.

The story is simple: Israeli Nazi-hunters capture Adolf Hitler in the depths of the Amazon rain forest. Their radio broadcasts to Israel are intercepted and decoded by various governments, which deliberate about how to respond before the news leaks out. Meanwhile, the Nazi-hunters, weakened by their ordeal in the jungle, decide to put their captive on trial. Hitler defends himself in a longish speech that has given solace to anti-Semitic readers (such as one Amazon reviewer below). Then the book ends. That's it. Really.Some of the writing is powerful, such as the radio broadcast from Israel reminding the Nazi-hunters of the horrors of the Holocaust. Other parts of the book are at least entertainingly bizarre, such as Hitler's super-intellectual defense of his decision to destroy European Jewry (since the Jews invented monotheism and guilt, they had to be wiped out). But at other times, the book is painfully cliche'd, as in its endless descriptions of the muck and leeches of Amazonia, or its quotes from the diary of a French diplomat (he's wily! he has a mistress! he is acutely self-aware!), or its rendering of the ponderous metaphysical/historical musings of a legal advisor to the German foreign ministry.Most readers will close the book scratching their heads and wondering what it was all about -- but at least it's short and holds one's attention."},{"Title":"The Portage to San Cristobal of A.

By location? Religion? Eating habits? Settling on any one or even a few elements makes it easy to limit culture to human beings alone. Many cultural anthropologists steadfastly keep to those bounds. McGrew argues strongly that such narrow constraints confine our thinking. His view of culture is defined as: \\"The way we do things\\". That would seem to open to almost infinite possibilities. For some, that has been the case - one researcher even sweeping pet guppies into the net. McGrew, however, is more concerned with ensuring culture takes other primates into account. In particular, he wants our nearest cousins, the chimpanzees, included in the rubric. In this finely-conceived overview, he skillfully builds a case for showing culture exists in chimpanzee society.McGrew's long career of primate research in the field granted him wide experience and many insights. The insights derived in some cases from surprises. His own observations in Gombe, Tanzania, were jarred by a visit to Mahale. No chimps in Gombe ever engaged in mutual grooming the way they did at Mahale. The Japanese team at Mahale assumed all chimpanzees did the \\"grooming hand-clasp\\", but McGrew explained it was otherwise. The event marked a major step in understanding that the usual human idea of The Chimpazee as a universal is false. Chimps have practices that vary in different places. In western Africa they will shatter hard food nuts with stone or branch hammers. Eastern chimpanzees \\"fish\\" for ants and termites with twigs, but don't pound readily available nuts. Some chimps apparently fear immersion in water, while others will plunge in up to their chests. Yet, what we know of these variations in behaviour and why it exists remains only initial awareness. McGrew calls for further research using clear parameters.Recognising that \\"the way we do things\\" is but a way to expand our outlook to include other primates, McGrew offers a set of terms for clarification. Noting that culture studies must weave in several disciplines from anthropology to zoology, he indicates which contributions each can provide. More importantly, he suggests that cross-disciplinary research will not only help clarify what culture means, the effort would certainly further the insights in the various fields. An indication of this is found in the book's structure, which deals less about \\"the way chimpanzees do things\\" and asks more about where new data should be sought. \\"Speech\\", for example, which most humans declare sets us apart from the rest of the animal kingdom, has almost been ignored as a research topic in primatology.McGrew avoids a strict definition of \\"culture\\". Instead, he skirts that issue, urging that \\"operational\\" values be used - is the suggested definition subject to investigation and/or testing and be reliably verifiable? Content is more important than labels, since labels produce constraints. Having been in many an academic skirmish, McGrew has no hesitation about accepting preliminary results in the new field he proposes. There's much to be done and while debate over terminology rages, chimpanzees are being habituated to humans, which changes their behaviour and may lead to their extinction. Part of that debate, he contends, takes up too much time and effort in how far \\"culture\\" can be extended. When guppy females show preference for victorious fighting males, is it necessary to argue over whether that signifies culture? Conversely, some have tried to limit \\"culture\\" to our high-tech society. Yet, that proposal fails when we examine the range of human societies. Such comparison with primate cultures is even less valid.McGrew's plea for an expansion of the idea of culture is dramatically synthesised in his final chapter. \\"Standard\\" science cannot be practiced on chimpanzees. As he's already demonstrated, there are geographical distinctions in some chimp social behaviour. Relocating large groups of chimpanzees to determine if these differences are environmental, imparted or genetic is both impractical and unethical. Future studies, he urges, should be experimental and opportunistic in method. Strict controls are impossible, but the cross-disciplinary approach should make up for that condition. The first teams might well be palaeoanthropologists and cultural primatologists. Fossil hunters could teach field researchers in primatology much. Of course, McGrew's colleagues must be willing to learn. Which is one reason why he wrote this book. The other reason is that human beings must shed their conceit that only our species can possess culture. Discarding that prejudice will aid in awakening our impact on the rest of Nature, as well.

Fletcher's \\"Practical Methods of Optimization\\", or Gill, Murray & Wright's \\"Practical Optimization\\" both good MSc level books but somewhat dated now and perhaps a bit tedious sometimes. However, if you're a novice, I advise you to look at them also, if you have access to them, as they might serve your specific needs/ reading style better/equally well. You should also look at Luenberger's \\"Linear and Nonlinear Programming\\" which is also quite old but has a classic writing style and is holding up rather well. If you want the fine nitty-gritty details and the breadth of coverage though, Bazaraa has more. Luenberger's more solid and rigorous.Haven't had the chance to look at the more recent \\"Nonlinear Optimization\\" by Andrzej Ruszczynski but it might be as good/better as he's also an expert in the field - so keep that in mind.\\"Convex Optimization\\" by Stephen Boyd is more advanced (not too advanced though, depending on your maths ability) and moving in a slightly different field/teritory."},{"Title":"NONLINEAR PROGRAMMING","review":"extremely good shape. i like the way it was sent and everything about the text was perfect and good.

It is more than one month, they made mistake with the delevery and I pay the delay of it"},{"Title":"The Fly on the Wall","review":"This novel is impressive for a early effort in the author's career. There are some early, illogical developements in the protagonist's not understanding what is happening. This is a plot device, which prompts the reader to question the character's acuity, and judgement; designed to increase the tension.I would recommend this book to someone, but with reservations."},{"Title":"The Fly on the Wall","review":"This book is especially interesting because it comes from the horse's mouth--Mr. Hillerman was a newspaperman himself once. A good story."},{"Title":"The Fly on the Wall","review":"This is NOT one of Hillerman's Chee and Leaphorn books. That series is great and the characters shine through, and most of the books are wonderful and fun reads. This book is not any of those. I guess there are two main problems with this book. First, it was written early on in Hillerman's career and his writing style was still developing; and, second, it is clearly an antiquated story and one dimensional.The book's hero is John Cotton - a reporte who covers politics for one of the local newspapers in an unnamed state capital some where in the northern midwest of the United States. The time is the early 70's. One of Cotton's colleagues - albeit someone who works for a competing newspaper - has a big story developed but he is either pushed to his death or commits suicide before it is published. Cotton decides to follow up on the lead and starts developing the story himself. This gets one of his friends killed, so Cotton knows he is on the right track.Trying to get away from it, Cotton takes a fishing vacation in the Southwest and there we see the Hillerman spark! The place descriptions, the pace of the story, they all start shining and show us Hillerman fans why we like his writing so much! Unfortunately, after this brief interlude, the story goes back to its base location, and the pacing slows way down again.Eventually, Cotton figures out what is going on and a thriller like climax takes us to a logical conclusion to the book. However, did I like it? Well, no. it wasn't so much that the book was unoriginal or boring, it was that the book was a drudge to get through for some reason. The whole scandal that the reporters are tryign to figure out has to do with the question of what should reporters do? Are they really disinterested and objective observers? Or, should they participate in their stories and adjust their writing to accommodate their personal viewpoints? Cotton is of the opinion that he needs to publish the story regardless of the cost to his favorite cause or politician. Many others in the book disagree with that premise.A kind of morbid fascination for me was reading about the technological tools of the time and realizing how much has changed in the intervening years. Cotton writes his stories on a typerwriter using carbon paper to have copies and then a teletype to get it to his offices; when he goes to search data for background, he leafs through paper files that are stored in big rooms with many file cabinets; etc. No cell phones, no computers, no internet!The plotting and pace of this book is rather poor. Most of the book concerns itself with technical details of reporting that just do not make sense to some one outside of the trade. Also, the whole way in which the plot is uncovered seems to not come together until Cotton explains it even though I read through all his searching and information gathering. I do not like books where the explanation for what is going on is dependent on specific information that only the subject has. And in this book that seems to be the case. Also, there is a key romantic relationship which appears out of nowhere at the middle of the book - and another at the tail end - and neither of them appear to be connected to anything.My summary is that I am glad to have read it as part of the overall Hillerman collection that I have. I am unhappy to have to say that if this was the very first Hillerman that I ever read, that it would likely have been the last."},{"Title":"The Fly on the Wall","review":"The Fly on the Wall reads as wonderfully as any of his Indian series do. I was quite thrilled to read a political thriller--in this day and age of excitement on the political edge. I wish he had considered that when he wrote this book--it certainly fit in. Thanks for a really great read, Mr. Hillerman."},{"Title":"The Fly on the Wall","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I'm a fan of Hillerman's Jim Chee mysteries, but found this to be as good, if not better, than those. I almost gave up on the book at first -it was so technical it was almost funny- but it was worth sticking with it, because the plot turned out to be one of his most interesting. Unlike some of the Jim Chee stories, whose endings can be somewhat anti-climactic, Fly on the Wall was riveting through the final pages. I imagine this book might not appeal to all of Hillerman's fans, but I thoroughly enjoyed it."},{"Title":"The Fly on the Wall","review":"in my opinion tony hillerman should stick to what he writes best navajo mystery! his joe leaphorn and jim chee novels are his best works by far"},{"Title":"The Fly on the Wall","review":"I did not enjoy this book as much as the rest of his books. It took me a long time to fully understand the characters in the book. The other day, I heard this book being compared to a glass of water. This person said, &quot;It is like water. It really has no flavor, but at least it goes down quickly.&quot; I agree with this because overall, I did not like this book."},{"Title":"The Fly on the Wall","review":"This was just a very boring story. On top of that the author was the reader on the tape and he is just monotone. No change of inflextion, pitch or anything to make it more pleasurable to listen to. I thought it was too full of details about numbers and lacked a lot for a mystery."},{"Title":"The Fly on the Wall","review":"I am glad to be the first person to review this excellent piece of literature. Hillerman is a master."},{"Title":"The Fly on the Wall","review":"One of Hillerman's few stories that doesn't take place on the Navajo Reservation. Here, newspaper reporter John Cotton stumbles onto a story of government corruption that has already led to the death of a friend and fellow reporter. It was kind of difficult to figure out where his investigation was going in the first half of the book. Things did start to make sense in the second half. Also, drama started to go up a bit. More should have been done to flesh out Cotton and other characters. You mainly see him as a reporter, not a human being. It also would have been nice if the city and state where the story took place was named. Still, all in all, it was an okay book."},{"Title":"The Fly on the Wall","review":"This story is set in an unnamed Midwestern city. John Cotton is a reporter at the state's capitol. One of his colleagues tells him he is working on a really big story. Shortly after this the colleague falls several stories and dies. This starts Cotton investigating the same leads. Then another one of his friends is killed while driving Cotton's car.I found this to be a very slow book. The characters were not well developed. Cotton's attraction to Jane seems to come out of the blue. Also, I had difficulties following the leads in the beginning. They were very technical.The political intrigue did not get interesting until about 1/2 to 2/3 way through the book. One issue covered in the book is how much political corruption, stealing of public funds, etc. is allowable if it serves the purpose of getting or keeping the &quot;better&quot; politician in office.Tony Hillerman's books set on the Navajo reservation are better. The characters are much more well developed in those books."},{"Title":"The Fly on the Wall","review":"This is the second time in about 20 years that I have read The Fly on the Wall, published in hardcover 1st edition in 1971 by Harper and Row, copyright by Tony Hillerman. I enjoyed the book much better the second time around; I learned from the first reading not to sweat the numerous, often-times boring details of the scam.John Cotton writes a political column for the Tribune. A rival reporter, just before he takes a violent tumble to his death from the balcony of the capitol rotunda, tells John that he is on to something big/exciting. Shortly before the rival reporter's death, a man in a blue suit hurriedly comes looking for the reporter's notebook which contains all the reporter's notes on current/future stories he is/will be working on. John Cotton finds the missing notebook,launches his own investigation that leads to the disclosure of policical corruption high up in state government, and comes very close, several times, to having his life violently snubbed out before the situation resolves itself in a most satisfying way.Although the book is jam-packed with minute details on how a state goverment is scammed by an unscrupulous road construction firm, just remember that understanding every detail about the scam is not that important. There is a section in the book about a poker game in progress. I'm not a poker player; I've never bothered to learn the rules of the game, but I knew enough to know that I didn't have to understand every detail about every hand to get the gist of what was going on (but it might have added to my reading pleasure if I had!). What is important about The Fly on the Wall is that the state is being scammed, and the challenge is to try to determine who is behind the scam and why. This is hinted at throughout the book, but the details are never fully revealed until the very end. (And what a Masterful ending it is!)Just remember: the book is all about politics and scheming to get ahead, and not in understanding every tedious detail of the scam!"},{"Title":"The Fly on the Wall","review":"I really like Tony Hillerman's novels though this is one is very different than any of his others. The protagonist is believably dull but is fleshed out nicely to make the action move really well. Many of the other characters, the girl friend, for instance, always remains a 2 dimensional spacer in the overall plot movement. I would rate this book a 4 star on the same level as Finding Moon, but not on a par with Chee and Leaphorn.This book is still a good choice today compared to the current level of fiction that is being generated today by method writers."},{"Title":"The Fly on the Wall","review":"I enjoy the Hillerman Navajo mysteries because the characters are well developed. Not so in this book. I found the first half really boring and hard to get through. The characters were not people you could care about, an important issue for me."},{"Title":"The Fly on the Wall","review":"Even though I am a Hillerman fan, my expectations were loweredfor this book. I'm mainly interested in his Navajo mysteries. However,I found this book to be well-written and compelling. Definitely worththe read, even though it isn't Hillerman's best."},{"Title":"The Fly on the Wall","review":"Tony Hillerman's The Fly on the Wall has not aged particularly well. Written in 1971, early in his career, the book has been bypassed by technological advances as well as Hillerman's success with the Leaphorn/Chee series. Knowing that no future tales of John Cotton, newspaperman, have been written made getting into the book a little more difficult than I expected.The characters and setting don't fit well with what one has come to think of as a \\"Tony Hillerman\\" book - that combination of Native Americans, their folklore, and the Southwest. To a man (and a woman), the characters are all extremely liberal in their political viewpoint. If you're convinced there's a liberal bias in the mainstream press, this novel will do nothing to disabuse you of that notion. Even if you do subscribe to the dominant point of view, you may be disappointed by some of the things liberalism's used to excuse in the final chapter. Perhaps the book's greatest weakness is the lack of alternate viewpoints explored: there are no real Republican characters either as foils or villains and this makes for some uninspired conflict and ultimately an unsatisfying resolution.Part way through the book I found myself wishing Cotton would get himself out of a jam by making a cellphone call, or fax or e-mail his stories in to his editor, then I remembered - 1971! None of those things existed. Teletype machines and direct-dial long distance were the high tech of the day; even though photocopiers existed, Cotton still uses carbon paper throughout the story to make duplicates of his stories written on a manual typewriter. If you're nostalgic for these things, then you'll probably get more out of the story than I did.The Southwest makes a brief appearance in the middle of the book when Cotton tries to find sanctuary there. While not quite as picturesque as in the Leaphorn/Chee books, this brief respite in New Mexico marks the point where the novel really picks up steam. Here and in Cotton's escape from the vacant Capitol building near the end of the novel are the two parts where Hillerman's pacing and plotting really shine. Compared to these fast-paced action scenes, the talky final chapter and the lengthy set-up in the first half of the book are big disappointments.The Fly on the Wall isn't a terrible book, but it's clearly not Hillerman's best. If you're caught up on the latest Navajo novels, go ahead and tackle this one, but there's really no reason to go out of your way for it."},{"Title":"The Fly on the Wall","review":"I did finish the book staying up until 1 pm. If you are a fan of Hillerman, then you do want to read this book. The two \\"chased by the bad guy\\" scenes in the book, one in Santa Fe and the other in the Capitol, are worth the price of admission. They are pulse quickening and vivid."},{"Title":"The Fly on the Wall","review":"In this novel by Mr. Hillerman, the well developed story puts the reader in a position as strong observer.

Unlike previous BGP works, this book assumes that the reader already has a solid understanding of BGP theory and mechanics, and is geared for those people interested in real world BGP design, implementation, and management in enterprise and service provider networks. The book covers the following four major categories:* Advanced BGP: Building Blocks, Performance Tuning, Policy Control* Designing BGP Enterprise Networks: Core &amp; Internet Connectivity* Designing BGP Service Provider Networks: iBGP, Route Reflection &amp; Confederations, and Service Provider Architecture* Implementing BGP Multiprotocol Extensions: MPLS VPN, Multicast, IPv6As the title suggests, BGP Design and Implementation goes into the depths of what to consider when implementing or managing a large BGP network. It is not for the casual reader as it is filled with large-scale design theory, and unless you are actually working with BGP at this level, it will be mostly an academic exercise and can drag on at times. Other foundational BGP theory books such as Halabi's Internet Routing Architectures will be a better fit for the CCNP/CCIE student. On the other hand, if the reader does or is contemplating using BGP at the enterprise or service provider level, this is an excellent resource to read and keep as a reference.The real value of this book is in the practical configuration designs that the authors propose based off of their experiences. For example, the explanation of BGP memory and CPU tuning based on small packet handling efficiency is not only surprisingly informative, but Zhang and Bartell solidify their theory by providing benchmark results. Not to be misunderstood, there is plenty of \\"theory\\" in this book, but it normally prefaces a case study that ties the practical to the theoretical. It was good to see examples of a BGP implementation at the enterprise core instead of merely seeing ISP connectivity examples, although there is plenty of information in that area as well. The service provider section of the book proves to be interesting, going into examples of how providers more commonly use route reflectors, or how transit and peering connectivity is controlled, but it seems that the authors are writing more to the enterprise customer than they are to the service provider. Perhaps they do this so the enterprise customer can have a better understanding of the carrier network. From a provider perspective, much of the information seems basic and would not be new to an experienced network engineer. It's in the final section of BGP extensions regarding MPLS VPN's, multicast, and IPv6, that the information presented might be of additional value to the service provider engineer. The typical customer might be more accustomed of thinking about VPN's in terms of IPSec and IKE, or simple static rendezvous points for multicast. It's interesting to see how BGP can help expand these concepts into a broader scale, spreading across disparate networks and protocols.If you have the proper expectations before reading the book, there really aren't that many drawbacks to the book itself. The majority of the information is not a repeat from previous works on BGP, and there is a good amount of practical examples and case studies. There aren't a lot of straight IOS config examples, but rather much of the conversation stays at the design level, which if you're the type of person that prefers to actually see the CLI commands, this can be frustrating at times. It's also questionable as to how valuable the third section of the book (service provider networks) would be to actual experienced service providers, but from an enterprise customer perspective, it is very informative. To the casual reader and someone not very familiar with BGP, this book will most likely prove to be much too boring and technically challenging. Perhaps a subtitle of \\"Enterprise and Service Provider Networks\\" would have better clarified the scope of the book.BGP Design and Implementation is an excellent resource for people serious about BGP, and it is even more helpful to those actually working with BGP as it provides useful, practical design and tuning models."},{"Title":"BGP Design and Implementation","review":"I would just like to add my comments to the list of reviews: if you work with BGP this book is essential! What makes this book unique is that it is intended for the real-world, production environment engineer, with outstanding results. Personally, I have used this book on two major projects with excellent results; I am sure I would not have been able to find this type of information, knowledge in any single place - if at all - since as another reviewer noted, it distills years of practical experience into a well organized, accessible format. Again, my thanks to Mssrs. Zhang and Bartell for a truly outstanding, practical book that has saved me hours of work, research. Highly recommended!!"},{"Title":"BGP Design and Implementation","review":"This book answered so many questions I had about how the Internet works and how enterprises can use BGP in their networks. The writing style is clear and a pleasure to read. I did not notice any errors or typos. This is one of the best Cisco Press books I've read. The material covered is a logical extension (fill-the-gaps) for the knowledge one gains when studying BGP as part of the CCNP/CCDP BSCI exam. The case studies for enterprise BGP core design and Internet connectivity were one of the most interesting and useful real-world scenarios one can strive to implement. Same for the service provider examples. One caution however, this is not \\"beginner\\" material. One would greatly benefit from having a CCNP-level understanding of BGP prior to attacking this book."},{"Title":"BGP Design and Implementation","review":"Advanced BGP Design and Implementation (Zhang, Bartell Cisco Press, 2004, ISBN 1-58705-109-5) is a great book on advanced BGP concepts.There are a few chapters at the beginning that cover the history and basics of BGP. Then it dives right into the settings and tuning of BGP. This book is not for the faint of heart as it kicks in quick with in depth coverage of all that is BGP. You definitely want to have a good solid understanding of BGP basics before reading this book.You should consider reading other BGP reference books first such as Sam Halabi's Internet Routing Architectures, William Parkhurst's Cisco BGP 4 Command and Configuration Handbook (Cisco Press, 2001) and various Cisco whitepapers and BGP design documents from their website. It will definitely help you to absorb more of this book and will give you a good basis to then get into the fine-tuning aspects of BGP.The book covers many of the advanced BGP topics that you would normally have to dig for in RFC's and various other resources and books. This is a great reference book to keep on the shelf and have handy (once you have read it a few times first of course). I personally enjoyed the extensive coverage of BGP policy enforcement in chapter 4, which is critical to getting the most out of BGP. Also there was great coverage of multi protocol BGP and Inter-AS VPN's with MPLS as it relates to BGP. This is a topic of great interest today for those looking at label switching for logical separation and/or for traffic engineering.Other topics of interest included IPv6, Interdomain Multicast and scaling BGP using confederations and route reflectors, and merging BGP autonomous systems. It was great to learn of the memory requirements implemented on Cisco routers. This was something that has always been a concern for many people with older routers and various memory and flash constraints.I found the diagrams and examples to be extremely valuable. The authors explained very nicely topics that often are difficult to understand or grasp. Their examples portrayed real world scenarios, which made it even easier to relate to and to understand. Always helpful to have something that you can apply to your particular situation or job function.I would say due to the granularity of detail covered in this book, it is geared more towards large enterprise backbones and Internet Service Provider backbones.This is a great resource to have, especially if you want to delve into the inner workings and mysteries of BGP."},{"Title":"BGP Design and Implementation","review":"I recently read the book titled \\"BGP Design and Implementation\\" by Randy Zhang and Micah Bartell. ISBN: 1587051095. In my opinion, this title is a magnificent compliment to two other great titles from Cisco Press, \\"Internet Routing Architectures\\", by Sam Halabi, ISBN: 157870233X and we mustn't forget the other great title \\"Cisco BGP-4 Command and Configuration Handbook\\" by William Parkhurst, ISBN: 158705017X. Each title has it's own strengths, but \\"BGP Design and Implementation\\" is a great hybrid of the two former titles on BGP.This book covers information that is either extremely hard to find, privileged information or it just hadn't been documented yet. This book gives you the knobs to turn, to tune BGP into everything it can be.I think the book is laid out very well. The authors do a great job of laying down foundational information on the subjects that are discussed in later chapters. The book starts off and goes 0 to 60 in about two chapters. Advanced topics and issues are discussed first, so the reader is not left in the dust when the more complex topics and details are covered.There are some great tip pertaining to BGP convergence tuning. The chapter is very well documented with several supporting examples. Some of the sections give great detail and are easily understood, but there are no command examples of how to implement the information. For example, TCP tuning is well documented, but there is no information on how to change the Maximum Segment Size on a router. Another great section pertains to how to leverage a feature in OSPF so that OSPF is aware of BGP. Unfortunately, the feature appears to be limited to a special IOS release. So certain sections would require the reader to either know how to implement the information or to look up the related commands to implement the information.The book contains information on everything from building a BGP network Core to Load Balancing in a Multihome Environment. It focuses on how to make BGP scalable and how to configure BGP to maximize performance. Making this book essential for any Networking Professional that has or will deploy BGP. There are more tips and suggestions on architectural considerations than any other reference I've seen relating to the implementation of BGP.The use of confederations, Route Reflectors and VPN/MPLS are well documented and studied in this book. The Authors have done a wonderful job of explaining the challenges of using Route Reflectors and Confederations and even how to migrate the two. These topics are very complex in nature, yet the books explanations and supporting diagrams are easy to follow, turning a complex issue into a manageable one.The book has several supporting diagrams and tables that reinforce the author's message. I found the diagrams to be easy to follow and understand. Most all of the commands that are listed in the book have examples of output and highlighting to help weed through the output information and draw out the points.A good portion of the book relates to the Internet Service Providers use of the BGP protocol. I say about half the book covers ISP related material and the other half for the Enterprise Engineer that want to get a good handle on BGP and make it scale.This book is best suited for Intermediate to Expert Networking professionals. Because of it's heavy information on ISP related features, I'd say that Networking Professionals in the ISP space would get the most bang out of this book, not to count out the Enterprise folks though. This book has a wealth of information that can help the Enterprise professionals take a BGP implementation to the next level or perhaps fine tune the protocol to get maximum performance."},{"Title":"BGP Design and Implementation","review":"BGP Design and Implementation (ISBN: 1-58705-109-5, Cisco Press) is a must-have for anyone who works with BGP on a regular basis. Whereas other books explain BGP operation, this book goes to the next step in explaining design issues for both enterprise and service provider networks. This is an advanced book, and assumes a fundamental understanding of BGP operation. This is evidenced by the first chapter alone, titled Advanced BGP Introduction. If you are looking for a book that goes beyond explaining BGP routing and dives into the intricacies and real-world concerns of using BGP, then this is the book to buy.In the first part of the book, Randy Zhang (Ph.D., CCIE) and Micah Bartell (CCIE) offer general tips on tuning BGP performance and BGP policies, including how to determine memory requirements, convergence tuning, and queuing performance. Next, in part II, Zhang and Bartell explain design recommendations for BGP enterprise networks. There are plenty of configuration examples and diagrams to illustrate such advanced concepts as multihoming, route filtering, and load-balancing. As anyone who works with BGP in the enterprise knows, configuring load-balancing and route filtering can be a complex task; BGP Design and Implementation clarifies the issues and makes configuration easy. This section concludes with a relevant case study that, unlike most case studies on BGP that fall short of representing real networks, actually portrays situations that one may encounter in a live network. In part III, the authors address common issues in service provider networks. Specifically, route reflectors and confederations are compared in regards to their usage among service providers. These technologies are used to address scalability issues, a common concern for anyone who manages a large service provider network. Because of the varied migration methods in working with route reflectors and confederations, the authors provide four different case studies. As an added bonus, there is a case study in how to prevent denial-of-service attacks against service provider networks. With nine pages of configuration examples at the end of this chapter, this is the most detailed example of preventing DoS attacks that I have ever seen. In part IV, Zhang and Bartell detail the BGP multiprotocol extensions and how they are being used for MPLS VPNs, multicasting, and IPv6. In appendix A, MBGP extensions for CLNS is covered. Throughout the book are countless configuration examples to aid in understanding the advanced BGP topics.There are few books parallel to the detail provided in this book. Until now, network engineers in service provider and enterprise networks had to rely on experience alone to teach them how to properly deploy BGP. Now, Zhang and Bartell have condensed years of experience and expertise into a single source. Both Zhang and Bartell work for Cisco Systems; Zhang works with Cisco strategic service provider and enterprise customers, while Bartell is a member of the ISP Experts team. It is definitely written for an advanced audience who are already familiar with the workings of BGP, but for those who work with BGP on a regular basis, this is an invaluable resource."},{"Title":"BGP Design and Implementation","review":"I purchased this book both to supplant my knowledge of BGP and as a resource for my CCIE studies. I found the book to be of value more towards practical implementations of BGP. This book is geared toward a high-level architecture - not if only needing to design a 10 node BGP community. One down side is there are not that many configs. On the flip side, nearly every page either has a diagram or show output. One chapter of value is Chapter 8, which focuses on Route Reflection and Confederations. The book also makes good use of Regular Expressions (pg 110) and route conditions - something that is sorely missing in CiscoPress cannon. The last few chapters dive into support for multiprotocol extensions (MPLS VPNs and IPv6). While, upon reflection, I don't believe this book is a necessary tool for the CCIE, it is certainly a book worthy of it's title.I give this book 4 pings out of 5:!!!.!"},{"Title":"BGP Design and Implementation","review":"Definitely not a beginners book for BGP, if you want to learn BGP from the ground up, look toward Routing TCP/IP Volume II, then continue to this book. This book goes into great detail on how BGP works and how it configured to work better.A definite read for anyone pursuing CCIP or CCIE certification, or if you work with BGP and need to get a deeper knowledge of it's workings."},{"Title":"BGP Design and Implementation","review":"We can say that this book is quite old (2004) compared to all the recent documentation that you can find somewhere on the internet.With that being said, we can also say that BGP didnt really evolved since and I can assure you that this book is a must read to understand BGP.I guess you will need some fundamentals to start the book because you are directly jumping into the core of BGP (Advanced BGP introduction)You ll learn the different attributes of course (Simple review) and the way that the Control plane and Data planes are handled with BGP. Then the authors teach you how to improve the performance of this protocol. The approach is great because it cames with some nice example ! The case study are also very usefull !The Part II and III are focusing the way to design your BGP networks in both enterprise and ISP domain (The route reflector/Confederation part is so great for ISP guys but also for enterprise you that wanna dig deeperYou will find 4 cases studies into this part. I have never went that deep into my CCIE RS studies for sure !The book is ending with MP BGP (MPLS VPN,IPV6,Multicast part)it's missing some recent features of BGP like next hop tracking but this is just a very small part of BGP so it's not a big deal,Honestly this is the best book to read if you want some Advanced BGP understanding."},{"Title":"BGP Design and Implementation","review":"This is a great book on advanced BGP design and implementation. As another reviewer mentioned this is not an introductory text to BGP so make sure you read through Internet Routing Architectures or the BGP section of Routing TCP/IP vol. 2 prior to this book."},{"Title":"BGP Design and Implementation","review":"If you wanna be a master in BGP technology, this book should be a must. It explains in detailed the BGP technology and offers an advanced level."},{"Title":"BGP Design and Implementation","review":"I bought this book several years ago for my CCIE preparation but to be honest never went through it as the primary EGP resource. I in fact usually relied on TCP/IP vol.2 but certainly some chapters of this book is much better explained than any other Cisco BGP books. For instance if you'd like to learn about BGP inject-maps which less explored in other resources this item is a nice one! it basically walks you through the topic with a nice example (check the CCO for this!). The same comment applies to its peer grouping and mass configuration topics which are very well discussed but some other areas like regular expressions and advanced filtering would not be graded as \\"perfect\\"."},{"Title":"BGP Design and Implementation","review":"This book provides an excellent reference for understanding advanced BGP designs and implementations. It expands on the general BGP functionality and configuration covered in other BGP books like Internet Routing Architectures (ISBN: 157870233X). If you need a general BGP book or are just starting to learn BGP, start with Internet Routing Architectures to learn about BGP then use this book to understand how to use BGP.Advanced BGP design concepts are presented in a logical flow and practical design scenarios are included to help you understand how and why the concept is deployed. In addition to advanced BGP designs, topics covered are performance tuning, policy control, Enterprise and Service Provider design guidelines, MPLS VPN, Multicast and IPv6. These are topics not clearly discussed in Cisco documentation with this same emphasis on learning advanced BGP concepts. My only wish (not a complaint in any way) is that a chapter or appendix was included as a general BGP review for reference. Maybe in the 2nd edition as the book is updated? Kudos to the authors and Cisco Press for compiling this information in such a useful and readable book! Highly recommend!!"},{"Title":"BGP Design and Implementation","review":"BGP Design and Implementation (Zhang, Bartell Cisco Press, 2004, ISBN 1-58705-109-5) is a valuable addition to the literature on BGP. The book really shines by providing content that is not available in any other volume that I am aware of. This book provides an advanced look at BGP and is not for someone without prior knowledge of BGP. This book is aimed more at an engineer with a Service Provider, a large enterprise with a complex BGP network, or an individual pursuing the CCIE certification.The first section of the book provides a high level overview of BGP and then immediately delves into a good discussion of IOS Switching (though in my opinion the definitive work on this subject is the great Cisco Press book Inside Cisco IOS Software Architecture by Bollapragada, Murphy and White). A fairly detailed case study of BGP memory usage is then presented as well as some memory optimization techniques using peer groups. The next chapter provides an excellent collection of BGP performance tuning techniques specifically around optimizing the BGP convergence time. While a lot of this information can be gleaned from multiple documents on Cisco's web site, the book presents the information in a logical flow that greatly enhances the reader's overall comprehension. Chapter 4 discusses the various policy control methods available in BGP and provides the first of many case studies that discuss real world BGP scenarios. These case studies, which appear throughout the rest of the book, are especially valuable as they provide excellent guidance on topics such as merging AS's, deploying BGP core networks, deployment/migration of confederations and route reflectors, and Inter-AS VPNs with MPLS. I recommend having a copy of William Parkhurst's Cisco BGP-4 Command and Configuration Handbook (Cisco Press, 2001) around as you go through the case studies as the authors describe the concepts and then proceed to provide an example or case study without a lot of handholding on the IOS configuration, and Parkhurst's book can fill in some gaps.Part II of the book is focused on the needs of enterprise BGP networks. Much of this material is in Sam Halabi's Internet Routing Architectures book, though this volume provides a fresh look at enterprise issues such as multihoming, load balancing and inbound/outbound filtering, and the case studies are more complete than the content in Halabi's book. The book also provides some great information on alternative BGP architectures for really large enterprises which may be bumping up against the scalability limitations of their IGP's or have a need for multiple autonomous administrative domains within their networks.Part III covers Service Provider (SP) networks. I found this section especially valuable as most of the available books are written for enterprise network administrators so it is usually difficult for admins at service providers to get this material except from their peers, at ISPCon or Cisco Networkers. There is very in-depth coverage of Route Reflectors and Confederations, the relative merits of each, and deployment and migration case studies. These case studies should be very helpful for some preparing for the CCIE lab exam that can include some difficult scenarios on these topics. The chapter on SP architecture is a little light, but it does cover the major issues and provide some best practices for the SP network admin, but not really for the network architect.Part IV has chapters on BGP as it relates to MPLS VPN, Interdomain Multicast, and IPV6. This information is also not widely available without rooting through the RFCs and this book provides a good overview so that you can read (and understand) the RFCs.Overall, this book is an outstanding follow up book for someone learning BGP (after they first digest Halabi's classic!) and wanting to advance their knowledge, or a more experienced engineer who wants to broaden their understanding or learn one of the topics in Section 4. The authors write clearly, and I would seriously consider reading other books by these authors. Overall, I would give this book a 5 out of 5 score based on its overall quality and the lack of competition."},{"Title":"BGP Design and Implementation","review":"This book provides an excellent BGP resource! I have been working with BGP since 1999 and I haven't seen a book that gives you real world scenarios and examples like this one. This book is definitely a higher level text that will help tie all the components of BGP together. The case studies are great examples of how to migrate from different architectures and designs. Not many books have that included. Also the book has good coverage of mBGP, MPLS VPNs, IPv6 and Interdomain multicast. This book picks up where Internet Routing Architectures leaves off. In my opinion the IRA book should be considered a perquisite to this book, it isn't for the faint of heart. In my experience as a consultant, many network guys are afraid or don't really understand how to properly setup and maintain BGP. Now, the answers can be found in this book. In chapter 1 the book starts off with an introduction to advanced BGP. Chapter 2 gives you the information to size your Internet routers by breaking down the memory utilization of BGP and router functions as well as estimation formulas for determining memory needs. Chapter 3 on performance tuning is very useful if you already have a solid infrastructure and looking to tweak the environment for faster convergence and easy of support. One of the most important details, if not the most important detail, is the routing policy you apply to BGP updates both inbound and outbound. Chapter 4 covers BGP policies in detail including how to filter based on AS path, filtering on routing blocks, and community lists. The chapter also covers aggregation, QoS policy propagation, and filter order of operation, which is very critical when building a policy especially when multiple techniques such as filter lists and route-maps are used. The explanation of regular expressions is easy to understand even if you haven't dealt with them in UNIX or other operating systems. Chapters 5 and 6 discuss enterprise BGP core and Internet connectivity design. Chapters 7 and 8 have a lot of good meat in them on how to scale BGP for large and small environments. The chapters discuss how to effectively use route reflectors, Inter-AS scenarios, and confederations as well as filtering and path selection techniques of each. Chapter 9 discusses how to build a service provider core and customer BGP connectivity. This section is excellent on Service Provider networks, which is something most engineers don't get to see or have hands on experience. The last few chapters dive into very new and advanced BGP topics in an easy and simple manner, which will prepare you for the future. These final sections that discuss mBGP, MPLS VPNs, Interdomain Multicast and IPv6, which includes a lot of the newer technology service providers and large enterprises will be deploying in the near future. The sections focus on the BGP side of things, as it should, not the other technologies. If you haven't had real world BGP experience this book will help get you ready for a lot of routing and filtering issues. If you are experienced with BGP this book is a great refresher and teaches you how to scale and stabilize your routing tables."},{"Title":"BGP Design and Implementation","review":"This book starts by identifying key features and functionality in BGP. It then delves into the topics of performance tuning, routing policy development, and architectural scalability. It progresses by examining the challenges for both the service provider and enterprise customers, and provides practical guidelines and a design framework for each. BGP Design and Implementation finishes up by closely looking at the more recent extensions to BGP through Multi-Protocol BGP for MPLS-VPN, IP Multicast, IPv6, and CLNS."},{"Title":"The Magic Tree: A Tale from the Congo","review":"This was one of my favorite childhood books and I was delighted to find it on Amazon.

It also made it seem more like I was experiencing things as the characters did which also made me grow more &quot;attached&quot; to them.A truly great read - characters that you really get to know and care about.

Russell Smith's female characters are shallow plot decorations, but Roxane Ward's female and male characters are better balanced.Indigo, the main character, is the sort of person one wishes one had as a friend.It's nice to see a woman outdoing the men in writing a funny, urban novel for a change."},{"Title":"The Labyrinth in Culture and Society: Pathways to Wisdom","review":"I was pleased to discover this book was an easy read.

Full of very good references, and stangely enlightened insights. Two flaws however: often stays at the surface of an idea, sometimes gets a little carried away. That's why it's more of an introduction than a true reference book. My advice: read this book and then go to Grace Cathedral in San Fransisco walk the labyrinth."},{"Title":"The Labyrinth in Culture and Society: Pathways to Wisdom","review":"\\"As we are in the process of entering into the new age of rapid change and informational battlefield or what Jacques Attali dubs as the \\"virtual nomadism\\", there is an emergence of a dire need for a new type of thinking. The intellectual clique in the West is drifting away from the linear approach to the gradual acceptance of more convoluted modes of reasoning, coupled with the increased interest in a labyrinthine thinking and cognitive complexities. Who better than Dr. Attali can prepare us for the strange future that is lurking around the corner, to help us solidify the new realities on the firm basis of the ancient pathways to wisdom.The Western consumerist society for far too long has been based on the unsustainable premises of endless and overindulging consumption driven by the desire for instant gratification, which inadvertently overshadowed the infinite treasure hidden deep within ourselves. Those who dare to survive in the current social transformation must embrace certain ideals in the form of nonlinear thinking and multi-tasking intellectual initiatives.The Hollywood blockbuster movie Inception (2010) will serve as a visual aid in the author's hunt for the new spiritual meanings and intellectual techniques that will become useful in the journey to the center of many social labyrinths that we inhabit. The task can be achieved via understanding of ourselves. Inception shall be examined through the prism of Dr. Attali's intellectual brilliance on the topic of labyrinths and the concept of the new nomadic man, because that movie has all the earmarks of the classical labyrinthine structure, where the easiest and the shortest path is not always the correct one. Ultimately the meandering paths of the labyrinth can teach us about our inner beings and prepare us for a more nomadic and less sedentary world of tomorrow.\\" (Taken from: [...])"},{"Title":"Idora","review":"This giraffe is lonely, living in a Paris apartment that has just been sold to a developer.

Born a cripple, he could have been consigned to the rubbish heap but instead and against all odds became a celebrated writer of this Whitbread Book winner, &quot;The Banyan Tree&quot; as well as an early book of poems. Without taking anything away from Joseph Meehan (a self portrait of Nolan), he couldn't have overcome his debilitating handicaps to scale the heights he did without the steady support and tender loving care of his family. A father, mother and sister who are such warm and emotionally intelligent human beings anybody would be blessed and proud to have them as family. The school principals, teachers and fellow students who accepted him, nurtured him and gave him the chance to prove himself equal to the best among physically whole human specimens are themselves shining examples of humanity who deserve as much recognition in Nolan's lifestory. Although it has been compared with James Joyce's &quot;Portrait of an Artist as a Young Man&quot;, it is in reality nothing like it. Whereas Joyce's work is for the most part depressing and full of pain and harshness, Nolan's story is so morally uplifting you almost forget its grave subject matter. Nolan's dazzling and inventive writing style is also unique and something to relish. He coins and mints new words which have a yet found a conventional meaning but are so emotionally accurate you know they're right. Read this if you're feeling down and need something to restore your faith in mankind !"},{"Title":"Under the Eye of the Clock: The Life Story of Christopher Nolan","review":"As a college English and literature instructor, I intend to make this book a required reading if it becomes available in print again.

This was a book that I read and reviewed back in February, and ever since I have been mystified why the book never seemed to gain the wide acceptance of readers. All of the reviews that have been posted by readers for &quot;The Banyan Tree&quot; have been 5 star reviews, and the same is the case for &quot;Under The Eye Of The Clock&quot;.If you read you understand how difficult it is to write anything, much less a full book, and then have it selected for and win a prestigious award. In the case of the book I review now it was the 1987 Whitbred Award that was awarded to Mr. Nolan. All very impressive, but that's just the start.This is an autobiography written by a very young man who next wrote the book &quot;The Banyan Tree&quot; and would take 12 years to do so. This is a painfully candid, but uplifting book about a man with the support of a wonderful Family overcomes extreme realities that are his life to become an Author of international renown.Mr. Nolan cannot speak, he can barely move at all. He types with what he calls his &quot;Unicorn Stick&quot; that he wears on his head, and even then his head must be supported while he works.An Autobiography is a courageous work if honestly presented. When you add Mr. Nolan's additional challenges he faces as a writer, and as a person living with his physical issues it becomes an extraordinary autobiographical book.I hope more readers find Mr. Nolan, he is a unique writer of immense talent, and if you pass by his work you deprive yourself of great literature."},{"Title":"Under the Eye of the Clock: The Life Story of Christopher Nolan","review":"Under the Eye of the Clock is the autobiography of Christopher Nolan, the talented young poet with cerebral palsy. He can't walk or talk or write in the usual manner. Since Nolan lacks the use of his hands, this book like Dam-Burst of Dreams, the book of poems that preceded it, was written by means of a typing stick affixed to his head. The book succeeds both as pure artistry and as a window into the world of the disabled. Nolan has re-named himself Joseph Meehan and told his story entirely in the objectivity of the third person. This brilliant stroke allows him to avoid excessive self-pity while making his sufferings and triumphs real and deep. Nolan's use of language had earned him comparisons with James Joyce, Yeats, and Dylan Thomas. Nolan stretches the meanings and implications of words, rearranges their spelling, and even invents new ones to communicate his moods and perceptions and illuminate life, his own and those he observes, with his unique poet's sensibility."},{"Title":"Under the Eye of the Clock: The Life Story of Christopher Nolan","review":"This is a great book!!!

The optimal reader is probably a boy aged 8-13 who loves to explore the world from this perspective already. Older readers will enjoy the social commentary as well, but may not revel in the means of the commentary unless they like extensive references to bodily functions.The use of the humor in this book is like slapstick is to comedy, its most outrageous and least restrained form.No one can stay grumpy while reading this book. It may be the only literary solution for depression ever developed.Obviously, if you can read French, it is even better in the original.Many people will choose not to read this book because of the earthy nature of the language. That is probably a mistake, because those who make that choice are suffering from the unattractiveness stall, not seeing the swan in the ugly duckling. Earthy humor can be a great way to communicate, in the appropriate circumstances. You owe it to yourself to learn how a master, Rabelais, does it.As a tip to the reader who has more sensitive tastes, I suggest you skip through to the end of sections that are bothering you.

The Everyman's Library edition, which I just received, uses a late seventeenth-century English translation by Sir Thomas Urquhart and Pierre Le Motteux, not the recent Burton Raffel translation. (One might be led to assume that it reprints Raffel, given that the \\"Search Inside\\" feature on the Everyman's edition leads you to his translation in a Norton paperback edition.) One should approach the Urquhart/Le Motteux translation with some caution. Terence Cave points out in his (excellent) introduction to the edition that the translation is \\"extremely free\\" and expands the first three books by 50%, but at the same time he calls the translation \\"an extraordinary feat . . . a literary work in its own right.\\" My sense after reading the first book is that he's right--the language has a lively and strange effect--but this is probably not the ideal introduction to Rabelais. There are no editor's notes. Moreover, the snippets of Latin, Greek, and other languages which riddle the text are left untranslated. Perhaps the phrase \\"charitatis nos faciemus bonum cherubin; ego occidit unum porcum, et ego habet bonum vino\\" gives you no problems, but if it does, I would recommend a different translation, like Donald Frame's, which Cave specifically recommends in the bibliographical note in his introduction.I don't want to make this review too long, but it might be useful to see brief excerpts from the Urquhart/Le Motteux, Donald Frame, and Burton Raffel translations for you to judge for yourself which one you would enjoy spending time with. (I don't have the Cohen translation published by Penguin). Here's the description of Gargantua's conception at the opening of Book 1, chapter 3, as rendered by Urquhart/Le Motteux (remember, late seventeenth-century English):\\"GRANDGOUSIER was a good fellow in his time, and notable jester; he loved to drink neat, as much as any man that then was in the world, and would willingly eate salt meat: to this intent he was ordinarily well furnished with gammons of Bacon, both of Westphalia, Mayence and Bayone; with store of dried Neats tongues, plenty of Links, Chitterlings and Puddings in their season; together with salt Beef and mustard, a good deale of hard rows of powdered mullet called Botargos, great provision of Sauciges, not of Bolonia (for he feared the Lombard boccone) but of Bigorre, Longaulnauy, Brene, and Rouargue. In the vigor of his age he married Gargamelle, daughter to the King of the Parpaillons, a jolly pug, and well mouthed wench. These two did often times do the two backed beast together, joyfully rubbing & frotting their Bacon 'gainst one another, insofarre, that at last she became great with childe of a faire sonne, and went with him unto the eleventh month . . .\\"Donald Frame's version, in up-to-date English:\\"GRANDGOUSIER was a great joker in his time, loving to drink hearty as well as any man who was then in the world, and fond of eating salty. To this end, he ordinarily had on hand a good supply of Mainz and Bayonne hams, plenty of smoked ox tongues, an abundance of salted mullets, a provision of sausages (not those of Bologna, for he feared Lombard mouthfuls), but of Bigorre, of Longaulnay, of La Brenne, and of La Rouergue. In his prime, he married Gargamelle, daughter of the king of the Parpaillons, a good looking wench, and these two together often played the two-backed beast, so that she became pregnant with a handsome son and carried him until the eleventh month.\\"Here is the passage as it stands in the original 1534 edition of Gargantua (following the original orthography):\\"Grandgouzier estoit bon raillard en son temps, aymant a boyre net autant que home qui pour lors feust on monde, & mangeoyt volentiers sal&eacute;. A ceste fin avoit ordinairement bonne munition de jambons de Magence et de Baionne, force langues de beuf fumees, abondance de andouilles en la saison et beuf sal&eacute; a la moustarde. Renfort de boutargues, provision de saulcisses, non de Bouloigne (car il craignoit ly boucon&eacute; de Lombard) mais de bigorre, de Lonquaulnay, de la Brene, & de Rouargue. En son eage virile espousa Gargamelle fille du roy des Parpaillos, belle gouge & de bonne troigne et faisoient eulx deux souvent ensemble la beste a deux douz, joyesement se frotans leur lard, tant qu'elle engroissa dun beau filz, & le porta jusques a lunziesme mois.\\"Notice that that the ribald detail \\"joyesement se frotans leur lard,\\" rendered by Urquhart/Le Motteux as \\"joyfully rubbing & frotting their Bacon 'gainst one another,\\" is altogether missing in Frame's version. Perhaps Frame's version is too genteel in omitting this passage. It's not only a delightful example of what Bakhtin described as the \\"lower bodily stratum\\" in Rabelais, but it links Grangousier's culinary preferences that open the passage with the conception of Gargantua (who will turn out to be quite a glutton himself). With this in mind, consider Burton Raffel's translation:\\"In his time, Grandgousier was a fine tippler and a good friend, as fond of draining his glass as any man walking the earth, cheerfully tossing down salted tidbits to keep up his thirst. Which is why he usually kept a good supply of Mainz and Bayonne hams, plenty of smoked beef tongues, lots of whatever chitterlings were in season and beef pickled in mustard, reinforced by a special cavier from Provence, a good stock of sausages, not the ones from Bologna (because he was afraid of the poisons Italians often use for seasoning), but those from Bigorre and Longaulnay (near Saint-Malo), from Brenne and Rouergue. When he became a man, he married Gargamelle, daughter of the King of the Butterflies, a fine, serviceable female--with a good-looking face, too. And they whacked away at making the beast with two backs, happily whipping their lard together, so successfully that she conceived a handsome boy and carried him for eleven months.\\"Notice that in addition to preserving the bawdy language, Raffel resolves the name of Gargamelle's father, the king of the \\"Parpaillons,\\" to \\"Butterflies.\\" (In modern French, \\"papillons.\\")Hopefully these examples give you a sense of which translation you would most enjoy. I like the Urquhart/Le Motteux version but would have preferred editor's notes to explain unfamiliar terms and translations of at least the Latin and Greek citations. I think Frame or Raffel would likely be preferable for first-time readers of Rabelais."},{"Title":"The histories of Gargantua and Pantagruel (The 100 greatest books of all time)","review":"This review piggy-backs on to the review of \\"A Reader\\" from 2006, which usually (and appropriately) has the most \\"helpful\\" votes and winds up on top. No doubt A Reader's review is so helpful because it compares different translations of the same passage, thus giving us a flavor of each (and, thankfully for those of us who have a little French, provides the original as well). These comparisons are useful in helping us decide which version fits our preferences.My purpose is to add to his/her review by offering two other translations for comparison: that of J.M. Cohen, originally published by Penguin in 1955 and generally well-regarded, and that of Samuel Putnam, whose translation of Rabelais' complete works was first published in 1929 and was more recently published in abridged form in Viking's \\"Portabe Rabelais.\\" Both are out of print, but used copies of each are readily available through amazon's Marketplace vendors.Here's Cohen:\\"Grandgousier was a good jester in his time, with as great a love of tossing off a glass as any man then in the world. He had also quite a liking of salt meat. For this reason he generaly kept a good store of Mayence and Bayonne hams, plenty of smoked ox-tongues, an abundance of chitterlings in their season and beef pickled in mustard, a supply of botargos, and a provision of sausages; though not of Bologna sausages, for he feared Lombard concoctions -- but those from Bigorre, Longaulnay, La Brenne, and Le Rouergue. In the prime of his years he married Gargamelle, daughter of the king of the Butterflies, a fine, good-looking piece, and the pair of them often played the two-baked beast, joyfully rubbing their bacons together, to such effect that she became pregnant of a fine boy and carried him into the eleventh month.\\"Now, here's Putnam:\\"Grandgousier was a jolly good fellow in his day, liking to drink heartily as well as any man in the world at that time, and he was very fond of salty food. For this reason, he ordinarily had on hand a good supply of Mayence and Bayonne hams, a lot of smoked beef-tongues, an abundance of chitterlings in season and salt-beef with mustard, a store of fish-eggs, pressed and dried, and plenty of sausages -- not those of Bologna (for he was afraid of the Lombard poison) but those from Bigorre, from Longaulnay, from La Brenne and from Rouergue. When he was of manly age, he was married to Gargamelle, daughter of the Kind of the Butterflies, a pretty wench with a good mug on her. And these two played the beast-with-two-backs, rubbing their bacons together hilariously, and doing it so often that she became pregnant with a fine son and carried him up to the eleventh month.\\"While I have no doubt that Cohen strikes nearly an ideal balance between scholarly fastidiousness and readability, I marginally perfer Putnam. Notice that Putnam doesn't assume that English-speakers would know what \\"botargos\\" are and translates them as \\"fish eggs, pressed and dried\\" -- a nice touch. His use of words which English speakers associate with Shakespearian English, such as \\"wench\\" rather than Cohen's \\"piece\\", makes the text easily understandable while adding a period flavor. On the other hand, Putnan falls flat in his translation of \\"joyosement\\" (joyousement) as \\"hilariously\\" (I really do think \\"joyfully\\" fits the meaning better), and Cohen's more plain style may catch the crass aspects of the original a little better.Ultimately each translation will have its own flavor, and I would figure Rabelais to be a challenge to translate. One has to be able to switch from the bawdy to the erudite in a flash, to catch the parodies of style and somehow render them into their English equivalents. In general, I have found that the most literal translations have been the least compelling, and prefer those which catch the idiom and find its English equivalent. I find both Cohen and Putnam do that well, albeit from differing perspectives.Putnam's translation is only readily available in its abridged form, but if you are starting out with Rabelais it may be a good beginning. Cohen's, the standard edition in many eyes for some time, is complete.Hopefully A Reader's review, and this coda to it, will aid you in your search."},{"Title":"The histories of Gargantua and Pantagruel (The 100 greatest books of all time)","review":"The title characters of this amazing classic are father and son, respectively. Gargantua is so huge that men climbing into his mouth got stuck in the crevices of his teeth as if they were food particles. Pantagruel, while being born, was so enormous that his unfortunate mother had to be ripped open to accomodate his exit from her womb._Gargantua and Pantagruel_ has lots of screamingly funny toilet humor, so much so, that occasionally I had to prevent myself from falling off my seat with laughter. Yet, there is really nothing pornographic about this book. There is absolutely no graphic sexual activity. Rabelais often quotes Greek, Roman, and French philosophers and intellectuals while recounting his tales. Rabelais also effectively satirizes political leaders, judges, Churchmen, and taste-makers of his day.On his voyages to foreign lands, Pantagruel, takes along, among others, his closest friend, Panurge and Friar John. Seemingly a braggart, Panurge is really a man suffering from great insecurity and cowardness. He is as loveable as the Cowardly Lion in the Wizard of Oz. Panurge is also very introspective and learns quite a bit about himself by the conclusion of the book. The monk, Friar John, is, on the other hand, a brave and swashbuckling character, who would not hesitate to run a sword through a seeming enemy. Many of the surroundings and individuals on these uniquely strange places are so unusual and the situations so inventive that they boggle the mind.I read _Gargantua and Pantagruel_ in the Modern Library edition, which was fortunate, because some of the earlier translations used too formal English (lots of \\"thees\\" and \\"thous\\" and \\"haths).This is a book of great intelligence and thoughtfulness, which, as I noted at the beginning of this review, is also delightfully bawdy and imaginative. I only wish one of my high school English teachers had made _Gargantua and Pantagruel_ required reading."},{"Title":"The histories of Gargantua and Pantagruel (The 100 greatest books of all time)","review":"Raffel has done it: the best translation in English, bar none. Jaw-droppingly clever, frequently hilarious, this is the one to read and savor over every scatalogical, satirical line. Get introduced to the great-godfather of the popular comic fantasy writer Terry Pratchett, today! Drags a bit in the second half, but doesn't everything/everybody? And read Raffel's DON QUIXOTE while you're at it."},{"Title":"The histories of Gargantua and Pantagruel (The 100 greatest books of all time)","review":"The positives about this edition of Rabelais' five book epic are: 1) the full inclusion of all chapters in all the books 2) a very readable text by Burton Raffael. The negatives for me were the lack of notes (though somewhat a formidable task considering the bulk of the text presented) and the occasional anachronism in his choice of translated names. Pretty minor - I still prefer Putnam's translation in the hard to find \\"Portable Rabelais,\\" but this edition offers a full exposure to all the books in a lively language that preserves the spirit and philosophical intent of Rabelais."},{"Title":"The histories of Gargantua and Pantagruel (The 100 greatest books of all time)","review":"Rabelais has a unique, pointed sense of humour that is still funny centuries after it was written. I'll never think of cuckoldry in the same way after reading this classic."},{"Title":"The histories of Gargantua and Pantagruel (The 100 greatest books of all time)","review":"Monsieur Rabelais' wit, wisdom and sophistication are of the highest order. His faith in a certain type of physical and mental education gives us evidence of the basic goodness and perfectibility of man. There is no other novel that gave me so much mirth ,enlightenment, and seriousness about learning . With the development of &quot;bonhommie&quot;, the author says, one can attain well-being. &quot;DO AS THOU WILT because men that are free, of gentle birth, well bred and at home in civilized company possess a natural instinct that inclines them to virtue and saves them from vice. This instinct they name their honor.&quot; This is truly a world masterpiece. Merci beaucoup Mr. Rabelais!"},{"Title":"The histories of Gargantua and Pantagruel (The 100 greatest books of all time)","review":"This book is Rabelais at his best. Yes, the humor is at times crude and vulgar. Yes, the more delicate reader may find it disgusting and idiotic, but if this isn't one of the most clever books ever written, I'll be a monkey's uncle! Not unlike Robertson Davies, who mentions our potty-mouthed friend many times in his book &quot;The Rebel Angels&quot;, Rabelais takes bathroom humour to a level you probably never thought it could reach: high comedy. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"The histories of Gargantua and Pantagruel (The 100 greatest books of all time)","review":"The praisers of Rabelais and this particular product he created have already expressed a lot of the truths to be found here, the exquisite style, the masterly satire. All they say is true and would be reason enough to read Gargantuan and Pentagruel. I won't repeat those laurels to affirm them. Instead, I'll suggest another reason a segment of readers might find Rabelais interesting. Followers of the Thelemic 'traditon' created by Aleister Crowley during the early 1900s might be surprised to discover Crowley's claims to having channeled the doctrine from Horus in Cairo in 1910, were preceded by Rabelais several centuries earlier. Rabelais creats an imaginary monastary and sect of monks he names, &quot;Thelema&quot;, where a sign above the entry reads, &quot;DO AS YOU WILL&quot;. Sound familiar? Buy this book and read on. But if you do so as an admirer of Crowley's channeling be prepared to experience a deflating of some of your balloons and butchering of a sacred cow for the barbeque."},{"Title":"The histories of Gargantua and Pantagruel (The 100 greatest books of all time)","review":"Damned good and brilliantly innovative. No doubt of its influence on experimental writers from the 16th century onwards."},{"Title":"The Year's Best Science Fiction: Third Annual Collection","review":"Dozois's third Bluejay annual (1986, for 1985 work) follows the same format as his second. You can read no other sf-related book in a given year and still have a very good idea of what is happening in the current sf scene. Dozois believes that short fiction is the heart of the genre; it takes as much originality to execute an effective story as it does a genre novel, which generally spins out an equivalent concept at greater length. Moreover, the concentation of the short form forces writers into a concise presentation of their material. In an age of elephantine media-based novel series, that's a pleasure. This anthology picks up 24 stories, several of them long. I most liked Karen Joy Fowler's &quot;The Lake Was Full of Artificial Things,&quot; a haunting meditation on Vietnam in which a woman interacts with a virtual version of a man she knew who died in the war. Another very good story included here, which won an award, is Frederik Pohl's &quot;Fermi and Frost,&quot; a less satiric than usual portrait of surviving beyond armageddon. Additional stories I liked here include Robert Silverberg's long &quot;Sailing to Byzantium,&quot; another award-winner in which Byzantium turns out not what it seems to be; Kim Stanley Robinson's &quot;Green Mars,&quot; which became the basis for his Mars trilogy; S. C. Sykes's &quot;Rockabye Baby,&quot; a moving story about a severely injured man who enters an experimental program to regenerate his body; and Lucius Shepard's &quot;A Spanish Lesson,&quot; a picaresque mood piece about an expatriate American in Europe who finally confronts his own shallowness. Two other award winners reprinted are Nancy Springer's &quot;Out of All Them Bright Stars&quot; and James Blaylock's &quot;Paper Dragons.&quot; One of the tensions in genre fiction of this period was the conflict between the cyberpunkers and the rest of the writers. Robinson was accused of being a fuddy-duddy for not joining the punker bandwagon. I think he had the last laugh."},{"Title":"The Year's Best Science Fiction: Third Annual Collection","review":"For this third annual collection of best SF stories, Gardner Dozois selected a great number of real jewels. After a very complete analysis of what happened in the SF field in 1985, we can enjoy nineteen exellent short stories - and there are only two (\\"Snow\\", \\"Roadside rescue\\") which I personally consider as average and only three (\\"The lake was full of artificial things\\", \\"Out of all them bright stars\\" and \\"The war at home\\") which to my personal taste were rather weak. At the end as usual there is a (quite long) list of \\"Honorable mentions\\" - short stories considered by the editor as good, but which for lack of place (and it is already a huge book) couldn't be included. Below you will find my impressions about all the stories, with LIMITED SPOILERS.-----------\\"The jaguar hunter\\" by Lucius Shepard - this is a very very well written and very high quality story, which actually reminded me more of the Latin American \\"magic realism\\" of Gabriel Garcia Marquez than of the \\"classical\\" science-fiction. I usually do not enjoy this style (I never could finish any of Marquez books) but \\"The jaguar hunter\\" is really a PLEASURE to read. I found however the main topic rather immoral and sad, as this story is mostly about a middle-aged man drifting away from his wife, who was once a beauty, but aged badly, used by the life of hard labour and struggle with poverty. Now that their children grew up and left the home, the man starts looking for a fresher female body and as usual finds all the rational, ideological, philosophical and ethical reasons and excuses to abandon the woman who stood by him for the last 25 years or so...\\"Dogfight\\" by Michael Swanwick and William Gibson - this is an excellent \\"cyberpunk\\" (high technology, low-lifes) story, once again very well written, which is not surprising, considering that it is the result of co-operation of authors of respectively \\"Iron Dragon's daughter\\" and \\"Neuromancer\\". There are many lessons to draw from this story, but one of the most powerful is that no matter the times and the kind of society, college girls should not frequent the scum of the Earth, no matter how angry they are at their daddy...\\"Fermi and frost\\" by Frederik Pohl - this Hugo Award 1986 winning story is again very well written, which is only normal considering that F. Pohl was already then one of the most prestigious veterans of science-fiction (and as of January 2012, he is still alive and at 92 he keeps writing!); the story is about the nuclear holocaust of World War III and what follows later - a quite typical obsession of many SF writers before Soviet Union collapsed in 1991; it is a very interesting thing mostly for younger readers, because it helps to understand how terribly many people were scared of nuclear weapons during Cold War - and ultimately how deeply unfounded were their fears...\\"Green days in Brunei\\" by Bruce Sterling - a very well written, very interesting and ultimately very funny story, happening in a future emirate of Brunei once the oil and gas were all extracted and after a mostly low technology, zero growth model of society was adopted; the story is shown from the perspective of a Canadian-Chinese informatician who is supposed to fix one of the few industrial plants tolerated by the sultan's governement; I enjoyed it greatly!\\"Snow\\" by John Crowley - the renowned author of \\"Little, Big\\" offers here a short and rather sad story of loss, grief and memory; it is not bad, but definitely not his best and certainly below the top quality of the four previous ones\\"The fringe\\" by Orson Scott Card - the author of \\"Ender's Game\\" offers here an excellent story about a heavily handicapped but brilliant scientist (in my modest opinion probably inspired to author by Stephen Hawking) who decides to work for a time as a high school teacher in a remote farm \\"border\\" community, where people labour heavily to recultivate the fertile farmlands poisoned and sterilized long time ago by some horrible cataclysm; his opposition to local corruption will lead to a dramatic confrontation and a tragedy... It is a very good story.\\"The lake was full of artificial things\\" by Karen Joy Fowler - this is one of the shortest and also the weakest stories in the collection; it is somehow linked to the Vietnam War, but I must admit that I couldn't really understand what this story was about and I didn't get the conclusion either; may be you will have more luck with it...\\"Sailing to Byzantium\\" by Robert Silverberg - it is always a pleasure to read texts of this veteran writer; this quite long Nebula Award 1986 winning story is a very good one indeed; it happens in an incredibly decadent and slightly disgusting world of distant future, in which a XXth century time traveler tries to find his place; I must say that I found most of the inhabitants of this \\"Brave New World\\" rather despicable and I would not feel a little bit sorry, if they were one day eliminated by their slaves, robotic and others... But once again, the story is very good.\\"Solstice\\" by James Patrick Kelly - a very interesting and very well written story about a future society in which all kind of mind affecting drugs and hallucinogenics substances are not only legal but even considered as part of every day life; in this society a man living alone can order an artificially conceived child and raise him/her all by himself and nobody finds a problem in parents giving children drugs already in their pre-teen years... I absolutely hated the picture of this future society, but I must admit that the story is really very good.\\"Duke Pasquale's ring\\" by Avram Davidson (sadly, deceased only three years later) - this is a fantasy rather than a science-fiction story, but I am absolutely NOT complaining, as it is a wondeful read; it occurs in a kind of alternate history Balkanic Empire, placed in the alternate XIX century between Austria-Hungary and Ottoman Turkey; the main hero of the story is a distinguished scholar and adventurer, Doctor Englebert Esterhazy and his adversary is a particularly nasty, clever, powerful and ambitious warlock; Avram Davidson wrote more adventures of Dr Esterhazy and after discovering this character in this story I will certainly read the others too. Top quality writing and a wonderful sense of humour!\\"More than the sum of his parts\\" by Joe Haldeman - the author of \\"Forever War\\" offers here a very clever and twisted story about a horribly mutilated man who receives experimental new prosthesis and as a result turns into... well, I guess you will have to discover it by yourself. Let's just say, that it is not a wise thing to give to a frustrated and not very brilliant looser too much power...\\"Out of all them bright stars\\" by Nancy Kress - for my personal taste this is another rather weak story, but good news is that it is only six pages long; the topic is xenophobia against aliens; it ends without any kind of conclusion and really should not figure in this collection.\\"Side effects\\" by Walter Jon Williams - this is in my modest opinion the SECOND BEST story in this collection; on the surface of things the story is a kind of social criticism of current (for 1985) American health system and it is in itself excellent - but just before the end you will discover what EXACTLY this story is about and you WILL be shocked, disgusted and terrified, because this kind of thing could actually already have happened...\\"The only neat thing to do\\" by James Tiptree Jr. - for me this is THE BEST story in this collection - and this is a high praise coming from me, for the reasons which I will immediately state. As you may be know already, James Tiptree Jr was the pseudonyme of Dr. Alice B. Sheldon, a psychologist, a former major in US Army, a former CIA analyst and also a very gifted science-fiction writer who for a long time dissimulated her true identity and even her gender to the general public, writing under numerous pen names.Doctor Sheldon suffered during most of her life of depression and attempted many times to kill herself - and she ultimately succeded in 1987, at the age of 71, after killing her grievously ill 84 years old husband. This lifelong history of depression influenced her writing and most of her stories are very dark, pessimistic and even - in my opinion - nihilistic. I always appreciated her writing but the omnipresence of darkness and hopelessness also made the lecture of her works a very depressing experience.However in this most excellent story, which was also to be one of her last, this feeling of absence of hope and lack of sense in life is totally absent and although it still is a very dramatic and dark tale, the ending is glorious and majestic. Also the heroin, Coati Cass, is one of the bravest and most touching characters I ever found in all SF books. To my personal taste this is Alice Sheldon's best story ever - and in a sense also a premonition of what she feared (hoped?) would happen to her soon...\\"Dinner in Audoghast\\" by Bruce Sterling - a very clever, very funny and sadistically twisted story about a man who lives in a Saharan town in XI century AD and who REALLY can foresee the future... A little jewel with a punch line so delightful that I really advise you against eating or drinking when reading the last page - it could be life threatening. I foresee it!\\"Under siege\\" by George R.R. Martin - another great name, another GREAT story. The author of \\"Game of Thrones\\" tells here the story about an attempt of fixing the history made by the last surviving humans, after our civilization was destroyed by (what else? sigh...) nuclear war between USA and USSR. A very unhappy handicapped mutant able to connect himself to some people in the past is possibly the very last chance of humanity to change history and prevent the total destruction of our species. There are a thousand things that could go wrong - and then there is always this one thousand and one, unseen and unexpected...\\"Flying saucer rock & roll\\" by Howard Waldrop - a very funny and very well written short story about a quite unique singing contest in a New York ghetto in the 60s, with a special appearance of UFO...\\"A Spanish lesson\\" by Lucius Shepard - this rather long but very good story also is on the border of \\"magic realism\\" mainstream literature but with much more elements of SF than in \\"The jaguar hunter\\". Very well written and very interesting, it includes also a very short but very intense glimpse into an alternate world so evil and dark, that even me, after more than 30 years of reading of SF, fantasy and horror, I felt a cold chill in the spine... A very good and very powerful story.\\"Roadside rescue\\" by Pat Cadigan - basically this is a story about a rape and it is as much porn as SF - but it is also true, that in this story the sexuality of a race of aliens very different from humans is particularly well described; ultimately it is not bad, but still a little bit gross...\\"Paper dragons\\" by James P. Blaylock - a very poetic fantasy story in which ultimately not so much happens but which is still a very good read, because of the unique style and sense of humour; a rather peculiar, even a little weird thing but with considerable charm too.\\"Magazine section\\" by R.A. Lafferty - a humoristic tale about a \\"journalist hobo\\" roaming the country and selling \\"incredible but absolutely true\\" stories, when trying to stay ahead the lawyers hired by his three (definitely not former) wives...\\"The war at home\\" by Lewis Shiner - the shortest and also the WORST story in the collection; I absolutely couldn't understand what it is about; also, although only two pages long it managed to bore me nevertheless; my advice - skip it and go to the next one, which is excellent\\"Rockabye Baby\\" by S. C. Sykes - that is a VERY good story about a quadriplegic man, wrotten by a very elusive but clearly very gifted female writer (no way to find her biography anywhere - it just seems that her first name could be Sandy or Sandra); this is one of the deepest and more troubling things in this whole collection and it made me think about... well, the topic, late in the night. Very impressive and very well written.\\"Green Mars\\" by Kim Stanley Robinson - just to be clear - this novella is NOT part of the later published novel \\"Green Mars\\", by the same author; other than the title the novella and the novel are connected by the same place of action (Mars after terraforming), but that is all; I believe however that this story was the departure point for Kim Stanley Robinson's work on his opus magnum, the Martian Trilogy (Red Mars, Green Mars, Blue Mars). In this EXCELLENT story a team of future alpinists tries to escalate the highest wall of the Olympus Mons, which is itself the highest mountain in the Solar system. This novella is quite long but frankly I didnt't even notice it - I was immediately taken by the magic of the story and remained under the spell until the end, even though I am not really a big fan of climbing stories (suffering from critical vertigo already on the fifth floor, I never could see any charm in high mountain climbing). This is the THIRD BEST story in the collection and a very pleasant closure for this really excellent book.----Conclusion: A most excellent collection, to buy, read, keep and pass to your children. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"The Year's Best Science Fiction: Third Annual Collection","review":"This is the third volume in Gardner Dozois's Year's Best Science Fiction series. Readers and libraries alike realized he was destined to require some serious shelf space. It begins with the by-now-expected summation of significant developments in SF during the previous year (1985). Each of the 24 stories is introduced with a concise description of its place among the author's other works.Five of the stories that I really liked:Michael Swanwick and William Gibson come together to create \\"Dogfight.\\" Deke is an up-and-coming competitor in flying virtual biplanes to win cash and a reputation. He starts with nothing and would give anything to out-fly the reigning champion.John Crowley's \\"Snow\\" introduces a new, high-tech method of remembering a loved one after they die. It has its complications, both technical and emotional.Robert Silverberg's \\"Sailing to Byzantium\\" introduces us to a man from the 1980s who must cope with society tens of thousands of years in the future. We learn this new world along with him as he slowly discovers who and what is real. And what can be done about it.Pat Cadigan's \\"Roadside Rescue\\" is a brief tale about a man whose car breaks down and is repaired through the generosity of an alien visitor. Perhaps generosity isn't quite the right word...S. C. Sykes' \\"Rockabye Baby\\" follows the post-accident recovery of a man who is mostly paralyzed. We learn about his life \\"Before\\" and what he must and chooses to give up. This is an emotion-driven story in which many characters struggle not to show their feelings. It is not for faint hearts or dry eyes.This is another very good collection and is highly recommended. It maintains the high quality of the first two volumes in the series. Get it, read it, enjoy it!"},{"Title":"The Year's Best Science Fiction: Third Annual Collection","review":"The earliest of these that I have come across. In fact, it would seen you could just about get secondhand every volume of this series for the price of the first two, with bonus books if you were in the USA.Pretty much right on the standard, two, at a 3.77 average. Although some will be annoyed by the multiple instances of the dirty fantasy story low-blows thrown in, one of them even a World Fantasy short story award winner, apparently. Balanced by nothing disliked particularly, and a really cool Tiptree story.This one is a secondhand book, and the story Green Mars provided a surprised - having read that elsewhere I had never bothered to look at the one in here, but it appears that it just may be autographed at the beginning by Kim Stanley Robinson himself! Very cool find if it is.An interesting contrast is the length of the editor's summary, now roughly a novella, this one is only around 10 pages, or a short short story, and only a few pages of standard type story recommendations.Perhaps this is a factor of more stuff out there, as the summary mentions around 1300 sf-type books published per year, and it may be closing on double that now I think I read.Year's Best Science Fiction 03 : The Jaguar Hunter - Lucius ShepardYear's Best Science Fiction 03 : Dogfight - Michael Swanwick and William GibsonYear's Best Science Fiction 03 : Fermi and Frost - Frederik PohlYear's Best Science Fiction 03 : Green Days in Brunei - Bruce SterlingYear's Best Science Fiction 03 : Snow - John CrowleyYear's Best Science Fiction 03 : The Fringe - Orson Scott CardYear's Best Science Fiction 03 : The Lake Was Full Of Artificial Things - Karen Joy FowlerYear's Best Science Fiction 03 : Sailing to Byzantium - Robert SilverbergYear's Best Science Fiction 03 : Solstice - James Patrick KellyYear's Best Science Fiction 03 : Duke Pasquale's Ring - Avram DavidsonYear's Best Science Fiction 03 : More Than The Sum Of His Parts - Joe HaldemanYear's Best Science Fiction 03 : Out Of All Them Bright Stars - Nancy KressYear's Best Science Fiction 03 : Side Effects - Walter Jon WilliamsYear's Best Science Fiction 03 : The Only Neat Thing To Do - James Tiptree Jr.Year's Best Science Fiction 03 : Dinner in Audoghast - Bruce SterlingYear's Best Science Fiction 03 : Under Siege - George R R MartinYear's Best Science Fiction 03 : Flying Saucer Rock & Roll - Howard WaldropYear's Best Science Fiction 03 : A Spanish Lesson - Lucius ShepardYear's Best Science Fiction 03 : Roadside Rescue - Pat CadiganYear's Best Science Fiction 03 : Paper Dragons - James P.

The strange sympathy which overflows in Lawrence makes him unique as a poet.Joyce Carol Oates in a long instructive critical essay on Lawrence explains part of his poetic practice this way.\\"Lawrence's poems are blunt, exasperating, imposing upon us his strangely hectic, strangely delicate music, in fragments, in tantalizing broken-off parts of a whole too vast to be envisioned--and then withdrawing again. They are meant to be spontaneous works, spontaneously experienced; they are not meant to give us the sense of grandeur or permanence that other poems attempt, the fallacious sense of immortality that is an extension of the poet's ego. Yet they achieve a kind of immortality precisely in this: that they transcend the temporal, the intellectual. They are ways of experiencing the ineffable \\"still point\\" that Eliot could approach only through abstract language.\\"It is illuminating to read Lawrence's entire poetic work as a kind of journal, in which not only the finished poems themselves but variants and early drafts and uncollected poems constitute a strange unity--an autobiographical novel, perhaps--that begins with \\"The quick sparks . . .\\" and ends with \\"immortal bird.\\" This massive work is more powerful, more emotionally combative, than even the greatest of his novels. Between first and last line there is literally everything: beauty, waste, \\"flocculent ash,\\" the ego in a state of rapture and in a state of nausea, a diverse streaming of chaos and cunning.\\"Lawrence so restless so individual could not bear the constrictions of traditional poetic form, and he stretches the free verse technique of Whitman even further, bending its broken lines to the shape of his own soul.I think Oates has its right, and Lawrence is not properly read by reading a poem here and there, but only by immersing oneself in the total flow of his work.Again his soul and feeling and world are not mine but it is impossible not to feel the poetry interfused in almost all he writes."},{"Title":"The Complete Poems of D.

Air Monster, reviewed by me also on Amazon.com was one of them. This book, recently purchased at a reasonably low price, was another. Notwithstanding the usual juvenile adventure plot, the book has some very interesting speculations on the future of transportation and urban life envisaged for 1985 from the vantage of over a half-century earlier in the early 1930s. Reading this prophecy of how we'd all be living in ease and comfort, written from a time when air travel was in its infancy and the future promised so much that was exciting is a bit melancholy today. The plummeting global economy and the decline of the great technological giants has postponed any such wonderous existence envisioned during a time of the earlier Great Depression. The author was typically optimistic that technology would bring everyone out of the world market crash and into a new world of comfort and marvel. The science is well handled for a novel pitched at the pre-adolescent. Reading it in the doleful beginning of the 21st century when technological progress is hampered by financial decline is nostalgic. It's a nice backward glimpse into the dashed hopes of \\"what might have been\\"."},{"Title":"Tony Evans Speaks Out On Being Single and Satisfied (Tony Evans Speaks Out Booklet Series)","review":"Visit your local Christian bookstore, and you will be bombarded with an enormous amount of literature on how to maintain a godly marriage. There is a myriad of books out there on Christian parenting as well as encouragement for Christian couples and parents--books which provide wise counsel for the sometimes overwhelming complexities and frustrations in married life. And I'm glad these literary sources are available.But in all the hoopla over how tough married life is, most people tend to forget that single life is no walk in the park either. In fact, in this day and age, being a Christian single is very tough. This way of life is certainly not for wimps or the faint of heart. Christian singles today face constant adversity and judgementalism.These come from two sources. The first source is, of course, the secular world, particularly Western media. We live in a world which encourages and even stresses sexual and emotional romantic intimacy between the sexes without the need for the \\"outdated\\" and \\"archaic\\" institution of marriage.The other source, unfortunately, is the church itself. Most people in the church today believe in an academic sense that God has ordained some people for a life of marriage and others for a life of singleness. But that belief stops there, because it is not evident in their speech or interactions. Many in the church look down on singles. They like to quote Bible passages such this one from Genesis: \\"It is not good for man to be alone.\\" In doing so, however, they totally ignore the fact that God wanted a populated earth and this was impossible with one lone man. Such a belief also ignores the fact that Jesus Christ was single and so was the apostle Paul during his Christian ministry.I say all this because Dr. Tony Evans's book, BEING SINGLE AND SATISFIED, effectively addresses these concerns--or as effectively as any 55-page book could. (And because this little book is only 55 pages, even a slow, lazy reader like myself can easily get through it in one sitting.) Dr. Evans also does a wonderful job imploring the Christian single to not just sit idle waiting for Mr./Miss Right. Dr. Evans reminds us to approach single life with a Kingdom-oriented attitude. I was especially impressed in the way Dr. Evans stresses that the sovereignty of God is revealed by the Christian's marital status. In other words, I don't have to feel ashamed or embarrassed as if I'm single because I'm not good enough to have a wife. I'm single because God is sovereign, and He knows what He's doing.Probably the most impressive illustration in the book is that of Ruth and Naomi. When Naomi tried to get Ruth married off (and probably had the best of intentions at the time), Ruth decided instead of returning to Moab where she would be more likely to find a \\"suitable\\" husband, to go to Israel simply because she had become a believer in the God of Israel. She was willing to risk never marrying again (she was a widow) just to obey and follow God.I cannot recommend this book enough! I highly recommend it not only to singles but to married couples as well so that they will understand the kind of sovereign God we serve and how He sometimes works in the lives of His people."},{"Title":"Tony Evans Speaks Out On Being Single and Satisfied (Tony Evans Speaks Out Booklet Series)","review":"I first encountered Tony Evans when I was just a baby of a Christian. I attended a city-wide revival where he was one of two featured speakers. At the time, I was going through a \\"renewing the mind\\" period. I read a book by Charles Stanley that gave me the idea to commit to listening to God's word being preached every day (buying lots of sermon tapes and listening to lots of Christian radio), reading the word everyday, listening to only praise music, and no TV (except for a little news and CNN's crossfire). So at the revival, I went to Tony Evans resource table and bought a series of sermons on The Family. One of the messages in the series was about Joseph - how he was a successful single. This was my first introduction to Joseph, and I've loved him ever since.

I eventually had bad reactions to taking such high doses (headaches, terrible itching, dizziness) and had to stop. While their research is intriguing, they set their doses so ridiculously high that they come off as kooks. Twenty grams of vitamin C per day?? That's absurd and probably dangerous. I saw Durk and Sandy on a talk show years ago and Sandy had developed a serious speech impediment. I was never able to find out if it was due to the megadoses of supplements they were taking, and they have been curiously absent from the scene in recent years.

With this book and \\"How to tell what health foods to buy\\", you pretty much cover what you need to stay healthy and live longer!"},{"Title":"Life Extension: A Practical Scientific Approach","review":"Like most books, there are good and bad points to the book.GOOD POINTS: The book is well written. It is perhaps the best \\"alternative\\" or \\"health\\" book ever published from the 1980s. It was quite revolutionary and the authors admit that they were self-experimenting with their own bodies, in essence, using themselves as guinea pigs. They also brought the free radical theory of disease to the foreground, which is now known to play a role in conditions/diseases such as atherosclerosis and cancer. And they make a convincing case for using high dose vitamins and nutriceutical agents for disease prevention. Nonetheless, there are some negative things to point out.BAD POINTS: While much of their information appears to be based on scientific evidence, it is not always from the most reputable of sources. Some are from popular books or obscure authors. Much of their information is from secondary sources, such as Scientific American or similar publications, as opposed to primary journal articles. This does not mean the information is incorrect; however, the book states that the intended readership includes the health professional & researcher (as well as the educated lay public). A book intended for a professional audience should direct the reader to primary sources whenever possible so that any information can be checked against the referenced article in a reputable peer-reviewed journal. But this was not always the case. In fact, if the authors are referencing a non-primary source, it makes me wonder if they even read the original study from which their citation is based. And if they did, why didn't they cite the original study? In addition, footnotes are not used, but rather, references are presented in an appendix near the back of the book so it is sometimes difficult to know which book, magazine, or news article was being used to cite a particular study.But the biggest reason to give this book three stars is because it is terribly outdated. It is over 25 years old since its original publication. Since then many studies have been published on nutrition and nutritional supplements. There are now thousands of studies available, some good and some terrible. But it would be nice if Pearson/ Shaw could published an updated edition with a review and discussion of the more recent research that has come out.And I would like to know what they've concluded from their, now, three decades (or more) of experimentation with their bodies. Did most of their hypothesis pan-out? Or do they have novel (even contradictory) hypotheses to present? Surely they've got to have new information to report?"},{"Title":"Life Extension: A Practical Scientific Approach","review":"I read this book cover to cover maybe ten times.

Drinking clean water, eating fresh whole organic fruits and green leafy vegetables, allowing yourself as much rest and as much sleep as you need, regular exercise, and clearing up the loose ends in your financial and emotional life, will keep you lean, and clean every internal system, allowing to you fool mother nature into thinking you're still young well into your 80s, without worrying about which chemical is going to come back and get you.

The whole notion of \\"spectacle\\" as the dominant mode of capitalist/consumerist society is by no means original to Kellner. His analysis seems inspired in part by the philosophy of Guy Debord (Society of the Spectacle, 1967), and by the American historian/philosopher Daniel Boorstin, whose provocative 1961 book \\"The Image\\" is an earlier and more accessible exposition of the same ideas. Boorstin referred to \\"pseudo-events\\" and famously defined the celebrity as one who is \\"known for his well-knownness.\\"What is refreshing about Boorstin is his apolitical, objective, yet passionate analysis, which Debord vehemently rejects as apologetic and naive. Kellner, like Debord and his Frankfurt School predecessors, reads contemporary culture as the subjugation of the masses by a \\"culture industry\\"--an all-powerful imperious collusion of dominant media and the shadowy controllers of the means of production. He seems bent on placing blame for what he perceives as the excesses of consumerism. Boorstin, on the other hand, believes it far more productive to look within ourselves, rather than to blame a nefarious conspiracy: \\"Daring not to admit we may be our own deceivers, we anxiously seek someone to accuse of deceiving us.\\"Kellner does not disguise his political beliefs, referring repeatedly in this work to George H.W. Bush as \\"Bush Daddy,\\" to that president's agenda as \\"hardright and utterly corrupt,\\" to the \\"Bush-Cheney gang,\\" and proclaiming that the younger Bush \\"stole the presidency\\" (the topic of another recent Kellner book)..There is certainly nothing \\"wrong\\" with interpreting culture through a particular political perspective. Indeed Debord, Adorno and the others did the same, although with greater originality. I agree entirely with Kellner's assessments and characterizations of Bush p&egrave;re et fils, but wish he would focus more in this work on promoting an understanding of culture and communication than on advancing his own political agenda. After all, he describes his goal as to \\"teach students and citizens how to read their culture,\\" and that is a disingenuous characterization of his apparent intent. He seems rather more devoted to teaching WHAT to read in culture than HOW to make one's own informed analysis.Kellner has written or edited two dozen books and published more than two hundred articles on critical theory, culture, and society. Perhaps it would be difficult for one so prolific to avoid becoming self-referential, but the bibliography in \\"Media Spectacle\\" lists 18 of Kellner's own works and the text and notes refer to those works at least 98 times. By this time, he seems to be repeating himself.Indeed, the redundancies within this work itself are aggravating. Discussing a character in \\"The X-Files,\\" Kellner reports that, \\"Mulder typically takes charge, provides the explanations, and is more often than not proven correct.\\" And only two paragraphs later writes that \\"Mulder is the senior partner, who usually gives orders and who often-but not always-has the more correct analysis.\\" He reiterates several times and in great detail how Michael Jordan's image reflects US cultural values and mythology. He tells us repeatedly, with slight variations in vocabulary, that O.J. Simpson, \\" was a well known sports star and media figure.\\" This is a book in desperate need of a good editor.Finally, Kellner certainly makes the valid point that the public needs to be aware that corporations and individuals should be judged critically--and that they often manipulate public opinion and perceptions. His examples, though, are all so well known as to be trite. McDonald's serves fatty foods? Michael Jordan avoids politics? O.J. Simpson's trial was a circus? The X-Files is popular because people don't trust the government? George W. Bush stole the election? Kellner should either provide some new insight into these \\"spectacles\\" or tackle something a little more difficult--a set of phenomena about which we don't already have grave suspicions--and shed some light in those places where the motives behind spectacles still lurk in the darkness.In the end, the reader is left with important questions unanswered: What are the elements of spectacle? What has created a culture of spectacle? How and why does spectacle communicate to us? What messages do spectacles present? If the answers are here, they are buried under mounds of verbiage. And they were far more cogently addressed by Daniel Boorstin more than 40 years ago."},{"Title":"Wrought Ironwork: Forms, Production, Assembly","review":"This book gives the only practical how-to on traditional English gate building.

There's the backyard birder who enjoys feeding and otherwise attracting birds to his/her backyard. Then there's the lister, who keeps a list of species seen (whether in a time period such as a year or in a lifetime) and is always trying to see the next new bird. I feel that among listers there are several types, some who chase the rare (pronounced \\"lost\\") birds that blunder to a \\"migrant trap\\" near the birders' home, and others who'd rather travel to where the birds should be. This book is for the later group.There are quite a few bird finding books out there, many good but perhaps none of them perfect. Some of them give detailed lists of what can be seen at each location covered. This one does not. However, that's not necessarily a strong negative because some of the lists in the other books seem to list lots of rarities. If you follow the lists blindly, you may find yourself searching for rarities rather than what is common at that locale.This book is first and foremost a book for daydreaming. Sure, the advice is practical and you get a good idea of what to expect at each location. But the scope of the chapters range from specific sanctuaries to countries. You may end up getting practical advice about an outstanding sanctuary not terribly far from you and start day dreaming about a trip to Kenya \\"someday\\".If you are a bird watcher who likes to travel, you will probably enjoy this book very much. In fact, you don't need to be an expert birder to enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Traveling Birder: 20 Five-star Birding Vacations (Traveling Sportsman Series)","review":"How can a book about great birding spots not have a single mention of South America?"},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"This book gives a great look into what it takes to lead soldiers in war. As a soldier myself, I feel that it is essential for all officers and entertaining for all."},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"I am a baby-boomer who came of age in the Vietnam era, so my interest in things military is slight and my general opinion of military organization, I'm ashamed to say, came more from Catch-22 and MASH than reality. Yet, the U.S. Army has done some huge and useful things, so I was willing to take a fresh look with this book.I was moderating a conference of business owners recently as they lamented the poor work habits and other failings of &quot;Gen-Xers.&quot; Finally, I'd had enough so I said, &quot;Say what you will about body piercing and Starbucks, I don't think that's the key issue. It looks to me that our generation's contributions were the drug culture and Vietnam while the present generation has given us the Internet and Desert Storm.&quot; The question becomes, how did this happen? Into the Storm provides part of the answer.In the aftermath of Vietnam, &quot;the Army began a revolution in training and leader development that touched every aspect of the ! ! way the Army prepared for war.&quot; This revolution, covered mostly in Chapter 5 of the book, is an object lesson for corporations seeking to develop the most effective workforce. The two keys to the Army's new training methods were &quot;train as you fight&quot; and &quot;performance-oriented training.&quot;Train as you fight mean realistic combat practice with the same people, equipment, and terrain you expect to have in battle. When &quot;asked how his troop had been able to do so well in their first time in combat, he [Captain Sartiano] answered that this hadn't been their first time; he and others in his troop had been in combat before -- at the National Training Center.&quot;{p. 559} Seems obvious, but how much customer service training is just reading from a manual? Management training done with lectures and slides? Skills training done with photos and prose descriptions? Why hasn't industry begun to &quot;train as it works?&quot;The second pincer of the revol! ! ution is performance-oriented training. That simply means y! ou train until a standard of competence is met, not just until the training time is exhausted. If you don't meet the standard, you don't go on the line. Isn't most business training conducted with no measure of actual learning: no tests, no trials, no demonstrations? Few corporations have any idea of what they are getting for their training dollar. (Their unhappy customers do!)Another shift in the Army's leadership style with relevance to industry is the recognition of the central importance of human nature. My favorite example is General Franks's first criteria of leadership: &quot;mental courage (the courage to be who you really are.)&quot; Music to my ears, of course, as the founder of a company dedicated to making people successful by helping them be genuine: MayoGenuine.My second example is the wonderfully descriptive term &quot;friction.&quot; Friction is the tendency of orders and instructions to be altered, misdirected, and diffused as they are passed along an! ! d implemented by various layers of management and staff. The way to deal with friction, once you have done all you can with communication and monitoring, is to adapt. The key is to make your orders simpler, clearer and less ambiguous. Nimble as his forces were, General Franks knew that at a certain point he had to shut-up and let them go with the instructions they had. Better to go with an inferior plan well communicated and understood that a perfect plan poorly communicated. A lesson for &quot;micro-managers&quot; in every organization.Another capsule lesson for managers is the example of &quot;'terrain walks': Once every three months [the General] required all commanders and leaders to go out on the actual ground where they anticipated they would fight. There they would explain in detail to their next-higher commander just how they intended to conduct the fight.&quot; How many senior business managers would be willing to walk a mile with their frontline people, then def! ! end their strategies to a panel of more experienced manager! s? What kinds of changes to their strategies would ensue from such an exercise?Into the Storm is too long; it needed a ruthless editor. I admit to skipping pages of poorly presented, unnecessary detail on minute-by-minute battle operations. I must still recommend it to anyone willing to look at their own management through the lens of a potent organization which plays only for the highest stakes."},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"This tome should be credited to General Fred Franks with commentary by Tom Clancy. I found it difficult to distinguish who wrote what. And a credit it is to Fred Franks for a brilliant career of personal perserverance and an outstanding performance of service to his country. But to an average reader of history, the book would have benifitted form a glossary of military abbreviations. Frankly, I got lost and eventually gave up trying to keep up. It was written by a military man for the military. As the subtitle states &quot;A Study in Command&quot;. I'll think twice before spending money on a book with Mr. Clancy's name in the future."},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"This was a good book. It was a fancinating account of what a combat commander has to consider in all his deliberations while planning an attack or defense. The book follows Fred Frank's career from Vietnam, a VA hospital, to Desert Storm. It may bog down for some readers (like me at times) in the mechanics of tactics and strategy but it generally holds one's attention very well. One other point some may see as a detraction from the book is the Authors' tendancy to spend time rebutting what was written in General Scharzkopf's autobiography. The General was critical in some respects of General Frank's attack on the Republican Guard during Desert Storm. There is some obvious frayed feelings over this and it creeps into General Frank's writing. He makes a good case however. I would say it was well worth the price."},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"The first part of the book has interesting details about the Army's transition from the problems of the 1970's to the professional force of the 1990's. Once the focus turns to Desert Shield/Storm, the book moves at a slower pace; almost too slow.Gen Franks spends too much time giving us the minute details of his planning and execution steps. Although it gives the reader a good perspective of what a general's life was like in this type of operation, I often found myself getting lost in the details (and I was there!).This is not a Clancy-type book, as we have normally encountered in the past. Also, Gen Franks too often defends past criticisms from members of his chain-of-command (Gen Schwarzkopf, etc) that may have occurred during and after the operation.An OK book if you're interested in the Gulf War or the Army of the 1990's. Not a thriller."},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"While not the average &quot;Clancy&quot; novel, this novel is insightful and an informative read. General Franks is a bonafide hero and served his country with honor and courage. His story and the story of the VII Corps needed to be told. Americans need to remember the debt we owe to the men and women who risk their lives so we can continue to enjoy our freedoms."},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"If you are interested in what the awesome responsibilities of military comand are and what makes a great military commander, this book is a must. Granted, understanding the military's lanquage- such as acronyms, terms, and slang-helps when reading this book. I even found myself, a U.S. Army vet, skimming some portions. What struck me after reading the book however, is how it intimately llustrates Gen. Franks' thought process-how he overcame a severe leg wound in Vietnam, the lessons he learned there, his commitment to troops under his command, and more importantly, the mental abilty required to command 50,000 plus mult-national troops in combat. You come to realize just how awesome &quot;burden of command&quot; is. This book could also serve as a warning to our current civilian and military leadership-most notably our current commander-in-chief-as to the dire consequences of returning to a &quot;hollow&quot; Army and commtiting our troops to ill-defined missions abroad. After reading the book I felt tremendous respect for Gen. Franks-not only as a military commander-but as a human being as well. I am sure that he will go down in history as one of the unsung heroes of Desert Storm."},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"This book is an excellent read for anyone who is interested in the living, breathing organism that is the U.S. Army. Tom Clancy and Gen. Fred Franks do an excellent job of portraying the team work required for any successful military operation"},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"This book is a testament to the decades of hard work the U.S. Army had to undergo in order to improve or evolve from what was considered a state of chaos the Army was in from the outcome of Vietnam. There is only one man to provide the story for this and that is Retired General Frederick Franks. And there is only one man who can write it down in a clever, fact-finding, well written novel and that is Tom Clancy. This combination is what makes this book special. Franks says in his book that he became frustrated when the press would show the laser guided bombs on CNN and would leave out the combat aspect that he is writing about. Franks is leaving a message for all of us, I believe. We Americans sometimes take for granted the freedoms that we are so accustomed to such as the gasoline in your car. The book portrays the skill involved in a military that is sent to fight a war for our society, for our national interests. I highly recommend this book, because sometimes we civilians have to research in order to gain the real insight and truth of the Gulf War and not just from watching CNN. Frederick Franks is a true hero"},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"The book provides an important prospective of theworkings of the U. S. Army at war from theprospective of a senior Army General.The book does not try to present an objectiveanalysis but rather Gen.

The book is worthreading."},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"I have researched the Gulf War for several years and found this book to be one of the best to give an inside look into the corps command level. Clancy and Frank's book shows the campaign through the eyes of the VII Corps commander, which was in charge of the main effort during the Iraqi campaign. It contains facts and details that are unavailable elsewhere (at least not in non military sources). This book, together with Schwartzkopf's &quot;It Doesn't Take a Hero&quot;, Atkinson's &quot;Crusade&quot; and Gordon's &quot;The Generals'War&quot;, is a must for every Gulf War researcher."},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"Since this is one of the relatively few popularly-available, yet widely-distributed, histories of the Gulf War published to date, I approached this with certain mixed feelings. Tom Clancy's involvement was a plus and a minus - he is a moderatly capable writer (though his ability to craft character, vs. technology, is sub-optimal), but he has become something of a military-industrial complex on a small scale in and of himself, the McDonalds franchise of military fiction.Fred Franks was, at the time I bought the book, somewhat less well-known, but as a corps commander in an operation I wanted to understand much better than existing published material would allow, he was a more credible source.What results from this mix is an unexpected melange - mostly for the better (relative to, say, Clancy's take on potential Russian/Chinese conflict, which was abysmal), but with certain flaws. Franks certainly has the expertise, credibility, and transferable wisdom to lend some real substance to Clancy's usual wanna-be star-stricken jingoism. The background on Franks' experience as a junior, and then senior, officer in the Army during and after Vietnam also help provide valuable context to close the vast conceptual gulf between 1973 and 1991, socially, personally, and militarily.What is lacking is a coherent, detailed story of the overall Desert Storm (versus VII Corps-perceived) operation itself - a story that is implied, if not promised, by the book's title and stated premise. At times, the narrative loses focus and does not follow the overall action closely enough; at other times, it dives into tantalizing description of individual unit actions that are not fully placed in context or followed up; or divergences into Franks' personal thoughts and schedule, which (though interesting on the level of understanding the blow-by-blow experience of a large-unit commander) do not add much to the overall clarity of the action. Some points of leadership philosophy become repetitive - nor is it clear where the boundary between Franks' (Clancy's?) specific beliefs diverge from some assertion of universal concepts.At times, the narrative becomes a thinly-veiled personal defense against higher-level criticism of Franks' asserted failings in pursuing the Iraqis in the early stages of the ground action. Given the overwhelming victory achieved and the extremely lopsided casualty ratio, this seems unnecessary - since the internal discussion among theater- and corps-level command in the operation has been largely invisible to the public, it is difficult to assess to what extent the implicit back-and-forth indicated in this book is valid, but the results speak for themselves. Whether the Iraqi Army could have been defeated 207-0, instead of 200-0, seems irrelevant compared to the larger strategic question (still alive today) of whether or not Coalition forces should have gone after Saddam Hussein's regime at its root - a question that was answered at a much higher level than any to which Franks had access. As it is, the nitpicking and (apparently bitter) counter-criticisms that sortof-kindof surface in the book between Franks' VII Corps and CENTCOM (Schwartzkopf) appear to be more a reflection of the power ploys within US command structures than anything that will (ultimately) have any real meaning to anyone but the immediate participants. In real terms, they seem to have relevance primarily to the pros and cons of different styles of leadership and command, rather than to any real possibilities for different outcomes for Desert Storm - given the constraints operating at national command (rather than tactical or even theater) levels.Ultimately, this is an interesting primer in tactics for (patient and committed) lay readers, and a solid contribution to a future body of first-person perspectives on a critical event in late-20th-century history. However, it is neither objective enough, comprehensive enough, sufficiently researched, nor inclusive enough of Iraqi (or non-US Coalition) perspectives to constitute a major historical contribution to our understanding of this particular conflict."},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"Clancy really did an average job with this book. I have also read the other book in this new series he is putting out \\"Every Man A Tiger\\" and I have to say that Into the Storm is a second to it. I think that as this was his first attempt at this type of book, he used it as a learning tool and the second book got better. Then again maybe the co-author was just a better writer. Clancy has teamed up with the General that was in charge of the ground war in the Gulf War.The book is basically three parts, the first section talks about the Generals career in the Army, the Army's development from Viet Nam to the Gulf War and a touch of the politics involved within the different military branches. The second section of the book deals with the build up to the ground war. The final section deals with the ground war both the stand-alone part and as a joint effort with the air war.The author does not give you an action packed, inside the tank type of story. What we do get is the process for building up the forces, developing a plan, working with the other countries and military forces and finally the execution of the plan. I found the discussions of attack plan creation and the relationship between the air and ground element to be the most interesting. Overall this is a well-written and constructed book. It has a lot of value if you are interested in the Gulf War or just how current U.S. battles are planned and fought. A good compliment to this book is \\"The Commanders\\" by Woodward; it deals more with the U.S. politics involved in setting up the coalition and the interaction between the main U.S. players."},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"This book should be rated as one of the top three books dealing with OPERATION DESERT STORM. This is General Frederick Franks' story complete with inspiring leadership vignettes from Vietnam, the amputee ward in the (former) Valley Forge Army Hospital, to the pulverized dirt and sand of Southwest Asia. The cover of the book is somewhat misleading as Tom Clancy's name is in giant bold print larger than that of General Franks. From my reading of this fine reference the credits should be reversed with General Franks'name in the large print. Thankfully most of the book is General Franks' story, and a very detailed one at that, with scattered narrative interruptions by Clancy. Having personally served in the US VIIth Corps with the 1st Armored Division during DESERT STORM, General Franks' recounting of the corps' &quot;bigger picture&quot; and the decision process behind them enlightened me more about the drive into Iraq and Kuwait than I ever experienced at the maneuver Brigade level. I am well satisfied with the hard cover copy of this book and would recommend its purchase in hard or soft cover to any leader, military or business, or DESERT STORM historian."},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"With Into The Storm, Tom Clancy brings to the public a very necessary study of the unique qualities of Operation Desert Storm. As the First of an intended five books on the subject, Mr. Clancy decides on a successful format to tell the story of a war that surprised soldier and spectator alike.By discussing the military career of General Franks, and having the general contribute to the book, Tom Clancy provides an effective picture of how the events of the Gulf War unfolded. Some may criticize the inclusion of General Franks' military career as filler, but I see it as an insightful and key element if we are to fully understand what really happened. What makes the man does contribute to what made this war.I am a veteran of the Gulf War, and when I heard about this book being written I was truly excited. I saw a very small piece of what happened. I missed television coverage, the parades, and all of the speculation. With this book, I finally saw into the rationale of modern war craft from a commander's perspective. I knew what me and my unit was doing, and why, but not how we fit in to the larger plan. With this book I could see what I was missing at my level of operations.This book may never be required reading at the Army War College, but who knows, it just might. Tom Clancy has succeeded in providing a practical view of command which anyone can understand. given the unique nature of the Gulf War, this series of books promises to help explain why the war happened the way it did."},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"The book is very dense and poorly written. I expected a clearer narrative from Clancy. The book is repetitive and could be much tighter. Franks complains about being criticized for the tempo of his forces during the war. While he may have been wrongly criticized, it seems to be eating him up and the book reads like a 700 page justification of his decisions. I think it really detracts from what could have been an expert level description of the ground war. I appreciate that Franks is describing the war from his perspective, but I would have preferred less of his emotions and more matter of fact information about how the war progressed and the battles fought. He uses much more ink describing how the criticism of him was incorrect than he does describing his corps elimination of the Iraqi divisions."},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"First of all, you should know that the parts of this book written by Gen. Franks are not literary masterpieces. But then again Franks is not an author, he's a soldier.However, if you want to learn about the no BS day by day actions of VII Corps during the 4 day ground war... this is the book for you. I was a young Sergeant in 3rd Armored Division during Desert Storm and this book really brings back the images of the war better than any other book on the subject I've read (including \\"Crusade\\" and \\"It doesn't take a hero\\").The General has painstakingly written most of the essential information that one must read in order to know what happened during the famous \\"Hail Mary\\" (as Schwarzkopf likes to refer to it) from the point of view of the soldiers of VII corps.Gen. Franks is a gentleman soldier who, above all else, is a consummate professional. You won't get the theatrics that were included in Schwarzkopf's book... all you get is the down and dirty facts of what VII Corps went through.Apart from the info regarding Desert Storm, I also enjoyed the background information on Gen. Franks, his service in Vietnam and how he overcame a potential career killer (losing half of his leg to a grenade) and became a Lieutenant General in the U.S. Army (and a 4-Star before he retired).However, memoirs like this aren't really written for the public. Rather, their written for students of the event so they can learn from the past. And, for that, this book deserves a spot on any military enthusiasts book shelf.Oh, and Tom Clancy did a good job too!"},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"Into the Storm, written by bestselling author Tom Clancy and retired Army general Fred Franks, is the first book of a continuing series of non-fiction military history/memoirs highlighting modern-day commanders and their experiences in war and peace.Subtitled &quot;On the Ground in Iraq,&quot; Into the Storm examines the post-Vietnam War rebuilding of the United States Army from a demoralized mix of draftees and &quot;lifers&quot; to the smaller but professional fighting force that defeated Saddam Hussein's vaunted Iraqi legions in Kuwait during Gulf War I. Clancy and Gen. Franks examine the evolution of the Army's weapons and tactics from the mid-1960s to the 1990s and the change of focus from Cold War confrontation with the Soviet Union to the face-off with new enemies in distant battlefields far from the Central European plains.The book is also Frank's personal account of his service as an Army officer, starting as a young cavalry lieutenant stationed in the Fulda Gap in the early 1960s, his tour of duty in Southeast Asia -- where Franks lost a leg during the May 1970 invasion of Cambodia -- and his subsequent rise to general's stars and the command of the &quot;heavy&quot; VII Corps which was Desert Storm's armored &quot;fist&quot; during the now-famous 100-Hour ground war.Along the way, we learn about Fred Franks the man, a bright, intelligent and quiet man who loves his wife and family, yet is determined to stay as a serving officer despite the loss of his leg. He comes across as a gentleman-warrior and genuine hero, yet he seems to be in awe of the young soldiers who fought and died under his command in two wars.The book's narrative switches from Clancy's third-person analysis to Frank's first-person autobiographical account several times, which gives readers the best of both worlds. And although there is quite a bit of military jargon in the text, the authors explain and define the acronyms and terms for the reader. Also helpful are the many maps and graphics by Laura Alpher and many photographs from the authors' personal collections."},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"The book written by Tom Clancy with Fred Franks showed how we did the hail Mary end run led by Franks armored divisions. The story is full of lessons learned explaining what went right and what went wrong, and implies how we need to improve both technology and organization.Of interest was that our commanders lacked proper radio communications and were not in direct contact with each other. Also GPS devices did not automatically transmit locations of troops to commanders displays, our vehicles lacked IFF devices, and that mobile SCUDs were unable to be found or destroyed once fired.Smart weapons did not have a 100% success rate, their IQ was average, although videos made for good press. The fog of war descended on General Franks, and he lacked information necessary to maintain the pace of the attack demanded by General Schwartzkopf. Friction between the two commanders demonstrated the difference between emphasis on keeping up the pace to acheive suprise, and a need to avoid chaos resulting in &quot;friendly fire&quot; accidents.The book does not dwell on the real heros,our logistics people who acheived massive movement of men and material. Description of unit contact makes one realize the success of the Abrams M1A1 tank and the quality of training given the troops.In retrospect, this book enabled me to understand that even with satellite surveillence and the lack of cover and consealment, we could not find key targets, and could not destroy SCUD warheads. The end of the war was directed by political concerns, rather than military objectives (read A SOLDIER's DUTY), and we toatlly misapprehended the power base of Saddam Huesein.This book was informative and should be read with &quot;EVERY MAN A HERO&quot; by Clancy describing the air campaign of Desert Storm. The combination of these two works will better explain what happened, suggest the future direction of technology on the battlefield, and indicate that a lesser degree of success can be expected lacking the advantages of desert terrain, and an unwilling adversary.Jon Yerow Cincinnati"},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"Anyone who has undertaken the task of becomming a leader in the military has struggled with the same decisions Gen. Franks does in this book. The kicker is that the General is doing this in a combat situation, not in training as new leaders mostly do.This book is a good read for any leader. Especially if one's unit is Armor, Armored Cav, or a supporter of this type of unit."},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"I like Tom Clancy, really; but this book was so boring that I found myself constantly falling asleep while trying to read it. It's a good and informative story, but seriously needs an editor.This is the problem with Clancy's non-fiction work, in my opinion. Much too wordy, and not edited enough to seem as engaging as his original fiction. We've seen better books written in military and war time situations, but Clancy constantly gets sidetracked by the 'essay' approach to non-fiction."},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"Retired General Fred Franks has a lot of interesting and instructive stories to teach us. Sadly, the editing in this presentation seriously mars the overall work. The book does not feel like a single narrative whole, rather, a collection of individual essays which we not planned as a single work. For example, we are told that an armored division consumes 800,000 gallons of fuel a day, a pretty amazing fact. However, this exact statement is repeated at least five more times in different places throughout the book. We wonder if the authors don't trust us to remember information, or perhaps the authors trust each other too much, to the extent that they didn't review or edit the work of their counterparts. Other stories are repeated in the telling through the book. Perhaps most annoying is the relentless and heavy-handed foreshadowing of the downturn in the relationship between Gen. Franks and Gen. Schwarzkopf.The next book in the series, Every Man a Tiger, gets an index, but Into the Storm somehow does not. A bigger lack is the missing glossary, as the sea of acronyms are rarely expanded on first use, and even where they are, the definition is often lacking."},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"This book describes General Fred Franks' life and especially his experiences during Desert Storm, the war in 1991 in the Persian Gulf to kick Iraq out of Kuwait.To really like this book you need to be a bit of a military fanatic. Fred Franks repeats so many times how wonderful it is to be a soldier, and how great the \\"warrior ethos\\" is, that you realize that for him the military is practically a religion.The thing in this book that I found the most interesting are the descriptions of the magnitude of military might that was fielded during Desert Storm.The American Army VII Corps (commanded by Gen. Franks) included 146,000 soldiers, 50,000 vehicles (incl. 1,600 tanks) and 800 helicopters. Not only are these numbers huge, but the logistics involved are mind-boggling: the soldiers need food and water, and the vehicles and aircraft burned an incredible 3.2 million gallons of fuel each day. When fighting the VII Corps expended 2,500 tons of ammunition every day.And VII Corps was only part of the military forces involved. There was another Army corps, there were Marine units, there was the Air Force and the Navy, and forces from quite a few other countries. An amazing marshalling of military forces, and all under the command of General Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf (more about him later).I found the book interesting, but it does have a lot of problems. It's way too long, mostly due to repetitiveness. With some editing it could have been cut down by at least 30% with no loss of information.Another problem is that there are no useful maps. There are a lot of small maps, about 1/3 of a page each, but they simply don't show enough detail. Again and again you find the text referring to some town or road or river and they simply aren't on the maps.Another major problem is the lack of a glossary with definitions for all the military acronyms and abbreviations that are used.And then we have General Schwarzkopf, who is NOT thanked in the acknowledgements. Gen. Franks is very careful to thank everyone from his parents to his family to all of his subordinates, and then goes on to thank Colin Powell (then Chairman for the Joint Chiefs of Staff), Dick Cheney (then Sec. of Defense) and President George Bush Sr. But not Gen. Schwarzkopf.It turns out that Gen. Schwarzkopf wrote an autobiography, \\"It Doesn't Take a Hero\\", and in that book he criticized Gen. Franks for the way he commanded VII Corps during Desert Storm.Gen. Franks uses this book to return the favor. I won't go into extensive details (and Gen. Franks keeps his criticism fairly low-key), but Franks basically claims that Schwarzkopf liked having his butt kissed by his subordinates, was prone to throwing temper tantrums, wasn't competent to understand or command armored (tank) operations and made several tactical errors. In particular, not giving VII Corps more operational room to the north, not using the Air Force to prevent the Iraqi Republican Guards from escaping northwards and declaring \\"victory\\" a couple of days prematurely were big mistakes. The result was that Washington decreed a ceasefire and a large portion of the Republican Guards avoided destruction.I actually found this dispute between Franks and Schwarzkopf to be quite interesting, and it's so very human to want to get back at someone who's done you dirt. So whether Franks or Schwarzkopf is right, the dispute does add flavor to Franks' story.Rennie Petersen"},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"This book is interesting at points. The chapters regarding General Franks experiences in Viet Nam and his recovery from his wounds are very interesting. However, the book really drags, especially in the middle 250 pages.

I'm glad I did! Whittled done to what really matters, this book about the VII Corps actions in the Gulf War through the eyes of its commander, General Fred Franks, is an inciteful look at the modern U.S. Army. I was most interested in Frank's comments about his misunderstandings with General Schwartzkopf. With all of our advancements in communications, it's baffling to see how leaders and subordinates still mess up the chain of command!"},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"This book by Tom Clancy is great. It gives an in depth view into command, tactical and strategic. Yet it is very hard to read if you do not read it carefully.

From his earlier years as a junior officer, his tour to Vietnam, the accident and the hard way back. Finally you learn that all this knowledge and experience put together, makes an officer ready to face yet another battle. To lead the VII Armoured Corps in Desert Storm.

In this category, Winston Churchill, Bruce Catton and Shelby Foote come to mind immediately.

As a Persian Gulf veteran (who did not serve under GEN Franks, whose memoirs this book is), I have to say that it is the best book yet on Desert Storm.It is captivating, extremely readible, and, most importantly, exceptionally educational in several subjects, including: the recovery of the US Army following Vietnam, leadership, military art at the operational level, and the histroy of VII Corps in Desert Storm.Mandatory reading for military historians, anyone who wants to learn about the modern military profession, and prospective leaders"},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"There are a lot of books out there about leadership, but most of them are useless and stupid. This book, however, is extremely valuable as a tool to teach leadership. The book examines General Franks' life and command, and his theory of leadership.If all leaders operated as he did in the first Gulf War, then there would be far fewer problems. There is a lot of minutia and detail in this book as in all Clancy works and collaborations, but those details just go to show you how good leadership basics allow a person to lead even critical and complicated efforts.Scrap all those vapid management books that the worst managers read, and find out how a man with a proper understanding of leadership works."},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"Good read.

I will never again assume that the Tom Clancy name implies a good book!"},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"This is a fair account of the US VII Corps attack in Desert Storm. The book begins with a lot of garbage recollections about Vietnam and Franks career. The maps throughout are very poor, which is odd in an operational account. Then Clancy et al go through the whole resurrection of the US Army in the '70s and '80s. The description of the Desert Storm battles are interesting but confusing. Several items are apparent: (1) Franks is out to exonerate himself and criticize Schwarzkopf; (2) Franks is a very rigid, doctrinaire commander and (3) Franks is unwilling to offer a professional evaluation of his campaign or it's relationship to the greater whole. Franks does point out severe communication problems, terrain problems and the Iraqi Republican Guards fighting better than most accounts. Yet Franks never explains the crucial (and controversial) issue of why it took his units so long to advance and his references to boundary problems with XVIII Corps sound like weak excuses. This book did raise one question in my mind: why were we so interested in fighting the war so quickly? What difference did it make if we won in 4 days or 8 days? The vital question of who decided to end the war remains open; Franks blames Shwarzkopf's poor battle-tracking at CENTCOM. Only the last 100 pages are worth reading."},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"I was disappointed with this book. I have really enjoyed Clancy's other fact based books, but this one came up short. With Gen Fred Franks (an American Hero, no doubt, and not to be confused with Tommy Franks from a decade later) Tom Clancy wrote this detailled account of 7 Corps actions during the Gulf War in 1991.--The book is very long winded. It just doesn't get into the action, and approaches the story with a patronizingly long professorial on military thought that really amounts to little. He spends half the book describing how the US army got itself into trouble from Vietnam and an overfocus on the Cold War which did not address all the mission areas required. That background is important, but it is too long and too academic. Then he goes on to spend pages and pages and pages describing a 4 day drive across the desert, skipping several details -- such as the Air Campaign which made that possible. Make no mistake, the details are there and the story is interesting, but boy does it take a long time to come out. Also -- I am not belittling the valor of our forces then or now. Exciting as the brief ground campaign was in 1991, it pales beside the recent performance of 3 ID, 1 MEF and our Brit allies in Spring 2003. They went a lot further, with less forces and certainty, at a much more rapid pace. That story deserves a long treatment, and I am looking forward to some good books on it when the time comes.--Into the Storm is also very myopic. Gen Franks perspective is very limited to what his division was doing, and not the entire war. Perhaps without meaning to he neglects the contributions made by the other services and neighboring divisions. Having been thru some battles myself, I know that it is hard to make any sense out of battle. Information is always incomplete, and no one gets the whole picture. Unfortunately, Into the Storm is predictably parochial and blinded to what else is going on. Part of that comes from its focus on justifying the decisions made during the campaign, but of course, without the whole picture, it comes out pretty narrow.--The most distasteful element of the book was it's nagging tendendany to be at times accusatory, self justifying and bitter. Into The Storm does provide a solid, interesting personal story, but there is also a strong tone of self-righteousness and old fashioned CYA mixed in. Schwarzkpof had many complaints about Franks, and Franks is eager to answer up in this book. That's exactly what poisons the simple story of a four day desert drive, vicious and dangerous as it was. This book was pretty obviously written to explain &quot;Why and How&quot; Gen Franks made his decisions. Although that is interesting enough as a study in command and execution during war, the book's tone gets downright whiny. It has &quot;something to prove&quot;, and comes up short, especially as I read it last spring and then witnessed the two division sized elements tearing thru Iraq in 2003: a far greater campaign with more risk, less forces, and hopefully more permanent results. Also, compare this book to Every Man A Tiger, Lt Gen Horner's story of the Gulf War also written by Clancy, and you will notice right away the difference. Horner had nothing to prove, but just a grand story to tell of American Heroes (and allies/coalition partners) in battle in the desert in 1991. I am proud that the story has continued, and was not left with the bitter tone that comes from Into The Storm.------&gt; If you're wondering why I have this perspective, I will say that I am an Airman and believe that maneuver thru the skies and precision engagement -- coupled with all the force and support that airpower brings -- is the key to our victories since WWII. I read this book while I was stationed with the Army Command in Kuwait last Spring just prior to and during our team's rapid defeat of the entire Iraqi army, terrorists, and thugs from assorted countries. I also spent years patrolling the border of Iraq from the air, and am very gratified to see the end of that.

There is almost no coverage of anything that happened in that war save one general's point of view. He spends more time talking about his wife and family than he does giving a detailed comparison of the relative technical strengths of the tactics and weaponry of the two sides. This is partly because he prefers to chalk up the victory in a vague way to the virtue of the American fighting man and the American military establishment, rather than getting bogged down with little details like our tanks could shoot further than their tanks, our troops could see them when they couldn't see us.He talks lots and lots in high level terms about strategic manuever, which makes sense because that is the level that a Corps commander like himself operates at, but this in fact is very hard to follow because there are not adequate maps in the paperback to make sense of all this abstract hand-waving. There are no maps at all with the audio, which I read, and few with the paperback, I don't know about the hardcover.Since the book revolves around him personally and little else, we get precious little view of life at the bottom, of those actually doing the fighting. Indeed, the number one thing I was hoping to learn from the book, how on earth you cross a minefield under enemy fire, defeat that enemy, and blaze paths through it so you can move whole divisions through with SO FEW CASUALTIES went completely unanswered.No description of a battle is complete without a comprehensive rundown on the relative capabilities of the hardware involved, along with discussion of the tactics and intentions of both sides. Such discussion is woefully absent from this very long book.One point that General Franks did make (he wrote the book, Tom Clancy at most edited it) was that many pitched tank battles did occur, but since the military at the time was minimizing coverage of any form of death, real, imagined, or potential, all the public got to see was coverage of Iraqis surrendering in droves, so the public does not appreciate the determined resistance that was met in places, and the excellent fighting the military did. Well, my heart bleeds -- the military dug their own grave on that one, and it's up to them to climb out of it."},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"I bought the Chancy book based on his reputation for fast action and through plots. Well, I got some of that. Most of the book is not a techno thriller, but it's still a great read. Those looking for a fast action book along the lines of \\"The Hunt for Red October\\" will be definitely disappointed by this. What you find here is really three books in one. First, it's the story of the VII Corps in the Gulf War and how this man, LTG Fred Franks, commanded it. Second, it's semi-autobiographical of General Franks. Finally, it's a story of how the Army, in the years after the disaster of Vietnam, changed it doctrine, strategy, and it's entire culture to culminate into the force exhibited in 1991. For me, the development and tenants of AirLand Battle Doctrine are a bit ho-hum. I've been in the Army and Reserve for over ten years now. But the best part of this book is the detailed description of how great an effort it is to mobilize, deploy, supply, and command an army corps. Novices in the area will get a taste of the effort that goes into this endeavor. The planning factors for critical supplies (water, fuel, and ammo are of paramount importance) show why the rule of thumb is that for every man on the front lines, there are ten or so more men behind him. Overall, I'll give this effort an 8. General Franks does dwell on the dispute between himself and GEN Schwarzkopf on final battle of the ground war, and that is a dispute I believe will never be settled completely. But all in all, for a book that gives insight into a ground commander's eye view (I say that because the corps is the largest Army tactical formation), Into the Storm is well written and through."},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"I have read all of Clancy's books. He should be embarassed his name is one this one, his portion of this book is mediocre. Franks writing &quot;style&quot; if you can call it &quot;a style&quot; is not only boring but patently self serving. As a genuine war hero Franks should have used a first class writing assistant. This great battle in American War History deserves far better than this very poorly written and confusing book. Hopefully,someone of the caliber of Stephen Ambrose will give the men and women of Desert Storm what they deserve - An exhilerating fast paced action narrative history of the people, logistics and strategy of this great battle."},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"General Franks tends to spend too much time trying to vindicate himself from the criticizm he recieved during and following the War. For the most part the book deals with the Gulf War planning and operations conducted by General Franks and doesn't deal with the &quot;Big Picture&quot; of the War. The beginning of the book is basically a biography of General Franks. The work can be slow in some parts."},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"This is a book that is written with great care;both authors love the military service and are clearly proud of their relationship with the US Army(one formal and one informal).It is quite informative with substantial detail regarding the US Army in general and the movements of VII Corps during the four days of Desert Storm.The book is most interesting on a human level,as General Franks explains his reasoning in a number of decisions and relates the emotional impact of a variety of events.General Franks comes across as a dedicated professional who is worthy of the responsibility he had during Desert Storm.This book would be a challenge for anyone who has no past knowledge or experience with the US military.It has too much detail.Thus at times it can be more informative than entertaining.Apparently there are three more books to be written by Clancy in conjunction with other participants of Desert Storm.These books should not exceed 300 pages each,and,unless they are being written for military historians,the writers need to focus on human elements with a more generalized presentation of the events.The details should be saved for only the most readable and exciting circumstances."},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"I found the book to be very insightful and a useful tool to study command and leadership. I favor a more technical approach when describing the campaign, but found some of the references and military acronyms confusing. I love a good map and many are present. The major problem I found was that it needed more editing to remove repetitions and clean up the confusion about military terms that may not have been adequately explained. The book also needed an index and perhaps an appendix of military terms and acronyms. Clancy is an excellent writer and Franks is inspiring, but a bit more editorial revision would have made this a five star effort!"},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"I found the book to be a gripping truth of what actually happened, I'm not just talking about the sands of the Middle East, but what happened to get the VII Corps poised for battle. It gave the insight of what was required to keep the soldiers disciplined so that losses would be keep at a minimum and a victory would be swift and sure. As a Soldier who served under General Franks, I would go anywhere and do whatever was asked because of his focus on the objective yet his genuine concern for his troops. JAYHAWK!

If you think this book is an exciting, riveting Clancy story, think again. If you think this book will be an easy read, think again. It is none of the above, but, as the subtitle implies, this book is a study in command with the life of General Fred Franks and his combat experiences as the lens.With that purpose in mind, it is a great effort. General Franks' insights into the complexities of command at all levels are worthwhile reading for any student of the military arts. The autobiographical elements of the book serve to add color to Franks' evolution as a commander and give a fresh perspective on how he executed the war against Iraq's elite Republican Guard.But this book is not an easy read. The military lingo and technical terminology force the reader to go slow. And, by Franks' own admission, this book is not a comprehensive analysis of the war.It is, however, a great &quot;study in command&quot; and is a commendable book for anyone who enjoys reading about great military leaders and their exploits."},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"Clancy does a superb job of researching the techo wiz factors for his excellent works of fiction.

Although, well written and extremely accurate, I found General Franks defending his actions entirely too much. General Franks was and is an outstanding leader; and the criticism leveled at him by Schwarzkopf was totally uncalled for. General Franks has brought up a great point about the lethality and tempo involved with modern warfare. The CINC was far removed from the battle and could only track the progress by reports sent to him. Not knowing the true nature of the attack left Schwarzkopf open for alot more criticism than what General Franks leveled at him. Through their hi-tech equipment today's brigade and battlalion commanders will be able to see the battlefield alot better than the company commander and platoon leader on the ground will; they will literally dominate &quot;battlespace&quot;. But what they have to keep in mind is that only that commander on the GROUND knows the true tempo and lethality of war.

It is virtually impossible to follow the troop movements without intense concentration or constant referral to the few maps included. Dry as dust.Like me, many Clancy fans will be suckered into purchasing this book on his name alone. This will be a mistake. I found no Clancy here. This book is an obvious response by General Franks (who I am sure is a fine man and an excellent soldier) to criticism levelled by General Schwartzkopf in his book on the Gulf War.If you are researching Desert Storm, this book may be helpful; otherwise, avoid this book at all costs!"},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"I am still trying to understand why Gen. Franks,who holds an MA in English from Columbia, chose tolet Mr. Clancy write his memoir for him.This book is an absolute muddle. At times it is notclear which man is doing the writing (largelybecause Mr. Clancy, who never served, insists onusing first person plural pronouns when referringto the U.S. Army). More often, it is not clear whether the thoughts belong to Mr.Clancy, or if they are his representation of Gen.Franks'.The subtitle, &quot;A Study in Command,&quot; is an absolutemisnomer. &quot;Study&quot; implies objectivity, and even--dare I say it--some criticism. Clancy never bothersto present any perspective beyond Gen. Franks' own.Franks' ideas, decisions, and memories are neverquestioned.Finally, the writing is atrocious.The first hundred pages or so I circled grossgrammatical errors and ugle style choices.Until I hit exasperation saturation. Clancy'swriting talks down to his reader in a way I findinsulting.Again, why did Gen. Franks let Mr. Clancy tell hisstory? I am not sure what I am supposed to bereading. It isn't memoir. It isn't biography.It isn't history.To the book's credit: it fawns on the army, andthe army's phoenix-like rise from the napalmashes of Vietnam. It does take a little of CNN outof the so-dubbed &quot;CNN-war.&quot; And Gen. Franks, when heis allowed to write, outdoes Clancy.

It provides the reader with a case study of modern military command techniques at work in the harsh, complex environment of Desert Storm.Through Clany, Franks, often in his own words, guides us through his thought processes in planning and executing the largest movement of armored froces since World War II. Although dry at times, it is a useful study, especially for military officers.On a personal level, I was more than pleased that Gen Franks received his day in court in light of all the criticism laid at his feet about the pace of VII Corps during the ground war. As a VII Corps vet who was there on the ground, I certainly do not remember a lot of &quot;down time&quot;. As a military officer, I was compelled to find out what I always assumed was true; namely, if Schwartzkopf was so concerned about VII Corps tempo, why did he not leave his bunker in the rear and fly into the Corps Area of Operations and see for himself what was going on? While the book does not answer this question for me, it does clarify that Gen Franks never received a speed up order from CENTCOM.Overall, Into the Storm is a great book for the serious student of military art and science. If you are looking for another Red Storm Rising, this certainly isn't it. It's value lies in the insight it provides on the workings of the American Army at war, under the guidance of skilled, dedicated individuals"},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"Oh boy this book was incredible. Anyone who has ever wanted to be general or military leader this book tells you what you need. The book revolves around the life of General Franks and his expereiences from Vietnam to the Gulf War.It also shows how the US Army was pretty much shattered after Vietnam.... I was also surprised to learn of all the controversy involving the higher up's and with Franks.The best part of the books for me was how Franks tells you detail by detail how the US Army figths and the tactics and strategies it tries to implement against the enemy. You really get into the mind set of a general in the US Army.The book at times gets pretty heavy in military jargon but if you really want to learn how the military operate this is it. I strongly recommned it and definately should be required reading at any military institution."},{"Title":"Into the Storm: A Study in Command","review":"Tom Clancy is a great person to have on your side - meaning he paints the main subject of this book, General Fred Franks, as a study of perfection. Franks commanded the US VIIth Corps in Operation Desert Storm (Gulf 1). General Schwartzkopf (Stormin Norman) was his boss. After the war, there were allegations that Franks should have moved faster against the Iraqi's and was too cautious. Many who served with Franks admire him for his compassion & caring of the soldiers. Those who know Franks certainly tend to side with him rather than Schwartzkopf who had quite the temper and was considered by many to be a bully.Clancy spends a lot of time refuting that Franks was too slow, demonstrating how Franks did just what he was supposed to do and why certain decisions were made during the 100 hours war. Hard to believe it, but there was finger pointing after what was a nearly flawless operation. Franks is an excellent leader on many levels, concern for your troops is a very important trait to want in a leader. Clancy shows this repeatedly.I would not recommend this book to anyone unless you are really a student of history and want to read about Desert Storm from many different perspectives. This is a heavy handed rebuttal of Schwartzkopf's biography \\"It Doesn't Take a Hero\\". Where is the truth? Probably somewhere between these two Generals. There are not a lot of maps, there are interesting insights to the Gulf War and strategy behind the war. I read this mainly to see what Franks had to say about Schwartzkopf.

In this interpretation, the concept of God evolved from that of a jealous, vengeful spirit to that of a constitutional monarch, and ultimately to a nameless God who is bound by the same morals and principles that govern humankind. Fromm is convincing in his arguments, and even for those readers who will remain unconvinced after the reading of the book, all will no doubt take away an appreciation of the depth of his scholarship.All of the three major Western religions: Islam, Christianity, and Judaism, owe their origins to the Old Testament, whether this is acknowledged or not, and all have to this day a powerful influence on the lives of millions of people. And yes, as Fromm states in the book, the world's populations do hold a materialistic philosophy that is coupled with ever-increasing globalization and technology, but the acquisition of material goods and the indulgence of their pleasures coexists with a commitment to spirtual values and religion. This superposition of religious and materialistic philosophy shows no sign of abatement.The radical humanism of Fromm is a philosophy that is delightfully optimistic, and emphasizes the capacity of humans to develop their intellectual powers, to become fully independent, to understand reality as it is, and a renunciation of the initiation of force, the latter of which, Fromm argues, results in intellectual disintegration and emotional dependence. Eschewing a static allegiance to doctrines and concepts that therefore become divorced from experience, Fromm encourages the thinking of concepts as dynamic objects, and cautious that \\"they have their own lives\\", and can be aliented from the experiences by which they were invented (discovered). Forgetting the roots of a conceptual structure in experience will transform it to ideology, argues Fromm, and this ideology will usurp the underlying reality of human experience. History will become a history of ideologies, rather than a history of concrete, real individuals who produce ideas. Conceptual structures according to Fromm can never adequately express the experience from which they refer to, and the symbols used allow communication of experiences. But, this also allows an alienation of their use, since such structures are incomplete, and a rush to fill in the gaps, to pad the system, results in one that appears complete, but in reality is still fragmented. It then tends to a state of stagnation and sterility, making it inert and useless. Such is the history of religious concepts in particular, asserts Fromm.Fromm's interpretation of the Old Testament is essentially as follows: Stage 1: A dictatorial God as absolute ruler, jealous of the human potential to be God's rival. The use of force and brutality characterizes such a God, who expels Adam and Eve from Paradise and limits human lifetime to 120 years. Stage 2: God establishes a covenant with Noah and his descendants, promising to never again flood the Earth. For Fromm, the concept of the covenant is one of the most decisive steps in the evolution of Judaism, in that it leads to a conception of complete freedom for humankind, in particular freedom from God. God and human beings become partners in a treaty, this transforming God from an absolute ruler into a constitutional monarch. God then has less freedom to be brutal, to disrepect human life and other living creatures. Abraham's numerical challenge to God at Sodom and Gommorrah is offered in evidence. Abraham's confidence in the principle of universal justice is a departure from the concept of human beings as meek supplicants, fearful of God's reprisals. Stage 3: The rejection of idols and the subsequent concept of God as a nameless God. One must talk to God, not about him, the latter results in idolatry. The philosophy of Moses Maimonides is offered as evidence of this. The \\"negative theology\\" of Maimonides allows only the employment of attributes of actions of God. Both God and humans in this stage become subjected to the same universal principles of truth and justice, and their relationships is no longer confrontational . Conceptions of God then evolve to the more abstract, with God working through history (\\"horizontally\\"), and not into it (\\"vertically\\").Fromm's viewpoints on sin and repentance are also very interesting. He points out that in the story of Adam's fall, no mention is made of Adam having committed a sin. Fromm also gives interesting arguments that support his notion that the Old Testament scriptures do not state that humans are intrinsically evil. Humans can choose good with the same potential as their choice for evil, is his reading of these scriptures. The Biblical view, at least from the standpoint of the Old Testament, argues Fromm, is that humans can choose between life and death, good versus evil, and their does not exist any compulsion to choose one rather than the other. God points out the alternatives and asks us to choose life and the good.Erich Fromm has been away from us for 22 years now, but his writings are to this day still studied diligently by many individuals and they still have a lot to say about human beings, their beliefs, and their relationship to reality. With the complexity of life and knowledge increasing at an accelerating rate, humans now can make copies of themselves, can create thinking machines from mere sand, can travel in space, and can live their lives in ways that the ancient writers of the Old Testament never envisioned. Fromm translates Deuteronomy 30:19: \\"....I have set before you life and death, choose life....\\". I think if Fromm were alive, being the optimist he is, he would be proud of what humans now stand for, despite some areas of conflict in the world.Humans have indeed chosen life, and have become as gods......."},{"Title":"You Shall be as Gods: a Radical Interpretation of the Old Testament and Its Tradition","review":"This book shows how the Old Testament contained some key humanistic ideas that did transform our culture. This is the most historical of the books written by Erich Fromm. The commentary made the Old Testament feel both alive and strangely modern for me. The book quotes the Old Testament extensively in a kind of psychological, sociological, and liberal biblical study. This makes the book fairly rare and unique. I would recommend it to anyone who likes reading Erich Fromm and who wants to see a different side of him."},{"Title":"You Shall be as Gods: a Radical Interpretation of the Old Testament and Its Tradition","review":"Fromm, a radical humanist (and a nonbeliever in God) still writes in the great Jewish tradition of optimism and of belief in human potential. Fromm had an excellent traditional Jewish upbringing, and although more traditional thinkers will disagree with his conclusions, they are at least well grounded in Old Testament texts.The book is a bit dated in that one of its intellectual underpinnings is the belief that human beings can perfect themselves through self-understanding, specifically through psychoanalysis. The twenty-first century has not been charitable to that conclusion."},{"Title":"You Shall be as Gods: a Radical Interpretation of the Old Testament and Its Tradition","review":"Fromm is a modernist, a humanist and an optimist and interprets Jewish tradition from this perspective. In this book he offers a radically humanist interpretation of the Old Testament: God evolving from an absolute monarch to a constitutional monarch - bound by the same morals and principles that govern humankind. This view is optimistic because it emphasizes our capacity to develop intellectually and become fully independent and free because of our ability to comprehend reality. This interpretation of Judaism could only have developed in the 20th century. It is an interpretation that has great attraction for me and without which I could not have written my own book \\"The Optimistic Jew: a Positive Vision for the Jewish People in the 21st Century\\"."},{"Title":"Razzle Dazzle","review":"This is a well written book of events, people, etc. of my childhood in Northern Kentucky.

The story is almost secondary because the illustrations are so perfect. When I bought this book and read it again after many years, I laughed because I practically knew the dialog before I read it!

I am a fan of John Grisham and William Bernhardt, particularly because they are always out for justice. In Steve Byas' character of Lance McNabb, we see the same kind of tenacity and decencey that keeps one coming back for more. The character descriptions were excellent and the names of the towns were fun (especially if you are from Oklahoma. For a first book, it shows promise for a great series. Many of the author's opinions came through in the plot, which I found interesting, but a little distracting at the same time. Maybe a little of that comes through in every book, though. I found some sentences to be a little short and incomplete, which a mediocre editor would correct.. Overall, I will definitely buy the next book, and will buy copies of this for friends and family!"},{"Title":"Digging Up Bones: A Lance McNabb Mystery","review":"A fantastic read,this book held my interest from the start and as a genealogist, I was impressed how the author ballanced that knowledge with the plot to write a very good mystery novel. I would and do recommend this book. I was totally impressed and look forward to the next Lance McNabb mystery."},{"Title":"Digging Up Bones: A Lance McNabb Mystery","review":"Summary by author, Steve Byas.(I gave it 5 stars because I had to fill in that field to do this review---I would have preferred to leave that blank).Lance McNabb expected the assignment would offer a welcome diversion from his usual fare as a private investigator: exposing insurance scams, tailing unfaithful spouses, and litigation research. All the young and beautiful Lisa Allen asked him to do was research her family history.Lisa's grandfather, Chuck Eller, is adamantly opposed to the project. He dismisses it as &quot;digging up bones.&quot; Lance has little difficulty in uncovering genealogical information, but he also discovers why Lisa's grandfather so strongly opposes his effort.In Digging Up Bones, we find that shaking the family tree can be downright lethal."},{"Title":"Digging Up Bones: A Lance McNabb Mystery","review":"The first time that I read this book, I was thrilled that I might soon have another mystery author to read.

What a page-turner! The writing style is similar to John Grisham and Frank Peretti. Fast paced, lots of detail, and very suspensful.This has great potential to be a series."},{"Title":"Digging Up Bones: A Lance McNabb Mystery","review":"I'll preface this by saying that I have to give the book a moderate thumbs up. I enjoyed reading it because I knew the locations (though Byas tries to desguise them) and knew the type of people and their beliefs that he was talking about. If I can find the second McNabb book locally, I would love to read it as well. I was able to read it quickly and was not bored by the plot. I will also give props to Byas for self publishing this book. All of that said, there are some critical and suspension of belief problems.Byas seems unfamiliar with how to become a private investigator in Oklahoma. McNabb, like anyone seeking a PI license from the state, has to apprentice somewhere. It doesn't appear that McNabb has ever done that, let alone taken the required classes for such licensing. This was published in 2003, but McNabb is stingy with his cell phone like it was 1987 and he was still carrying around the big brick phone. Even back in 2003, people, especially folks in business who wanted to keep in touch, live(d) and die(d) by their cellulars. To believe that his girlfriend doesn't have his cell number is pretty strange.Another believeability problem I had was when McNabb and the girlfriend go to eat at the Olive Garden. Personal opinion: I like Olive Garden. McNabb and the girlfriend act like they're going to eat somewhere with an ultra snooty dress code. They treat it like it's going to be featured on an episode of \\"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous\\". At the chain Italian restaurant with good food, they run into a character who owns a multi-million dollar company and has a private jet. This guy eats at Olive Garden with some associates? Making up some small mom-and-pop restaurant and having them cross paths there would make much more sense. Perhaps Byas felt that all the readers could relate to eating there and thus he wouldn't have to create a restaurant and come up with a backstory and details.Most prior reviews have talked about how much detail Byas put into the story. Going into detail about every article of clothing someone has on is just like those oral book reports where you talk about how many pages the book has, it's measurements, etc. It's just a big serving of Novel Helper. I know all about trying to stretch the manuscript to be so many pages/words, but why not be descriptive about something mentioned in the paragraph above instead.Overall, this is a decent, easy read. It does have its share of predictability and times when you'll say \\"You think that guy would've been prepared for something like that.\\" However, you won't be sitting around later thinking that you wasted those hours reading it. I think this is Byas's first book, so I expect a degree of improvement in the next book."},{"Title":"Digging Up Bones: A Lance McNabb Mystery","review":"Digging Up Bones by Steve Byas is a very well written book, which is very easy reading from the very 1st page to the last. The author has the reader wanting to read the book from cover to cover in just one sitting. The book is very enjoyable, the reader who likes excitement will most definately want to read Digging Up Bones. The author has you guessing and you won't find the answer until the very last paragraph. It will make you want to dig up your own bones."},{"Title":"Digging Up Bones: A Lance McNabb Mystery","review":"From the opening of this book, I was hooked. This was a fast read with good pacing.

Fr. Hupp alleges, that he, practically single handedly , micromanaged the &quot;outdated management style&quot; practiced at Boys Town during the tenures of Fathers Flanagan and Wegner.The changes that Father Hupp initiated became permanent, and in that sense, could be described as revolutionary.The formerly centralized system disappeared: dining hall, laundry facilities, clothing store, medical and dental care, as well as the scheduled liturgical functions: Catholic, Protestant, Jewish. In his work, Hupp followed the predictably simplistic, but extremely expensive, recommendations of a Management Counsulting Firm, Booz, Allen and Hamilton. The boys, the reason d'etre of Boys Town appear to play a secondary role in the book. Father Hupp relies on unproven theories of sociologists, blind followers of B.F.Skinner's utopian world in his Walden Two. Boys Town's new educational philosophy is based on the sociologist E. Phillip's near-Pavlovian Lawrence Achievement Place, a system of behavior modification with an hourly system of rewards and punishment transfusions that Phillip transplanted to Boys Town. But it has been amply documented that rewards in such a system tend to fail. They are effective in gaining temporary compliance, but they cannot change attitudes. Rewards on the long run are controlling agents. As such, they warp relationships, and reduce intrinsic motivation. As part of his &quot;cleaning the Auegean Stbles&quot;, Phillip fired, or dismissed long-time, successful employees, and replaced them with &quot;experts&quot; in sociology and educational techniques, specialists in &quot;civility and political correctness&quot;, tutors in social graces , greeting and conversation skills, trainers in sensitivity, and so on, with the aim to modify the boys' and girls' behavior with standard positive reinforcements. There is no word about the reduced number of youths, the brevity of their stay, termination of those who do not fit in, or are considered incorrigible, nor is there word about the new admission standards, and the super-expensive refurbishing of buildings and cottages to make them practicable for &quot;family-teacher&quot; environment, a concept, that in its present form, is alien to the esprit de corps that characterized the Boys Town of old. m It is unfortunate, that in theprocess the &quot;Old&quot; Boys Town lost that splendid spirit that gave it international renown, while the &quot;New&quot; one sold out Father Flanagan's dream to behaviorist practitioners of a yet to be proven science fiction utopia."},{"Title":"Cases and Materials on Federal Indian Law (American Casebook Series).","review":"The pictured & decribed item was the 5th Ed which is what I need for class.

This book claims to have a 'collection of over 3000 quotes.' Seeing its daunting size, there is little doubt to the accuracy of that statement. While mostly about love, the quotes vary in genre from 'Wrinkles' to 'Safe Sex,' from 'Gossip' to 'Lingerie.' The quotes have a vast range of emotion behind them... humor, spite, truth, and independence included. Examples include: &quot;I am tired of all this nonsense of beauty being only skin deep. That's deep enough. What do you want- an adorable pancreas?&quot; (Jean Kerr, page 32) &quot;At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet.&quot; (Plato, page 248) &quot;Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth/For thy love is better than wine.&quot; (Song of Songs, page (212) There are a variety of authors, as the book says, though it tends mostly to have many lines from the 1800's-early 1900s.

I did enjoy reading about the history of Henry VIII and how the people of England fared during his reign."},{"Title":"The Miracle at St. Bruno's","review":"This is the first novel of the all time popular \\"Cornwall Saga\\" written by Philippa Carr (Who is also Victoria Holt.)As always ,her attention to the detail of historical facts is, in my opinion, matchless. The data is not only superbly correct from a historical standpoint but she can somehow make the most minute fact seem of interest. Characters, whether kings, queens or peasants come to life as real people, not simply historical icons.The heroine's name is Damask Farland and her name itself is even a tie to the historical period. She was named after the damask rose, brought to England by King Henry's doctor. It would be completely plausible that creative parents would choose it as a name. It's these tiny details that make the book real. When I read it I am not reading ABOUT a period of time. I am BACK there.The pulsing question underneath all the excellent historical entertainment is; Will Damask find love and come to some peace in her life? Or is it even possible to find happiness in such a turbulent time in history?

Philippa Carr, Victoria Holt, aka as Jean Plaidy were amongst my favourite historical authors, so it was with this in mind, I picked up a copy of this reissued first book in the Daughter of England series, in the hope that their appeal would be everlasting.Maybe my perception of historical romance has altered with the passage of time, as sadly for me the appeal seems to have been lost. Overall, I found the story rather laboured, with little really happening for the first third of the story. However, there is no denying that the book has been well researched, and to some extent manages to capture the heady and challenging days of Tudor England with some unexpected twists and turns in the story, which add interest.A nice story if you haven't read the series before."},{"Title":"The Miracle at St. Bruno's","review":"A young woman has to contend with a very religious but obviously lusty stepfather and with her burgeoning attraction to a young man who was discovered as a baby left in the local monastery and is considered to be a miracle.Having read some Victoria Holt novels, over the years, I picked up another one of her pseudonyms. The big difference in this from the Holt titles is the lack of romance and the definite emphasis on sex. That's not to say this is packed with descriptions of explicit sex, it isn't. The heroine's virtue is challenged all the time especially by her stepfather, which lends the book a slightly more adult emphasis. The main story of her relationship with the human miracle of St Bruno provides the book with a fairly creepy climax, as she uncovers the truth about him.So, an enjoyable fast paced read to pass the time. Off-beat enough to be more diverting than a bog-standard historical romance."},{"Title":"The Miracle at St. Bruno's","review":"A girl grows up in Henry VIII's England with her beautiful, temperamental cousin.Pretty good job of evoking the feel of living during religious conflict, less so at producing an interesting story. The narrator is a wimp and cousin Kate is a selfish terror who has to dominate every situation. I gave up about a quarter of the way through."},{"Title":"The Miracle at St. Bruno's","review":"I started reading Victoria Holt novels some 30+ years ago and instantly liked her style.\\"Lord of the Far Island\\", \\"Mistress of Mellyn\\", \\"Bride of Pendorric\\" and \\"Devil on Horseback\\" were similarly satisfying reads, but for me the \\"Daughters of England\\" series of books (ca. 20 volumes) is unsurpassed. Victoria Holt wrote \\"Daughters of England\\" under her Philippa Carr pseudonym. Volume one (Miracle at St. Bruno's) starts in the 1500's (the closing of the monasteries) and follows the same family through many generations into the 20th century. The first 5 or 6 sequels are especially good and unpredictable!"},{"Title":"The Miracle at St. Bruno's","review":"The narrator for this book is Damask Farland, daughter of a prosperous attorney during the reign of Henry VIII. Damask has grown up around the legend of the Miracle of St. Bruno's abbey, that of a lost child found in a crib on Christmas Eve. The child was named Bruno after the abbey and brought prosperity and wealth to the abbey - that is until King Henry starts hankering for Anne Boleyn. During the destruction of the abbey Bruno's real parentage is revealed, and since it's one he can't accept he high tails it out of town for a few years, but when he does return his fortunes have significantly improved, although no one knows the source of his great wealth.Anywho, there's a marriage and a few deep dark secrets, but it takes years and years of endless exposition from Damask to get the reader to the big reveal on the last few pages and by then I was so darned weary of it all I really didn't care much. Part of the problem is that today's readers are fairly up to snuff with Henry VIII and his six wives, and the last thing one needs is another recital of it all, particularly from a character who is stuck in the countryside raising children and gets it all second hand. I suspect this might appeal better to younger teens or die-hard fans of Carr who also wrote at Jean Plaidy and Victoria Holt, but for anyone else I'd suggest giving this a miss."},{"Title":"The Complete Book of Flowers and Plants for Interior Decoration","review":"this is a how-to book showing ways to arrange potted flowers and plants to fit in with period \\"styles\\" meaning:early european periods,english periods,american styles,and modern design. style periods refers to FURNITURE STYLES. for instance one would not want to use some funky,tie-dye modern looking pot on a 19th century rosewood marble top table-that would look weird!this book is profusely illustrated with black/white and a few color pictures. it also has line drawings showing different styles of furniture and how to identify them. this is a great book for someome with a 19th century house looking for ideas on how and what to use for flower/plant arrangement.the latter part of the book has to do with more modern themes like:making color and texture work,designing flowers for room settings,plant crafts and techniques,and holidays and other occasions.only drawback is,this was published in 1969 so,the \\"modern\\" parts are a bit dated.still,a nice book on the subject."},{"Title":"Measure theory","review":"This book is an overview of measure theory that is somewhat dated in terms of the presentation, but could still be read profitably by someone interested in studying the subject with greater generality than more modern texts. Measure theory has abundant applications, and has even gained importance in recent years in such areas as financial engineering. Those interested in the applications of measure theory to financial engineering should choose another book however, since this one does not even mention the word martingale. After a review of elementary topology and set theory in chapter 1, the author begins to define the elementary notions of measure theory in chapter 2. His approach is more general than other texts, since he works over a ring instead of an algebra. Measures on intervals of real numbers is given as an example. Measures and outer measures are defined, and it is shown how a measure induces an outer measure and how an outer measure induces a measure.The next chapter explores more carefully the relation between measures and outer measures. It is also shown in this chapter to what extent a measure on a ring can be extended to the generated sigma-ring. The all-important Lebesgue measure is developed here also, and the author exhibits an example of a non-measurable set.In order to develop an integration theory, one must first characterize the collection of measurable functions, and the author does this in chapter 4. The convergence properties of measurable functions are carefully outlined by the author.The theory of integration begins in chapter 5, wherein the author follows the standard construction of an integral by first defining integrals over simple functions. Then in chapter 6, signed measures are defined, and the Lebesgue bounded convergence theorem is proven and the Hahn and Jordan decompositions of these measures are discussed. The all-important Radon-Nikodym theorem, which gives an integral representation of an absolutely continuous sigma-finite signed measure, is proven in detail.One can of course take the Cartesian product of two measurable spaces, and the author shows how to define measures on these products in chapter 7, including infinite products. The physicist reader may want to pay attention to the section on infinite dimensional product measures, as it does have applications to functional integration in quantum field theory (although somewhat weakly).The author treats measurable transformations in chapter 8, but interestingly, the word &quot;ergodic&quot; is never mentioned. He also introduces briefly the L-p spaces, so very important in many areas of mathematics, and proves the Holder and Minkowski inequalities.The next chapter is the most important in the book, for it covers the notion of probability on measure spaces. After an brief motivation in the first section of the chapter, probability spaces are defined, and Bayes' theorem is discussed as an exercise. Both the weak and strong law of large numbers is proven in detail.Things get more abstract in chapter 10, which discusses measure theory on locally compact spaces. Borel and Baire sets on these kinds of spaces are defined, and the author gives detailed arguments on what must be changed when doing measure theory in this more general kind of space.The book ends with a discussion of measure theory on topological groups via the Haar measure. This chapter also has connections to physics, such as in the Faddeev-Popov volume measure over gauge equivalent classes in quantum field theory. The author does a fine job of characterizing the important properties of the Haar measure."},{"Title":"Measure theory","review":"There comes a time when the budding probabilist or statistician seeks a more comprehensive treatement of measure theory than is afforded in the first few sections of a graduate text in pstats. I chose Halmos's \\"Measure Theory\\" for this purpose for two primary reasons: i) Paul Halmos in my opinion is one of the best expository mathematics writers in history, and ii) years ago I paid $1 for the above-mentioned text (original Van Nostrand print) at a local thriftstore. My only perceived drawback was that likely some of his approach to measure theory may be outdated.After reading the text (up to the chapter on probability) my opinion of Halmos as a writer and mathematician not only has been elevated, but the book delivered the thorough study of measure theory that I had hoped for. Indeed, the author does an excellent job in presenting measure theory in its entire generality semi-rings, rings, hereditary rings, algebras, sigma algebras and their extensions are all considered in detail, as well as measures on these set systems: finitely additive , sigma additive, inner measures, outer measures, sigma-finite measures, the completion of measures, regular measures). I especially enjoyed his presentation of Fubini's Theorem along with the concept of \\"section of a measurable set\\", which helped the theorem fall out effortlessly. I also found his presentation of different types of convergence (e.g. pointwise, uniform, almost uniform, in measure, in mean) very good and helped give me the bigger picture on modes of convergence. Theorem 22A is essentially a generalization of the Borel-Cantelli Lemma.The book does have a few downsides. In particular pi and lambda-systems are not used and in some sense replaced by the older notion of semiring. Also, the author's definition of Lesbegue integrable seemed a bit more complicated than what is usually presented (e.g. for nonnegative measurable f to be integrable it requires a sequence fn of simple functions that is mean fundamental and converges in measure to f; compare this with the simpler definition of the integral of measurable f being the sup of Lesbegue integrals of simple functions g for which g &lt;= f). But I consider these downsides minor and highly recommend this text to anyone who seeks a deeper understanding of measure theory.My impression of measure theory has gone from seeing it as abstract mathematical machinery for simplifying analysis proofs, to a kind of mathematical philosophy that unifies the infinite with the discrete, and lays the proper foundations for inference, probabilistic reasoning, and learning; i.e. the foundations of cognitive intelligence."},{"Title":"Measure theory","review":"If you want to stydy measure theory from scratch, I do recommend this book. This book is based on a ring, not an algebra, and is a little old-fashioned. So some people feel uncomfortable. But in particular, product spaces, the Fubini theorem and extension theorems are written very clearly. I'm convinced this book will facilitate your learning in measure theory and probability theory."},{"Title":"Measure theory","review":"Halmos was a lucid mathematical writer but his \\"Measure Theory\\" is dated 1950 and so antedates by two years Rohlin's definitive axiomatic discussion in Doklady Nauk USSR 1952. The attempted axiomatization by Halmos and Von Neumann in the the late 1940's failed and was withdrawn by its authors. Someone who is seriously interested to learn measure theory, with an approach based on the notion of measureable homomorphism, should visit Rohlin's publications and at least one other modern book.WH Cobbs Narberth PA"},{"Title":"Fort Everglades","review":"Again it is an outstanding book, and like most all of Dr Slaughter's writings it is weel worht the reading.

Look no further than this excellent guide. \\"Skywatching\\" begins by discussing the interesting history behind astronomy. The history is given a thorough treatment but is not overly done. The author includes just enough to build on the fascination we already have as attested by purchasing this book. I believe the most valuable part of this book is the main content which names and explains all of the constellations and points out neighboring celestial objects... many of which are visible to the naked eye or binoculars. One of the interesting things I've learned about this fascinating hobby is that you don't need to run out and buy a $2,000.00 telescope to enjoy it.

All of the poems are a true experience of the women who were and are touched by entering the man's world of war. I didn't carry weapons, didn't walk the bush, but I saw the carnage and felt the then seeming helplessness of the wounded bought in by dust-off. Intolerant of being helpless, I lived my tour in numbness and left Vietnam as only a shell. Who wouldn't in those conditions?

This is a book written from the hearts of those that have served our wounded heroes!"},{"Title":"Visions of War","review":"I first read this book in the mid-1990's. Recently I picked it up again. The insanity of war is just that, regardless of whether it happened when I was in my twenties or now in my sixties. As a non-participant in the immediacy of war, I can still feel my heart wrench as I read these poems. I cannot even begin to imagine the agony of working day to day in a combat hospital. If I had a son at war now, I would hope that women such as these would be there for him.I admire Van DeVanter and Furey's courage in presenting such a wide range of poetic expressions. Some are, admittedly, the work of rank amateurs, but many carry the power of the true poetic voice. They included a few poems by Vietnamese women, with no indication of which \\"side\\" they were on.

From their position, they could speak of what they saw as the deaths continued to mount all around. Many of the poems are awkward and sentimental, many rely on limp rhymes, many wear their hearts on their sleeves. Most ache with wounds that will never heal. The authors' courageous struggle to face the eternal suffering of war, to try to find words to express how others' suffering has deeply moved them, gives some of these works a rough edge that cuts the reader to the soul."},{"Title":"Visions of War","review":"Book was advertised as \\"used in good condition\\" and that was a precise description.

Readers looking for steamy suspense will find it here, though some may wish the authors had written a trilogy of three separate books so they could have had more of these stories.Rebecca York begins the set with \\"Tyler.\\" An undercover federal agent is surprised when his latest case brings him into the life of the sister of his boyhood friend. Tyler feels he let her brother down. When killers chase them into the bayou, can he do right by her? York doesn't have much room to tell her story, since she has to provide the prologue that sets up the trilogy and the events that lead into the next two tales. Eighty pages isn't much to tell a whole story. As a result, there isn't much to \\"Tyler,\\" a straightforward couple-on-the-run tale with few surprises but good suspense and a high level of sensuality. There aren't many twists and some may have trouble believing these two could fall in love in such a short period of time. Good atmosphere and page-turning suspense do compensate. Fans of constant action and steamy love scenes will find them here. Four Stars.Surprisingly, the best story in the set doesn't come from an Intrigue author but from Metsy Hingle. In \\"Nick,\\" a man returns to his hometown for his brother's wedding to the only woman he's ever loved. When his brother is murdered, Nick becomes the prime suspect. Can he find the truth and reclaim the only woman for him? Hingle's story is the best because she manages to combine all the elements of a full-length Intrigue into her eighty pages. Both characters have interesting and involved histories that make them seem more three-dimensional. Hingle keeps her characters in constant danger, but she also spaces her story over several days. It is fast-paced but doesn't feel rushed. This is the only story where I really felt like the characters had a chance to talk about their relationship. By the end I was convinced they would last as a couple. A good mystery, dangerous situations and enjoyable antagonists make this a joy to read. It's not easy to pull off in eighty pages (some writers can't do it in 250). Hingle does it with ease. Five stars.Joanna Wayne finishes the set with \\"Jules.\\" A murder brings Jules close to the truth of the man out to get him and his friends. It also reunites him with his first love. Can Jules protect her when her involvement with him puts her in danger? Wayne's story is a solid follow-up to the second one. It has some good character development and twists along the way. The climax is somewhat weak. The dangerous situation the characters find themselves in is so contrived I couldn't understand how this could be happening to intelligent people. Wayne does offer some chilling scenes and confrontations with a truly evil villain to keep readers turning the pages and the romance is solid. Four Stars.The Louisiana bayou country is a setting that has mostly been forgotten in Intrigues (out of the last 100 Intrigues, only one full novel and one novella were set in Louisiana, both in New Orleans). It's a shame these stories couldn't have been offered as three separate books to allow readers to spend more time in this setting and the authors more time to build their stories.

At the setting of this novel it has been 10 years since a cataclysmic event took place which turned elantris into a city of decay and its inhabitants into leprous type creatures, unable to die, and for whom the smallest injury can amount to unending and unendurable pain. Those that succumb to the Shaod are now treated as dead and thrown into Elantris' city gates and forgotten about. Elantris has become a savage and despairing hell, where its citizens are brutalized and mad from the pain.Thus when King Iadon's son Raoden is taken one night by the shaod, he is quietly exiled to the prison of Elantris and treated as dead. Raoden was to be wed to the princess of Teod, Sarene. She was traveling to meet Raoden for the wedding, having only met him through letters and a sort of magical communication. SHe is unaware of what has happened to Raod, and arrives to find that he is dead, but her engagement contract has bound her to the union. The contract was meant to ally the last two countries that stand against the powerful and tyrannical Fjorden, an imperial religion that threatens all the world with dominion. She is a stranger in a strange land, married for life to a dead man she has never met.Thus the story follows the Raod in his quest to reclaim his humanity and dignity, as well as to decipher the mysterious Shaod and the shattered Rune magic that once offered great power and majesty, and Sarene who is strong willed and politically savvy as she seeks to save her new land from the powerful fjorden empire. Sarene is confronted by one of Fjorden's High priest, Gyorn Hrathen. He has been sent to convert Arelon to Shu-Derethi, the militaristic religion that underlies Fjorden's power. Hrathen seeks to bring down Arelon by wit or political savvy -- both qualities Sarene shares -- but he is not averse to taking the country in blood and fire.What is so refreshing about this novel is Sanderson's understanding of the redeeming value of self determination and sacrifice. Sanderson's wisdom of the true nature of humanity permeates the novel. Evil is exposed for what it often truly is, not a devil with horns, but those who crush the wills of others by taking their choices from them in the name of peace and ultimate obedience to the wisdom of their governance. People may not always know the bad guys are by the outside, but with a true moral compass it is pretty clear who they are. On a micro level, Raoden delivers hope and a sense of self worth to the Elantrians by giving them a purpose. Rather than lying in their filth and waiting for someone to save them, they rebuild their lives. Sarene on the outside rallies her support not through the demands of nobility, but through the promise of self determination. Sanderson deftly handles religion neither elevating it to the omnipotent power of some fantasy novels, nor demeaning it as could have been done. He treats it with reverance, offering true insight into the crisis of faith that many have and the ultimate tranformative power of goodness in faith.There are some flaws in this book. Sarene can be just a bit too plucky at times, and there are just a few too many pep talks. The payoff for Raoden's plight seems to take and interminably long time. But the story resolves itself nicely and is filled with enough real tension and suspense as to make itself a page turner. While there is enough left for another story (and that is a good thing) we are left with a satisfying conclusion, which in this age of 10 book fantasy series has became a rarity.Elantris is a rarity in the fantasy world and a promising debut from a very promising author. I look forward to more!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Intelligent, witty, and intriguing, Elantris is a perfect book. That's about it."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I find that I am very much in agreement with M.Jacobs and dennster on their reviews of this book. I would give it 3.5 stars. Elantris seems somewhat over-hyped. Interesting concepts, but the characters weren't developed well enough to compellingly hold my interest. It left me with an impression of being lighter than it should have been, given the course of events in the novel. Don't get me wrong, I will check out this author in the future, but this novel had me pushing my way through it just a bit, instead of being totally pulled in."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Over hyped? I don't think so. I loved this book. Wow Wow WOW!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"It's a sweet story and the fact that Raoden is stricken with a horrifying and disfiguring disease really turns me on."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I can't recommend this book because most of it is very depressing, and although the magic is imaginative, it is \\"broken\\" for most of the story. Here are my complaints. If Sanderson had changed the book in the following ways it would have been a much more pleasant read (spoilers):1) Lighten the gloom. I would have left the city of Elantris in good shape, the doom only effecting the people, AND it would have been better if those affected by the Sheod could be damaged (dismembered, etc), but the pain didn't pile up.2) Raodan was just too darned perfect. Sarene was too, except for being irascible and smug. And their plans for helping the people are too 21st century progressive. He should have eased off on that. Some feminism and grrl-power in there too that I found irritating.3) Maybe I missed it but I didn't understand how the Elantrians couldn't have figured out what was wrong with their magic and fixed it. It is hardly believable that Raodan could, under such a handicap, and they couldn't. The Elantrians need to have just been disintegrated instantly when disaster struck.4) I think he was angling for a follow-on book, but the injection of several other forms of magic toward the end was a mistake, I think. It cluttered things and seemed like something of a deus-ex-machina (for the bad guys).5) The monks of Dakhor were made too powerful. It would have been enough if they were just very well-trained warriors.6) The magic was imaginative, but too powerful. It was either broken or running at full power, easily. The best magics come in different strengths, and are sometimes elusive.I could go on (I hate anti-smoking pressure in a fantasy, in fact pipe-smoking and discussion of tabac is one of my favorite pleasures in fantasy novels), but the above changes would have made this a much more pleasant to read book."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I'd heard good things about this novel for a while, and had been meaning to pick it up. After reading a somewhat mediocre Sanderson novel, I decided to try and cure my disappointment with Elantris.Well, the novel was engrossing. Don't get me wrong, it isn't perfect. It's still clearly a genre book, and not up to the level of writing demonstrated by someone like GRR Martin. So, the characters can be a bit unbelievable and the plot can be fairly predictable... including some of the \\"twists.\\" Raoden is heroic to near fairy tale proportions. Sarene is just shy of being impossibly more brilliant than everyone around her. Still, they're three dimensional, and I really found myself rooting for them as the book progressed.Even Hrathen, the protagonist, has good points--something I give kudos to Sanderson for since he could have easily been portrayed as Big Bad Evil Priest and nothing more.I also have sort of a personal issue with Sanderson's books because, though I l usually do like them, he manages to put in one or two characters in each of his novels that really annoys me. They're, I suppose, meant to add in humor, but I just find them more awkward than funny. But, said annoyances in this novel were pretty minimal.Furthermore, the world here is well built and the theory of magic employed is original-ish. Plus, you can tell Sanderson really thought about it and tried to think it through.Pretty amazing considering it was Sanderson's first novel. I actually think it's better than some of his later works!! If you're a Sanderson fan, or just looking for a solid stand-alone fantasy romp, I'd highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Brandon Sanderson created a unique, self-contained world that is mostly not drawn out, unexplained and left to your imagination to figure out. While the pacing started a little slower than I would have liked, the story pays off quite nicely. As with Mistborn, a certain level is mystery is sewn into the story and you can walk away with most of your questions answered. In the end, characters asks several questions you would ask as the reader and does not answer them, but in a tactful way. Rather than a Q&A; monologue, Sanderson leaves the story open for further installments, which I do not mind since is has lots of potential.The magic system in Elantris is not overly complicated, at least in its undrestanding, and like the system in Mistborn, does not provide its user with unlimited resources to completely dominate one's opponent. There are limitations and they are played in a believable fashion. Elantris ended with a final note concerning AonDor, the source of all magic in the book. Gragdet's, the highest Derethi priests, have magic of their own, but it mainly consists more of physical abilities than supernatural. For instance, one Gradget is repeatedly struck with a sword and is virtually unharmed, while others move with greater quickness, agility and strength than the strongest of regular men. The process that makes them this way, while using AonDor, would be like a dark or blood magic, but ultimately, the source of the power is the same, thus making an Elantrian, who is not immortal, fighting a foe that is essentially equal.I could not help but note the similarities in this book and Ken Schole's Pslams of Isaak series, specifically the characters Sarene and Jin Li Tam from Lamentation. The audacity they hold themselves to, their unique political positions, and even their character traits are strikingly similar, almost as if they were the same person. And like Sarene, Jim Li Tam is practically too good at getting in the thick of main events. So what I am basically saying is that they were so good it was a fault in their characters. They executed a little too perfectly, leaving very little room for mistakes. Even Vin from Mistborn made mistakes, some huge. I guess you could mark this as my only complaint of the book.Sanderson has captivated my imagination once more with Elantris. I was not let down and enjoyed the ride. He mentioned that there would be a sequel to Elantris, but with his primary focus being the conclusion to the Wheel of Time series for a 2012 release, Elantris 2 may not be in my greedy hands until 2013 or 2014, possibly even later. In the meantime, I have a handful of other Sanderson books I can digest. I can now say with certainty that Sanderson is my favorite fantasy author. I need more exposure to add more weight to that statement, but I am confident in my position."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Though Elantris was the first novel by Brandon Sanderson, it was the 6th book by Sanderson that I have read. Many other reviewers cover the main plot points well enough already. Rather than cover them again, I would rather write about style and theme.Sanderson has a knack for putting his protagonists through the wringer (The pits of the Mistborn trilogy is a prominent example), and this ability is on full display in Elantris. Suffering as a pathway to personal transformation is a time honored, some would say cliche, tradition in the genre. Fortunately for us, Sanderson's methods somehow manage to feel real and lacking in cliche. Prince Raoden finds himself in the worst possible situation; an eternal being where eternity means increasing levels of pain, leading to eternal mortification of the flesh and mind. His reaction, to try to bring some order and beauty out of the chaos and muck, sets the stage for a series of outcomes that he could not have foreseen. This is a critical difference between characters in other novels, who perhaps choose to undergo some sort of trial in order to accomplish some great desired outcome (fulfill the Prophecy, revenge the murder of his family, escape poverty, become a wizard, get the girl, etc). Raoden assumed himself to be condemned, without the possibility of recourse, yet still holds true to his own nature.As usual, Sanderson offers strong, yet distinctly feminine, female characters. The women of Sanderson's novels are not afraid to take on leadership, make tough decisions, make their opinions well known, and do the dirty work when required. They are also happy dancing in ball gowns (though they may protest at first) and are happy to be appreciated for more than their intellect, power and character. In that regards, his novels are a natural fit for young women interested in the genre, or for parents who wish to introduce the genre to daughters.In the end, the novel is brought to a satisfying conclusion, and works as a stand alone novel. I am puzzled though why there has been no follow-up to it. There are clear indicators that Mr. Sanderson was thinking about the plot lines for sequels as he wrote this book, but he had proceeded to complete one subsequent trilogy (Mistborn) and start another (Warbreaker). On top of that he is finishing the monstrosity that is Wheel of Time series. It is my sincere hope that he can eventually turn his gifts towards continuing the stories of the characters he introduces us to in Elantris."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Review of Elantris (Brandon Sanderson)--Nicole HackElantris is a completely new kind of fantasy novel; forget dragons, orcs, elves, and dwarves--Brandon Sanderson invents a whole new kind of mythical creature and the fall thereof. Yes, Sanderson tends to be inventive with the names of his characters and places, but once you get them all straight the book really is enjoyable. The book centers around the three main narrators (a prince, a princess, and an evil \\"gyorn\\" who you can't help but root for once you get to know him and his doubts), and the most enjoyable narrative is definitely Raoden (the prince). He woke up one day to find the curse of the Elantrians come upon him--you can't help but cheer him on as a fallen hero who is trying his best to bounce back. You know how in Harry Potter you get to the Quidditch matches or where the characters visit Hogsmeade--and those are like the little pieces of chocolate in a big bowl of strawberries? Raoden's narrative is like that. The other two narratives are a whole lot of setting up and background.Speaking of background...let me whet your appetite. Elantris is a city once full of mythical beings--even the very composition of the stones in the city is mythical and it shines with an inner light. Elantris is in the land of Arelon--where normal human beings became Elantrians--and were worshipped as gods--in a completely random selection process. But then the city fell. The book takes place ten years after Elantris fell, when men have risen to power and are about to war against each other as nations who don't agree with the religious beliefs of the other. The three main characters are all striving for one goal (albeit in very different ways): to avoid war. But war finally comes anyway. This is towards the end and while a lot of the book may be seen is boring the ending more than makes up for it--it's when all the pieces of the puzzle come together and all the hints at special powers and underlying stories come to light.Sanderson aptly describes the political atmosphere of Teod (the city right outside of Elantris) and how the princess Sarene tries to maintain a sense of control and avoid bloodshed. The sense that the peasants and normal people are just pawns in a greater struggle is evident; it makes you feel special to know the inner workings of the three narrators because they are the ones controlling what happens in the story--rather than just being acted upon like some characters in some books.Sanderson's writing is recognizably written from one of those \\"dungeons and dragons\\" nerdy types (you can totally tell), but it's kind of fun to enter his mind and his karate-chopping magic-warped fantasies. Although it isn't of the same caliber as J.K. Rowling, JRR Tolkien, and Ursula Le Guin (his writing doesn't make you care about the story line and characters quite as well as these authors), it is still very passable and enjoyable. Be warned, though: there is a lot of bloodshed in this book (especially towards the end; a.k.a. heads being lopped off, people lying dead in the streets, disgusting rituals) so if you can't stomach it don't read it!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I decided to read \\"Elantris\\" by Brandon Sanderson after it was announced he would be completing the Wheel of Time Series by Robert Jordan. I read information about him and started with another of his books, but decided to read this one first. This ended up being a wonderful decision as this is an excellent book. The story follows three people and their interactions with a mysterious city called Elantris which was once a great city full of power but has since become a place of outcasts.Roaden, the Prince of Arelon, is the first character we meet just as he discovers he has contracted the Reod. (for further explanations of the terms you can visit Mr Sanderson's website at [...]. We're next introduced to Sarene, Princess of Teod, who has come to Arelon to marry Raoden. The third character is Hrathen, a leader in the Shu-Dereth faith. The story follows these three characters as Hrathern prepares for the invasion of Arelon by converting everyone in the kingdom to Shu-Dereth faith while Sarene uses every trick she know to stop him and Roaden tries to make the most of a cursed life in the city of Elantris and figure out what has happened to Elantris and everyone who now lives there.Mr Sanderson does a wonderful job of character and plot development. He devote one change for each character and often you see the same events from each of the three character's viewpoints. Adventure, political intrigue, and magic (that doesn't work) all combine in this book to give the reader a satisfying novel. The plot did seem to get a little slow towards the middle of the book and I found myself wanting the book to get on with it, but overall an excellent book. Elantris is a stand-alone fantasy novel that delivers!Overall grade: A-"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"My husband bought me this book for Christmas, and it was a great gift! The idea of Elantris, a fallen city in need of redemption, and the idea of Elantrians, fallen people who need to be lifted up is a great story. Although it follows the very typical/predictable steps of every hero journey, I was intrigued as to what would happen next.I enjoyed the characters. Although they were a bit predictable, they are likeable and interesting. There were some loose ends in the epilogue that could be hints toward other stories, and I would be interested in reading more about Elantris.The book reminded me much of David Edding's epic tales--only this story was one volume of fast-paced story. It had tales of intrigue and lots of practiced magic like Mercedes Lackey, and it also had a fate and destiny playing a role--like Frodo and Bilbo experience in Tolkien.I highly recommend the book and will recommend it to my high school students as an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"When I first picked up this book, I knew there was something about it that set it apart from the \\"fantasy novel\\" drivel that plagues the genre nowadays. First of all, it was made as a single novel, not trying to overstretch a series into a trilogy from the beginning (Eragon, I'm looking at you! Just because Tolkien did it doesn't make it good). The entire novel gave a sense that, if it was inspired by Tokien, it was still kept fresh enough to not feel like all the ripoffs in fantasy literature today. There was no Dark Lord, no long journey, no orcs and elves and dwarves in the traiditional sense. By dealing largely with political intrigue and religious fundamentalism, this book is a new breath of fresh air for the genre.I will admit that the Raoden's character was somewhat flat, but since this is the kind of book which deals with the ideal hero, that is forgiveable and more than made up by the flaws in the heroine Sarene (with whom the reader sympathizes at the beginning, but wavers as the book goes on with her political manipulation). I would also have liked Hrathen's character to be fleshed out more -- a lot of it seemed rushed at the end.One problem with including any kind of magic in a fantasy novel is how to prevent it from becoming an overused plot device. The AonDor system, and, in fact, all of the city of Elantris benefit from Sanderson's expert forethought, where he established specific rules and limitations on the magical powers that were internally consistant -- and that is the most important thing. The system of how AonDor worked was so interesting that I found myself rushing through the Sarene and Hrathen chapters to go to the Raoden chapters (speaking of which, the book could have used a little work on the former two chapters, because they didn't captivate like Raoden's did).The use of dialects, mention of religious and political divisions and history, and the like gave the book a \\"tip of the iceberg\\" feel that begs for more explanation. It is for this reason that I wish the appendix was more fleshed out to be more than just a listing of Aons; I know that appendicies are overused in fantasy novels, but I would have liked to have descriptions of the nations, peoples, and religions, as well as some family trees so I wouldn't forget how everyone was related!All in all, this is a wonderful book, and I recommend it to anyone looking to go beyond the bland mass-produced mediocrity that is the modern fantasy genre."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Elantris is a decaying city that was once the center of the civilized world.

When Raoden, price of Kae, is taken by the Shaod and transforms into an Elantrian, he is declared dead and thrust into Elantris for eternity.Sanderson's Elantris is an amazingly well-executed first novel. Within its pages one will not find the tired cliches nor the over-used archetypes of the genre. Elantris offers to its readers a new and original world of magic, intrigue, and mystery.

So I figured to myself what heck lets give this guy a try. I did not want to get involved in a multi book series to begin with so I read Elantris. Oh and what a read it was. This was such a wonderful surprise to me. The quality of the writing, world building, characters, original magical system, character depth made me felt like I was reading a seasoned veteran's offering. Someone who has been writing for decades. Someone who is intimately involved with the characters they create and the world they populate them with. Elantris was pure enjoyment to read me. I am moving on to this Mistborn saga before tackling his Jordan books."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I saw this book in a book store and I liked the cover so I picked it up and looked at the book jacket. It looked pretty interesting, but I don't usually buy hard cover unless it's the next book in a series and I've been waiting for it. Because this is Brandon Sanderson's first novel, I'd never heard of him. Then I read the first page...and I couldn't put it down. It's different and very original. There are three separate main stories: Sarene, Hrathen, and Raoden. Sarene is a princess coming to marry Raoden only to find that he had died. In fact, Raoden isn't dead. He has been transformed by the mysterious Reod and thrown into the decaying city of Elantris. Hrathen is the priest sent to convert Raoden's country, Arelon to his empire's strange and dangerous religion. Sarene is determined to stop him and in doing so enters Elantris and meets the deformed Raoden who calls himself \\"Spirit\\". Of course, she and Spirit begin to fall in love and together they try to save Arelon.It's really not that simple, though. This book is incredibly complex in a good way. Even small details that don't seem important are tied together in the end so that everything makes sense. This novel technically stands alone. Everything is concluded, but he leaves a small opening so that there could be second novel ( I hope so!).I liked all of the characters, as well. Sarene is a great female character, very independent and smart. She and Raoden go well together. (I especially like the whole kinda \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" sort of thing where she falls in love with him despite his strange appearance).Anyways, it's just one of those books you keep reading late into the night and when people talk to you while you're reading, you ignore them. And when it's over, you miss it...I love books like that. Elantris is great. Read it :) :)"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Sanderson is quickly becoming one of my favorite authors. Warbreaker was the first of his books that I read, and I was hooked. That's still my favorite of his that I've read (I've also read Elantris and the Mistborn series), all of his work is excellent. Elantris is no exception. I would say that, compared to the rest of Sanderson's work, it's not his best book. But Sanderson's worst book (which is not something I say flippantly, because Elantris is still a fabulous book) is still better than books from almost anyone else. Here's the thing about this book: I can't put my finger on what it is about it that I don't care for quite as much as his other books. I loved the characters...even Sanderson's villains are somewhat likable (or at least understandable)...and the overall story. Elantris was a little bit convoluted, I thought, in terms of plotting...maybe that's it. But even then, I'm stretching quite a bit, because this is still a truly excellent book. I really struggled with whether to give this book 5 stars or 4. If I were to rate this compared to most of the other books out there (and by most, I mean MOST), it would easily get 5 stars. But when I compare it to the rest of Sanderson's books, and some of my very favorite books (The Name of the Wind is my #1 favorite book of all time), it gets 4 stars. Still very highly recommended, and many folks (obviously) disagree with my assessment and would give this 5 stars with no problem. You can't go wrong with anything by Sanderson..."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Elantris, by Brandon Sanderson, is one of the best books I have read in quite a while. Although Elantris was Sanderson's first published novel, it's actually the fifth novel of his that I have read. For those who have read his other works, the strengths and weaknesses are basically the same here with Elantris. But for those who have never picked up a Sanderson novel, I'll go into more depth.From a technical standpoint, Sanderson is a solid, though not spectacular, writer. His prose is not also beautiful, generally flows very well. Further, his dialogue is generally realistic, if not memorable. But his writing is good enough that it enables him to successfully tell his story, which is the real strength of Elantris. Sanderson has created a memorable and sympathetic cast of characters. Raoden, stricken with a terrible, debilitating disease, is exiled from his home country, Arelon, and, despite his pain and suffering, works to build a society with his fellow outcasts (who are called Elantrians, and are quarantined in a rundown city that is sort of like a leper colony). Sarene, a foreigner married into the Arelon royal family, secretly works to overthrow an unstable and untenable dictatorial regime that equates power solely to wealth. Finally, Hrathen, a warrior-priest, has been sent to Arelon with strict orders from his master: convert Arelon within three months or it will be destroyed. As Hrathen struggles to convert the kingdom, he struggles with both Sarene's interference and his own faith. All three characters, as well as the wide array of side characters, are realistic, well drawn and nicely developed (although Sarene is, perhaps, a bit clich&eacute;d).Another strongpoint is Sanderson's world building. He explores religion, philosophy and government with depth and aplomb. Not only has he created several distinct cultures and societies to serve as the backdrop to the events of the book, he actually develops a new society during the novel as well. Indeed, Raoden's part, his efforts to unite the Elantrians (who, in their suffering, have reverted to a more primal, savage existence) into a community, was the most intriguing part of the novel.Elantris is, by no means, perfect. Although it has a few nice twists and turns at the end, the novel is, for the most part, fairly predictable. But even if the conclusion is foreseeable from the start, the journey is still well worth it. Likewise, if you have read any of Sanderson's other novels, particularly Warbreaker, you might notice a strong resemblance between Sarene and his other primary female characters. In short, they are all fairly similar - smart, brave, tough, scrappy, etc. It's great to see strong female characters, particularly ones that are fairly realistic, but because of the overt similarities between the female characters in Sanderson's different novels, Sarene's development was pretty predictable. One wonders, perhaps, whether Sanderson is capable of developing strong female characters that don't fit into this exact mold. The biggest weakness, though, is that the pacing is a bit slow and, as a result, it seems like very little happens for quite awhile. Reading Elantris was an enjoyable experience, but it probably could have been a quicker one.As a final note, some people might be put off by the relative lack of action in Elantris. Although it didn't bother me, the plot is moved primarily by dialogue and political maneuverings. There were a few big action scenes in the last 50 pages of the novel, but almost none before that. I enjoyed reading about Sarene's and Hrathen's plotting and Raoden's society-building, but some might find the novel a little dull.So if you're looking for a novel with constant action sequences, you might want to look elsewhere. But if you're looking for a thoroughly developed, realistic world with a great cast of characters and a strong plot that will keep your attention throughout, do yourself a favor and pick up Brandon Sanderson's Elantris."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Upon arriving in Arelon to marry Prince Raoden, the competent and strong-willed Princess Sarene discovers that he has died. What she doesn't know is that Prince Raoden has succumbed to the Shaod and been cast into Elantris, an uncivilized slum of undead zombie-like people who have no government and no resources. I won't say anything more about the plot, since it's been covered in other reviews.I really enjoyed listening to Elantris on audio (nice production by Recorded Books) and I think it's a great debut. Brandon Sanderson has created a couple of heroes I enjoyed spending time with, and a truly engaging story. But, Elantris had several elements that almost made me cringe:1. Some of the \\"lessons\\" of Elantris (war is bad, zealots are dangerous, women are just as competent as men, political rank should not be determined by wealth but rather by ability, you can do anything if you try) are handled with all the subtlety of a brick to the forehead. For example, the men's attitudes toward women, and the subsequent behavior of the women, are so ridiculously patriarchal as to be unbelievable. If a woman uses her brain, the men (and women) are intimidated by her. Therefore, Sarene hasn't been able to find a husband. Obviously there's a lesson here, but it loses its potency when we see that nearly all of the women actually are stupid and are just as intimidated by Sarene as the men are. Also, when Sarene mopes that she (a princess) hasn't been able to attract a husband because she doesn't act like they want her to, it makes me think that the men in this society are just as stupid as the women are (and why would she want to marry one of them?)...2. ...Except for Prince Raoden and Sarene, of course. They are perfect. Mary Sue and Gary Stu, actually. Though they have been dealt a bad hand, they are super-smart and super-competent. When they act, roads straighten and obstacles move out of the way. The reader has no doubt that everything will turn out right in the end, so there's essentially no tension. However, Hrathen, the high priest who is trying to convert Arelon for his wrathful god and emperor, is a more complex character and saves this novel from feeling too simplistic.3. I didn't believe the political system in which people rise to, and fall from, power based on their income. How long could that kind of system work and what kind of people would go for that? Well, I guess the same sort who are intimidated by Princess Sarene... I also had trouble believing that the people who lived in Elantris never tried to better their lives before Prince Raoden showed up.4. The writing is competent, but some of the dialogue is stilted and there are frequent uses of unnecessary explanatory narrative, such as telling the reader what something implies or when someone was \\"speaking for the first time,\\" or \\"declining to answer\\" or holding their questions or obviously unconvinced, etc. This made for some long passages (usually during meetings) where not much actually happened.Even with all of this stuff that annoyed me all the way through, I have to say that I still loved Elantris. Mary and Gary -- I mean Sarene and Raoden -- are characters to care about, and that still-young-and-idealistic part of me enjoyed reading about the successes that Prince Raoden and Sarene accomplished in Elantris and Arelon. Brandon Sanderson's greatest strength, though, is his creative magic systems. Just as in the Mistborn trilogy, the magic of Elantris is truly unique and one of the most fun parts of the book."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"After muddling through a slew of YA books- and being very disappointed with them in general- I wandered back over the the \\"adult\\" side of the isle and picked up Brandon Sanderson's \\"Mistborn\\" trilogy, which was wonderful. Then, lucky me, he also has this book \\"Elantris\\"- a well told, well written, stand alone story (which is nice, because sometimes I get a little sick of committing myself to 3 to 5 (or in Robert Jordan's case, 13) books to have a satisfying story. Another thing that is nice about this book is that it is a \\"clean\\" read-- no sex, profanity (but, I suppose technically they are using a curse word from their world, but I'm okay with that)--this is a book that I could let my daughter read and not worry about the content. \\"Elantris\\" was a very good read. I now consider Brandon Sanderson one of my \\"yeah!! he has a new book out\\" authors."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I will jump right in and say I loved I Elantris, it was the best, and most original fantasy novel I have read since Michael Moorecock's tales of Elric of Melnibone. Sanderson writes with a dry narrative style that allows the stark reality of his world penetrate the reader imagination. Elantris is refreshingly free of flowery embellishment, or sappy emotional overtones. While the characters in the story suffer, it is a dignified, humble suffering that shines through in Elantris. Along with a masterful use of the invisible style, Sanderson is a genius worldbuilder. Because Elantris is a standalone novel it made sense that Sanderson did not bog down the story with unnecessary details about the world. Arelon and Elantris are wonderfully portrayed, as theya re the focus of the story. The rest of Sanderson's world feels real and definite, each culture is explained well inasmuch as it affects the story at hand.The Magic in the story is one of the biggest assets to the book. Sanderson created a magical system that is based in reason, yet remains mystical. The payoff regarding Elantrian magic is simple and that simplicity lends credit to Sanderson's imaginative process. I thoroughly enjoyed Raoden's discovery , especially because Sanderson made the magic based in notions of science that allowed me to solve the problem regarding AonDor pages before the main character. This is consistent with Sanderson's view that magic in his books is always based in the natural laws of the worlds he creates. As a reader I appreciate the fact the there is no Deus Ex Machina in Elantris. It makes the reader (me) feel like Sanderson is an author who has faith in my ability to reason.Elantris was not a book without its shortcomings. For a fantasy book I felt it suffered from a lack of action, especially a climbing story arc. The first 500 pages felt like a continuing arrangement of point counterpoint by the Sarene and Hrathen. The only point of view that seemed to have a rising storyline was Raoden's and even that was broken midway through the tale, only to be restored later on. The climax finally came in the last 10% of the book, yet it felt totally unconnected to the previous pages. Sanderson end-loaded the book, a huge chunk of the movement of the story happens after page 500. There are very few \\"carrots\\" for the reader in the first three quarters of the book, and without story movement, or action, the reader is left with (the very well written) political intrigue. Which was more than enough for this reader to fall in love with Elantris.My final gripe with the book was the lack of character depth, while I did grow fond of Hrathen, Raoden, and Sarene, I felt the latter two lacked depth and cahracter development, there were both very one note. Hrathern, however, was extremely well written and developed, his inner struggle was a point on which the story hung for me, that along with the mystery beind him made constantly wonder how he would turn the tale.Elantris was a good, bordering on great fantasy read, while I did have a few technical gripes with the story I felt myself slowing down my reading as I reached the end, something that is common for me when nearing the end of a book I love. I just do not want it to be over. I wish Elantris was a series and not just a standalone novel. I am impressed that Sanderson fit so much lore and intrigue into a single volume, especially for a debut work. It speaks to Sanderson's place among the top tier talent of fantasy writers."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"After finishing the Mistborn trilogy, I had to have more Brandon Sanderson. And since I had a 40% off coupon for Borders, I went and bought up Elantris. This book was hailed by everyone and their brother, claiming it to be one of the best works of fantasy in a very long time. Needless to say, I was expecting great things, and Sanderson did not let me down.Elantris has three POV characters: Daoden, the beloved prince of Arelon; Hrathen, a high ranking Derethi priest of a foreign religion; and Sarene, a headstrong princess of Teod. Elantris was the city of gods. It was beautiful, white and shiny, enormous. Normal people would wake up to find that they had been blessed and then they would go to Elantris, where their skin would shine, their hair would be white, and their powers would be limitless. Then, ten years ago, something happened, and the city of gods died, its once beautiful people becoming ugly, hairless savages. The city was closed off, the people scorned and restricted inside its walls. And the blessing would still come, only this time rendering its victims as corpses instead of gods. The people of Arelon then cast the victims into the dead city, never to see them again.Perhaps the most entertaining aspect of the novel is the extensive religious system. Arelon and Teod are the last countries to resist the Derethi religion, instead staying true to their Korathi doctrine. Hrathen has been sent to convert Arelon in three months, and if he fails, the warrior Derethi religion will slaughter the nation. Not wanting the guilt on his mind, Hrathen piously tries to change the country, but he meets opposition from an unsuspecting source.Finally, Princess Sarene is engaged to be married to Prince Raoden, their unity forming a treaty between Arelon and Teod. The two have never met. Sarene leaves her country a few days early to surprise Raoden, to get in some alone time before their wedding. However, when she arrives in Arelon, she finds that the prince is \\"dead.\\" Headstrong and curious, she sets out to find the truth behind Raoden's disappearance.Brandon Sanderson is a masterful storyteller. He knows his story and where he's going with it, even when the reader does not. He will bring things together and leave no unanswered questions. By the end of the novel, I was breathless. The way he brings things together is completely believable. The conclusion was perfect.So, would I recommend Elantris to you? Absolutely. Not only is it an excellent novel from a great storyteller, it is a single, stand-alone work in the fantasy genre. That means that you don't have to wait for the sequels to come out. Unfortunately, it also means that there won't be any sequels... If you want to be entertained, thrilled, appalled, and intrigued, then I recommend this book to you. Although I enjoyed Mistborn more, this book was exceptionally well rounded, balancing story with word usage."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Of course any time you read a new author, it takes a bit to get used to all the characters and writing style. This book took about 4 pages. I really liked it and want more. I am now reading the first of the trilogy Brandon is writing to finish the Wheel of Time. I think Mrs. Jordan picked a quality writer to finish the series. I look forward to reading more from Brandon."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I bought Elantris for two reasons: his extremely high reviews and his taking over The Wheel of Time. Ultimately I knew I would read the next installment in Time, so why not read something by him to see how he writes? At first I was not impressed at all, but then I came so that I couldn't put the book down. By the end of the book I was sold on Sanderson.The first half of the book was rough. Most of the characters were clich&eacute;s that lived in a world that was formulaic. Oppressed peasantry, greedy king and nobility, son who everyone loves, wife who is... You get the picture. The only real thing that set this apart from other fantasies was the city of Elantris itself and the Shaod. This was why this book didn't do anything for me in the beginning, because the book focuses on three main characters: Raoden, Sarene and Hrathern. Starts with Raoden, then Sarene, then Hrathen then starts the cycle all over again. In the opening pages you see Raoden taken by the Shaod and thrown in to Elantris. Then the storyline breaks to Sarene, which has its moments and is a somewhat interesting storyline to follow. Then you get the proselytizing religious man Hrathen and you couldn't care less. So you are forced to read through two chapters before you finally get to why the book is really interesting, only to have to do this all over again. I found myself bored but reading on till I could read more of Raoden. This did not make for a fun read because everything was very surface level. That is until about the middle of the book.Sanderson begins to join the plotlines together and the interaction of the characters ignites a new life to the story. It was at this point that I couldn't stop reading as the plot thickened and moved ever faster, spiraling towards the climax. At this point the characters are no longer formulaic, the writing takes on a life of its own. You read greeily as you follow Raoden and Sarene, you actually begin to enjoy reading about Hrathen, and the story takes a ton of twists that you would not have seen happening. In the end I was sad to have finished simply because there wouldn't be any more for me to read!I'm not sure how Sanderson turned it around but this book blossomed into something that really enjoyed reading. Despite the first half being slow, although still readable, I still found that this was a great fantasy. Normally anything that takes 300 or so pages to really catch my interest is not something that I would care about, but care I did about Elantris. I would definitely recommend this to someone looking to read something by Sanderson. It will not disappoint, provided you can get past the first third to half. A recommend.4 stars"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This is an excellent novel. I spent 2 weeks reading the first past of the novel. This is not to say that I did not enjoy the book, but I was taking in the chapters and letting them dissolve mentally throughout the time period. Once I got into part 2 of the book, the speed accelerated, the dynamics increased, and it became a book that I could not put down. I read the last 200 pages in one evening, whereas I spent 2 weeks on the first 400. There are moments in the story that I honestly did not see coming.Brandon Sanderson is a great talent, and I have previously enjoyed his first Mistborn novel, which is also very well written. This is a must own and a must read. I buy books that I will read and return to the book store for credit on other books if it does not seem to grab me. This will be one of the least dusty books in my collection. Well done, and I look for further reading within Sanderson's universe."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"The only reason I read this book is b/c Sanderson will be finishing the Wheel of Time epic series created by Robert Jordan.I was amazed by how good this guy is. If this is his debut novel, I am confident that he will do justice to WoT. He is way better than the vast majority of the other writers and at the risk of blasphemy I would put him on par with R Jordan and GRR Martin. Definitely above Card, Anthony, Brooks etc.This book was a great surprise, excellent plot, rational and believable characters with understandable motivations. The entire novel takes place over the space of a few months but could easily have the lead book of great new epic. If you are a fantasy fan and enjoyed Robert Jordan, George RR Martin, then you NEED to read this book. You owe it to yourself."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I think Elantris is okay. I fall in the group who, with expectations amped, anticipated an organic fantasy similar to George Martin's. My main complaint: three main characters, two of them are so perfect that their POVs become exponentially predictable (agreeing with another reviewer, there was no inner growth). Otherwise, Elantris will not waste your time! It's a solid fantasy, absent of unanimously-glaring flaws. It's okay...just not so memorable for me."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Sanderson creates a unique fantasy world in the novel. For fantasy lovers who get tired of the same old thing rehashed in novel after novel, Elantris is for you. Sanderson does an excellent job of developing his characters. You see many dimensions to each of his main characters, making even some of the \\"bad guys\\" very sympathetic. Underlying this novel is a message of hope and the idea that even one person can make a difference in the world. There are a few scenes that require a suspension of belief in reality, but hey this is a fantasy novel. Overall, one of the most enjoyable reads I've had in a long time. I heartily recommend it. Check out his Mistborn series as well."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This is narrative as it should be written: sharp, clear, engaging style, original and, one would say, apt to the bigotry-ravaged current times, setting, interesting and convincing characters, tight plot. And this rare thing of a single-novel self-concluding story! This novel has real magic-the magic of the true writer! Don't miss it!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Elantris is an excellent debut. Original, engrossing, and contained in a single volume, this book exceeded my expectations. I would reccomend it to anyone and have added a hardback copy to my collection.Unlike some reviewers, I thought this book was very original in its plot and setting. A world with a rich and detailed history is nicely developed, with religion and philosophy playing big parts to help bring the world to life. While the story takes place [almost] exclusively in the country of Arelon, neighboring countries are described and have unique cultures and histories of their own. This gives the world a large and detailed feel and is an impressive feat for a stand alone novel. As far as the plot, I can't think of another book that I've read that is very similar at all. Some mysterious cataclysmic event took place ten years ago, begining a sort of dark ages for the country of Arelon. The storyline follows three main characters through fairly intense action and deep political intrigue, making for a more than interesting read.As for the characters, Prince Rao could have been more believable, coming across as being a bit too self-assured, but was overall good for the part and likeable. Sarene was definitely my favorite character, being a strong female without too much of the off-putting feminazi dribble common to most similar characters. The main protagonist, Hrathen, is also a great character that sort of grew on me through the book and was richly detailed inside and out.4.5 stars for an original and very enjoyable single volume fantasy!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Elantris was once one of the wonders of the world, with its inhabitants virtual gods, then 10 years ago the city and its people fell in an instant and were massacred in their helplessness. When Princess Sarene arrives in Arelon in preparation for her wedding to Prince Raoden she is disconcerted to discover her husband-to-be had passed away suddenly, but according to treaty she is still considered married.In reality her husband had been taken by the mysterious shaod and been exiled to the rotting city of Elantris. This is a well written, and very original fantasy novel. The characters are all likeable and the villains complex in a well thought out world. It was refreshing to read a stand alone novel for a change, though at the end of it I was a bit sorry that I wouldn't see more of this world I was also relieved that it wouldn't take a sequel to finish this excellent story. I'm looking forward to new books by this author"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Well... maybe this book doesn't need another shining review - but I'm going to give it one anyway! I just finished the Elantris and I had to come here and check Amazon to see what other reviewers were saying. I won't describe the plot, because others have done that quite well --I just have to say this book is an excellent read. It's original, the charecters are well fleshed-out and compelling - it even seems to have elements of a mystery. Almost every chapter ends with a \\"cliff-hanger-y\\" 'ooh - what's going to happen now?' feeling.I'm so glad I took a chance and bought the hardback copy. Write more Mr. Sanderson!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Brandon Sanderson laid out a beautiful world, original and enchanting. I've had problems trying out new fantasy novels that always revisit the same worlds nowhere near as well thought out or well written as other authors who have set the cornerstones in fantasy, but Sanderson more than satisfied a tentative buy. I believe he was able to stroke a new chord, and although I hope this novel remains a stand alone, I also hope he continues to write. The world of fantasy should not be without such an originally creative mind."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I'm a big fan of Brandon Sandersons work, but this one didn't have quite the polish of his others. It got a lot better midway through but some of the characters are a bit insipid and annoying. They become a great deal more interesting as the plot progresses, but that happens very slowly. It probably could have been half as long."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Could not put this book down. So many twisting plots going on and yet each one playing on the other one. Very tender love story among all the intrigue. Brandon has an unbelievable imagination and such a way of verbalizing it. I loved this story. Would make a great movie."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Slow on the action (compared to his later novels), but the world he builds is incredible. Sanderson's storytelling style and sense of humor is strong in this one so fans of his work will appreciate it. Newcomers might not be so convinced, though."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This one is a real winner... What Brandon Sanderson is able to create in a stand alone fantasy is really impressive. I've read quite a bit of fantasy over the years, and I really have to say that the world building you see in this singular book often takes other authors a full trilogy to accomplish. Again, Sanderson introduces an interesting and dynamic magic system, and he weaves through storylines so effortlessly, it's hard to imagine that this was the earliest of his published novels.** spoiler alert **My one complaint, though it's very minor, is that there seems to be no major change resultant from the goings on in the story. Perhaps this simply wasn't covered in Sanderson's attempt to wrap things up, but the world of Elantris SHOULD be a different place at the end of the story, but I don't think that was well developed. The story was certainly a roller coaster - no never would have suspected some things would have happened - but you do feel as though you could have guessed the end result fairly early on. This is only brought up because I feel as though I never would have guessed the endings to the 3 Mistborn books or The Way of Kings. This is certainly an area where Sanderson has improved over time.Again, a great story and certainly recommended to fantasy lovers"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I enjoyed reading the book. I have not read fantasy books for a while, and this was a nice surprise."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Brandon Sanderson is one of my favorite authors for his ability to create new worlds and new characters. This book did not disappoint."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Excellent book thoughtfully written shows honest depth with the characters only disappointment was the fact t h at it took the main character forever to put together the problem with the magic"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This book is not only a story of good and evil, but it is a story of self exploration. Well done Brandon! Everyone needs to read this book!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I love how Brandon Sanderson writes. Great characters and good plots. It took me a bit to get into it but it was worth the first couple chapters to become fully immersed."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I noticed the parallels regarding the nobility class and religion that Sanderson replays in his Mistborn novels, but on the whole--this is a good read. It wrapped up rather abruptly in the last fifty pages or so, and I found that a bit dissatisfying, but it's not bad for a first major novel. The Mistborn series is also worth your time."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Quite enjoyable, but not as densely realized a world, nor as engaging a set of characters as The Way of Kings, which to me is fully 5-stars."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"like the story and enjoy that it is in one book. good characters and enjoyed it.

I have read it 5 more times since that christmas so long ago. And so has my brother. If you liked the Hunger Games you WILL LOVE THIS BOOK! This is a action packd, pages flipping novle with a little romance and a taste of politics.Now stop reading comments and start reading!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Ten years ago the city of Elantris was once a gem of prosperity and virtue. Then it was cursed. Elantrians became like zombies, and the city fell into decay and became covered with slime. A foreign princess, Sarene, arrives in Elantris's suburb, Kae, to wed the prince of the land, but during her voyage, the prince has died. Searching for answers, to the death of her betrothed and the curse of Elantris, and trying to save the country from conquest by an evil neighbor, Sarene gains political prominence and her life becomes endangered.Brandon Sanderson's first published novel is an easy read, with no obscure poetic passages, only light descriptive detail, and vocabulary that is challenging enough for mature readers. In keeping with the flow of the story, there are no sexual sequences, and action sequences are not gratuitously excessive. Characters are agreeably distinct, each with unique identity and color.Sanderson demonstrates an advantage of outlining a story before writing it, rather than blundering forward and writing spontaneously. What I mean is that Sanderson mentions in passing some things that are apparently insignificant. For example he describes something hanging on the wall of a dining room, or he describes a person's behavioral trait. Then, hundreds of pages later, after I've forgotten those things, they pop up again, fitting neatly and impressively into the plot. And he has surprise characters: ones you think you know, only to discover later on that you did not know them. To do that right, the author needs to do some pre-thinking.The novel has attributes that have been criticized, but if they are flaws, they are minor in my mind, and I am not going to lower my rating because of them.One criticism is that too many sequences seem unrealistic and contrived. I say you just need to read with an open mind and with some interpolative rationalization. A second criticism is the presence of silliness; that is, gratuitous levity. I say there is some, particularly early on with the little girl, Kaise, and her twin-like brother, Daorn. But except for some tolerable wisecracking, the levity disappears as the story progresses and becomes more serious. A third criticism is about the neologisms. There are a good number of them, and their meanings are not always immediately apparent. Eventually, however, I understood them all, well enough. I did scratch down some notes as I read, but even without a glossary and precise definitions, the neologisms contribute to the aura of a fantasy culture. An appendix does include drawings and definitions of the magical symbols called Aons.Read responsibly--I mean carefully--forge ahead through forgivable shortcomings of prose, and you will experience worthy moments of creativity, climaxing in a fast-paced, suspenseful conclusion that gratifies."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Yet again I found myself thrilled by Sanderson work and this time about Elantris. Author's first novel delivers such a great story full of mysteries and longings for answer on the questions repeatedly asked. I was totally sucked into book just like in his other novels I read (only Warbreaker left). This one is truly amazing with such a great twists, magic system, internal fights in his characters, hope where there is none and after all epic ending.This one comes as approval why I see him as my favorite epic fantasy writer ever, far above all others."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Brandon Sanderson's \\"Elantris\\" is an amazing piece of fantasy. Make no mistake, this is not necessarily an easy read. There are more politics at work here than action, so this book might not be for those with short attention spans. That said, Elantris rewards those who press on with a very satisfying single edition fantasy epic. And the book IS epic. The characters are very real, each with faults and strengths and each fighting their way through tough situations. The antagonists are both scary and relatable at the same time. The pacing is somewhat slow, but I found that to make the final chapters all the more satisfying. By the time you get to the end (a hefty 600+ pages of small print in the paperback version that I read)you feel totally connected and concerned for the characters. There are a couple of \\"twists\\" at the end - but I hesitate to even call them that because by the time you get there, there's not a big surprise. Any seasoned reader will have predicted these plot turns several chapters in advance. Nevertheless, these events are welcome because they provide the satisfaction you've been waiting for by the time you get to the end.I recommend this book without reservation. It is a great piece of fantasy."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Fantasy is a fun genre, but often you have to commit to 3, 5 or 10 plus books to read the good ones. This is a great, single volume story. Sometimes, in those big epic series, I have to wonder if the author knows where he or she is going. Not so here--it is very obvious this was a well thought out book. The created religions are very well done. It's very tempting to read it thinking about Christian church history...but this is not a veiled re-telling. I love the full use of the x-ray Kindle feature as well."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Brandon Sanderson is a wonderfully original and imaginative fantasy writer. It's like coming home, to read another one of his novels. This was no exception."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Elantris was an entertaining read well worth the time and money. However, it isn't without flaw. A few of the characters seemed too perfect and the solution to a few of the problems seemed too easy. Never the less I recommend this book and all of Brandon Sanderson's novels."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I love the world the author has created. The intricate magic system is implemented excellently.I would love to see more books set in this world.This is one of my reread books. I've even got the dramatized audio version."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Brandon Sanderson, now better known for his Mistborn series and being the author completing Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, made his published debut with Elantris. Elantris has a variety of deep characters, believable and understandable while often difficult to predict political intrigue, a variation of an uncommonly used magic system, and even a little sword fighting, usually with at least one woman holding a blade. Sanderson is one of my favorite authors and while this isn't my favorite of his books, I haven't been disappointed with any of them. I recommend this book for any fan of fantasy."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Loved this, had to buy the book. :-)Sanderson is amazing and I've read everything he has written! He is one of my favorite authors now."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I have read a lot of Brandon Sanderson's work and can honestly say he is now one of my favorite authors. To this date I have read the Mistborn trilogy, The Way of Kings, and this work. Elantris is an entertaining read but in comparison to his other works falls a bit short.One of the main reasons I don't rate this a 5 as I would Sanderson's other books is because I felt less enamored with the characters. There wasn't as much character development and back story to this novel which made it seem less epic as his other novels (although this should be expected in a one-off novel compared to a series like Mistborn or tWoK). In addition the story mentions many other interesting locations like the various Derethi monasteries, Duladel, and Jindo, however you spend very little time at these other locations leaving the book feeling narrow in scope.Despite these quibbles the story and plot is entertaining and I would still recommend the book. In honest reflection part of the reason I may not consider this a great work is because Brandon has set the bar so high with the Mistborn Trilogy and tWoK."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I've recommended this book to several friends, and a few co-workers. It's a great read. I recommend this to anyone looking for a new and interesting fantasy novel."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This was my first introduction to Brandon Sanderson's writing, and I was immediately drawn in by the story and impressed with the author's imagination. I couldn't read it fast enough. As soon as I finished, I went looking for more by this author and found the Mistborn trilogy (which I also loved). Mr. Sanderson is at the top of my list of favorite fantasy authors."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Sanderson's talent for well-thought out plots shines in ELANTRIS. The story centers around the city of Arelon, which is next to a once glorious but now derelict city called Elantris, which is inhabited by humans who once had been blessed with immortality and god-like powers--chiefly the ability to routinely perform incredible feats of magic through the manipulation of magical symbols--but now were the victims of a horrible disease. In true Sanderson fashion, understanding the design and function of his magical system plays a critical role in deciphering just what has transformed Elantris from the glory of the world to the pity of it. The plot hums along quickly and the antagonist is not simply a \\"bad\\" guy who does bad because he's bad. He has a complexity that made him, for me, the most compelling character, which brings me to my only negative issue with the book and why I was only able to give it four stars instead of five. The protagonists are a prince and a princess who both fall directly into the stereotypical roles in fantasy. The prince is unfailingly good-hearted, loyal and compassionate to the people and almost entirely selfless. The princess is headstrong and underestimated by the men, but plunges ahead to quickly take a dominate role in a patriarchal culture. While this served to make me root for them, it didn't make them stand out as memorable characters. Nevertheless, I recommend ELANTRIS for anyone who enjoys fast-paced fantasy with plots and conflicts and ideas that are fresh and this is the sort of debut that bodes well for any author."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"When I first purchased this book I had no idea what to expect. However; after completing it, I can say quite honestly that this is one of the best fantasy books I have read all year. This book is full of believable characters who have depth and emotion. Characters display real emotions and are just as complex as real life. Elantris is a complete story told in just one book. When was the last time that a fantasy story was told in a single book and not in a multipart series? Elantris also has a well thought magic sense which just adds to the depth of the world. Do yourself a favor and read this book."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I hope that Mr. Sanderson continues writing about this world. He has created a beautiful relationship between the prince and princess. They learn something about each other without ever meeting as prince and princess. I enjoyed this book very much."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I loved this book! If I could add more stars, I would. I'm now recommending this book and the author to everyone I know who likes to read the fantasy genre."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Having read most of Brandon Sanderson's works recently (Elantris, Mistborn, Warbreaker) I have to say he has quickly become one of my favourite writers. Needless to say I enjoyed Elantris quite a bit. I would like to give it 5 stars just to boost the rating but I will reserve that rating for the truly special books (Song of Ice and Fire comes to mind). Compared to most other books Elantris is definitely a 5 star effort though.I love the way Sanderson is able to play with the scope of his books. Each of the three books (or series) of his I have read has had a distinctly different feel and scope to it. Out of the three Mistborn is definitely the most epic one (and by far the longest with 3 books in the series) with Warbreaker being somewhere in the middle. Elantris doesn't feel quite as epic as the other two but that doesn't hurt it much.If you like Sanderson's other stuff you will like this, no question about it. If you haven't read anything else by Sanderson Elantris is a really good place to start. The book grabs you fast, doesn't let go till the end and wraps everything up in a single volume. Can't really ask for much more :)"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I was looking for a book with adventure, purpose and not an on going war epic. This book was perfect!

It quickly became apparent to me that Brandon Sanderson could write though. This book seems like it was written by a pro - it has an intriguing hook, a good rhythm, and a cast of memorable characters. Brandon Sanderson accomplishes a great deal in this standalone novel about a fallen society. I recommend you pick it up now. As for me, I'm going to move on to his other books."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"What an amazing debut fantasy novel!I've got to admit, I'm impressed. From the first page to the last, I greatly enjoyed this novel. It is populated by rich, vibrant characters; has a quick-paced plot; twists and turns throughout and is totally unique in it's scope. I would be hard pressed to find more than a couple of fantasy novels in recent years to come up to this level.I think that the plot has been sufficiently covered in the synopsis for this book already. Suffice it to say that I was enchanted with the fresh slant that Mr. Sanderson has taken with the genre. He has created heroes (and heroines) that we can truly root for and villains to despise and hate. A world of magic and chaos and good and evil can be found within these pages. Be warned though, once you pick it up, you won't be able to set it down for long!!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"The city of Elantris is a paradise, a heaven in this realm, but not all are chosen to become Elantrians. Only those who receive the glowing condition that deems them as an Elantrian may enter the city of Elantris and become supreme beings. But then the great change happens, the catastrophe that changes the world forever.After a quick prologue, Elantris opens to a different and less than idyllic world. Those who are now chosen to be Elantrians find themselves physically altered overnight. They awake to find themselves covered in weeping sores, mottled skin, and are unrecognizable by their own family members. They are banished to Elantris, sealed in the fortress of the once great city which has now fallen into disrepair and ruin. Like lepers or the unwanted, they are ignored by society and hated for the way they look and the way they are.Raoden was the crowned prince of Arelon, loved and respected by everyone in the realm. That is until the opening page of the first chapter, where Raoden wakes to find himself doomed to be an Elantrian. His disfigurement is hidden by his father, the king, and he is tossed into Elantris. Inside he discovers a horrific world where its people have given up on life. With this curse, its people no longer need to eat for they are essentially dead, and yet feel the pangs of starvation. Any wounds they suffer refuse to heal, while they continue to feel the pain of the wound each day. But Raoden is still the same person inside, and isn't giving up. In time he begins to change and improve the once great city and the people who have lost all hope.Hrathen is a devout high priest of Fjordell, looking to become the new ruler in Arelon and will do all he can to scare the people into believing and hating the Elantrians even more. He will stop at nothing for his ego and his beliefs, even if it means causing the collapse of the monarchy.Sarene is the princess from Teod who was destined to marry Raoden and form a strong family alliance. But Raoden is in Elantris, and yet through an evil law, Sarene is forced to join the royal family of Arelon. While pretending to be the prim and kind princess to the king who sees little in women of power, Sarene is first trying to comprehend what has happened to Arelon and Elantris, as well as trying to deal with Hrathen. She knows there is more going to than there appears and will need to do something if the kingdom is to survive.Check out the BookBanter podcast featuring an interview with Brandon Sanderson at: http://bookbanter.podbean.com."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Recommended by a friend and has become one of my favorite books. Superior plot, characters, and setting. Exciting plot twists & turns keep you engaged. A must read.Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"ElantrisThis book was a refreshing fantasy read for me. The author writes excellently and I never felt like I was reading something totally unnecessary to the story.The characters were great and well-made with strong personalities despite some of them bordering certain archetypes. However, none feel generic and every single one has a backstory that remains unexplained.The world feels pretty small and the book isn't exactly \\"epic\\" but you get the feeling of doomsday arising from most of the book. The magic of the book was excellent to be honest and shrouded in a certain mystery that doesn't explain every single detail about it. Despite this, in the end, some loose ends about the magic and characters left me with something to be desired. At some points, I felt this boo bordered on becoming overly dramatic. At the end, the author definitely took a risk with the main characters. Some characters sort of popped out too. It felt out of touch with most of the book.Even with these few set backs, I was still able to enjoy the book to its fullest. It goes rather slow near the beginning, but it pulls you in more and more as you go deeper into the book.I can see why some people wouldn't like this book at all and I don't necessarily blame them. The book seems like it was a copy off something at some points. It feels original but cheap at some points. Some things in the story are overdrawn and a lot of the ideas in the book could be called totally uncreative, though I felt his world building was set out to be reasonable within its own bounds and amazing within them too, rather than pull new ideas out of itself every chapter.I enjoyed it and I think fantasy readers who aren't looking for the \\"greatest fantasy ever\\" or reading to be critical can enjoy this book. It is certainly a unique book, but at the same times feel un-unique. Try it. You'll probably like it."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"\\"Elantris\\" overall was a fun, easy-to-read novel that had an interesting premise and a cool system of magic (granted, I've only been reading fantasy for 5 months, so almost any magic will be new to me :) ). I found myself eager to learn how and why \\"Elantris\\" fell from glory, and was not disappointed. This novel did not have great character development, although it was interesting to look at the glossary of letters used throughout the novel (the basis of the magic), and then to connect the letters' meanings to how the characters were named. It was one of those \\"extras\\" that helped reinforce the driving characteristics of each character and how they related to the events in the novel. In general, I felt the purpose of the novel was to tell the story of Elantris, not to tell the story of its characters.No, this is not a spectacular fantasy novel along the lines of \\"The Name of the Wind\\" or the \\"First Law\\" series, which both get high marks for character development and plot. But \\"Elantris\\" does get 4 stars for likability, ease of reading, and innovation."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This is a good start to what i hope will be a long career for Mr. Sanderson. I do have to say that some parts of the novel put me off. At times the dialog just seemed to drag on as a lot of back history was given as speech. Also the names for people, places and things all started getting a little to similiar.One of the strong aspects that made me want to keep reading was the orginality of the piece. It was a totally differnt look at how magic could operate in Fantasy. Also there was a good mix of political and religious intrigue to keep me guessing on what was going to happen.The twists at the end were also a huge plus to make the book better. All in all i have to give this book a 4 star review, the dialog and general slowness of the story keeps it from being a 5. I have ordered the first book of the mistborne series to see how his writing goes from here."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I have become a pretty finicky reader over the years, especially with my favorite genre, fantasy. So I kind of took a chance with Elantris because I'd never heard of it before and it was a debut novel, but I was desperate for something new to read, and the reviews in the front of the book were pretty compelling.I am so glad I gave it a chance. It fulfilled pretty much all the things I want in a good fantasy book: solid plot, good descriptions of geography and ways of life, magic, humor, and of course characters I actually got firmly attached to-- I even really liked the side characters.This book isn't all about action. In fact, the most exciting action doesn't happen until close to the end. But it doesn't matter; it's still a book that you have to force yourself to put down at night in an attempt to get some sleep. This book will probably especially appeal to people who have a thing for well-written politics.Anyway, yeah. Definitely go read this."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I rather enjoyed this book. I gave it 5 stars becuz' I felt that it was a masterminded story with immense mystery and intrigue. I was totally curious as to why Elantris had fallen and it keep me zipping through the pages....it seemed a touch slow here and there-But also I think I felt it was slow only becuz' I seriously wanted to know what was going to happen next-not becuz' it was unnecessary. Sanderson takes his time in places for a reason...it allows the reader to really grasp the reality of the world he created and of course- it keeps one curious as to what in the world is going to happen. ..I also appreciated the character's and their struggles which made them seem human as opposed to some super hero. I also loved that the story has a little bit of romance in it which never got in the way of the main plot....(for all my hopeless romantic friends out there)Anyways, I love it. I place it on the shelf with my favorites and will ever more be thirsty for Sanderson books.Give it a shot...it's worth it."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Elantris is the city of the gods. Its inhabitants have white hair, glowing skin, near-immortality and powerful magic. Once in a while, a random regular person from the outside world wakes up, transformed into an Elantrian, and moves into the city. Ten years before the book starts, everything suddenly changes: the Elantrians lose their magic and are transformed into gray-skinned, magicless wretches. Raoden, the crown prince of Eralon, is also transformed and tossed into the ruined city.This is the very intriguing start of Elantris, Brandon Sanderson's debut novel. From this inspired beginning, he creates a fast-paced and original fantasy novel that never slows down and works its way to a satisfying conclusion.I thought this book was very refreshing because, unlike so many fantasy tomes, it actually has more material than its pages warrant. Sanderson could have easily turned this 600 page novel into a full trilogy, and I'm sure that other writers (hello Tad Williams) would have done so.If anything, the book occasionally seems too fast-paced. Some characters, like Roial and Shuden, could have been fleshed out a bit more (I'd even argue one of them could have been an additional viewpoint character to give the novel some more substance). The fantasy world and its various countries are only very minimally sketched. Finally, the last 50 pages definitely felt rushed, quickly tying up several loose ends. I can't believe I'm actually writing this, but I really think this book should have been longer!Still, this is a very entertaining and relatively original read. The magic system is unique and relevant to the story and the characters, while a bit stereotypical at times, are easy to identify with and don't always take themselves too seriously (something I always appreciate in fantasy). Elantris doesn't read like a debut novel. It definitely motivated me to check out Sanderson's other books."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Just adding my 5 starts to the others. I enjoy fantasy because it allows me to stretch my imagination and relax in a \\"different world\\" with characters I grow to love. This one successfully did that."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"As I started the book I felt it was written for an early teen audience. However, as the book progressed the plot and writing advanced and I quite enjoyed the book. It was a new and interesting premise and held my interest as I completed the book."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Sanderson's first book has a fascinating premise but, as other reviewers have noticed, it is troubled by some common \\"debut novel\\" problems. I read the Mistborn series before Elantris and was excited to read another Sanderson book. For those of you who were disappointed by this book, please give Mistborn a try; the difference is night and day.Elantris has three major threads: Raoden/Elantris, Sarene/Kae, and the Priest/\\"Outside Threat\\" thread. The Raoden/Elantris plot was well-done and kept me engaged in the book. The \\"Outside Threat\\" thread dragged and felt like it was added in obligatorily rather than as an organic part of the story. I ended up skimming some of those parts. I suspect he started with the Elantris premis and the character of Raoden and added on other parts to make it a full story. These problems, as well as characters who are less developed than his later characters, make Elantris a book you should read after you are already a Sanderson fan."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This is my first time reading one of Brandon Sanderson's books, and I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised. Although far from great, Elantris was certainly enjoyable.Unfortunately, though the book benefits from a strong beginning, I thought that the middle was weak and felt slow (there wasn't always a strong enough sense of conflict to keep me hooked) and although the ending was good, it wasn't anything great.The characters were likeable, although I did feel that Raoden was a little too perfect at everything. He was the ultimate good guy, and I found that got to me at times.There were also perhaps a few too many characters for my tastes--by the end, I did begin to lose track of who was who.The writing itself was very simple, but it works to move the story forwards. I liked the triad chapter system (rotating between the three different point of views) but sometimes it felt awkward.Considering this is a stand alone book, Elantris is a really good read. It's certainly brought this author to my attention, and I'll be checking out some of his other work in the future."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"It has long bothered me that the genre of Fantasy has become essentially formula fiction. Most Fantasy can be defined by its setting and plot: in a medieval world of magic, an unlikely hero saves the world from an unspeakable evil. Elantris cannot be said to be a part of this \\"Tolkienesque\\" tradition. The single book epic differs from much of modern fantasy in that the setting has a unique feel that cannot be placed in any single Earth timeframe, and encompasses its own religions, cultures and history. And the plot cannot be described in ten words, which is always a plus.The main characters are interesting and well drawn, to the point where you find yourself rooting for all three of them, despite the fact that the third seems to be working against the interest of the other two.The magic system is not only creative and new, but it is flawed, adding an extra dimension to something that is usually just used as a gimmick.The threat is truly felt by the focal characters and thus the readers, but it is not the world of darkness and slavery warned of by most fantasy authors. Instead it is the threat of the death of an ideology at the hands of a martial nation, converting its peaceful neighbour. At times the reader may wonder why the characters strive so much just to protect ideas, but wouldn't you die for what you believe in? Elantris strives to preserve the truth, to protect the victims of a curse instead of persecuting them, and to overcome a mighty threat to their way of life. That way of life is flawed to begin with, so our heroes must fight not only to stop the invading force, but also to bring around change. An incredible read."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I readWarbreaker (Tor Fantasy)by Sanderson and absolutely loved it. Then I immediately acquired Elantris as well as Sanderson's Mistborn trilogy because I wanted to read more Sanderson. This was a great book and I am so glad that I read it.The story is told from the viewpoint of three different characters. Riorden is the Crown Prince of Arelon and is struck down by the curse of Elantris and thrown into that city to rot with the other Elantrans. Princess Sarene of Teod finds out about Riorden's death on her way to marry him; because of the contract she is considered married even if the other party should die until Riorden's father is no longer ruling. The third viewpoint is from Hrathen, a leader of the Shu-Dereth faith, who is under a deadline to convert Arelon to the Shu-Dereth religion. These three characters maneuver deftly through complex politics in an effort to save Arelon, the people and themselves. Along the way the secret of Elantris is discovered.Sanderson is an exceptionally story teller; and he really excels at these complex epic fantasies. My biggest complaints about some epic fantasies are there are too many people to remember, the plot is too complex to remember, the magic system is confusing, and relationships between the characters are unbelievably dry. Sanderson never runs into these problems; he introduces the people in a way that makes them easy to remember...never once was I confused about who was who. The magic system is explained very well without getting preachy; we discover it along with the characters. The plot is very complex and full of intrigue but Sanderson maneuvers through it with such grace you never have trouble following what is going on.Most importantly Sanderson's characters have heart. At times they may be a little too perfect, but that just endears them to you more. I always thought that the Lord of the Rings could have done better with a little more emotion and love between the characters, same with the Wheel of Time series. I love both of these series dearly, don't get me wrong. Sanderson just gives his characters a penchant for nobility and love that makes them so interesting to read about. There is also some humor thrown in now and then which made this book more fun to read than your typical epic fantasy.I loved that the story was so complete and that it fit into one book, instead of twelve 800 page books. I am impressed with the intelligence behind the plot, the serious moral issues discussed, the humor, the love, the magic...just everything. This book is much like Warbreaker in that is it more about political intrigue than about massive battles.Overall I loved this book. Now I am ready to read the Mistborn trilogy. I also have his Stormlight series on my list to get when it is released. If you love epic fantasy, intrigue, and magic with a touch of romance you will love this book."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"The fact that Elantris is Brandon Sanderson's debut fantasy novel is mind blowing. There is no way I would have guessed this unique and marvelous book was the author's debut. He created such an original world of magic and fantasy. The system of magic found in the book was so well thought through that it almost seemed logical that it was real. Everything from the plot of the story to the descriptions of the places and people showed how unique and powerful Sanderson's vision is. I sometimes found myself thinking I really was in Elantris. Not only were the descriptions of the characters amazing, but also they always kept me guessing. The characters were never who or what they seemed to be.From the prologue Sanderson had me excited to read and had me wanting to know more. The excitement did not stop there, the stories twists and turns kept me hooked throughout the entire book. Whenever I felt I had figured out what would come next I was wrong, however, this made the book better with every surprise. Even with these twists and turns Sanderson was able to keep the writing smooth, the book flowing from page to page.I would definitely recommend Elantris to anybody. It doesn't matter if people are fans of fantasy or not, there will be something in this book for them. Mystery, magic, romance, political struggles, religious tension and fights for equality are just a few of the details of the great plot that is Elantris."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Not the greatest work ever, but very good. It seems to drag at some points, but the mythology and history of the world are compelling, and the characters feel real. Even the bad guys are given back story and motivation. The story draws you in and keeps you interested. It does feel a bit incomplete, like there's supposed to be a sequel, but I guess we'll never get one. The work stands on its own, but never achieves greatness."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I bought this book based on all the positive reviews and expected to really like it. Overall I thought the writing itself was good, but I found the story disappointing and, in some places, stupid.My biggest problem was that the ending was obvious from very early on in the book. Usually, when you see something coming that far off the author has something bigger up his sleeve. That was not the case here. In fact, the ending was far less climactic than I had expected. It was drawn out slowly, then you finally see the part that you were expecting for 3/4ths of the book and it just doesn't live up to the expectation. Even worse, it is suddenly made irrelevant. It's hard to explain without spoilers, but I was thinking \\"you've got to be kidding me. That's it?\\". I loved the Wheel of Time books by Robert Jordan, and the plot twists here paled greatly in comparison. Jordan is also far superior at building tension and making climatic twists at at already climactic points.The rest of the book was alright. Some good parts, some boring parts, and some downright stupid parts. There were a lot of little twists in the story, but most were political and weren't all that dramatic, though some were pretty good though. Unfortunately, like Jordan, he chose to make a female lead character \\"strong willed\\". Not bad in and of itself, but he felt the need to remind us that she was strong willed every chapter. This was mostly don by telling us over and over, rather than mentioning it then having her act that way. He also went over the top in showing us that she was strong willed, which led to the stupid parts I mentioned earlier. At one point she makes a deal with what she thinks is an outlaw leader so that he will not interfere with food shipments. This goes on for a while. His requests are for supplies for his people (tools, clothing, and such). She resents having to make the deal so she gives him what he wants, but in a form that she believes is unusable. For example, he asks for nails and she sends him all bent nails. It made no sense, and she did this type of thing with everything he asked for. If she was afraid of him interfering with the shipments, why risk angering him with these obvious passive aggressive tactics. If she thought that he wasn't really a threat to the shipments, then why make the deal at all. It made no sense. In another part, while she was getting ready to teach her fencing class, she took a dislike to a gentleman simply because she didn't like his type. She then convinces him to show her some fencing from his country. She then uses the real swords instead of the practice swords and proceeds to try to kill him...for no reason....and nearly does. It just made me think \\"That's not strong willed, that's stupid\\".Stupidity aside, the bulk of the book was decent. The slow building and transparent climax that never fully developed left me feeling like I wasted my time. There was a lot in the beginning and middle of the book that had potential and I liked, but it ended up being a let down. I bought Mistborn at the same time, but I have not been able to bring myself to read it after reading this one."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Elantris is Sanderson's first published work. It is a one-volume fantasy novel. There are no sequels to date.Elantris is the name of a once great city that collapsed 10 years ago. Elantrians used to be great beings with magical abilities. The Elantrians became sick, and their magic broke. The normal people freaked out, killed most of the Elantrians, and shut them in their city to rot.Present day, the king's only son and heir, Raoden, wakes up and finds that he has been afflicted by the terrible disease that afflicted the Elantrians. He is sent with haste into Elantris and considered dead. That day, his would be bride, Sarene, arrives from her far away country to marry Raoden. Hrathen, the villain of the story, arrives with the task of converting the country to the true religion. He has 3 months to do this, or else the country will be destroyed.The three characters each have different objectives that they try to accomplish. Inevitably, they are each pawns in the others' big plans. Since the magic system is broken, a major task of Raoden in the novel is figuring out how the magic system actually worked. Politics plays a major role in this novel.The story is told from 3 points of view: Raoden, Sarene (Raoden's would be bride), and Hrathen (the villain). For most of the novel, Sanderson writes in chapter \\"triads\\" rotating through the character's view points.At times the characters and their tasks got a little annoying. Raoden has an interesting task, Hrathen has good internal struggles, but Sarene seems like simply a tool the author uses to move things along. I thought she was rather weak (as a character), a little agenda-driven, and not very interesting. Though she portrayed a strong-willed, independent woman, her character was very static and uninteresting.Overall, I really liked this novel. It has a satisfying plot and, for the most part, satisfying characters."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This is something different in a fantasy. I found it to be a page turner. I can see why Brandon Sanderson was chosen to write the last volume of the late Robert Jordan's \\"Wheel of Time\\" series."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I read this book after Sanderson's two newer fantasy novels - Mistborn & Well of Ascension. Sanderson has got to be one of the more imaginative fantasy writers today. It's hard to believe that this was his debut novel.

If you're looking for a very good 1-volume fantasy novel, this has got to be on your list!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This novel had some fabulous inventive and creative ideas in it. I hope to see better dialogue writing in the next books. Unfortunately, the dialogue was stilted and manufactured (almost painfully so), like one would find in a book for teens 10-14, for those: they would enjoy.The ending more than makes up for the contrived dialogue and slow pace. :) I WILL read more of Brandon's books. I expect him to get better and better."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Originally read this book because I heard that Brandon Sanderson was going to be writting a Memory Of Light the end of the Wheel Of Time series written by Robert Jordan.

They are fleshed out, with enough time and attention given to developing each into a person you want to get to know better. The story is compelling, logical, and thought out.

I have bought extra copies for friends and family."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Before I started reading this book I jumped on Amazon first and read some of the customer reviews. There was one review that stuck with me, the customer commented that he was unable to read once they where about 200 pages into the book and only gave the book a one or two stars. But with so many others commenting what a great read it was I planned on giving it 300 pages. I have to admit, around 190 I was starting to get a little board with all 3 of the main characters, but around 245 to 260 it was back.For my review:Its one of those books where everything happens really easy and fast for the main characters, which is a good thing. It keeps me guessing and there were a few good twists and turns. The last 150 pages or so was a pure page turner for me. I enjoyed the end a great deal, and when I say \\"I enjoyed it\\" it was more then the way the plot line ended, but they way the main character learned about different ways to access the magic. I would love to read another book that would follow Elantris."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"For a stand alone novel, you can't ask for a better read and satisfaction when you finally put it down. The book reads fast, the characters have good time to develop, and you get the feeling the author did his hardest to tie every loose end into a nice little package at the end.This book was my first Sanderson read, and I liked his quick and deep style. I will now move on to his series."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I was in a graduate folklore class with Brandon, which is why I decided to read this book. We didn't know each other, but I was curious about his writing abilities. I was very pleasantly surprised. The plot of this book, though it takes 30 or so pages to get going, is complex and fascinating. I read it in just over 24 hours, and that's while taking care of my 1-year-old! I highly recommend it.Also, before I read Elantris, I had doubts about Brandon's ability to complete the Wheel of Time series (which he was chosen to do after Robert Jordan's death). The Wheel of Time books are my all time favorite fantasy books and I have been reading them for almost 15 years. However, I have no doubt now that Brandon will do an excellent job and may even bring some life back to the series, which seemed to flounder a little in the last two books."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I saw this book in a book store and I liked the cover so I picked it up and looked at the book jacket. It looked pretty interesting, but I don't usually buy hard cover unless it's the next book in a series and I've been waiting for it. Because this is Brandon Sanderson's first novel, I'd never heard of him. Then I read the first page...and I couldn't put it down. It's different and very original. There are three separate main stories: Sarene, Hrathen, and Raoden. Sarene is a princess coming to marry Raoden only to find that he had died. In fact, Raoden isn't dead. He has been transformed by the mysterious Reod and thrown into the decaying city of Elantris. Hrathen is the priest sent to convert Raoden's country, Arelon to his empire's strange and dangerous religion. Sarene is determined to stop him and in doing so enters Elantris and meets the deformed Raoden who calls himself \\"Spirit\\". Of course, she and Spirit begin to fall in love and together they try to save Arelon.It's really not that simple, though. This book is incredibly complex in a good way. Even small details that don't seem important are tied together in the end so that everything makes sense. This novel technically stands alone. Everything is concluded, but he leaves a small opening so that there could be second novel ( I hope so!).I liked all of the characters, as well. Sarene is a great female character, very independent and smart. She and Raoden go well together. (I especially like the whole kinda \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" sort of thing where she falls in love with him despite his strange appearance).Anyways, it's just one of those books you keep reading late into the night and when people talk to you while you're reading, you ignore them. And when it's over, you miss it...I love books like that. Elantris is great. Read it :) :)"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Several factors shape any nation, fictional or otherwise, but three are especially important: religion, politics, and economy. Mr. Sanderson has used all three to set up a world that not only fascinates, but also convinces.And this world is populated with equally believable people. Main characters - including the antagonists! - are many-faceted and complex; secondary characters are well-rounded and distinctive. And never does the illusion shatter. All the people stay in character, with thoughts, words, and actions true to themselves.Part of the experience of reading a fantasy novel is suspending disbelief and entering another world. ELANTRIS makes that easy."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"As a long-time lover of fantasy (including Farland, Douglass, Eddings, Goodkind, Marillier, Rawn, Wurts, Tad Williams, etc.), I have to say that this is the most original fantasy novel I have read in years. I've been in the book business since '93 and was quite impressed by this novel...especially as a breakout work by a new, young author. I read the first line (which I would quote here if it wouldn't break copyright laws) and was immediately hooked. Sanderson does an impressive job of relating the story, characters & world in which they live in a single, richly comprehensive volume. Truly a must-read for every fantasy afficiando."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"A friend of mine recommended Brandon Sanderson's Elantris to me years ago, but I kept putting off reading it, thinking it'd just be another fantasy novel, but boy, was I wrong.Even with my really busy schedule, I managed to finish the book in two days, and thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it. It was very well written, and had lot of interesting twists and plot points. It was also a lot different from other fantasy novels, which made it even more enjoyable."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Typically, I only read an esoteric select few authors that I know from past reading. Of course, to have a past reading, there needs to be a first reading, so, occasionally I try someone new. The cover of Elantris had this testimonial from Orson Scott Card: \\"...finest novel of fantasy to be written in many years.\\" Well, I have never been a huge fan of Mr. Card, but I know some who are and have a certain amount of respect for him. On the other hand, this could just be one of those marketing quotes that authors exchange as rhetoric. Regardless, I took a chance and began Elantris.It started off slow and not much fun. I almost put it down and left it (like the two dozen or so other novels similarly abandoned). A really superior story grabs you from the first sentence and never lets you go as it builds to the incredible climax. That is why this novel does not get 5 stars from me.However, sticking with it for a few chapters, I began getting interested in the characters and in the basic premises of the plot. There is a certain amount of redundant visualization and character building that made me begin to make a habit out of tapping the first sentence of paragraphs and skipping on to more interesting parts. But that may be more me than the story. Or, it may even be a credit to the story that I was so compelled to discover what happened next!Regardless, Elantris does become a page turner where the reader hates to put it down and wants to read \\"just a little more\\". And, it has enough twists and tension building.A enjoyable read. I will likely give Brandon Sanderson another chance for a place in my reading library."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"What a joy it was to finally read a self-contained 1 volume long EXCELLENT fantasy novel. The best fantasy novel I've read this year by far! Sanderson is a fine new addition to the world of fantasy. Only reason he gets 4 instead of 5 stars is because there were several parts within the novel which I thought dragged a bit. This novel is in the same league with The Briar King. Buy it! Read it! Enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I nearly put Elantris down after the second or third chapter. The writing was just so poor I didn't think I could make it through the whole thing. a passage in chapter 2 bothered me particularly. Sarene, a princess from another kingdom, has just arrived in Arelon to marry the local prince who she is shortly informed has recently died. Here's a passage that nearly broke my spirit:\\"Sarene surveyed the busy funeral tent with a critical eye, waiting as Ketol and a few of the packmen cleared a way for her to approach the casket. She had to admit everything was irreproachable--the flowers, the offerings, the praying Korathi priests. The only oddity about the event was how crowded the tent was.\\"'There certainly are a lot of people here,' she noted to Ashe.\\"OK. At this point I very nearly just put the book down. This is just so flat and pointless and stupid. You see nothing of the scene. And Sarene's observation that a lot of people are attending the crown prince's funeral is just ridiculous. You might think that the writer goes on to make a point of this--that funerals are generally small and private in the local culture, or that Sarene is heartless, cold, or possibly stupid. But no. This is just sloppy, bad writing and I'm very surprised that someone didn't tidy this up, being that it falls so close to the beginning.Once the story got going, however, I stopped noticing the quality of the writing. I was far too focused on the plights of the characters and the interesting predicament they find themselves in. Sarene actually comes alive as a clever character, and Prince Roaden's struggle to organize and bring life to the broken souls imprisoned in Elantris is quite enthralling.I never did warm to Sarene's uncle and her various \\"plucky\\" nieces and nephews, who never seemed anything but annoying to me. A few of the plot movements near the end are a bit awkward and unbelievable, but overall the story was quite imaginative and involving.And imagine this! A fantasy novel that actually concludes in a single volume!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Like other reviewers here, I am pretty fickle when it comes to fantasy. It's my favorite genre, but I find it challenging to find original stories that suck me in. All too often I've purchased a book that everyone raves about only to find it collecting dust on my nightstand weeks later. Not Elantris. I was fascinated by the description on the jacket, and the book did not let me down. This is one of those books you're sorry to see end. The characters are believable and easy to relate to. There are twists and turns that keep you guessing all the way to the end. Most important (for me), I looked forward to reading Elantris because it took me away to a very different place, with characters that I would like to get to know. To me, that's the sign of a truly well written book. I can't wait to read Brandon's upcoming works."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Brandon Sanderson's debut deserves great praise for offering the rarest of fantasies: a stand-alone novel. Furthermore, he eschews the classic tropes of fantastical races in favor of a modern-fantasy type medieval world fragmented by religious politics and a mysterious biological plague.Unfortunately, little else in _Elantris_ is as original or promising as the concept. The pace is numbingly slow, especially in the early chapters of Sarene discovering her way through Arelon. Huge passages of expository dialog between her and her Tinker Bell-like floating confidant serve only to dump background information on the reader. Clunky prose repeatedly distracts from the tale. Sanderson's fantasy names are too similar to avoid confusion, often starting with the same series of letters: Derethi religion and Dathreki Mountains, arteth priest and Arelon kingdom, Fjon the priest and Fjordell the religion.Worse still, the characters are shallow modern archetypes--the tables-turned prince and his world-wise new friend, the harsh militant priest, and the perky young princess who changes the world. They react most predictably to the situations they face, and many of those situations seem gratuitously engineered by the author to force the outcome he wishes. The dialog is laughably wooden, lines that real people would never say. \\"'Something just doesn't feel right here,'\\" Sarene tells Ashe at one point, and she's exactly right. Sanderson's concept is wise and full of potential, but his writing is not yet equal to that challenge."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I was very upset that I lost an entire night of rest in order to finish the book. The ideas are refreshing and unique in a genre that has too many rehashes and same-old-plot stories. With one exception (Sarene), the main characters are interesting and enjoyable to follow. The settings and locations are different and well thought out.The plot itself, however, is where the book shines the brightest. The basis of the story is gripping and interesting from the start and the development of the plot flows well. Most of the twists that come are unexpected and made me want to keep reading. As it is, I am wasted as I write this, as I have not slept for almost 40 hours because of Elantris.I look forward to the next in the series and hope it makes me as tired as I am now.Curse you, Mr. Sanderson, for taking my rest from me. May Domi protect you if we ever meet..."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"...the other sections of the book, however, were a bit dull. One third of the book is spent with the prince in Elantris trying to rebuild the city and rediscover it's magic. Another third is spent with the princess learning about nobles and plotting rebellion. The last third is spent with a foreign priest trying to convent the city to his religion. Unfortunately, I found myself uninterested in how much money nobles were making, which king was in charge at the time, and how to get peasants to work harder. I wasn't interested in the squabbling between two priests, which seemed to be unimportant in the grand scheme of things. If I liked the princess and priest characters more than I would have enjoyed the novel in it's entirety. As it stands, I only enjoyed parts of this novel. I have to admit the author is very good at coming up with unique magic systems. That was why I stuck with the novel instead of giving up. The resolve of the Etlantians was admirable, and the mystery of why the magic went bad was enthralling. The rest of the book paled in comparison, it was more like filler. Overall a decent first novel for the author that sets the stage for great things in the future."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I picked this book up after it was recommended to me by several friends. I'm a huge fan of the Fantasy genre, my favourites being Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series, Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time, and Jim Butcher's Dresden Files. This book is PHENOMENAL. If you're familiar with Goodkind's work, think \\"Blood of the Fold\\" meets \\"Faith of the Fallen\\" meets Wheel of Time [but done right!]. Sanderson writes his own lore well, without it sounding corny, and his characters are sympathetic and believable. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in a singular fantasy novel!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"What first drew me to Elantris was the fact that it was a novel of the Epic Fantasy genre, but contained in only one book. Though I don't pretend to know much about said genre, I do know that as of late, 3-9 book story arches are the norm rather than the exception. Tasked with finding a novel that both my girlfriend and I would like (we read together often), I was skeptical at first. She wanted something containing romance/fantasy, and I wanted something scifi-esque. Elantris delivered both, along with a few surprises.Elantris- the city of Gods, or at least beings worthy of worship due to their command over AonDar (read: magic), and their aesthetic beauty. Able to heal mortal wounds, make food from dirt, and make technologies like electricity obsolete, Elantrians possessed it all. That is until the Shaod struck and made beings lesser than animals of the Gods.A decade has passed since then, and so the story begins, telling the tale of Prince Raoden and Princess Sarene, both of whom are to be married to each other in an effort to unite their two kingdoms by blood against a common enemy. Things don't go according to plan, which is lucky for us readers as the resolution of these problems make for a delicious adventure.My hats off to Sanderson as he has impressed me with his fine control over the depth of his narrative. While other epic fantasy authors have the luxury of allowing their story to emerge over 3 or more books, Brandon did not. I was skeptical initially as to whether or not he would be able to do justice to the rich and far reaching story of the Elantrians. My fears were laid to rest, however, as he does a masterful job of it for the most part. I say for the most part because the romance between Raoden and Sarene is very poorly developed and is not completely fleshed out. In one portion they're acquaintances, and in another they are fully in love, with almost no middle ground. I am not sure whether this is due to length restrictions or the author's own inability to write a convincing love story. Personally I believe it is the latter as an extra 30-50 pages would not have been an issue in a book that is already 650+ pages long.As with most books of this type, the distinction between good and evil is very clear and there is little gray area. Elantris is no different in this regard, however, it is easy to empathize with even the villian(s) of the story. Their motives are not always simply one sided, rather they too fight with the ethical ramifications of their actions. As the story plays out, there is appreciable change in the characters' thought process- they all learn from their past and current actions and the situation surrounding them. Sanderson juggles 3 different characters throughout, and does a damn good job of it.I loved this book, and I hope very much that Sanderson writes a sequel that revolves around the main characters Sarene and Raoden. With a unique story line that draws you in from the beginning, and characters you can really root for, I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this book. True, it is not any literary masterpiece, and no it doesn't compare to the level of writing of the greats like Card and Tolkien, but does it matter?. Just because you enjoy caviar doesn't mean cheap candy can't leave you smiling from ear to ear.Plot (8.3)/Character Development (8.7)/Fun Factor (9.0)Overall: 8.6"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Many reviews I've read of Elantris state that it doesn't read like a first novel. I have to disagree. I read Sanderson's Mistborn series first, so I was accustomed to his more mature writing style. Slipping back into Elantris I was able to get a feel for many things that I bet he would do differently if he were to write it today. For one, there is much too much exposition, especially in the first half of the novel. Fantasy novels tend to have a little more exposition than your typical non-fantasy novel since they bear the additional burden of world building, but he really tries to cram a lot in there to set up his book. I got a little tired of him telling us how clever Sarene was through exposition. I never found her all that clever. She was more lucky than anything. He tells us how loved Raoden was by his people. It would have been nice to have seen a townsman talk about that instead of just being told.Additionally, there were a number of things he springs on the reader without warning where a little foreshadowing would be nice. It comes across as if he's changing the rules in the middle of the game. Sarene and Raoden are married even though Raoden died before the wedding. Oh wait, that doesn't count if the king dies, he tells us when the king dies. This happens quite a few times. In fact, he does it twice on page 566 of the paperback. Just for the record, Pirate Crushthroat had once tried to invade Teod and take the throne, and gragdets outrank gyorns. It would have had a better impact if these things had been mentioned previously so that we as the readers could go, \\"Oh, I remember he said that but I didn't see how it applied like this. How clever.\\" Instead we just feel cheated.There were also a few minor details around clearly writing action scenes. On a few occasions, people appeared from nowhere to rescue Sarene. She never sees them coming; they're just there right when they need to be. And in one scene the driver of her coach takes her right into the middle of a battle. Didn't he see the flames and hear the screams from a distance? It made no sense to me.If I'm being overly negative, it's only that I want to provide balanced view of the book against some of the overly positive reviews. (See Orson Scott Card's cover quote for example. Another example of how OSC is one of the more deluded people on the planet.)It did do a number of things well. The magic system is solidly conceived. It's not his most original creation, but it was believable. There was some depth to the culture of knowledge that he created around the magic. It was believable that years of study and scholarship had gone into finding out how to use the glyphs.The city of Elantris itself seemed very vivid to me. I was able to picture the decaying city, a remnant of its former glory. I found these to be some of the more enjoyable scenes to read.Overall I do recommend it to any fan of epic fantasy. However, it does not rank in the same category as Sanderson's Mistborn series or his more recent Warbreaker."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Elantris feels like 2 books to me, one that for the first 550 pages is an amazing study of human relationships, inner conflict, and one upmanship; the last 50 pages involve fast paced action that scratches the surface of the the magic system, leaving the reader wanting more.For this being Brandon Sanderson's first published novel, he deserves considerable praise for the characters he has created in this novel. The setting, the magic system, and even to a certain extent, the plot play second fiddle to the character's conflict (with self, others, supernatural, etc). Brandon has done an excellent job placing you in the minds of the main characters, whether it is Sarene trying to deal with insecurities, Hrathen dealing with inner-conflicts, both of them trying to manipulate others or Raoden trying to play a god.I have a few minor complaints about Elantris. The first is that there are a few plot twists that you cannot see coming. I like when a story hints at a plot twist allowing the astute reader to guess the twist beforehand. The next issue I have is that Raoden does not have any apparent flaws (yes, I saw the relationship between him and the god-like Elantrians throughtout the story). Finally, I feel the magic system does not really get explored till the last 50 pages and even then the book hints that it is far deeper then we have been told. I read somewhere that Brandon may create another book in the Elantris universe that explores a minor character (please be Galladon) from this book - I hope this is the case so we can find out more about this magic system.Overall, this is a very strong first outing by Brandon Ssnderson. I applaud him for creating great characters and I cannot wait to read my way through the Mistborn trilogy.I found out about Brandon Sanderson because of his involvement with Wheel of Time series, I ended finding a great new author to read."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This first novel by Brandon Sanderson is without a doubt one of the best standalone fantasy novels I have read to date. The world that he has created is truly unique yet has the feeling of having been influenced by ancient mythology. The plot develops in ways that could not possibly have been predicted by the reader, seeing as there is not hint of cookie-cutter fantasy going on here. The characters were engaging and not simple black and white, good and evil driven. The only issue with the characterization that I had was that Raoden and Serene were not nearly as interesting to me as Hrathen. Hrathen went through the most interesting changes and development throughout the course of the book, constantly questioning his faith and if he doing is really right, or if it is just what he has been trained to do his entire life. This perspective was unique and appreciated. The evolution of Raoden was also extremely interesting and I always couldn't wait to pick up the book and find out more about the effects of living in Elantris and how Roaden and his growing influence would work to combat its' effects.An excellent book that is definitely worth the read, and a quick and easy one it is."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"The exclusive novel \\"Elantris\\" quickly places Prince Raoden of Arelon at a disadvantage, he wakes up after the Shaod changes him into an Elantrian. While not fully clarified what initiates the random curse on assorted individuals, the Transformation (once considered a blessing) presents problems within an unstable government where wealth establishes position. However, the Arelon Kingdom survives ten years without a dedicated military or its sole protector of Elantrians from invading armies or roving brigands.The novel shifts between three characters, Prince Raoden, the Teoish Princess Sarene, and antagonist Hrathen, a Derethi gyorn (priest) from Fjorden. Although not strong with military maneuvering or deep characterization outside the main characters, the straightforward plot mixes politics with religious manipulation in a magically depleted realm. Originally symbols or Aons drawn in the air controlled a mystical force but after the eerie affects of the Shaod Elantrian's lost the ability to channel magic.The optimistic book would be acceptable for young readers since it isn't gruesome or excessively explicit. A detailed map of the significant terrains and comprehensive appendix including the mixture of distinctive words would have been useful.Check out the author's web page at http://www.brandonsanderson.com/ for excellent inside information and deleted scenes (he provides warnings before any spoilers).Thank you."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"The city of Elantris is peopled by beings of wondrous powers, god-like in their beauty, power, and magic. Their touch could heal, turn dirt to gold, and turn stone into bread. That was ten years ago.Now, the city is fallen and in decay, it's inhabitants are decrepit outcasts. The world is threatened by a powerful enemy, the last allies are gathering, but with each failed effort, the threat seems to grow greater. As bad as it seems, however, the threat is hidden and closer than it appears.A stand alone fantasy, Elantris takes a while to build. In Sanderson's style, however, and he takes the time to create depth, develop characters, and introduce the roots of a conflict that will not be resolved until the last pages of the book. Resolution in Sanderson's style the revelation of a mystery behind the conflict, and Sanderson hints at the mystery through out the story. Because of the mystery, the plot is more satisfying, the story more enjoyable. More than just enjoying a story, the reader guesses at the clues along with the protagonists.In addition to a clever and well developed plot, Sanderson creates characters that are interesting and believable, not to mention colorful and diverse. His plots and characters live in a world of struggling religions, and though the names and doctrines are not the same, the conflicts between them are not unlike those in ours. All together, the world has a depth that brings it out of the flat pages of a book and give it depth and texture.One last thought: one thing I liked most about this is that the characters were not black and white. Not all the characters were good and not all were evil, but even those who seemed on the antagonistic end of things was redeemable in the end. In our real world, people are rarely black and white, and I appreciated that Sanderson gives his characters the same depth.I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good fantasy read."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Pros: Author does a superb job at world building. He introduces a few different concepts with ease. He also does a decent enough job at creating different characters to fit into this world - some of them more effective than others.Cons: Some of the writing falls into the category of telling us, rather than showing us. For example, there might be 5 or 6 paragraphs stemmed together that really don't do much for the story, but rather rehash or explain something. I'd much rather gain this understanding through dialogue or by characters' actions.Also, much like one of the main characters - some of the dialogue is a bit awkward and almost computer like. But overall, it is a good read to fill in the down times. I will likely buy one of this other novels in the near future."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This book is excellent in storytelling and pacing. The worldbuilding is excellent, and I kept reading to the end to discover the answer to the puzzle of Elantris.My only disappointment is that I didn't really bond strongly with any of the characters.

Overall, it was well worth reading.Genre Reviewshttp://genrereviews.blogspot.com/"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"A very good fantasy that doesn't include clich&eacute; elves and dwarfs! I loved how this book incorporates politics, religion, and magic so seamlessly. The creation of magic system of AonDor and the revelation of how it became corrupted were well done and very creative (the glossary w/ pictures of various Aons was a very nice added bonus, as was the map). Even though I like the fact it was a single volume fantasy (these seem so rare that I picked up this book just for that reason), this book has left me wanting more (especially answers to the questions asked at the end). Can't say this is a fault, and wouldn't mind reading a sequel (even if it takes this book of the short list of stand alone fantasies)."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I think a hundred pages could have been easily edited from this novel. It would have helped the pacing."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Having read Sandersons Warbreaker earlier this year i was excited to read another single volume fantasy novel. I assumed that the story would be a solid read seeing as it has had solid reviews and a 4 and 1/2 star rating. I was dissapointed to say the least.The politics of the story is my only gripe, but a big one no less. It seemed that the first 200 pages were bogged down with nothing but Victorian era intrigue and politics. This is interesting if spread out in a span 100 pages, but the book seemed to focus more on the manouvering of several groups to gain the throne of a kingdom and less and characters and a true story.Extremely disapointing. I have to say that I intend on reading his Mistborn trilogy but with lower expectations than I previously had."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Tolkien wrote tales of a place that supposedly ahd been real, and were half faerie tale. Martin writes gritty fantasy based on a historical period. Erikson writes tales of war. Now joining those grand graets of the fantasy is Brandon Sanderson, creating a unique kind of fantasy. Sanderson writes a tale sort of like Greek mythology, with buildings' faades covered in coulumns, a secret way the king does things, and an invading force coming for holy reasons.This book is a huge tale of basically what is crusade and welling crusade. It reads like a George RR Martin, fused with Orson Scott Card. If you have read neither authors, Martin writes as said above gritty fantasy that has a made up world inhabit a time period much like Wars of the Roses, while Card sci-fi. You may notice that Card comments on this book, one of the reasons I picked this up. However, if you are a fan of Robert Jordan, and think that all fantasy is incomplete if it's not like his books, then forget about this, big time.Storyline:Prince Raoden of Arelon wakes one morn to find he has been struck by the Shaod, a mysterious occuring that used to turn you into an Elantrian who in the old days were gods. It still turns you into an Elantrian, and makes you have to go to Elantris, but it doesn't make you look pretty, or be like a god. It makes you ugly and painfully immortal. Princess Sarene of Teod comes to marry him, and finds him \\"dead\\", or so his father says. She looks into this, suspecting maybe even a murder. Hrathen, a warrior monk from Fjorden, comes with the choice of destroy Arelon, or convert it, and is going through decisions and thoughts towards that question.Pros:-Well written, great prose and fun charcters.Cons:-None except that after six hundred pages, all the main character can do to kill is point at them and mutter something.MSL"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Thought I'd give this one a try after hearing it was a single, self contained fantasy novel, without any dark lords on dark thrones needing to be defeated by a band of heroes. Unfortunately though, the writing just wasn't very good.The dialog was quite weak and unconvincing, filled with thinly veiled exposition trying to pass off as natural conversation, and most of the attempts at witty banter had me rolling my eyes. The twists at the end felt extremely forced and just didn't make sense to me. There's tons and tons anachronisms (having characters think about things like \\"metabolisms\\" seems kind of out of place in a medieval setting). And finally, the main characters were just too perfect in everything they do.They succeed at everything they attempt, always insightfully seeing the truth while everyone else around them is too dumb and clueless. They never falter in their optimism (even when they've been doomed to eternal damnation, living indefinitely in an undead state where pain never goes away) they never swear, they never say anything they'll regret later. They're perfect paragons of virtue. They aren't human and I felt no sympathy for them.Many of these complaints can be applied to 90 percent of the fantasy out there, so if you enjoy most of these kind of stories, you probably won't have any complaints with this one, (I've certainly read worse). But if you're hoping for something more along the lines of A Song of Ice and Fire or The Lies of Locke Lamora, don't bother with this one."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"The best part of this novel is its premise. Within its fantasy nation, a mysterious phenomenon caused regular people to become elevated to near-gods, almost-immortal creatures with great inherent magical power. These beings used their powers to provide for all of the basic needs of their nation -- food, shelter, security. Its society was, in fact, fairly utopian.Ten years ago, a catastrophe ended all of that. The magic stopped working, and all of the immortals suddenly transformed into zombie-like creatures: unable to die, yet not alive -- and unable to heal, cursed to eternally suffer the pain of any injury. After a period of chaos, the nation re-emerged as a feudal kingdom, in which rank was based upon income, and in which the transformed are confined to the crumbling ruin of their once-grand city.The novel begins with Raoden, the crown prince, awakening to find himself transformed.There are three main characters -- Raoden, Sarene (his betrothed), and Hrathen (a high priest). The novel rotates among them, devoting a chapter to each, until all of the viewpoints converge near the end. Rarely is the same time period covered twice, though, and the device generally keeps the plot moving along.Politics plays a major role; much of the story consists of the lead characters attempting to manipulate others in order to achieve their disparate goals -- which often conflict with each other. The intrigues are handled fairly deftly, and to the author's credit they never become boring to read.The same can't always be said for some of the other things the characters get up to. The characters often dwell at length upon the past, sometimes quite repetitiously -- Sarene's troubles in pursuing romance, in particular, are brought up many times throughout the course of the novel.The characters themselves are fairly likable -- even Hrathen, who serves as a major antagonist, is motivated by a desire to help the people of Arelon. That said, though, they're also fairly bland. An idealistic young prince, a smart and fiery princess, and a scheming but compassionate priest -- none of these exactly breaks the archetypal mold. It doesn't help that the former two feel a bit out of place in this setting; their egalitarian attitudes, and the arguments with which they present them, feel very modern.There's some inconsistency of plot as well -- it's generally well-executed, but there are major plot points that are never really explained. They're brought up multiple times, foreshadowed, and then forgotten -- left to the sequel, I'd normally say, except that there isn't any sequel.For its faults, though, this is still a very enjoyable novel. (I'd call it 3 1/2 stars if I could.) The writing is clear and evocative; the world is well-realized and quite detailed; the pacing, while it stumbles occasionally, generally keeps the reader drawn into the plot. It's a competent debut and very imaginative fantasy, and it makes me want to read his later work."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"After all the glowing reviews, I thought I would pick up Elantris by Brandon Sanderson. I can't believe this guy actually teaches writing, this is one of the worst fantasy novels I've read in recent years. The characters aren't just badly-written or one-dimensional - they do not behave in any believable fashion. The female protagonist, Sarene, does and says the most ridiculous and stupid things, yet she declares herself at every turn to be a bold, crafty and intelligent woman who somehow intimidates and outfoxes all the men surrounding her - when the reality is that she comes across as petulant and foolish as a 2 year old child. Yet somehow all the people who surround her are contrived to respect and admire her as being soooo intelligent. It's irritating beyond belief when an author doesn't actually know how to write a character in such a way that she would actually portray those qualities, instead relying on the character declaring that she possesses these qualities of being such a political genius (when she is in fact just about the most stupid character in the novel), and then magically all the surrounding characters treat her with deference and respect she clearly hasn't earned. She essentially is the smartest idiot in a group of absolute morons, and that is not interesting in the least.The chief antagonist in the novel, Hrathen, is only marginally better. I think Sanderson intended him to actually have a character arc, where the audience will see him as the villain at first, but slowly seeing through his eyes the audience is supposed to become more sympathetic, and by the end of the story arc he has redeemed himself and changed his intolerant views and become something of a tragic hero. Well, that's not how it works out. He starts out as the stereotypical intolerant and evil high priest of the inquisition who is bent on converting everyone to his religion (or slaughtering them if they don't convert) - anyone who reads fantasy has seen this character-type a thousand times before, and always better done. The problem is he doesn't change in any believable way, he just randomly seems to shift personalities. His character is so one-dimensional that when he suddenly changes allegiance at the end of the novel it has no impact and makes no sense (beyond bringing confusion to the scene). Then he gets a quick death scene that is almost laughable. Sanderson should do himself a favor and go read George RR Martin's books (specifically Jaime Lannister) to see who to write a believable character who can change his personality from antagonist to tragic protagonist over time in a way the furthers the character and the storyline.The one character in the whole novel of any real substance and worth is Raoden, the protagonist. He has his faults too, but at least his storyline is somewhat interesting, and his actions make some sense at least. Early in the novel Raoden contracts a magical wasting disease and is cast into the city of Elantris (which was formerly a great city of magic but ever since a catastrophe ten years in the past when magic suddenly stopped working, has become essentially a city of lepers, shunned by the rest of society). nearly everything Raoden does in the first half of the book - learning to survive in this city of the magical-lepers, adapting and rising to prominence, organizing the other afflicted, and researching more and more how magic works and why it failed - is interesting and kept me reading. Eventually Raoden succeeds in figuring out why magic isn't working anymore and puts it all right, but unfortunately when he leaves the city of Elantris and goes back into the regular world again he becomes as stupid and un-interesting as everyone else.The author writes like a 14 year old boy who has never experienced a real romantic relationship and doesn't understand even basic strategy. The various kings and princes and priests and nobles and other people in power are all absolute morons when it comes to strategy, and the battle-scenes are some of the absolute worst I have ever read in any fantasy novel, ever. If it weren't for the one storyline (that of Raoden in the city of the lepers in Elantris) I would have thrown this book down in disgust and possibly even demanded my money back from the bookstore. As it was, Raoden's storyline was enough to keep me reading until the end, but I would not recommend this book to anyone else.I've heard this was Sanderson's first novel and that he gets better, but I can't bring myself to actually purchase any of his other stuff (now that I've been burned once, I'm very unlikely to buy any of his stuff again). I know that he's writing the last volume(s) of the Wheel of Time series from Robert Jordan, and I've heard from others who have read it that he does quite well, so I may make an exception and pick that up, but otherwise I'm going to steer clear of this author in the future. It amazes me to see all the glowing reviews here, so obviously my opinion is not the majority, but nonetheless I thought this was a pretty bad novel (bad enough that it made me want to go online and post a negative review, which I hardly ever do)."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I purchased this book because I always love checking out new authors, especially in the fantasy genre because it's always cluttered with 10 book series and the like.I just finished Elantris last night and can say it is fair to say it is a decent book and a good debut from a new author. Many praise this book because it is a single volume in a genre filled with trilogies. While it is refreshing for an approach like this, I feel that it actually the root of some of the novel's shortcomings. Here are the problems I had with the book.1. Average dialog. Because fantasy themes are very similar, I always look to the characters to bring something interesting to the table. Unfortunately, the characters in this book were fairly stereotypical in nature and didn't have realistic flaws for the most part. The dialog also seemed a bit too modern in many ways for my taste. It was almost an anachronism in many cases and felt a little unnatural. You had the good natured/popular/charismatic leading man (Raoden), you had the villain who at the end learned the errs of his ways and finally turned to good (Hrathen). I do commend the author on his approach with Sarene and not writing her like a basic princess, although I felt she had large amounts of masculinity, she didn't feel like a woman to me by the way she thought, spoke, or her actions.2. Rushed third act. Now I know that the final acts should always have a faster pace than others, but this one was extremely quick. I felt like I was drudging through all the history and world-building in the first act, then the story concluded in a matter of moments at the end. I feel that is this book was another hundred pages, the pace may have been more consistent with earlier acts; either that or shorten acts 1-2.Now the good things:1. Good world-building. Sanderson has creating a unique system of magic and the nature of things in this book. While at times it felt like more of a D&D; setting than a realistic world, I admire his unique approach. I really liked the story behind the city of Elantris, and how he linked the basic nature of the world/universe to the magic and explained how it worked.2. Chapter construction. I really do like the fact that Sanderson rotates whats going on with each character in the chapters. You're never stuck on one character for very long which keeps the reading fresh.I really did enjoy this book, I just felt it was necessary to be a little more descriptive of what was wrong with it because there are so many 5 star ratings when I don't believe it deserves that. It is a nice first novel and I look forward to seeing Sanderson hone his skill in future books."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Haven't had a chance to read it yet, but it arrived very quickly with a small stack of books I ordered at the same time. (Warbreaker, Alloy of Law, and Wild Cards)."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I read Elantris after reading Sanderson's Mistborn trilogy, which I loved. I realize this was his first major publication so I didn't expect Mistborn quality, I did however expect more than I got.The story starts off strong, the characters not so much. Raoden was an enjoyable character, he was hard to imagine though. His role was that of the good guy, but one that was too good. He was too perfect, fighting every injustice, always looking towards the future with a vision and plan to far reaching for the other characters, especially given his circumstances. Sarene was much harder to enjoy. She played a vital role but you ask yourself, why? She was the extreme of curious, suspicious, and sleuth. I just don't feel that anyone would act out to stop those she saw as an enemey (and she saw everyone that way)with so little motive. Hrathen was a good character, I can't complain about the way he developed.The story progressed well for most of the book. I was always intrigued about what had happened to Elantris, the political ramifications of Shu-Dereth on the world and the secret abti-king club. The build up for the climax was present. I think the buildup was so intense that it fell flat during the climax. The solution to Elantris's problems was rather simple. Not to the characters in the book but why not to the old Elantrians? They knew the secrets of magic and the meaning of the symbols so I felt it was a bit of a stretch to use that as the reason AonDor stopped working. Then the final battle after magic is restored was a let down. A few spells and then getting beat down the block by the Derethi? The whole book is based on how amazing the magic and powers of the Elantrian \\"gods\\" were and that was barely explored when it was fixed.The book felt incomplete and the ending felt so rushed as though there were a page limit and Sanderson needed to wrap it all up in just a few chapters. So much was missing that could have made the climax and on great.This hasn't turned me off from Sanderson, his Mistborn series is amazing, I would even read another Elantris book if he ever decided to continue the series, this one however left more to be desired than it fulfilled."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I'm usually a little hesitant to read an authors first novel when it is published after subsequent novels prove to be a big hit.Often, it is merely an attempt to cash in on new found popularity by publishing a book that is better left unknown.But this is certainly not the case with Elantris, Brandon Sanderson's first book , only published in the UK in 2011.It is a wonderful fantasy novel that drew me in and kept me reading through the night to find out what would happen next.The book begins with a prologue that describes the city and inhabitants of Elantris, both magical and beautiful at the same time. Anyone can become an Elantrian via a random transformation called the Shaod.But something malfunctions and the Shaod becomes a curse instead of a blessing, Elantrians are no longer wise ans powerful beings. They become diseased and loathed by everyone else. The Shaod changes them both physically and mentally, few survive for long. Those touched by the Shaod are flung into the ruined city of Elantris, there to continue their miserable and painful existence.One morning the Crown Prince wakes to discover that he has become a random victim of the Shaod, his rank does not save him, he is exiled like all others afflicted by the disease.Coincidentally , the princess of a neighbouring kingdom arrives soon afterwards to marry him. Sarene finds out that the terms of their betrothal mean that if either of them dies before the marriage, then it will be judged to have taken place. Sarene is a widow before she becomes a wife.The third and final main character is a warrior priest. Hrathen is determined to convert the people to his religion.I found that each of these characters brings a great dfeal to the story.Raoden, the prince is struggling to come to terms with what has happened to him and refuses to merely lie down and die.The princess is not the usual fantasy princess, but neither is she a caricature figure of 'the heroine who acts like a man'.She has common sense and intelligence enough to keep it hidden, but also makes mistakes and is occasionally a vulnerable figure who never quite fits in with the nobility.The priest starts out extremely dogmatic about what he needs to do, but it is interesting to watch his character change as a consequence of the religious fervour of those around him.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, all the protagonists became real to me and the clever way in which the author ties it all together was refreshing.I understand that he has almost promised to write a sequel and I am looking forward to it eagerly."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Sanderson has quickly become one of my favorite authors, and I've read all his novels. Elantris, although definitely showing that it was written by an inexperienced Sanderson, is a quality read nonetheless. Interesting plot, relatable characters, very cool magic system...what more could you ask for in a fantasy book?The only reason I gave this four stars instead of five was because its plot revolved more around politics than action/magic. While most good fantasy novels do include a political subplot as part of the book, pretty much all the conflict in this book is a matter of who can influence the right people, be diplomatic enough, uncover conspiracies, lead in times of trouble, etc. To be sure, there's still action and magic, but the (very cool) rune-based magic system isn't actually understood by the characters until the end of the book; they take the whole novel to figure it out...when they do, it's awesome, but still. I guess it was a nice change, but at the same time, I do expect a little more adventure and action in a fantasy book.Despite this minor shortcoming, this book is definitely worth a buy. Not only is the story itself filled with intrigue and suspense, there are some larger issues that it explores. Also, the ending--while fully conclusive and satisfying for a stand-alone--sets up for possible sequels, and I believe that Sanderson mentioned in his blog that he wanted to write a generational-type sequel in the near future."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Elantris is the first novel by Brandon Sanderson I have read and I am now keen to read more. The story is highly imaginative and richly detailed.In places I feel it possibly lost it's way in a story sense but overall when all is said and done I was very satisfied. The characters were generally enjoyable and there are moments of real suspense in Elantris itself where an atmosphere of danger is successfully created."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Elantris by Brandon Sanderson is the sixth fantasy book I've read from this author and never once has he disappointed me. Well, he's not about to start with Elantris. This guy just has a gift to create beautiful fantasy worlds but not only that, he knows how to tell a damn good story to go alongside with it!Story wise, Elantris is quite interesting. There's not a whole lot of action in the book save for the end but the intrigue is still there. The book has three main characters in Raoden, Sarene and Hrathen. The author takes turn writing each character's perspective in each chapter. So chapter 1 would be dedicated to Raoden, chapter 2 would be for Sarene, chapter 3 would be Hrathen, chapter 4 would be Raoden, and so on. Eventually, the characters cross path with one another and the real fun begins. The Elantris story is mainly one of politics as Sarene and her companions try to find ways to oust gyorn Hrathen from converting the city of Kae to the Shu-Dereth religion. All the while, Raoden is stuck in the city of Elantris trying to make sense of what went wrong with the once great capitol. Hrathen mean while, tries his best to convert Kae into believing in Shu-Dereth before it will be too late for the city. Basically, there's a lot of plotting and trickery involved.The cast of characters is interesting to say the least. Supporting characters like Galladon, Kiin, Roial, Eondel, Shuden and Dilaf all chip in to make the story more exciting and keeps the story from getting too bland. Raoden is your main protagonist and does a very good job in making you root for him and his cause. However, I just wished that he interacted more with the citizens of Elantris than just Galladon. In the beginning, this did happen often but later on, it's if Galladon and Raoden were the only citizens left in the ruined capital. Sarene is the typical witty princess that I'm sure everyone will fall in love with. Dialogue between her and Seon Ashe can be downright hilarious at times. At first I thought Hrathen to be the typical zealot. Slowly but surely, you see a deeper side to him and you'll wrestle with yourself deciding whether or not what he's doing is right or wrong.In the end, I don't believe Elantris is Brandon Sanderson's best work but even then, it's still a fantastic read. I was a little disappointed in the ending mainly because not much was said about the Elantrians and Elantris itself. I wouldn't count this as a \\"rushed\\" ending but more closure would have been excellent provided this is a stand alone story."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This is a great fantasy novel with a strong lead female character. BS gives his usual high quality attention to the details of the world and the workings of the magic. BS tells great stories of characters and their interaction with a very physical world. I have enjoyed other books by BS, particularly The Way of Kings, only to be horrified at the end to read he plans to write 10 books in the series at one a year or so. This story was as enjoyable, and them much more so because it has a proper beginning, middle and ending. The characters are likable enough that you might want to read a prequel and a sequel, at least about the heroine. There is already enough said in the cover notes and blurb here, so i won't describe the plot any more. If you like fantasy with imagination and logic, strong female and male characters, and a story with a fully fledged ending, then this is a great choice."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"First, yes, you should read this book - if you like classic, original fantasy. If you're looking for the sexy vampire/sexy werewolf/unwilling female protagonist meets magic storyline, look elsewhere.The more reviews I write, the more I feel that I have to explain my reviewing standards when assigning my stars. First, to me, 3 stars means a solid, decent product worth buying. For me, 5 stars means an AMAZING earth shattering product.Elantris has many five star qualities. I definitely felt that the premise behind the novel was original, refreshing and kept my attention. The idea of a perfect society that crumbles due to a mystery affliction and the struggle of the main characters to detangle their kingdom's problems was wonderful. I can't believe that I didn't discover this author and his books before. I also believe that some of the character development was well done, even if I didn't like them. I found the prince, the gyron, and the princess most interesting, although I found the princess somewhat unpleasant. She was pretty much the only female character (the other women have very minor roles) and her character was built up to be this awesome person...mostly because of how she was able to penetrate the male crew because she is so assertive, dominant, etc. I don't think these are wrong qualities for a female, I just felt that she was lauded for them because they are masculine qualities in this book.There were qualities that detracted from me assigning this book an overall 5 stars. The pacing of the novel was slightly off. This did not kill the book, but wounded it. The beginning was fine, but the middle dragged, and then the ending was super rushed. I also did not enjoy the frequent POV changes. I was dying to read more of what the prince was doing in New Elantris, and was rushing through the middling intrigue of the gyorn and his crew. I also felt that there were some unresolved issues in the novel. We know that the prince's mother is dead, but there's no backstory to that. SPOILER - sort of - we read of one person's love for their child they left behind when they are quarantined, but ultimately this situation is not neatly resolved...which made me sad. In addition, we know that the people had complete reliance on the magic of Elantris for everything. When Elantris went away, the people were not self sufficient enough to survive. The novel doesn't address this major problem, especially in light of the fact that other nations are threatening Elantris.Much has been made of how wonderful it is that Elantris is not a trilogy, but a stand alone novel, and I agree this is nice. In the end, I felt that there was enough of an unresolved threat hanging over the people that it seems as if though there should be more to come. So these are the reasons for the 3.5 stars, which I rounded up to 4."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I enjoyed this book. It's definitely not as good as Sanderson's later works, but it's reflective of his fertile imagination. I loved the premised and enjoyed the plot. The characters were just okay and the ending wrapped up a little too neatly, which is why I don't rate it higher. Don't let the overhyping spoil it for you. It's a fine, middle-of-the-pack fantasy."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This is an awesome first book by Mr. Sanderson. He brings a refreshing originality to all of his stories.

I will be reading more by this author to see what else he has."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Wow what I book. It normally takes me a handful of hours to a day to read a book but this one held on to me for a week! It was captivating at first but then I got a little board. These are epic books like Lord of the rings and Eragon's last books, with lots of explanations and character development. I started skipping around the chapters where the bad guy narrated and just wanted to get to the meat of the book. Very rarely where Raoden's chapters boring and I wished the rest of the book could have been like those chapters but it sounds like this book is just the beginning building book for more to come. I don't think I will be reading many more Sanderson's books, not because he is not a great writer but he is a little out of my zone I like to read. I did fall completely in love with the two main characters who really came alive for me and were soooo well developed. I was actually very stressed at the end of this book wondering how this was all going to end well. A good writer can do that, taking a perfect mess and making it all come together and end well is a tough thing to do. There was violence in this book and I would not recommend it to a younger reader. Probably 17 and up but only because of the violence and sometimes freaky things that happen."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This was purchased while I was on Christmas break. I have the kindle edition and read the entire thing on my phone. It was that enticing. ***NO SPOILERS CONTAINED IN REVIEW***To hit the highlights:- The story is original. Original system of magic (very intriguing), original characters, original world, original political environment, etc. etc.- The characters are fun and, for the length and nature of the book, are well established. You get to know the significant characters as the story line progresses, learning about them through their actions and beliefs. I don't remember a single point in which the story stopped moving to focus solely on character development.- Fully contained experience - their is a resolution to the major conflict(s) while still leaving an opening to return to Elantris for more adventure.- Easy read - as I said, I read it on my phone. I've marked this as a book for my son to read when he gets a little older as an introduction to fantasy literature.I bought this after being exposed to Sanderson in the Wheel of Time (just finished reading the final book - another good series if not a little long). I was thoroughly impressed with his ability to blend Jordan's world with his own thought, being true to both. I honestly felt that his books were among the best in the series, though, one must also consider he was writing the conclusion to a complex and extensive history and was benefited from the extensive notes Jordan left behind. Still, Sanderson is one of my favorite authors after reading Elantris. He did great with the WOT, but this author obviously stands on his own right well before that ever happened."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I like that this was not hard core Fantasy.

I hope to see many more in the future."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"As Brandon Sanderson's first novel, \\"Elantris\\" is, in many ways, one of my favorites.It has all the elements that I have come to expect from a Sanderson novel. A novel magic system; wonderfully created world, that comes alive as you read; a theme of self-reliance and spirituality; strong, noble hero and heroine.The magic system is discussed more than seen for the first 2/3s or so of the novel, and is based on runes and symbols drawn in the air or on the ground. Only \\"Elantrians\\" have the ability to perform these magical feats and they are created at random, there is no control over who becomes Elantrian and who does not. There is only one problem, the system is broken and rather than becoming godlike beings, the Elantrians become zombie-like creatures. They can be cut, yet do not bleed, and their minds and bodies slowly rot around them.There are more political battles than physical. Still the depth of the world and the liveliness of the characters will keep you interested in the story, as much as any magical battle would.The most interesting character in my opinion is one of the villains. I think Sanderson did a wonderful job of making him one of those villains that you can sympathize with. He is much more complex than either the hero or the heroine. Of course, he is not the only villain and the others are relatively typecast, but Sanderson knocked him out of the park.Another nice thing about this fantasy novel is that it is relatively self-contained. Too many fantasy novels are simply one piece of a bigger whole; whereas \\"Elantris\\" is a simple tale. It could however, be spun off in sequels if Mr. Sanderson so chooses.The biggest theme in this work, and one that I am seeing throughout Mr. Sanderson's novels, is a theme of self-reliance in both material and spiritual matters. The main hero discovers that one way to off-set the pain of become an Elantrian is to keep occupied with work and purpose. The main villain struggles with discovery of self in his spirituality, and the heroine finds strength though accepting herself.For a debut novel, \\"Elantris\\" tales one some pretty big philosophical questions and can at times read like an allegory more than a fantasy novel. Still, it provides for a few hours of entertainment and if you are looking for a beginning point to Mr. Sanderson's work, I can think of no better place to begin. In fact, I wish I had began here rather than with the \\"Wheel of Time\\" series because I feel like Mr. Sanderson's personality and philosophies on life really shine through here.I also hope that he decides for some sort of sequel, especially since we only get to see Elantrians in action in the last section of the novel and he sets it up for a continuing conflict between two religions and peoples, as well as two distinct forms of magic. Plus, I would love to spend more time exploring the wonderful world Sanderson has created in \\"Elantris\\"."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Great book, great writer, I cannot get enough of Brandon Sanderson.

I wish he would write another book about this world because it's so well done and I want to read more!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Elantris was beautiful once.....Elantris and I really got along. I mean, I really expect a lot from my books. I need to enjoy the story, be intrigued by the plot, feel uplifted by the themes, bond with the characters, feel smarter at the end than I did at the beginning, and not be offended at the violence, language, or sex. The less these elements move me, the less I care about the book. The stronger the book is in all these areas, the more I'll like it. There are a few books that massage me just right in all these different ways, and these are the books I don't forget. These are the ones that land on my personal greatest-ever shelf. So, when I say me and Elantris really got along, I mean in every aspect important to me, Elantris got it right.In fact.....I loved reading it! Elantris is told from from the point of view of the three main characters, Raoden, Sarene, and Hrathen. The chapters can be grouped into groups of three--each main taking turns to tell what's going on in their part of the plot. Raoden is the crown prince of the kingdom, and he has been stricken with a mysterious condition that causes his own father, the king, to secretly banish him into Elantris--the gigantic city formally inhabited by magical, god-like beings--and tell everyone that his son has died. Sarene is the headstrong princess of a nearby kingdom who was sent to marry Raoden as part of a treaty between the kingdoms. Unfortunately, she learns of Raoden's death only after she arrives for her wedding, and despite the prince's. passing, the treaty still holds. She is now married to a dead man, and decideds to make the most of her circumstance by embracing her new kingdom and working to prevent the rotten king from destroying the kingdom and inviting war. Hrathen, the creepy-priest-from-a-foreign-land, is the bad guy, sent to the city by his boss to cause the kingdom to fall from the inside by converting the people to the religion favored by the country that is set on taking oven the world.Brandon Sanderson takes these three stories, throws them in a blender, adds enough plot twists to make you motion sick while reading, sprinkles his own carefully crafted system of mysterious magic on top, and serves up this remarkable book. It stands alone--its not the first book in an epically long fantasy saga. It was everything I want a book to be. I recommend it to all.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Good story, as with other Sanderson books most of the action happens at the end. The beginning was unusual, but effective."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Awesome book. Sanderson does a great job with creating a new style of magic. Great characters and a good complete story."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"The book is written in Brandon's characteristic style and has elements that appear in his later books, such as Mistborn. Since it was written at the start of his career, it makes sense it wouldn't be as complex as his later work, but it is still a good book. If you liked it, I recommend reading the Mist born series. It will blow you away!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This review was originally published at [....]If at first the many 'funny words' (Rao, Shaod, etc.) and names of places (Fjordell, Arelon, Teod, etc.) seem overwhelming, do not fear. They are a necessary part of creating a world that is truly a whole world unto itself: complex, strange, absorbing. That world is like a heavy duty paper towel and YOU, dear reader, a hapless puddle of juice on the counter.You are going to get sucked right in.First of all, the characters. Like the Mistborn trilogy, which you may remember I loved, Sanderson's characters are larger than life in terms of good and evil. Or at least, they appear that way, until you realize they are truly human... even the ones who aren't, or not fully anyways. They are simply thrust into very extreme situations.Raoden, one of the main characters, is the perfect example. Though he is trapped in soiled, squalid Elantris by the Shaod (that's when you become an Elantrian, it happens at any time to any person), he doesn't let his exile into the city of the damned slow him down. Instead, he devotes himself to helping the people of Elantris.As the book goes on, we discover through the other characters outside of Elantris that Raoden's entire life had been so devoted: to helping those less fortunate. Though we see him as others might - a good natured guy, almost light-hearted were it not for the whole eternal damnation thing - we start to know him as he truly is. A prince. In the best sense of the word. You want to keep reading if only to keep this wonderful person in your life.Outside the walls of Elantris, the world Raoden fought so hard to improve is crumbling. When Elantris's magic suddenly fled, leaving the Elantrians ugly and damned, a new religion sprang up to fill the void. The Fjordell people use this religion as an excuse for world domination, and with no magic Elantrians standing in their way, they're pretty close to succeeding.They didn't account for a tall and gangly Teoish princess standing in their way, though.Sarene is such a great character. Watching her operate, slipping through the cracks of the court to get closer to the truth about Raoden (her betrothed, who she's been told is dead) and to protect her country from the Fjordell, is truly a pleasure. She's like James Bond, only better in every single way. Plus she's cheeky. And imperfect. And just wonderful.The real gem of the book, however, is the person you'd least expect: Hrathen, who is leading the Fjordell charge into the country surrounding fallen Elantris as a missionary, offering conversion before the murderous and inhuman invasion force makes its way in to kill the unholy. You will dislike him so much it is not even funny.And then...Well. You'll just have to read it and find out!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Elantris is a really interesting premise. It is a little slow at first, but I promise that reading it is worth it. It is, as always, really well written and chalked full of humor and surprises. Highly recommended with a cup of cocoa!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Before I bought this book I read some of the reviews for it. I love fantasy books, and this appears to be an original idea very well thought out by the author. The characters were solid and likeable and I would buy other books by this author. However, I was a bit confused with some of it (ie chasm, what chasm?). It may be I never realised there was a chasm in the pictures. It was an interesting book and very easy to read otherwise."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"As a reader with a formidable collection of books of this genre, I am always looking for something that isn't \\"typical.\\" This book had an interesting plot and was not the typical fight, fight, fight, kill, dragons, gnomes, orcs, elves, and dwarfs. While I am a fan of all of those, this had a different twist, was very creative and different. More clerical that many. I enjoyed it very much. If I want all the other kind of books, I'll dig back into my beloved Dragonlance and Forgotten Realms, or Wheels of Time (which, btw, Brandon Sanderson is completing with Robert Jordon's notes and is doing an excellent job). A refreshing and different twist, well written and I enjoyed it a lot."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I have to agree with another reviewer who said his biggest disappointment is that there no additional novels in this world to be read. That being said, I do love the fact that it was a single novel with most issues being resolved at the end. The reason I have rated this a 4 rather than a 5 star is related to the resolution. The first 85-90% of this book (I'm a kindle reader) went along at a good pace, however my issue is I think the ending was rushed. Given it was a first novel, it is understandable that everything is not perfect, but I think I enjoyed these characters and the new world so much, I was just a little sad to see it all end so quickly...."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"The only thing bad I have to say about this book is that it ended. I felt a bond with the main characters as well as the minor ones. I felt the story was not only unpredictable but well written and unique. You have to read it to understand."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I generally avoid fantasy novels, but was assured by people I trust that this one was different and well worth reading. I now heartily agree. What I most appreciated was the thorough discussion of somewhat similar faiths differing in one flavor offering convert or die as its only argument, with others (and secular alternatives) seeking Truth, rather than only victory. This has obvious relevance to our own world, as does the idea of one culture being briefly so powerful and advanced that it feels able to ignore threats better not ignored."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I am extremely happy with this book. I had an extremely hard time putting it down, or rather, stop listening to it. I had the audiobook version and it was incredible. The world itself was great, the characters were meaty, and the inner/outer dialogues really added to the story. Great political environment as well."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"One volume fantasy stories are not that common.Well written fantasy is not either.Elantris succeeds at both.Some character are a bit cliche (the Prince, the Princess, The priest) but they are likeable and have more depth that it appears at first."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I started with the Mistborn series, then went on to Elantris. I actually like this better than the final mistborn.This had a the complex world we have come to expect of Sanderson, the great characters, the focus on gods and religions and magic and rebellion that we (again) expect of Sanderson.I'll give it a 5 out of 5 (since that is what amazon.com asks us to do...work with five stars).I'm looking forward to reading his latest tome! dk"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Wonderful novel that I had a hard time putting down. It is very refreshing, especially the Raoden storyline. The concept of enhancing your world and finding the beauty within it was inspiring and so contrary to other authors in this genre that seem to focus on the negative and provide immature writing. Only one issue kept it from being a 5 star... the ending fit together a bit too neatly and quite too easily. This is especially true since characters learn patterns almost instantly that took Raoden a long time to learn (and he is supposed to be gifted in the process). Several other \\"miracles\\" occur as well. The story also beggars a sequel or two, and is left feeling a bit incomplete... Hopefully Sanderson will return to this world at some point as there is still much left to explore."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Great book. Yes im only nine but this was a great book. My mom read it and convinced me to read it. long wonderful book."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"The population of Elantris, once the capital of the land of Arelon, has become a powerless society of tortured souls. Although unable to die, after the city's magic inexplicably broke 10 years ago the city has fallen into disarray. When a curse strikes Prince Raoden of Arelon and he's imprisoned in Elantris, he refuses to surrender to his grim fate. Raoden strives to create a society out of the fallen and to unlock the secret that will restore the city's glory. Meanwhile, Princess Sarene of Kae, Arelon's new capital, who was betrothed to Raoden sight unseen, believes Raoden has died. Sarene is officially declared Raoden's widow; she must use her political savvy and wit to protect Kae from evil forces. Sarene must protect Arelon and Kae from Hrathen, a leader of the creepy Shu-Dereth faith, who aims to either convert Kae or destroy it within three months.The beginning of Elantris was slow as the plot built up. I didn't find Brandon Sanderson's writing to be that good. However, partway into the book I really got into the story and I looked forward to finding out what would happen next. I enjoyed Elantris and I'm planning to look at Brandon Sanderson's other books."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Elantris suffers from a tendency to submerge its' reader in fantasy names (a la Robert Jordan), which can become awfully confusing after a while. If you can ignore that, or have a great memory for these things, it's an outstanding book. The story revolves around three separate characters; the prince, the princess, and the priest (I would use names, but this was alliterative.)Raoden is the prince. He doesn't have much character development, but that's alright - he was likeable anyway. Winning over Elantris, the slimy city of the damned, is his task throughout most of the book, and since he literally cleaned it up real good, my womanly instincts applaud him wholeheartedly.Sarene is the princess. She does a lot of political scheming and meddling and all that good stuff. Honestly, it gets a little confusing for non-politically inclined people, but a strong amount of action pulls it through.And Hrathen was the priest, and also most developed, character wise (even if I didn't wholly approve of him.)Despite all the warbling above about the book's flaws, Elantris was actually incredibly well-done. It was original - the writing was serviceable (could have been prettier and flowier, but it got the job done) - the characters were solid, if a trifle perfect. I'm looking forward to more from Sanderson in the future. Maybe I'll even join his forums and be a rabid fangirl - who knows?"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Nothing short of invoking some metaphysical value can truely attribute towards the quality of this book. This book is a prime example of the road that modern fantasy should look towards."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This book has such a rich plot and a wealth of characters. The story is entirely unique. I couldn't put it down once I picked it up."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Elantris tells the story of a fallen city where the inhabitants were once beautiful and possessed magical abilities. The city and the inhabitants fall from glory when the Elantrian people lose their magical abilities, their skin turns a hideous color with dark patches and any wound the receive will never heal. Elantris is a very well written novel, and is a very enjoyable read. It is filled with politics, action, and some great new ideas. I thoroughly enjoyed the book, but was somewhat disappointed in the ending. I kept expecting an awesome revelation about what caused Elantris to fall- with all of the the scheming and such taking place, I was hoping for something more interesting than what was presented in the book. That is my only complaint against an otherwise great novel. Definitely pick it up."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"We listened to Elantris Part 1 during a 10 hour drive. This amazing story made the trip go by so fast. The sound quality, the effects and the multicast performance was incredible. We look forward to enjoying the rest of the series and will be purchasing other titles from Graphic Audio!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I picked up Sanderson's \\"Elantris\\" after having read his latest book (Warbreaker). This is certainly not as good as that book, but it's still darn good (especially for a first novel). As with \\"Warbreaker,\\" Sanderson has come up with something unique as the driving force behind a book's universe. Ditto in that the book is entirely self-contained, is well-described, and has several unforeseen and clever plot twists.My biggest problem with the book is the pacing: the first half of the book drags. There are a lot of things being developed, but not too much actually happening. Then, at the midpoint, things pick up dramatically (and even more so at about the 3/4 point). Also, there are one or two places where the main characters seem to have brain failure and fail to grasp something when all the pieces have finally been laid out in front of them. Finally (and most trivially), for no reason I can come up with, I had a tough time keeping the characters' names straight. The names are sufficiently different from each other and, for the most part, even follow a cultural naming scheme. But, I was constantly trying to keep name attached to character.Regardless of those gripes, this is still a very good book and I rate it at 4 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"During the first several pages I had my doubts about this book, but based on the reviews I'd seen I read on and am certainly glad that I did. Elantris is an inspiring story of triumph sprinkled with a little bit of mystery, adventure, humor, and romance. I enjoyed this book so much I read the Mistborn trilogy (My favorite trilogy of all-time). I can't wait for Sanderson to finish The Wheel of Time series. He has a knack for wrapping things up nicely: the one thing Robert Jordan always struggled with."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I loved everything about this book. Interesting story, great character development, and it all comes together at the end. I don't gravitate towards happy endings, but I don't dislike them either. While it was relatively easy to know where the book would go eventually, there are delightful plot twists that make the inevitable journey an interesting one. As an added bonus, several of the twists are completely unexpected. Absolutely worth reading."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I will admit that I initially started reading this book only after finding out Brandon Sanderson was going to be finishing the Wheel of time. That said, however, I thoroughly enjoyed Elantris. The characters were interesting, and the plot was unique. The very premise of what are basically living zombies, and the mystery of why that isn't understood until the very end is in my opinion expertly crafted. I realize this ir fairly bare bones, but saying too much would give away many interesting story points.Regrettably there are a few flaws. The ending is a bit more rushed than I would like, and gets hectic very quickly. Also, Sarene, one of the three main characters can be such a Mary Sue at times that it can get grating. Otherwise, great novel, particularly for a first try."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This book was just Ok. In some ways it was very unique because of the setting but I found the characters to be too perfect with no flaws which made them a little boring. I found myself trying to hurry and get to the end for the big climax which was again unique but it didn't make up for the lack of character development."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I like the concept of Elantris and I bought it because I really liked Mistborn (another novel) and Orson Scott Card raves about it on the cover...This is a good idea that overstays its welcome. There is no forward momentum to the story. The merchant-king angle does not remain logically consistent. You have these brilliant businessmen who have no common sense. Tons of exposition in the dialogue. Then the ending is rushed through with several 'revelations' that seemed a bit convenient.Read Mistborn, which is a very worthy novel by the same author."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This book was surprisingly good. I picked it up on a whim. After reading the first chapter or two I was hooked. There's just something about his writing style that made the pages fly by.Though I'm not partial to changing characters to describe what's happening, he stayed focused on three main characters which enhanced the story. This book was such an easy and pleasurable read. I've already recommended it to my friends. Too bad there's no sequel.Overall I give this book 5 stars. I can't wait for another one (if there ever is one)!!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I'd like to begin by saying that I am a lover of fantasy and sci-fi. Brandon Sanderson's book; Elantris has a good story to tell. It is an interesting world and the characters quirky and held my attention. BUT - the book cries out for editing; both copy editing for spelling and grammar errors, and story editing for his use of language. Sanderson takes great liberties with words; both their meanings and how he uses them to construct sentences.His map is vague and difficult to understand - which are countries, and which are areas, what is annexed, what isn't..the book only adds to the confusion.All of this was so distracting to the storyline that i put the book down numerous times, thinking i wasn't going to finish it. I admit, I still haven't completely finished it.I thought from the glowing reviews that this would be a really wonderful book. But these flaws kept me from enjoying it. Please, Mr. Sanderson, get your book edited by someone competent. It will really make a huge difference."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I expected a lot more of this book. The story is interesting and there are some original ideas in the setup and plot. But the writing was a big letdown to me, and I never really got into any of the characters. \\"Flat\\" is the best description I can come up with. Wouldn't recommend this book to friends."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Although Elantris has a great storyline and a well sketched out main character, the perspective of the story keeps shifting over to people you dont give a damn about. While desperately wanted to get back to Raoden, you have to get through about 60 pages concering Hrathen and that feminist women who I can't remember the name of at the moment. That being said, the whole while you are reading the story you're practically DIEING to get back to Raoden, but are forced to sit through the social views of Princess Feminist and bad boy Hrathen I myself stopped reading 500 pgs in."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Let me first point out that Elantris was Brandon Sanderson's debut novel. That said, one can tell.Let's start with the good:The book was looking like a definite 2 for a variety of reasons (which will be detailed below) until the very end. As Sanderson's books go, Elantris's ending (though expected and a bit drawn out) was appropriate and well constructed (mostly). After struggling through an only passingly interesting ending to Warbreaker and a downright disgusting end to the Mistborn trilogy (though book 1 had a fantastic ending) I was relieved that Elantris finished strong-ish. Of course, this was likely due to the fact that the entire tone of the book set up for a soft and easy to write ending.The not so good:However, despite the better than expected ending, Elantris was not one of the best books I've ever read. That's not to say it wasn't mildly entertaining but I will never be compelled to read it again. There were just too many frustrating things about the book.Such as:I'll start with the most frustrating part of the book: Sarene.I love books with strong, level-headed female characters. That's why I liked the first Mistborn so much and hated the rest of the series. That's why I periodically re-read Pride & Prejudice. That's why I feel the contempt the authors wanted (I believe) to convey when I read Daisy Miller & the Great Gatsby. That's why I hated the French Lieutenant's Woman, Love in the Time of Cholera, & the Name of the Wind.Sarene was an attempt at just such a character. A poor attempt that fell flat. She is just too extreme. There is little to relate to on any level. She is always right about everything, immediately finds the right answer to any problem (usually within moments of having it posed to her), knows exactly how to play every person she meets, gets the best of every confrontation, rarely has anything backfire on her, and (the best part) pretty much single-handedly re-engineers an entire society. All the while deciding that it is her divine calling to throw down with Hrathen the moment she sees him, being able to divine his every motive (or at least broad strokes) with relative ease. Her overly-headstrong, unforgiving character makes her one-dimension and by the time Sanderson tries to humanize her with \\"flaws\\" and \\"doubts\\" they ring hollow because they are overcome a scene later when someone tells her how fantastic she is. Reading characters like that is just plain uninteresting. (8/10 on the frustration meter)Other difficulties:1. The book is riddled with questionable (possibly nave) plot points. Examples:a. The easy and immediate acceptance of an Elantrian (supposedly accursed and shunned by the entire city for 10 years) as king.b. Telrri, a bad guy with a disfiguring birthmark. Or, more accurately, his \\"Hey, I'm a bad guy\\" mark. Unnecessary.c. The classic hole-filler moment: \\"Oh, by the way, the main bad guy has a special power that makes him resistant to the Dor. I haven't mentioned that yet but I have to make this scene more impressive so there it is. Boss fight!\\" This particular point was ridiculous and unnecessary. Late additions like that are...just downright appalling. (7/10)2. Every major revelation in the book just seemed too easy. The characters connect the dots on complex motivations or cause/effects instantaneously. Something will occur and the very next sentence will be \\"Oh, well this must be why\\", a supposition that is usually spot on. The author needed to take a step back and let the characters breathe. (6/10)3. At times the writing dragged on. There were unneeded scenes and paragraphs that added nothing but page length. Not surprising for a first book but still frustrating to slog through. Scenes like:a. The masquerading as a Dula was just stupid and unnecessary (not to mention that a supposedly feeble Elantrian with allegedly atrophied muscles suddenly dancing around during swordplay was incongruous).b. The women rising up to try to fight off the Derethi...I understand what Sanderson was trying to do (women are strong, yay! Sarene made them all independent!) but the tangential undertone was never properly developed and therefore rang hollow. (5/10)4. Sanderson's efforts at witty repartee strengthen as the book moves along (and it is genuinely funny at times) but too often it falls flat. Especially Kiin's twins. They are insufferable, boring, and not particularly believable. Thankfully, Sanderson pretty much abandons them as characters early on. (4/10)5. Galladon. Dear god. Has there ever been a more annoying character? \\"Kolo\\" every third word and all kinds of faux words that sounded very Spanish. Honestly, this character came across as more than a bit racist... (Note: I'm not saying Sanderson is a racist. Far from it. I'm claiming he leaned on stereotypes a bit too much at times). (4/10)6. The world just isn't as developed as I expect out of top notch fantasy. That said, it was a first book. Of course the fact that this book begins to follow what I'm beginning to see as the standard Sanderson baseline for his worlds (tangible gods v. intangible god) was a bit disappointing. I'd like to see something new out of him. (1/10)7. Hrathen was an interesting character but his sudden professed \\"love\\" for Sarene (with whom he hardly interacts) falls flat. It was pathetic, shallow, baseless, and unnecessary. (1/10)Overall, this book reads exactly like it is: a first book that provided Sanderson a foot in the door. Not a bad thing but it kept it from being anything other than a mediocre book. It earned every bit of a 3 rating."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Started this because I'm Jordan and Stanek fan. Stanek has written much about once great races and peoples brought to the end, to the last, and Sanderson's style of moving from one vantage point to another is something Stanek masters so well. Like Stanek's works, the story doesn't revolve around a single problem, rather a number of problems. Ultimately, the story of the Elantrans, and their once great race is deep, with plenty of plot twists and turns. It begins when a prince deeply loved by his people, shows signs of the changing curse, is pronounced \\"dead,\\" and then is thrown into the old city of Elantris with the rest of those \\"changed\\" like him. The city used to contain god-like humans, but it now holds cursed humans. The prince wants to restore its former glory of Elantris and studies Aons, Elantrian magic to do it."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I first read Mistborn then Well of Ascension...both two of the most awesome novels ever!!! Then I figured while I wait for Hero of Ages to come out in paperback, I'll read Sanderson's first book, Elantris. While not as action packed as the Mistborn series, Elantris is heavy will intrigue and character development and this is where the book shines. You have three points of view right from the start from the 3 main characters. It starts off at a nice pace and somewhere between page 80 and 150, you're hooked like crack!!! Get this book! One book epic??? Come on. How many one book epics are there? It takes talent to put all of that in one cover. Tigana is the only other one I can think of. Awesome story. Getting his new one later this year, but first Hero of Ages."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Excitedly, I picked up this book because all of the 5 and 4 star reviews. Sadly, I was expecting too much from this book and labored to get through it. It wraps up neatly at the end which I was hoping would end sooner. The book seems more of a world building and philosophy exercise than a novel crafted to entertain and move audiences. There are long philosophical passages where the characters are thinking out loud or debating philosophy with other characters, which would have been better if broken up or cut down greatly. There are some nice things in the book, some nice plot twists, interesting premise but, for me the story relied too much on philosophical wanderings (rather than relationship building) and exposition about the world.Because of reviews that this book got, I was expecting something on the level of Song of Fire and Ice by George R. R. Martin. This is the author's first big published book and unfortunately shows, however, I'm happy that Mr. Sanderson has gotten a lot better with his Mistborn series the first book which I give a high rating."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I started reading this book after reading the Mistborn trilogy and understanding that this was Brandon Sanderson's first novel. The characters in the book were interesting, and I'm refreshed by the strong female characters that Sanderson likes to include in his book. The book began a bit slowly, however, and the quality of the writing at the beginning of the book was not what I had come to expect from the author (although it was still certainly good). As the book continued, the quality of the writing greatly improved. Overall, This is probably my least favorite of Sanderson's books, but is still among my favorite fantasy books."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This I believe is Sanderson's best work. I enjoyed this book so very much that I highly recommend it and can honestly say that it is a must read for sure!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Sanderson created a deep and complex world with characters that are fleshed out and real.

Not very long but it feels like I just read a whole series."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Brandon Sanderson is perhaps the most consistent and best authors in fantasy today. He has put out more quality material in the last decade than most authors do in their entire lives. Elantris is perhaps his seminal work, and definitely one of his finest.Sanderson's signature seems to be his magic systems, and the one in Elantris is no less intriguing than his other novels, though Mistborn is probably the single best.Where Elantris really shines is in the characters. This novel, perhaps more than his others, really drives from the interactions of the main characters. You almost feel sorry for the main antagonist, Sanderson does such a wonderful job of making him human.In short, this is an excellent novel, and a great one to start your Sanderson collection with."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Gripping.

It is worth your time. I have been busy, and have not get a chance to finish it, but I'm past half"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Everyone seems to be reading Brandon Sanderson's novels ever since he was selected to finish off Robert Jordan's massive Wheel of Time series. One has to admire Sanderson for what he's been doing: choosing to finish Jordan's series while being astoundingly classy about it (despite the fact it is a largely thankless job as he will recieve only criticism for doing this, as would anyone else), trying to push the fantasy genre to new limits, and churning out at least one 200,000 word novel every year. The most amazing thing about the speed with which Sanderson writes is that none of his novels are at all bad. None of them have been terrific, but so far he hasn't messed up. (So far I've read the Mistborn trilogy and Warbreaker in addition to Elantris.)Ten years ago, Elantris was known as the city of the gods. A transformation would randomly occur to people around the world, changing everything about them, and they would be let into the city to live their own kind. But a cataclysmic event occured. The Elantrians lost their powers and became diseased instead. From that point on, anyone who changed into an Elantrian was thrown into the city and kept under guard. The story follows three main characters: Raoden, prince of a nearby city who catches this disease; Sarene, a princess of Teod who gets caught up in a political battle; and Hrathen, a high priest of the Derethi religion who must convert the people of Arelon or kill them.Sanderson aims high and, as a result, sometimes misses his mark. He is able to tell a compelling and complex story in an easy manner. His writing style is very accessible, and he does what he can to make his words invisible. He's just trying to tell an entertaining story, and he does. However, the complexities presented in the political machinations come across as rather simplified at times. It makes things easier to understand, but it also seems unrealistic. If a character accomplishes something, then everything goes right. If they fail, then they fail miserably. There is no in between. And while the characters are all likeable, a few come across as two-deminisional. A few minor characters are just caricatures (not to mention that there are some in which I forget who they were), and Raoden especially comes across as flat. He seemed to figure out problems too easily with the perfect solution, and came across as TOO likeable. There weren't any major faults that I noticed from his character. Sarene and Hrathen were both much better done.It is a fun story to read, though. I never felt overwhelmed, despite the numerous characters, and it was fast-paced (especially the last 150 pages or so). The world was interesting and inventive, as well as the magic system. The city of Elantris was a wonderful setting for much of the novel, and there was enough in that place to fill up a novel by itself without ever getting dull. There are a lot of twists along the way. Some are easy to see; some not so much. He may have gone a little overboard with the number of revelations, though. Many characters do die along the way, though it was quite obvious that they were safe until the climatic chapters came around. While there is a lot of conflict, the story is never extremely dark. The conclusion, while a little bit too perfect for my tastes, was satisfactory and optimistic. It is good to have a happy ending every now and then, though the fantasy genre is going more and more towards the darker resolutions. There are still plot threads (very, very minor ones) left open in case Sanderson wants to write a sequel (chances are he will), but the story is self-contained. In a fantasy genre where everything seems to be trilogies or ten novel (or more) sequences, it's good to see a novel that is told under one cover.In conclusion, Elantris is a strong novel that is fast paced, fun, and inventive. While it highlights Sanderson's problems and faults as a write quite clearly, it doesn't detract away from the story enough to be a problem. Sanderson's strength is world building and plotting, and his strengths shine as well.4/5"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This book is so well written I had trouble even believing it was a first novel.

It's quite original and engaging throughout the book and I found it difficult to put down. It didn't take me long to get through, but that is not a complaint.I have already begun reading Sanderson's next book. (Which ironically happens to be a trilogy)"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Brandon Sanderson proves why he was chosen to complete the Wheel of Time series. What an interesting story with ideas and abilities different from what I've read before. Read it!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This book was solid. Besides the main concept of Elantris there was nothing about it that was truly mind blowing. There was never really a scene that made me go \\"wow\\" or a dialogue which really stuck in my mind, but throughout the whole thing the pacing, plot, characters, and dialogue were good, not amazing, but good none the less.Strengths- Stand alone fantasy, wrapped up nicely.- The bad guys are not so black and white, and get a lot of attention. Often stories only focus on the heroes, which can be great, though seeing things through the bad guys eyes can be refreshing.- Solid pacing, with a great build up of tension throughout the whole novel.- The main character, the prince, is well done. I enjoyed every single one of his chapters.- Low magic, and magic feels special. I like this because it makes the dangers that the characters face challenging, they cannot simply teleport out of danger.- Smaller scope, it is nice to see a story that does not have the fate of the world hanging in the balance. The author creates tension without having to resort to nuclear weapons.- Lots of small threads and foreshadowing, all of which seem to be wrapped up rather nicely by the end, giving a good sense of conclusion.Weakness- Fight scenes not done very well, nothing like some of the fights you get in a Robert Jordan novel, or Ian Irvine (lesser known but highly recommended fantasy author). The were not terrible, but they do not ring of someone who has had fighting experience. At one point someone takes a step back and kicks a sword out of someones hand, the someone who is supposed to be a renown warrior. This was kind of silly. The guy had a sword pointed at his throat, just getting reach and not losing a leg is hard enough, but actually hitting with enough force to dislodge the sword from someones grip is very, very difficult. In martial arts training I have seen people kick someones hand away if they carried a knife or something, but only moving their hand, not making them drop the weapon, not to mention the fact that a sword at your throat is going to be at least three foot of reach to get through. This might have been forgivable if the warrior was a newbie, but the author built the warrior up all through the book, only to have them disarmed so simply and easily. It was a little bit annoying.- The strongest scenes were from the prince's POV. I feel like the novel might have been stronger overall written from his POV entirely. I got a little bored with some of the other people. Then again, the author only had one book to develop a lot of characters, so I do not consider this a big problem. Like I said in the strengths section, I liked the view from the bad guys perspective.- The author \\"tells\\" instead of \\"shows\\" a little too much sometimes. Still, this was his first book.- A little low on the action (explosions and blood etc.) until right at the end. This did not bother me, but some people might get bored.Summary: The book is great, I feel warm and fuzzy writing about it, which is a good sign. The strengths easily outweigh the weaknesses, so I would recommend picking it up if you don't mind a story that takes a while to build. I am looking forward to reading more Sanderson."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Left thirsty awaiting the final book of the Wheel of Time, my experience with Brandon Sanderson's writing just gets richer and richer through the Storm Light, Mistborn and Elantris offerings. Elantris combines themes of desperate urban survival and leadership with civil, theocratic and magical power. This is all delivered with many Oh no! and Holy Shi' moments, and interspersed with surprisingly elegant inspiration. Enjoy it!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"\\"Elantris\\" is the debut novel from Brandon Sanderson. Blurbs on the cover from Orson Scott Card and David Farland say this book is \\"the finest novel of fantasy to be written in many years\\" and \\"one of the finest debuts I've seen in years.\\" When I read a novel I generally do not pay attention to when it was written and I know that I haven't read all of the debut fantasy novels which have come out in the past several years. I do know when I've read a very good book, however, and \\"Elantris\\" is certainly that.The prologue to the novel was all of five paragraphs but it gave all of the information needed to understand the background of what the story would be. It tells of a beautiful city named Elantris which glowed like magic and where amazing magics were possible and commonplace. Elantris was populated by godlike beings who could wield these powers as I might use a pen. But these beings were once regular humans, soldiers and serfs, princes and beggers and merchants. When something called the Shaod came upon them they were transformed into Elantrians and into a newer, greater existence. But ten years ago something happened.That something is that the blessing turned into a curse and Elantris and its population started to rot away. The city now abandoned except for the poor souls still called by the Shaod is covered in slime and muck and the Elantrians are the cursed, neither dead nor truly alive.This was a beautiful set up and pulled me right in from the start. Sanderson introduces Raoden, a prince and heir to the throne of Arelon. The city of Kae lies in the shadow of Elantris and the glory of Arelon has fallen with Elantris. Raoden is a man who gives his people hope, but when he is called by the Shaod he is doomed. His father, the king, does not reveal what happened to Raoden, but rather holds a funeral for his not beloved son. Meanwhile, Sarene, a princess from another country has arrived to marry Raoden not knowing what has happened. Her marriage contract considers her married upon the betrothal and even continues after Raoden's death, so she remains in Kae. But Raoden must find a way to survive, such as it is, in Elantris. Sarene is the only one who sees the coming doom from the religion of Darethi and an invasion from Fjordell.Brandon Sanderson has done something remarkable here. He has created an incredibly original work and unlike so many other works of fantasy this novel is complete in itself. It is not, as I understand it, the first volume of a trilogy or larger series. It is an epic work of fantasy in one self contained novel. It's one of the better fantasies that I have read. Sanderson does a good job in making all of the primary characters understandable, and sympathetic...even the \\"bad guys\\". The motivations are explained well and the characters are well developed and revealed. Simply put, with one novel Sanderson has made a fan of me. I was surprised by just how good this book was. If Sanderson writes another, I will definitely read it.-Joe Sherry"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I think I may rate books differently than other readers. For me, a book starts out as a 3. That means solid writing, no major plot holes or characterization issues, and an overall satisfying experience: the basics we should expect from a published fiction. A lack of any of those facets means the book is a 2 or a 1; additions like social relevance, emotional resonance, memorable writing, or intellectual stimulation can drive the rating up to a 4 or (for those few books that have all or most of these) a 5. There are very few books I'd rate as a 5, which I think is as it should be.Elantris on my scale is a 3. The writing is clear but rarely poetic. The main characters are well-defined but two of the three are a little too perfect to relate to and don't experience any inner growth, while the secondary characters almost universally seem to exist in order to provide some sort of surprise loop-back later in the book. The system of magic was interesting but the answer to the central question -- why it had stopped working -- turned out to be something I had a hard time believing wasn't commonly known and understood. The city of Elantris was a well-described setting, a character in itself, but other countries and races seemed rather stereotypical portrayals of Earthly analogues. Overall, while reading the book I never stopped in boredom but also I never paused in wonder, and when finished I was satisfied but it's not a book that I feel any great desire to re-read.That being said, the author is someone that I plan to keep an eye on and hope to read more from in the future. It's my understanding that Elantris was written some 7 years ago, and much of the above is understandable as \\"young author/first publication\\" issues. Despite what I wrote above, the author clearly has a lot going for him: the novel was smartly structured; the inter-relationships between names, glyphs and magic, as well as the setting and basic plot, were all well imagined; genders and religions were dealt with even-handedly; and it was simply refreshing to read a fantasy that was not a multi-volume rehashing of the \\"orphan boy undertakes journey from one side of the map to the other with party of companions to save the princess/retrieve the object/kill the bad guy\\" story. I look forward to seeing what the author's intelligence and imagination can do when combined with the further refinement of his craft that only experience can bring. And by all means, pick up a copy of Elantris if the story sounds interesting to you, just don't expect it to be more than it is."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I was most impressed by this novel's combination of religion, politics, social strata and economics. These elements combine to create a more complex world than the typical good-versus-evil we see in so many other works of fiction. It's pleasing that this work relies on these complex systems and their products, rather than simply setting characters on some physical quest and exposing them to new lands and beings as the source of entertainment. Equally important is the concept of magic, called AonDor, in this novel. The idea is well-rooted in a spiritual construct, rather than simply granted as a source of power and wonder. Furthermore, there are secrets to using it that can only be discovered by study and practice. This is a well-thought out perception of how a magical force might work. There is a well-outfitted cast of characters, and it's satisfying to see that they each have combinations of faults as well as virtues. This makes the characters more engaging, since the protagonists are at-times flawed and make mistakes and the antagonists can still stir sympathy and understanding in the reader. The only detractions I found in this novel were some phrases and expressions that seemed overused by the author, perhaps in his zeal to remind you of the world and characters he created. Things like the princess tapping her cheek, or the Dula character who says \\"Kolo\\" in as many as a quarter of his phrases eventually become a distraction and almost come across as overly insistent attempts to make you perceive the characters as the author imagines them. This, however, is a minor distraction when the great value of the other elements are taken into account. All in all, the story is engaging and there are several unexpected events which take the story down paths not anticipated, yet are rewarding. Fantastic work, and I look forward to reading more from Brandon Sanderson."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I had heard about Elantris from my brother who told me that he thought it was an excellent book. After reading what Orson Scott Card and David Farland had to say about it i decided to give Brandon Sanderson a chance and so I bought the book. I found the beginning chapters to be very captivating and provoking. The author set up a world that was nothing like any other world i had ever read about. He doesn't bog down the reader with lenghty descriptions but allows you to gain an image of the world over time and throughout the entire book.I was immediatly drawn in by the plot and literally could not put the book down. I started reading about 10 am and read until 3 am. I will admit that the second quarter of the book felt a little slow but not to slow to get my to stop reading.I loved the complex problems that Sanderson created in the book and seeing the intrigue and plotting that was going on in the book. It came to a point when i began to fear that Sanderson had created to big of a problem for him to solve. I have read far too many books where the author cannot create an interesting and plausible ending for his book. However, Sanderson did it. This book pulls it off, just when i thought everything had lots controlled, Sanderson showed that he knew exactly what was going on and how he was going to solve his problem.I loved this book and felt satisified upon reading it.If you are looking for a fun book to read that at the same time will introduce some interesting ideas choose this book.Elantris is by far the best book i have read in years."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Elantris juggles so many balls in the air that I am deeply amazed by newcomer Brandon Sanderson's skill. The characters are simultaneously forced to confront magic, religious controversy, politics, and economic policies. Not only all they all dealt with completely and competently, but it is a fascinating read. The three main characters are Raoden, a fallen prince of Arelon, Sarene, his fiance and a politically savvy strongwilled woman, and Hrathen, a Derethi gyorn (high priestish) trying to conquer a nation to save it from a worse fate. Each of these characters is superbly handled, they become almost real people and grow as the novel progresses. The supporting cast is also wonderfully done; I can't think of one two-dimensional character. It would be excellent if Mr. Sanderson did someday return to Elantris, but this book really leaves no threads unfinished. Elantris is a worthy read for characterization, depth of plot, world-building, and because it is interesting. My advice, don't wait for a possible paperback reissue, go for the hardback."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"The premise for this novel is breathtaking. I must admit, that on reading the blurb on the back I thought to myself, 'there is no way this book can measur o up to this premise'. I was pleasantly surprised as Sanderson proved me wrong.The plotting is intricate and unpredictable (on at least three occasions I gasped with the melodramatic panache of a cartoon character). The pacing is also impeccable.One slight deficiency is that for the first half of the book, the Hrathen sub plot is not as interesting as the Raoden and Sarene sub plots. This imbalance is shortlived and in the second half, Hrathen's arc becomes as fascinating as the other two characters.The system of magic and the world are interesting and original. A novel approach to the fantastic.The end is satisfying but has weaknesses. it hurtles by at such a rapid pace that some of the built momentum segues into anticlimax rather than climax. Also, there are way too many 'surprise' revelations that happen too quickly, creating a soap operaesque situation in the final 50 pages. Amid these revalations, the given explanation for Elantris' fall is somewhat disappointing.Even so, this book is way ahead of competitors in the fantasy field. It is an astonishing first novel and I eagerly await to see where Sanderson's career leads."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I must have been one of the few that missed that Brandon Sanderson explosion onto the market a few years ago, at the time I had completely lost faith in fantasy as it seemed every new fantasy novel I picked up lacked creativity, originality, and that sense of wonder and awe that typically defines every great fantasy story. Having discovered that there was a whole entire world of great fiction outside of fantasy I rarely ventured further than the Crime and Thriller aisle (probably because it was closer to the front door), and so it wasn't until about 18 months ago when I started getting back into fantasy that I saw a copy of The Gathering Storm in the book store penned by some guy named Brandon Sanderson. It was six months ago when I saw Josh's review of The Final Empire that I actually bought my first Brandon Sanderson book, and it was five days later, having just read the last 300 pages of The Final Empire in one sitting, that I found my faith in the future of fantasy writing had been restored and that I must read everything written by this guy named Brandon Sanderson.Elantris, published by Tor in 2005, was the first published novel for Sanderson and has fast become one of my favourites. Elantris was a great shining city, populated by people who had been blessed by the Shaod, a powerful magic that turned people into \\"gods\\". That was until 10 years before the present day when a cataclysmic event caused the magic of Elantris to fail, turning its god-like citizens into undead creatures unable to perform even the most basic of magic that once sustained both themselves and the city. Elantris now resembles a ruined wasteland, a prison / mental asylum for the people cursed by the Shaod isolated from the rest of the world.Raoden, the Prince of Arelon, has been cursed by the Shaod and thrown into Elantris. He wants to know what caused the magic to fail so that he can reclaim his life and restore Elantris to its former beauty. Sarene, the Princess of Teod, is engaged to Raoden though they have never met. She has just arrived in Arelon to be told that her fianc&eacute;e is dead and that a Derethi Gyorn is setting up a church. She wants to find out what really happened to Raoden while also trying to stop the Gyorn in his mission to convert Arelon. Hrathen, a Gyorn of the Derethi religion, is renowned for converting entire nations to Shu-Dereth by any means necessary. He has arrived in Arelon with a deadline; he has just three months to achieve a peaceful conversion of the Arelon people. Perhaps he can use Arelon's fear of Elantris to his advantage.Elantris is a great example of how to create characters and stories that are strong enough to stand up on their own in a massively complex and wondrous world. With so many religions, nations and locations, each with their own rich history and complications, it can be daunting trying to understand everything and this puts the story at risk of being lost in a sea of data overload. There is a pretty steep learning curve at the start of the book and for the first 50-100 pages I found it hard to become fully immersed, however, once I had been given all the necessary information the story really comes into and you find yourself being drawn in deep trying to solve mysteries of the world. This is a book that works of the idea that everyone has a secret and Sanderson uses this idea to make sure that the plot remains the central focal point, giving each character clearly defined and relatable goals while allowing the reader to discover all the complex background information at the same time as the characters do.The three main characters and the entire supporting cast are all written superbly, each with their own rich history that gives them a unique outlook on life. They are complex people with their own strengths and weaknesses put into unfamiliar situations that are designed to severely test their resolve. What I like most is that Sanderson has created a bunch of characters that I have come to care about, I want to get to know them, I want them to succeed, I want them to be happy. They are real people with real problems, defined by their actions and the way in which they deal with the consequences of these actions. The people are the real story of Elantris, watching how these characters grow as they are forced overcome every obstacle placed in their way is very satisfying.The story is told by rotating the viewpoint at the end of each chapter from Raoden to Sarene to Hrathen and then back to Raoden. These viewpoints are grouped in three's, referred to by Sanderson on his website as \\"triads\\", with each viewpoint in the triad occurring at roughly the same time (or at least the same day). This gives you a look at the same problem from three different points of view which gives you a much greater understanding of the story but at the cost of pacing. Towards the end of the novel Sanderson starts messing with the triad system as he accelerates the pace of the story, upsetting 50 chapters worth of stability and replacing it with a sense of chaos that parallels the chaotic scenes in the story.This a book that if you haven't read already, it should be high up on your list of books to read next. While the steep learning curve and the slow pacing can be a little frustrating at times, the compelling characters and the intriguing mysteries make it so hard to put this book down. At 11:30 pm reading chapter 50 I hit what is known as the \\"Brandon Avalanche\\"... I did not put the book down until I finished it at around 3:30 am. By taking a bunch of great characters and placing them in a wondrous and mysterious world, Sanderson has managed to create an original and powerful story that shows how being human can mean so many things to so many people."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This is only the second Brandon Sanderson book I've read but I can tell that he is a natural storyteller. In this and in the only other book of his I've read Mistborn: The Final Empire, the first thing you notice is that he hooks you quickly. This is important. There have been a ton of times I've started a book that I put down because it just didn't draw me in or, it did eventually but it took time to gain steam. Not here. The book sets the hook pretty early on and grabs you.The second thing you notice is that he doesn't let up on momentum. Again, I've read books where the hook is immediate but the author can't sustain the stellar beginning so the books starts to drag. Maybe you get some exposition dumps or plot creep, or whatever. No, here the story continues. He presents the mystery of Elantris first and foremost. You feel compelled to read on to see the 'why' and 'what' of it. He also let's the reader in on a few secrets and truths that the characters aren't aware of. Then he places those secrets/truths tantalizingly close to the characters and thereby places the reader on a bit of a razor's edge. You know what is going on when are they going to figure it out?The third thing, and probably the most important, he has the ability to create extremely charismatic characters. In this I will compare him to Guy Gavriel Kay. For me, GGK is the master in creating the unforgettable character who gets under your skin and stays there. That person who is so real you just want to talk to someone about him/her. Sanderson does this as well, albeit to a lesser extent (GGK is after all the master!).The fourth thing, he has a talent for world building and creating magic systems that don't feel like the same old thing you'd read before.This book tells the story of the fallen City of Elantris. A city where all the citizens were god-like magical beings. The Elantris city gates sits right outside the land of Arelon where the book is set. This is the hook, that first thing I mention above. The prologue sets up the story really nicely.The narrative becomes a three part thing told from the point of view of three main characters. Raoden a prince who falls victim to the mysterious Reod -- the malady that caused the downfall of Elantris and still takes victims randomly. When this happens, those poor souls are effectively declared dead and banished into the now dark bowels of the fallen city. But Raoden refuses to be left for dead is determined to unravel the mystery of Elantris.There is also Sharene, Raoden's affianced bride from another country who arrives only to find out that her fiance is now dead and, because of the terms of her betrothal contract, she is now a widow. But Sharene is no wall flower. She is smart, a King's daughter who had been brought up with politics and scheming as her mother's milk. She realizes something is amiss and proceeds to make waves in her new home.And finally there is Hrathen. A high ranking priest of sorts in a religious order sent to hasten the downfall of Arelon. Their king is considered weak and the populace is considered heretical as they worship a different version of the deity. Hrathen sets off a series of plans to bring Arelon to it's knees.These three characters plunge immediately into their plots and thus creating the second thing above, the momentum. They are each working toward their own goal. Each one has a vested interest in Elantris but in different ways. As a reader you can't wait to see when/how they all converge.And while all three characters were very interesting, I found myself most drawn to Raoden. I enjoyed Sharene's intelligence and how she was able to manipulate events and people around her. I also love that she was a catalyst for a lot of the plot moving elements as well. But there was a bit of a Mary-Sueish quality about her. I thought Hrathen was the most fascinating of the characters. He began with a towering conviction that threatened to make him a bit one-dimensional but then slowly over the course of the book his characterization deepened and he took on more hues. He is an antagonist of sorts who surprisingly becomes sympathetic.But it is Raoden who does the heavy lifting for me in this book. He is that third thing, that magnetic character that sucks you in. I loved his chapters. Through sheer force of will and personality he begins the evolution of the city of the dead. I couldn't wait to see what he would do next, who he would convert to his side now?Amidst all this we are treated to learning about Arelon and it's environs, the political and religious landscape and customs. Elantris remains the draw though. The construct of this place and it's people is that fourth thing, that fascinating world build and magic system. What happened to cause such a quick and massive downfall of what was by all accounts a place of wonder? The descriptions of what happens physically to people when the Reod takes them -- they don't have heartbeats, they feel pain and hunger but don't heal, don't really need to eat and can basically 'live' forever. As is Raoden's quest to discover the secret of Elantris' magic. Will he do it? What will happen if he does?The book picks up speed as the schemes of the three start to spin, in some ways out of their own control. The chapters get shorter and shorter the closer they get to each other until finally they do converge.The story was super fun and the conclusion was extremely satisfying.Highly recommended"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Although this book will likely appeal to a smaller audience than your run-of-the-mill modern fiction or science fiction and fantasy with flashier covers or from popular mainstream settings, it's a damn shame because this is a very exciting, mature, and fascinating book.At first I was a little put off by the early introduction of foreign slang and foreign terms but they are much simpler and less in number than say, that of Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\" or something more in the vein of science fiction.Unlike most fantasy books that focus on adventure and often a party of individuals, \\"Elantris\\" is a more realistic story of political intrigue that is split between three main characters. These are the two protagonists -- a bright, savvy princess who comes to a foreign country to marry its prince and hopefully secure peace for their side of the continent and the kindhearted, cunning prince who effectively dies on the very first page and before he can meet his fianc&eacute;e -- and the antagonist, a calculating but remorseful priest from a theocratic empire that very nearly has control of the known world. His orders are to convert the king and/or the entire city in three months or else the city would be violently and forcibly converted.Besides these three main characters is one character that looms above them all very literally: the city of Elantris and its long-gone people. Elantris was literally a city of people ascended to godhood and had been for as long as known history. But ten years prior to the setting of the book, something inexplicable happened and the Elantrians fell, also literally.Yes, it sounds fantastical and fanciful but it's not really that much so for 50% of the book, if not more. Pretend it's renaissance France -- only it's on the border of the Holy Roman Empire who is almost done taking over Europe and the Black Plague ate everyone in the next country over ten years ago. Then you're all set.If you just can't deal with the fantastical aspect of the Elantrians but you like interesting, three-dimensional, characters and some political intrigue, suck it up and try \\"Elantris\\" anyway. It's that good. Just look at the first sentence of the book, quoted at the top of the page."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I liked this book. The fact that it's a stand alone, but with room for sequels was a bonus.The writing is well-done with very strong characterizations. The characters are all for the most part likeable people, even the priest who isn't what I expected. That was a wonderful change since most such characters in fantasy are frothing at the mouth fanatics.The prince was sometimes tough for me to believe because what happens to him (and to all who go to Elantris) is quite a fall. And yet, despite this huge and terrible change in his station, he remains essentially unchanged. I had hoped to see some darkness within himself that he had to overcome, but while he overcomes external obstacles, he doesn't have to face many internal demons. However, I liked him so much that I could easily forgive the author for this. In fact, I wanted more of the story focused on his actions, but instead it is the princess to whom most of the book is devoted.The politics of the world seemed simplistic, at least in comparison to Martin or Scott Bakker, and the world building isn't as strong as those two (but who's is?). But, that's ok because the focus of the book isn't on world-building. While the politics may be simple, it serves its purpose which is this: What happened to this once glorious city of Elantris and how do the people of this country deal with its demise. In that, the book read almost like a mystery.Overall, I liked it a lot, and for some reason, I thought of Sean Russell and Greg Keyes when I read this. Maybe that's just me because no one else has pointed that out."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I think I've read Brandon Sanderson's books in the reverse order of when he wrote them. So I'm coming into this book a little biased already. Mr. Sanderon has become one of my favorite authors. Some people have commented on lack of character development, etc. While I can't analysis a book to death I can say that every book I've read from this author often poses questions that I often think about. It shows struggles people have to deal with often and tries to work those struggles in throughout the book. I don't know but at times I feel like the author working some of his own questions out by putting characters into situations that would force them to answer the internal conflicts they, and many of us, have. I think that is very apparent in the Mistborn series and in The Way of Kings, and to a lesser extent in this book as well. I think this makes the characters more real and interesting. When I completed reading this book I was very satisfied and felt extremely entertained. It kept my attention, didn't give things away too soon, made me sympathize with the characters, and had an ending which left me feeling like I'd completed the story. There's also enough of a story left out there for the author to write another book on Elantris (hint hint)."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I got Elantris for my birthday, and immediately dove into it. If you've been reading my blog, you know that I've really wanted to read this for a while. I think Brandon Sanderson is my favourite fantasy writer, and this is his debut novel.Elantris is about the city of Elantris, which was once radiant and magical, where all of its inhabitants were benevolent, and used their magic to benefit the people. However, Elantris fell ten years ago, and its inhabitants are basically zombies who can still think. People are still being turned into Elantrians, but it is no longer a blessing. The religious zealot kingdom of Fjordell is getting very powerful, and Prince Raoden of Arelon is about to be married to Princess Sarene of Teod, forming an important political treaty between their nations in the hope of resisting Fjordell. However, a few days before their wedding, Raoden is taken by the Shaod and turned into an Elantrian, and Sarene is declared his widow. Now Raoden needs to find hope in the anarchy and despair of Elantris, and Sarene needs to stop Hrathen, the Fjordell priest from converting and subjugating both her adopted kingdom and her home kingdom.I really liked this book. Sarene and Raoden are both people that you want to root for; they're both intelligent and principled, and very well-matched. I was a bit surprised at how quickly their romance came together at the end (primarily because Sarene is otherwise so sceptical), but other than that, I thought they had great chemistry. Hrathen is also a great point of view character; he's devoted to his faith but also a rationalist. His battle with Sarene over the conversion of the Arelish people was pretty interesting.As usual with a Brandon Sanderson book, the magic system was very well thought out. As also seems to be the case with his standalone fiction (I'm looking at you , The Alloy of Law), every loose thread is not explained at the end, which is frustrating because now I really want a sequel!I don't think I can say very much more about this book - I was pretty much completely immersed in the world and didn't get out of it enough to think about what I liked or disliked about it. I'm really excited to read Brandon Sanderson's annotations of Elantris, available for free online."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"A satisfying one-off fantasy novel. The concept was highly original. The mechanistic magic system is classic Sanderson. The setting was fascinating enough considering the limited world-building allowed to a stand-alone novel. The notion that one could be exiled to to a fallen \\"Olympus\\" and experience an eternal life whereby all the pains accrued in everyday life would never heal, but instead pile upon one another, is gruseome. To be honest, the plot wasn't the most exciting,(it feels heretical to write this as Sanderson is probably the best fantasist around. His other work proves that) but Elantris was well-written and the fate of the main characters, Raoden and Sarene, kept me interested enough to finish. Glad I read it."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Not quite as polished as Sanderson's later work, but still an amazing tale. Interesting magic system, interesting character, and an interesting location. The story moves along at a great pace and I'm excited to see what feels like epic fantasy accomplished in a single volume.I highly recommend this book to any Sanderson fans, and anyone who enjoys the fantasy genre.The only problem I have is that the end contained what feels like a little too much deus ex machina, but even these elements are clearly set up in early chapters."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I stumbled onto this gem of a book thanks to Amazon's book recommendations. As readers, I know you all know the joy that comes in discovering a new author to love - it's like unearthing an priceless gem while digging for vegetables. It's a debut book, and from what is turning out to be one of the most promising new authors I've read over the last few years.At its heart, this is a story about hope, and about not giving up in the face of great adversity. These are themes that always appeal to me, so needless to say I found it very moving, and inspiring. This is one of those books that will leave you with a peaceful, happy feeling, and life will look just a bit more hopeful and bright.The world is haunting - mostly set in a single broken, city, fraught with mystery. Sanderson's world building skills shine the most in his magic systems though. He takes a unique, well thought out approach to magic in all of his books. It's not overbearing or over technical but it's intelligently done.Characterization is, by FAR, this author's strongest skill. I have fallen in love with just about every character he's written. His male protagonists are honorable, smart, and quirky (and truly drool worthy for me). His female protagonists are strong, with brilliant minds, and quick wits. He writes female characters better many authors (including female authors) I've read. He'll even make you love his antagonists and ancillary characters.The only negative I can think to point out about this book, is it is a debut. Having read more of Sanderson's work, his plots get tighter and more complex; his characters gain more depth in later work. However, that's only obvious taken in perspective of later work, and this piece offers something they lack in its profound and inspirational message of hope.Truthfully, anything by this author is amazing, but this book was so beautiful, I thought I'd start with a review of it."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I absolutely love it!, and i hadn't been able to say that in a long time. You have to read so many books to find one you actually LOVE (if you're lucky, you enjoy reading a book, but as soon as you finish it you forget about it). The last fantasy books i read and really enjoyed were from Andrzej Sapkowski, R. A. Salvatore and Patrick Rothfuss, and this one if as good, if not better, than those.I read a lot of fantasy books, and i find the same two or three plots told in different ways, but the story is always just the same. If the book is well written i can enjoy it, but that's it. This one, however, is different. The plot is really unique, a complex history not seen before, not a \\"good boy save the world from the bad guys\\" (althought the princess is quite a clich&eacute;, that's the only bad thing i can say about this book).Also, it's just one book, wich i terribly appreciate. I don't know why the fantasy genre is the only one where the authors don't finish their stories in one book. It's really annoying to like a book, to be cut in the middle of the story, and when a year after the second book comes, you already forgot what the first one was about, and i don't even care any more (except if it is an excellent one).Ps: i'm not an english speaker, so sorry for the misspelling and grammar errors."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Elantris isn't like other epic fantasy. This is a one and done novel. Not just the first chunk of a large series. This is very rare in fantasy. All would be for naught if it wasn't a very fun read. Thankfully it is a great read. Don't be fooled by it size though. There is a lot of mystery, magic, intrigue, and action to satisfy the appetite for the any lovers of fantasy.This book is written in a triad structure. That means that there are only three main POV characters and the each get a turn in sequential order. This works well because the main characters are people you really grow attached to. It is their personalities that drive this plot. As you are excited to be learning what is happen to on you get ripped away to see what is going on with the next. Though you know you only have to wait two chapters to get back to that character.This was my first book by Sanderson but it will not be my last. He has shown with this debut novel that he is a name to stay in the genre of Fantasy."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This is the first book I have read as a stand alone novel since high school. I got hooked on The Wheel of Time back then and have been reading all these multi-volume epics since then. This was an excellent book and was packed full of so many great characters, events and cultures that it felt like a full epic. In a relatively short time Brandon was able to weave together several distinct cultures, their interactions and the personal growth of his main characters. This is what fantasy is all about for me so I was not in the least bit disappointed even in this smaller package.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Despite being a major fan of fantasy for the past 10 or so years, this is the first book I've read by Brandon Sanderson. It was good enough to make me want to read some of his later work, but for some reason, I just didn't have the emotional connection to the characters that I crave. I want to cry when they are devastated, and feel ecstatic at their success. I read the book quickly enough from start to finish, meaning it kept me entertained and was not by any means a bad book, but I wanted a fantasy I could dive headfirst into and lose myself, and Elantris did not deliver.I will say this: aside from a few annoying lines or corny jokes here and there, Sanderson pretty accurately depicts how a woman with Sarene's personality would feel, act, and react to her world. He did a very good job of describing her conflicting emotions -- growing up and being clever and opinionated and wondering why other women wouldn't stand up for themselves like you do -- then realizing that you were the one who didn't have the social know-how to navigate life as a woman, how to be feminine, and still intelligent and strong. I still think George R. R. Martin understands women and writes female characters a small step above Sanderson's writing of Sarene, but Martin gave me way more characters to observe his talent. I'll have to reserve judgement until I've read more of Sanderson's work, which I look forward to doing."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I have come to know Sanderson for his amazing worldcrafting, his habit of creating characters that inspire emotional investment, and his excellent story building ability. That being said, it is obvious that Elantris is first novel, as these elements were budding, but are not quite in full bloom yet. That is the only reason this novel got a 4 star rating.The plot of the story revolves around the lost city of Elantris (kinda like Atlantis, heheh). The city hasn't moved, but the god-like power that emanated from it, and it's people, has been corrupted. Elatrians are now walking zombies, unable to die, and unable to heal. This plot devise was unique to anything I'd read, and I imagined it as new kind of hell. Elantrians never stop feeling the pain of an injury. You know how bad it hurts to stub your toe really good? Well imagine that that first blinding white shot of pain never receded. You have an eternity with that pain, and every other pain, large or small, that you accumulate. Thus, most Elantrians ended up as Hoed...crumbled sacks of flesh, moaning and crying forever.Since the corruption of Elantris, the nearby cities that depended on it for food have either withered away completely, or hit an economic depression. Prince Raoden is campaigning for reformation when he is struck with the Elantrian disease, and locked away in the forgotten city. This seriously disrupts his foreign fiance' Sarene's plans. When Sarene reaches Kae she is confronted not only with a missing husband, but also the dangerous religious conversion attempts of a tyrant.The characters of this novel are not as fleshed out as characters in later Sanderson works (Mistborn, The Way of Kings, and even novel #2, Warbreaker) and I found myself a bit bored with them. The system of magic that Sanderson wrote about did not have his normal creative stamp, and the world itself was pretty boring...lacking the strange landscapes, or unique weather/people/customs of his later novels.What makes this book a 4 star read is that this first novel by Sanderson is more engaging and well plotted than many author's 30th effort. I am harsh on Sanderson only because he's an excellent writer, coming close to the same league as Orson Scott Card and Anne McCaffrey (my heroes).I definitely recommend Elantris, even to fans of Sanderson's later, greater works. If there was a sequel to this novel, I'd be all over it."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I picked up this book because of the orson scott card remark on the cover only to remember later that these things tend to be favors, bought and even part of publishers contracts.It took me a while to get over the obvious, Elantris/Atlantis name. Sanderson's naming scheme in this book was problematic. A lot of his made up words and character names sounded the same or read similarly. Even though i know it was intention to have the names reflect the culture it made it difficult.The various plot \\"twists\\" were weak and often forced. I got the impression that Sanderson wanted to write a novel of intriguing and political savvy. It's obvious that he just doesn't have the mind to think like that. His character's were a little shallow.Lastly, and this might just be me but reading between the lines I saw Sanderson trying to hard to counter act his Mormon frame of mind especially when it came to talking about the various religions in the book.Yet, beside all that I wanted to finish reading the book, wanted to know what happened. It wasn't poorly written, slow or boring. I did though get a little disheartened when at the end the subplots and characters felt mashed together to finish the story as quickly as possible."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I listen to the first disk and said this is not worth my time.I passed and I'm disappointedChuck"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"A good fantasy book draws u in.

It is probably one of the better ideas I've encountered in fantasy recently. The characters were pleasantly drawn, except with perhaps a little too much irony. Similarly, the dialogue was a bit jarring: the prince and the princess particularly sounded like a couple of cocky, fairly smart college students. However, the worst were the author's declarative, \\"god-like\\" proclamations: \\"X woke up, not yet knowing he was cursed,\\" \\"Y thought she was a bride but in fact was already a widow,\\" \\"Z thought his fancy shoes were still safely at the cobblers' but in fact a small elf, carrying a red bucket full of slime had already dumped the contents...\\" (Ok, I made the last one up.)So, great ideas, fast-paced plot, mediocre/poor writing -- not bad for a first-time author.

I love Sanderson (Mistborn is my favorite series) but this book was hard to deal with. The idea was amazing..... but the execution is terrible. It is VERY obvious that this is his first work. The characters are flat and unbelievable and the storyline is disjointed. If you are looking for more Mistborn... look elsewhere."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Brandon Sanderson has read some of David Eddings' series; the similarities are far too obvious to be ignored. But he doesn't have Eddings' style or flair - in fact, he's downright dull in spots.And his first novel has one far more serious flaw - he doesn't explain the history or the culture behind his book. For example, it took me close to a hundred pages to find out what a Seon was, even though they're mentioned in the first few pages of the story.Sanderson is definitely a good writer, but he needs more lessons in his craft."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I was so excited to read this book. The description, the reviews, the high praise from other authors all had me convinced this would be a great read. I didn't make it past page 200.I hung around for that long hoping something would happen. I remember reading the Bridges of Madison County years ago feeling the same thing. I couldn't understand why so many people loved the book, but I persevered to the end and was mildly rewarded. That book was 192 pages long. Elantris is considerably longer and I just couldn't bring myself to give up hours of my life to find out if it would improve.The book's concept was very appealing, the execution was not. Fantasy is rife with the same plotlines, the same archetypes--the reason why people continue to read the genre is that talented writers find new ways of making the familiar seem brand new. The writing here was not of the caliber I expected (given the reviews), it was more YA. After 200 pages I still didn't care about any of the characters including the protagonists. My biggest complaint was over the author's choice of names for people, places and things (\\"Sheod, Teod, Reod\\", anyone?). Too much similiarity between them made it hard to keep them straight.Bottom-line, don't believe the hype. If you're curious save your money and get it from the library."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I have to confess I couldn't finish it. It was too silly and unserious. I had very high expectations from having read all the glowing reviews but the book itself was awful. Sanderson can write well and tell a story well, look at his bringing the moribund Wheel of Time series back to life, but this one was a misfire."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"With a book collection numbering over 2000, I'm always looking for new authors, especially in the realm of fantasy. I picked up Elantris while browsing through the bookstore thinking to myself that it sounds like an interesting concept.Of course I sat down to start reading and was up until 3 AM finishing the darn book, on a work night, in one sitting. Hurrah for Mr. Sanderson. Great concept and a pretty good implementation. The characters were definitely interesting and entertaining and at least a couple of the plot twists were not predictable.I'm hoping for some other stories in this world. Whether in the future, past or present, it seems that the foundation for interesting religions and cultures have been well defined."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Elantris is a light, entertaining read, but not a great novel. On the plus side: it's a fantasy in one volume, not another infinite series; the world is interesting if spare; and the moral complexity of one of the viewpoint characters is refreshing. On the minus side, the author's characters are wooden. You never get invested in any of them. Also, while his world is interesting, Sanderson doesn't deliver enough backstory (you learn about the city's golden age, but not why it exists and how it came to be).I've been reading fantasy and science fiction for two decades now, and I've come to accept that there are often quality trade-offs in these genres. Some authors are better at world building than character development (Kim Stanley Robinson), and others devote so much time to building characters that the backstory fades away (early Robin Hobb). Sanderson falls in middle; he doesn't excel in either category, making the book a light adventure read with no greater resonance. Sanderson is certainly NOT the new Tolkien (whatever that means nowadays).If you want to read this, definitely buy it in paperback. I enjoyed reading it, but it's not worth the hardcover price. On a final note, I find many of the 5 star reviews here odd, almost as if they're working from talking points. Eerliy reminiscent of the Robert Stanek marketing machine."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I've always been something of a stickler for compelling characters. If a book hasn't got them, I become annoyed, even if the plot is otherwise quite inventive. This novel would have been much better had the author put more effort into the people inhabiting his world.Raoden doesn't react the way most people would to what happens to him at the beginning of the novel. This isn't because he's a really unique guy, but rather has more to do with the author's failure to explore what a young person doomed to an agonizing, painful, possibly eternal death-in-life might feel about his fate. The situation he finds himself in is truly horrifying. Seriously grappling with this fact would have added a lot of needed depth to his character. We never get it.Sarene, the novel's heroine, is shrill and unconvincing. She easily dominates a council of senior statesmen, while constantly complaining about not being taken seriously as a woman. Uh huh. And she teaches a group of court ladies to fence, as some sort of rather silly feminist project that has no discernible liberating effect on any of them. She's progressive, certainly, but not very interesting.Hrathen, the remaining main character, is a religious fanatic with a few scruples that emerge belatedly, after the city is overrun by demonic monks who start killing everybody. Nice that he finally chose to do the right thing, but I didn't enjoy reading the chapters told from his point of view.Turning to the plot, the notion of the city of Elantris is interesting, and original. Which makes the shortcomings elsewhere all the more jarring by contrast: rule by the richest? Noblemen demoted to peons if their profits fall unacceptably low during a given year? Constant turnover in the aristocracy? I don't believe that's possible, as anyone who attained a title would then have every incentive to use his wealth to build a fortress, hire soldiers to guard it, and set up his own little empire. From which he couldn't afterward be shaken loose, no matter what the 'King' (himself a promoted merchant) might have to say about the matter. Why wasn't this happening? I have no idea. And the King himself was simply laughable; he shouldn't have lasted a week on that throne. He was thoroughly inept and insulting to everyone. He didn't even have any standing army to speak of, which seems odd given the presence of an aggressive enemy lurking nearby.Anyway. The book's worth a read, but wait until it's out in paperback. Or check it out from the library."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Elantris is problematic. As a fantasy, it's entertaining enough, but it reflects a simple understanding of human nature, physiology, physics, politics, and just plain story plausibility.Some of the more egregious examples:We are led to believe that the humans in the book are humans like us. They are not. For one, the protagonist Raoden is inhumanly intelligent. He learns an impossible amount of material in a few weeks and develops a virtuosic hand. Raoden also has superhuman concentration. Everyone else, it seems, is remarkably dumb, including the supposedly god-like Elantrians. And one man alone can apparently clean tens of thousands of square feet of filthy, slime-encrusted wall and floor and furniture in a matter of days.The leaders in this book are nothing like leaders in the real world. They're far too forgiving or idealistic or inept. In the real world, Hrathren would be too easily undermined to be a leader; Ioden would've killed Sarene instead of bawling like a baby and folding like a wet napkin after she said some mean things to him; and no one would've been engaging in a weird, highly stylized form of politics with complete strangers who've just shown up a few days ago, gambling their fortunes and lives.The book plays too fast, too loose with its own rules and with human nature to be enjoyable. The solution to the mystery of Elantris's fall is simply dumb. I wouldn't waste my time with this novel."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I picked up Elantris because Sanderson was chosen to finish The Wheel of Time and, in an odd coincidence, because his works were highly recommended by a friend shortly before Robert Jordan's passing.It took more than one try for me to finish Elantris. The first time I got about 140 pages in a simply lost interest. A few weeks later, I picked it up again, skimmed to where I had left off, and finished it rather quickly. Overall, it was entertaining but not amazing.Below, you'll find spoilers and specific thoughts, but if I had to make a general recommendation about this book, it would be:Pick it up if you're interested in Sanderson's work. If you can't finish it or don't like it, don't worry and don't give up on him; go read Mistborn instead.*** Here be spoilers ***For me, the most frustrating part of the book was Sarene. I am tired of semi-rebellious female characters who aren't taken seriously but surprise the men with their wit and competence. Even as a male, that culture / gender stereotyping strikes me as frustratingly unrealistic. Why can't the competent females just be competent and respected for it? (BTW, Sanderson skillfully avoids this stereotype in Mistborn, which I highly recommend)Next to that, I found the pluralistic ending a bit anti-climactic. So there's this amazing power that the Elantrians can somehow tap into and they're worshipped as gods. But, as it turns out, there are at least two other demonstrated ways to tap into this power and nobody knew about it?!? There's a huge mystery about the Dor which is finally (somewhat) revealed and the impact of that is subsequently negated by evidence that others have been tapping into this power, even while the Elantrians somehow lost the ability. Perhaps this will be better-explained if Sanderson ever writes other books in this universe but, for now, it feels silly and unnecessary.Now for something I like about Elantris (and Sanderson's writing in general). You may think me simple, but I think Sanderson is an expert at believable plot twists. In both Elantris and Mistborn, he has characters plot what could be the rest of the story. Things progress roughly as-planned for a while... and then it all (believably) falls apart and yet the end goal is somehow (and believably) accomplished. While I complained about a specific aspect of the ending a bit above, Sanderson's endings are gripping, action-packed, and really satisfying. In reading Elantris and both available Mistborns, I stayed up way past my bed time simply because I got wrapped up and wanted to know how it ended."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Elantris passed my \\"couldn't put it down\\" test. I totally lost myself in Sanderson's wonderful fantasy world of Arelon, Teo, and Fjordell. I really cared about the characters, and I was fascinated by the converging plot lines. I especially liked Hrathen, the Gyorn/priest of the Dereth religious sect. His self doubts and character flaws were very well done. The explanation for the Shaod and why the magic of Elantris failed was clever and led to one of the most exciting climaxes of the story, as Raoden restores the power of Elantris.There were hints at the end of a possible sequel, and if so, I will be looking forward to another great book!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"At the start, I want to give Sanderson a positive review just for doing what seems to be the unthinkable nowadays--writing a standalone fantasy, a book that actually comes to a close, a book that is just that, a book and not the \\"start of a bright new fresh trilogy that out-Tolkien's Tolkien!\\". Luckily, the book holds up well even merits beyond being a standalone.Elantris is the name of the city that until ten years ago was inhabited by near-gods, ordinary people randomly transformed by the \\"Shaod\\", some sort of semi-virus (my comparison not Sanderson's) that struck all segments of the population of Arelon and turned them into powerful magic users. Elantris was a city of beauty and power, the capital of Arelon, until the magic suddenly disappeared a decade ago. the Shaod, however, still comes, though now it leaves the people disfigured and in seemingly eternal torment (pain of any sort remains forever, growing cumulatively in effect). Those it happens to our now shut into the ruins of Elantris and left there to suffer or die. All of this is swiftly conveyed in a two-page prologue.The story itself centers on Prince Raoden, heir to the throne of Arelon, and his wife Princess Sarene of Teod. The two have not met--the marriage was a political one to cement relations between the only two nations that have resisted Fjordell, an expanding religious empire. At the book's start, Raoden is struck by the Shaod and exiled into Elantris. The story that unfolds focuses on his refusal to give into the inevitable \\"givens' of Elantris--suffering, privation, isolation, madness. Instead he tries to build a society within the city, continuing what had been his earlier unsuccessful attempts at reformist politics. He also tries to learn just what had destroyed Elantris' magic.Sarene, having arrived and been told her newly-betrothed had died, stays on in Arelon and tries to strengthen the country (ruled by Raoden's inept father) so that it may stand as a strong ally with Teod (ruled by her father) against Fiordell.Meanwhile, that empire's chief agent, Hrathen, a high leader in the hierarchy of the Shu-Dereth faith has also arrived in Arelon, given the mission to convert the country within three months. Otherwise the empire armies will do so at the tip of the sword. Hrathen is fresh from a bloody conversion, orchestrated by him, of another country and has no desire to see similar bloodshed, ruthless as he is in his attempts to convert the current Arelon leadership (and if they won't, he'll change the leadership by whatever means possible).The book shifts among the three main characters and does so quite smoothly. The story itself is quick-paced, each one offering up its own bit of suspenseful action.The book has its flaws. Raoden and Sarene are a bit too consistently good, too consistently successful. A darker tinge to each would have helped greatly. As it is, one never truly doubts whether or not they'll succeed and succeed relatively easily. Raoden is painted as a reformer, dangerous enough that it is not beyond consideration that his own father had him \\"killed\\" so as to rid himself of a gadfly son always undermining his father's feudal system. But there's too much of the sense of \\"royal presence and power\\" underlying his created Elantrian society to make that description feel completely true. His study and (not really giving much away here) solution to the disappearance of the magic also seems to come too easily and its repair is pretty anti-climactic.Hrathen's story is the strongest of the three. Partially because his character undergoes some change, unlike the other two. Partially because he has a more complex storyline--he must use politics and public relations to battle the Princess for control of Arelon and also battle a challenging and more fundamentalist/fanatic upstart priest from within his own group who would be just as happy to see all of Arelon killed as converted. All this while he battles his own interior doubts. If the other main characters are a bit pallid, Hrathen brings a much more colorful (darkly colorful) edge to things.The story, as mentioned, does come to a resolution, though it also leaves room for Sanderson to further explore these characters (well, some of them) and this land. If he chooses to do so, I'd pick up another Elantrian book. Elantris isn't great, but it's better than average and as a first novel bodes well for future ones. Recommended."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"It is rather refreshing to pick up a fantasy novel that is not based upon it's many many predecessors. This book is simply fabulous. I have only completed about half of it, but I have stayed up till 5 A.M. reading it! (I am a slow reader) I would recommend this book to any fantasy reader, though I think those not accustomed to fantasy would like it as well. The setting is fantasy, but the character developement, plot, and overall presentation of the book is very impressive and welcome to readers of all kinds."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Elantris starts off with a great conflict and premise, and gives you a reason to continue reading, as you seek to uncover the plight of the Elantrians and the disaster of the Reod; which has affected far more than just the once-great city of Elantris.My great complaint with Elantris is that, except for a few exceptions, the characters are not always consistent or fully conceived. Raoden is well done and comes to life; but the purportedly intelligent Sarene lacks the support to convince me that she is more than just surface-smart, though her compassion is convincing enough. Hrathen's conflict is great but lacks on execution. His is a great struggle to subjugate a people with religion to avoid their death and destruction through domination by force. Compelling? It could have been!The political intrigue that could have been a profound part of the book, came off as fluff; at least when you compare it to The Song of Ice and Fire by George R. R. Martin--which I am obliged to do. But perhaps that comparison is unfair. It was Sanderson's first published book after all, how dare I compare it to the great GRRM?The magic system was interesting and different, but of Sanderson's later books it is probably his weakest. Also, with a central element of the climax hinging on how the system works--which in my opinion was a stretch of the imagination for the created world--it took away from the tangibility he had worked so hard to achieve.I've since read Mistborn, Warbreaker and his work on The Gathering Storm. Each experience has been unique and different. The quality has improved on his own work, though it still lacks something for me to consider awe-inspiring. His work on The Gathering Storm, in my humble opinion, was the BEST book of the series by some magical, whimsical quirk of fate, Jordan's exhaustive work, and/or Sanderson's growing ability. I know much of it was already completed by Jordan, but can you just imagine the sheer weight of content and tapestry of threads to weave into a cohesive tale? If anyone has listened to his Writing Excuses podcasts with Dan Wells and Howard Tayler you can conclusively state that he is a force to be reckoned with, and if his first couple books were somewhat lackluster, they still intrigued with his magic, setting and plots; even if his characters (at times) needed work. Perhaps his only true failure in this book was in being a first-time published author, and needing time to grow in his craft.I went into the book with no expectation or knowledge of the author, merely curiosity as to what the man was like who had been chosen to finish the Wheel of Time. Ultimately I would recommend the read. Elantris is a great city and concept by an author that people will speak of for years to come--more than just for his sheer volume of work, but for his ability to create something that feels new.I'd give Elantris a 3.5 (if Amazon allowed it) out of 5 for being better than some, and a good start by a new writer. Come visit me on my blog: [...] and tell me what you thought."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This is Sanderson's first novel, and in my opinion it shows. I give this book marks for the setting--I think the idea behind the city of Elantris itself was actually quite strong. Starting from this premise, I expected something a little more interesting. Sanderson does a reasonable job keeping the revelations coming, even if those don't pack quite the punch that they should, but ultimately for me this one fell short.What I did not like about the book, however. First, the dialogue. Honestly, it really got under my skin, and did not take long to do so. I believe it was supposed to be witty, or funny, but in my opinion was simply annoying. There is far too much TALKING in this book. Characters are planning constantly--discussing plans over dinner, holding meetings, \\"calling\\" each other on their supernatural telephones. Remove the \\"banter\\" and this book would be a hundred pages shorter (and quite a bit better).The characters themselves were dull beyond reason. I think that Raoden was the only storyline that I was able to stay interested in, mostly because he was the most active of the bunch. Sarene, as others have mentioned, was a chore to read, and really not much of a character at all. There was a feel of the stereotypical heroine there that I found a bit insulting. \\"Anything boys can do, girls can do better.\\" I am not five years old. And as in the Mistborn trilogy, these characters sigh constantly. This word appears so frequently in his books that you can't help noticing the repetition.Pacing was an issue. This is a fairly fat book, and did not need to be anywhere near this length. I think that in spacing the revelations and the action out the way they were, Sanderson weakened his plot. There was a story under there, and the book would have benefitted a great deal by being edited down somewhat.That said, this was a first novel, and I'm in Sanderson's corner. I came to his work because I wanted to see who was finishing the Wheel of Time. I have read the Gathering Storm, and was happy with the result, and I think the Jordan estate has chosen wisely in having Sanderson finish the series. His writing in that book is clean and competent, and he has done an admirable job with a difficult task. For that, I thank him.My recommendation: try the Mistborn books, and read this one after them. Perhaps this was meant as a young adult novel, and that is why it felt a little off for me (I'm an old guy). Also, at the time of this review, his Way of Kings series has not been published yet. I'm guessing that that will be the work he is ultimately known for, and Elantris will be more a footnote. I wish him luck, and hope that his potential is fulfilled."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This is a great book to renew fantasy readers belief in the genre's ability to make brand new concepts in fantasy writing. It is not so much the characters, the plot, the writing style or the details of the magic itself. I would have to say that the best thing about this book is its scope of originality.The author manages to wrap magic, love, theology, politics and adventure into one broad reality. It gives the reader a depth and belief into the world that has been created. It feels like you are viewing a fully three dimensional universe because the book describes a world where there are characters that are concerned with more than just magic.Although don't get me wrong I think that the detail and thought put into the system of magic is incredible. I really like the way that the author gives the reader detail (but not too much) and explanation as to the mechanics."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This is an engrossing book with an interesting premise and interesting characters. I liked that it is a very full story completed in the space of one volume; most fantasies seem to come in multi-volume epics and being able to finish a story in one book was refreshing.Both the female and male protaganists are strong and unconventional. The author succeeds well in making them and the other characters feel real. Their counterparts are fascinating in a twisted way, though I would have liked to learn more about them, especially the complex and conflicted main antagonist. With more exploration he could easily have been the most interesting character in the story.Both the politics and religion of Elantris contribute to the livliness of this tale as do the mysterious \\"aons\\", which appear to be an Elantrian version of runes. There is plenty of physical action to keep things moving but I enjoyed the fact that scholarship, politics, and religious deliberation were equally important to the story's forward motion. I would definitely reccommend this book to lovers of fantasy. I can hardly wait to read the author's second novel, \\"Mistborn\\", which is a reccommendation in itself!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I loved the way magic was used in here. I hope Brandon comes back to this storyline and writes more about it. I will now have to grab is new series and see if it is just as good."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"A standalone (so far? I suspect a sequel will be forthcoming) novel set in a world with broken magic and major political upheaval. It's an interesting story, well-written, and the love story is secondary to the rest of the novel. I bought this on the recommendation of a bookseller at a sci fi con, and I don't regret the purchase at all.My one complaint is the use of non-English words for things we have perfectly useful equivalents, but the author limits that to mainly cultural things (like priestly ranks and, more annoying, friend-relationships). To be honest, I'm only sensitive to this particular hangup at the moment because I was at a sci fi con this weekend and attended a panel on the subject-- most of the time, it wouldn't bother me, which is why I still give it 5 stars.It's a good book if you like fantasy novels. It reminded me very strongly of the video game Planescape: Torment, in the sense of the main character being somewhat not-alive, and in the overall tone of a world in decay, but not without hope."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I'm surprised to hear this is his first novel. Sanderson writes as if he has the experience of several successful novels under his belt. I read alot and I normally can predict correctly what will occur next in a novel, yet he had me fooled even with the trival things until the very last page.In this novel you will find twist, intrigue, and just a smidgen of romance. Elantris was a powerful city of gods and goddesses with wonderous powers that was used for the good of all. Yet, ten years ago that power suddendly disappered. The once gods and goddessed of Elantris turned into horid half corpses without even a heart beat. The gates of Elantris was closed and locked from the outside and the people stricken with the wasting sickness were locked inside without water, food, or clothing. Many turned feral. Others laid in the street in agony. Yet, when the prince of land woke one morning to find himself with the tell-tell signs of becoming an Elantris, he decides to change things for the better in dismal city of Elantris.Meanwhile, his fiance', who was on her way to meeting him for the first time, finds herself a widow before she even becomes a bride. She, too, decides to change things the better in the city of \\"free\\" people and is determine to save the land.Great story. Great premise. I'm looking forward to more from this author."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Thank you Mr. Sanderson for making me lose a lot of sleep last night! It's been a long time since I've read a book that kept me interested enough to lose sleep over. The concept and story were interesting and unique, with delightfully unpredictable twists and turns. I loved the characters! I also agree with the other reviewers who liked the fact that it's not a never-ending story that may not get finished before the author dies, but is a self-contained story that can stand alone without a sequel. (Although there is room for one, and I'd love to see it happen!)I can't remember a book in the last couple of years I enjoyed as much as this one. I plan on re-reading it in the future."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This book had a lot of promise, but it didn't live up to it. The world building was pretty weak, but that can often be forgiven in most books. But usually when world building is weak it's because the author decided to focus more on character development. This is not the case with Elantris. I found most of the main characters to be weak and two dimensional, especially the two main protagonists, Reoden and Serene. These two characters were a little too perfect, a little too smart, and a little too quick to catch on for my tastes. The only character I found to be well drawn was the priest Hrathen. I also thought the dialogue was pretty bad. It seemed forced at times and there was too much supposedly \\"witty banter\\" for my liking. There were also a lot of infodumps, were one character would explain, in detail, to another something that everyone already knew. So, with all these negative aspects, you might wonder why I would give Elantris a 3/5 stars. Well, I liked some of the ideas in the novel. As I said above I liked the character of Hrathen, and I liked the motivations behind his actions. I also liked the idea behind the city of Elantris: it was somewhat of a magical leper colony. All in all Mr. Sanderson had some good ideas, but I thought the execution left something to be desired."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Don't get me wrong I love Brandon Sanderson writing style, He is unique in the way that his mind can come up with some of the stuff he writes. Also, the worlds he creates are out of routine science fiction fantasy novels.But in reference to this book, the story development was so-so, I am going to give it a 2/5 stars, the characters were semi great (some dulls and predictable) 3/5, and the storyline was a 5/5 stars, great imagination on his behalf.But after reading mistborn, which he wrote much later after Elantris, I felt this book felt short of my expectations. What can I say without offending the writer; At times it was just too LONG, tedious, and pointless in some chapters, I felt the editors could have helped him a bit more or his creative writing team.This novel was advertised as 1 book, no prospect of sequels, well they fail at reading the last couple of chapters of the book, as it leaves one with so many unanswered questions. In the end the story leaves you empty wondering so much that you end up been confused. 2nd I felt that the writing was rushed to maybe meet some form of deadline, whatever the reason, well that it is why i am giving him a 3 star. &lt;> I LOVE YOUR WRITING SANDERSON, I AM A FAN OF YOUR WORK DONT GET ME WRONG &lt;> but this book fail short of expectations as a science fiction reader. But good try and kudos for making money on it :)."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This is truly an amazing work of fiction. I would say to anyone looking for a good book to read- or anyone not for that matter- that it doesn't get much better than this. My friends and I now have a new term- \\"The Elantris Syndrome\\"- for when a book is so engaging that you can't stop thinking about it until you finish it. I recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Elantris captures the spirit of George R.R. Martin's 'A Song of Fire and Ice' series, but with one major difference: there's no sequel to read!Author Brandon Sanderson manages to infuse this book with plenty of humour (more than Martin uses), throne room shenanigans, mystery, and magic both good and bad. Once we get introduced to the main characters and the setting of the world where Elantris takes place, Sanderson masterfully cuts from character to character, managing to propel the story along at a brisk speed while turning up the tension and sense of urgency.Sanderson has bought himself a wealth of faith from this effort, and I will eagerly read his next offering."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This was a good book. Frankly, it was nice to find a scifi/fantasy book that was NOT part of a series."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I discovered Brandon Sanderson when he took over writing for the Wheel of Time series. I have since read EVERY one of his available works, and he is now one of my favorite writers. Elantris is almost as good as the Mistborn trilogy, which completely blew me away. I have never read a trilogy and immediately started again from the beginning. That is how engrossing Sanderson's writing is. Must read."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Elantris has a very interesting concept and world built around it, but, for me, the characters fell short. There was a great deal of analysis and plot development through the book, but those were mostly the only interesting things happening. The concept of Elantris (fallen gods, mystery, desolation) and the countries surrounding it (political intrigue, battles of wits) were, for the most part, well thought-out.However, the three characters we follow (Raoden, Sarene, and Hrathen) all share a similar logic-based narrative. All three characters are members of high society (a prince, a princess, and essentially a warrior priest). By the end of the book, the only one I vaguely cared about was Raoden. That is to say, they are almost completely impossible to relate with. Raoden and Sarene themselves are almost too perfect in themselves. At least in Raoden's case, he is believable because he is thrust into a society that does not accept him, and he deals with it in a way that doesn't stretch the limits of imagination of the human spirit. But with Sarene, and I say this speaking from a perspective of a woman, her execution is stale. Whereas the context of Raoden's difficulty is extremely believable, Sarene's intelligence in the face of the court seems staged. The interactions between her and other characters are hard to believe, and therefore the characters she interacts with are hard to believe as well. When it's constantly thrown at you (from other characters, no less) that Sarene is witty, intelligent, but has a severe complex about her marriageability, it feels heavy-handed. The respect given to her doesn't feel earned, and it's hard to relate to her hardships, because they're seemingly dealt with easily and smugly. When compared to Raoden being thrusted into a city of dead people, Sarene's witty remarks and petty manipulations come off as ignorant, which is the direct opposite of what the author wants you to think of her, as shown multiple times by her father saying something along the lines of, \\"oh, Sarene, you're so clever, don't torture those Arelians too much, you're too smart for them.\\"However, my main problem with the characters and their development (of which Sarene has next to nothing of, besides the resolution of her marriage complex... by getting married), is the lack of emotion. There are rarely tears, and they're always wiped away quickly because they're brave! There is no emotional impact. There is no fear. There is an emotional scale of a teaspoon, ranging from haughty to humbled, all logical responses. There is no joy or sorrow, only mild interest and (very) brief sense of loss. In other words, the tone of the book is largely the same, and therefore so much potential tension is lost. I was never excited reading this book, because none of the characters were.These complaints aren't to say that the books premises aren't interesting. In fact, the world creation is extremely good, with an interesting magic system, an avoidance of elves and dragons, and a lot of mythology and wonder. it's just that Sanderson chose to let us only see it through essentially the same pair of eyes--eyes with mostly logic, not human ones."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I was impressed with the level of detail that Sanderson was able to achieve in a one volume fantasy book. The story and the characters were both engaging and compelling. I enjoyed reading it and would recommend it to someone looking for a good fantasy read but doesn't want to commit to a series."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Very good read. I couldn't guess what the ending would be and I love that about a book. This story takes you to a whole new world that sounds fascinating to live in. The fall of a great people, a horrible king, and hope that is just barely out of reach that only one person can restore. Great story with great characters. The ending leaves you hoping there is a sequel..but I don't think there is."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"There are so many reviews im gonna make this really short. The one thing i want people to know about this book is that it may be considered boring, especially in the start. There is no real action to speak of until you get to the last third or so of the book. Yes there are good characters, story, even some little mysteries for you to try to understand before all the info is known. Just know, if you are someone who enjoys battles more than intrigue you may find this book lacking."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"For years now my best friend has been trying to get me to read the Wheel of Time series and other fantasy novels. In my stubbornness I refuse because they are just too long. Then one day this book shows up on my kindle (a gift). If you are interested in Fantasy novels or want to know what all the fuss is about Brandon Sanderson is... READ THIS BOOK.Sanderson is a fantastic writer, good enough to get me to go to his book signing, good enough to get me to read more fantasy novels, good enough to TRY THIS STANDALONE NOVEL. If you hate it, no big deal. Its short enough to not waste your time. If you LOVE it, great, he has plenty other titles for you to try."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"item came on time in excellent condition great service hope I can do business with this seller again highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"When I started reading I thought it would not be a very good book, I was wrong. Well written, kept my interest all the way through. Characters were well defined, plot was very interesting and kept my interest all the way through I had a hard time finding a place to stop reading."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Expertly written, this book pulled me in from the very start. Sanderson is an extremely skillful writer to be able to spin an entirely original and gripping tale from beginning to end in one book. Elantris, the capital of Arelon, once stood as a bright, radiant, vigorous city. Ten years ago, however, the magic that the city and people thrived on deteriorated, and the city as well as the people began to decay. Once a powerful and god-like people, those taken by the transformation of the Shaod now are confined to the city of Elantris, stuck in an in-between state, unable to die and suffering for it. When the Shaod unexpectedly takes Raoden, prince of Arelon, he refuses to resort to the state of misery that Elantrians have succumbed to, and instead strives to rebuild a society within the city and unlock the secrets behind what happened to the magic ten years ago. Meanwhile, Sarene, princess of the bordering country of Kae, travels to Arelon as Raoden's betrothed to join the two countries as allies, but upon arriving to Arelon, she believes Raoden to be dead. Sarene throws herself into the turmoil and must see if she can use her political wit to save the country from the bordering country of Fjorden, which is determined to convert Arelon to their religious ways or destroy them instead. This novel contains aspects that appeal to all people: adventure, intrigue, romance, politics, magic, and mystique. Sanderson breaks away from all other fantasy genre stereotypes and creates a captivating new story out of imagination and mysteriousness. Readers everywhere will never want to put it down!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I enjoyed the whole book. Very fast and witty. Recommend this to those who like a surprise ending. Brandon Sanderson, very well done."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I loved that the author went in a different direction than most. Instead of our hero's using physical strength they used their minds to deal with situations that were beyond their control. It was great to see really clever hero's."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I have to say Sanderson has a way of making even the most mundane of things extremely interesting just by the way he tells them, would highly recommend all of his works starting with this one."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Sanderson has 4 epic works (5 if you count his portion of Wheel of Time), a couple of short novels, stories and novellas. Of the 4 epic works (excluding Wheel of Time, which I havent read), you have the Mistborn series, and the first volume of the Way of Kings series. You then have Elantris and Warbreaker, substantial full length stand-alone novels.These 4 epic works have a fundamental difference -- Mistborn and Way of Kings have turbo-charged action fueled by the magic system. Some criticize the action as over the top/video game style action and think the heroes are over-powered or in god mode, while others think the magic systems are excellent, and support the pulse-pounding action very well. Warbreaker and Elantris are different. There is that same level of creativity and imagination, but the action is more subdued. So if you are specifically looking for high octane action, look somewhere else.What you get here is a very creative and highly original story, likeable characters and reasonable doses of action, all rendered in Sanderson's simple and tightly written style. The level of complexity to the characters is not terribly high, but they are likeable. Moreover, while there isnt a lot of high octane action, there is enough lower key action, and the story moves very well. The story also has a certain charm to it, perhaps due to its originality and creativity. There are also a few weaker aspects to the plotting, such as the romance, but overall the plot is good enough to support the original ideas.The reader understands essentially immediately that the hero will eventually figure out how to restore Elantris and its people to their god-like level of power, and that this will come just in the nick of time to save the day from an expected invasion. No mystery there. Nonetheless, the journey to get to that point is relatively compelling due to the creativity of the world and pacing of the book.Verdict: This is an easy recommendation if you like Sanderson's other books, and are OK with somewhat more subdued action than found in Mistborn or Way of Kings. If you require deap and fully believable characters, Sanderson may not be your thing, and that is true of this book as well, but if you value creativity and atmosphere, Elantris delivers."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Summary:This fantasy book is based on political, religious, and social conflict. The magic system, AonDor, is an interesting mixture of various other magic systems -- caliphaphy, zen, the force, thaumauragy. I found the magic system to be the most interesting but when you find out what was broken thus stopping the magic of the Elantrians, it was a bit of a let down -- good build up but overly simple explaination.The characters in the book are interesting for the most part. I found Radeon and Sarene clearly the best written characters. The other characters in the story needed to be there but they took up too many pages...slowed down the interesting and well executed parts of the book.The religious side of the book did not go into the philosphy of the religions just that one was violet, required total domination and destruction of non-believers (translation: Islam in the modern world) while the other religions were mostly peaceful and took a live and let live approach. I would have like to have had seen more on the Jindo religion (sort of like Buddahism combined with Shintao(sp?) ).If you enjoy this authors other books, then you will probably like this one. But, it is a slow read and fairly long so be prepared to invest some time into it.There is clearly an opening for a sequel."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This was a great audio book, loved the voice and the story. Sanderson has a great ability to build this amazing world that you feel completely apart of. I really wanted to go and see the City of Elantris and its people after it was restored to it's former glory.The people of Elantris as well as the city have become ill to the point of near death. They are ghastly to look upon and are left in the city or thrown back into it for fear that it is contagious. Roeden the Prince ends up with this illness and cast into Elantris just a few days before his wedding. The poor guy and his poor fiance Serene I felt bad for them. Worst yet Serene thinks her husband to-be is dead. Serene is such a likable character she knows she is different from the other girls, not quite as pretty, overly tall, smart, feisty and thick headed, she fights for truth, and things that are right. She is very courageous, and loves her people. Her husband to-be well he is quite handsome (well when not inflicted with the illness of Elantris), smart, kind and chivalrous. He becomes a leader in the hopeless Elantris, he cares for these people who are his people. He sees how hopeless and sad, and pained the people have become and he wants to give them hope, which he does. Without hope life would be miserable, hope is what gets us through the rough times in our lives, realizing that it will pass, or learning to find the good in a bad situation. Hope is like a life preserver, keeping us buoyed up until someone or something comes along and relief is found. That is Roden to these people. Outside of Elantris there is conflict of power going on between the king and his lords as well as Hrathen and his god. There are plenty of twist and turns to this story that keep you guessing. Quite an enjoyable read. I look forward to reading more from this author.content:clean read, some minor violence"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I Love Sanderson's books, this was the 4th time I'd read Elantris and it's still great. I read it to my 12 yr old and he loves it too.I would recommend this and all other Sanderson's books."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Elantris is Brandon Sanderson's foray into the \\"published author's club\\" and what a great introductory novel it is. It is not your typical fantasy novel -- and that's good. It is also not a tragedy centered fantasy novel -- and that's good too. Elantris is new, different, weird, and at the same time fun. The mixing of politics and religion I found especially fascinating. It mixes a lot of ancient myths, puts a new twist on the Atlantis story, and gives a serious look at what would happen to society that lost their gods in one night.I also personally LOVE the idea of stand alone fantasy novels and I wish there were more of them around. I hate being forced to wait years, or decades before a story is concluded. Trilogy's are great, but 10 and 15 book series (WoT) are just too much for my patience, no matter how good they are. It's great to have these stand alone novels that do what epic fantasy does best -- transport us to a new world, meet new characters, and discover wicked magic systems -- while at the same time wrapping things up and allowing us to move on to new things. Of course, there could be a sequel to Elantris someday -- and that would be great, but it is a solid, stand-alone fantasy novel worth reading.If your one of those fantasy fans who are tired of the \\"same old same old\\" and wants something new and vibrant, give Elantris a try. If you enjoy traditional fantasy and are tired of ultra grim stories in which nothing good ever happens, then you too should give Elantris a read. It has something for everyone and is a good intro to Brandon Sanderson's writing. A solid 4 stars!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Like all of Mr. Sanderson's other novels, this one is wholly unique. Never have I read anything similar about it. The premise of the book - of immortals worshiped as gods who were one day cursed - was something that hooked me from the start. The beginning of the book took off on a great start, and kept me hooked, but I found that my interest started to wane later on in the book. The climax was good, but seemed very rushed. There was a lot of building up to it, only to have the climax end in a couple of pages.I did find it somewhat more challenging to keep the minor characters separate. Most of them seemed to share the same \\"voice\\" that I was trying to remember who they were, how the main characters felt about them, etc."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Very interesting story and the ending is surprising. The magical system is dramatically simple and make everyone bravo. Hope the story can be continued."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I really can't understand why this piece of infantile drivel has garnered so many stars ! It has so many things wrong with it describing them would fill a book.Do not waste your time."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"If the book hadn't been missing 30 pages in the middle I would've rated the story itself as a four. Hopefully it was just my book that was missing those pages and not just a printing error. I would like to buy the book at some time but will have to look at a physical copy before I purchase."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This is an appealing fantasy with a number of original features. Although there are a few hanging questions, and it seems likely that there will be sequels, the story is essentially resolved in this volume. The magic system is interesting, and the reason for the fall of Elantris offers an intriguing puzzle to supplement the main plot, which is largely comprised of rather conventional court intrigue, but very well handled.The plot device of the separated royal lovers (although in this case the lovers have never actually met) works very well and sustains interest nicely. Princess Sarene is a somewhat more interesting character than Rao, who comes across as a bit too perfect. Fortunately she takes center stage for much of the book. The supporting characters are well drawn and distinctive. There is also an antagonist who is given considerably more depth than is usual, which further spices up the plot.I found that it held my interest quite well, although I was somewhat disappointed by the ending. The wrap-up came a bit too fast and too easy, and the ultimate deus ex machina was a bit too predictable. There was a nice plot twist (though honestly foreshadowed) introducing a new threat near the end that I think could have been developed a bit better. As it was, the threat never quite came across as dire."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"So I am a huge Sanderson fan. I haven't read all of his works but i have been very impressed with what I have read........until now. Elantris is a book that left me with the distinct feeling that the author had an awesome idea for a short story and spent several hundred pages getting ready to tell it. It seems that it takes forever to get to know all the cast and their personalities. Many times the conversation seems like a cleverly disguised history lesson on the world of elantris. But ultimately I just felt bored throughout.The characters, while very well developed were stereotypical and overplayed. The virtuous prince, raised in a family of a vapid detached mother and an evil, money hungry, dictator father some how produced a virtuous, selfless, caring and genuinely well rounded perfect ruler. The independent, highly intelligent female lead who can fight and is perfect to continue to galvanize and motivate the political social club started by the prince into a revolutionary force to overthrow the evil dictator father. And the zealot priest antagonist just so happens, as we find out right at the end, to be the ubber ninja monk boss fight at the end of the book. Even the supporting cast felt like it was picked off the ready made support characters list.I don't know. I believe that many people will enjoy the book. But to me it was very obviously the work of a fledgling author. I am glad that Sanderson has developed beyond where he was when he wrote this."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I like the tone of the book, the setting, the magic, but the book is just not believable. It's got mood and atmosphere, a workable plot, but all the characters speak in the same voice. No one changes, for better or worse. Everyone does everything exactly the same way, every time: the bungling king is an idiot, start to finish. Over ten years in power and he's still a complete idiot, enough to be totally fooled by an ugly-yet-beautiful princess who is an expert at absolutely everything she does. It takes the prince a few weeks to figure out what an entire city of demi-gods, with multiple lifetimes of experience, weren't able to figure out.Reading the book, it reminds me of high school fiction, where all the characters are the same age and are so much smarter than all the adults around them. And, of course, there's a predictable romance, very gooey and sweet. This is definitely a first novel, one that feels like it was written by a young adult, or at least written for young adults. You can skip this book if you're a fan of heavier or darker fantasy, like GRR Martin, Steven Erikson, R. Scott Bakker, Glen Cook, Stephen Donaldson, even Tolkien, et al. Note that I'm not suggesting you skip Mr. Sanderson's work, just this particular novel."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Like other reviewers, I found the protagonists too perfect and unbelievable. I enjoyed the whole Elantris concept. The conversations were not believable (similar to the Honor Harrington books?). I found the names of most of the characters to be forgettable and confusable. There's not much action that happens until right at the end, and as some people have commented, some of it seems to happen just for stuff to happen."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Note: I've changed this review after thinking about it a bit more.For a debut novel, this is pretty good. There a few niggles which I'll get out of the way first. Characterization isn't quite as good as it could be. The three main characters are somewhat bland. The only obvious personality trait is one character \\"tapping their cheek in thought\\" (which I just noticed is the first 'key phrase' listed for this book) and somewhat amusingly, this happens pretty close to clockwork, once in every chapter that features this character (a friend of mine knew instantly what I was talking about even though he'd only gotten 1/3 of the way into the book).There's one fairly strong emotion revealed by a character near the end of the book (first to the reader, then to another character) that really seems to come out of left field and honestly just doesn't work. Fortunately it doesn't really detract from the story, but it strains the reader's suspension of disbelief. The author also liberally mixes in 'telling' with the 'showing'. Generally in fiction, it's better to show something than to outright tell the reader it, even if it's through a character telling another one something. Instead, we end up spending quite a bit of time in the minds of the characters as they remember the past events that made them who they currently are. Often, the author repeats himself in multiple chapters (yes, I get the point why one character had problems finding love.. I got it the first time the author stated it, along with the second, third, and seventh times).There are some inconsistencies with the main 'mystery' in the book. It's a huge surprise to one of the main characters when he discovers some of the specifics of a certain physical condition that he undergoes, and yet I find it hard to believe that it isn't common knowledge (some characters seem to have heard rumors that are correct, others appear to know it without having been told). There are other minor inconsistencies as well.Ok, the above sounds way too negative. I really did enjoy this book. Why?It has a refreshingly small group of main characters and places. I've been reading novels with dozens of main characters and places lately. This book focuses mainly on two places and three characters. The three characters each get one chapter, in order, before the cycle repeats, at least until very late in the book. The timing of each chapter rarely overlaps (so it's not really the same scene from three different points of view, just seeing time moving on from three different points of view, if that makes sense). Other characters are brought in, but usually relatively slowly, and always appearing in relation to a main character (and only near the end are we privy to one or two of 'their minds' - as alluded to above, I actually think this makes these characters somewhat more interesting than the main characters to some extent). The symmetry is really nicely done.There's a major mystery, some nice poltics, a strong female character (though sometimes Sanderson's portrayal of her feels just a bit off - the same friend I referred to above nailed it when he said the character felt like a 'modern' woman in a medieval society), and an exciting ending that wraps up most of the loose threads. One loose thread that's left dangling is unfortunately something I was hoping to find out more of (specifically, how something was created) while another really felt like a red herring (regarding someone's relationship with someone else) that just didn't do anything at all for the plot.Overall, I found this novel a refreshing read, with not as much to have to remember as some giant fantasy series, with a relatively coherent main plot and enough twists to keep me entertained and interested in how things were going to turn out. Recommended in spite of some problems, and I'll definitely be checking out his Mistborn series."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I resisted started this novel for a very long time. There was something about it that just seemed to tell me it wasn't going to be all that good. Then I read that the widow of Robert Jordan had selected Brandon Sanderson to complete the final volume in The Wheel of Time series and that made me take notice. Elantris is a good place to start if you're new to Mr. Sanderson's work, as I was, since his second effort was a multi-part series, which I just didn't want to get that involved with until I knew I'd be satisfied with this novel. Having just finished Elantris I'm feeling very good about Sanderson's chances of writing a great final volume for Robert Jordan's magnum opus.Elantris is a rarity in the fantasy field, a single volume fantasy; that in of itself is quite an accomplishment for any author. Sanderson does a great job of setting up his world and developing it as the story moves along. In addition, he's created a magicl system that is wholly new and interesting from what we normally get in fantasy. The unfortuant part is that the magic isn't really seen until the end of the novel, but it still works. The majority of the novel is taken up with the politcal and religious machinations going on in the country of Arelon. At the center of all that is the most intrigiuing character of the entire novel, Princess Sarene. I have to give Sanderson more credit for giving us something that is so often lacking in fantasy novels these days: a fully-realized female lead who is the match of any man around her. While Sanderson does an excellent job of developing Sarene it's at the cost of really devloping the other major character, Sarene's presumed dead husband Prince Raoden, but that's doesn't detract too much from the overall story.If I have one quibble with Elantris it's that Sanderson get's bogged down in minutiae, which makes the story drag in several places. Of course, even the greats like Martin and Jordan suffer from this, as well. Overall, this was a very good, very interesting novel and it makes me look forward to what Mr. Sanderson can do for The Wheel of Time."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Finally, after getting bogged down by the hundreds of trilogies out there, there is an author with a \\"novel\\" idea. A stand alone book is a rareity in this day and age, but hopefully Brandon Sanderson will inspire other authors to do the same.Elantris has all of the charecteristics of popular fantasy, but Sanderson has fresh new ideas on how to bring life back into the genre. There were plenty of turns in the plot to keep the reader off guard without messing up the beutifully laid out story line.Elantris is a book that I have recomended to many of my friends and they came back asking about other books by Brandon Sanderson.To Mr. Sanderson, we are all eagerly awaiting."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Elantris, by Brandon Sanderson, is a elegant story that weaves both plot evolution and character development into a seamless tapestry of intrigue and enjoyment. Arelon, a nation once ruled by the divine and benevolent Elantrians, has fallen into petty scheming. The mysterious Shaod, once a blessing which could elevate any ordinary person by glorious transformation from man to Elantrian, has become a curse. The once great city of Elantris is in ruins and the people of Arelon are caught in the vice of a greedy aristocracy.A political marriage designed to forge an alliance from an uneasy truce falls apart after a mysterious death. More disturbing is the sudden interest of the Fjordell priesthood in converting the people of Arelon to their religion. Religious fervor, or a prelude to war? Shrouding all of these mysteries is the greatest mystery of all: what destroyed Elantris those ten years ago, and turned the Shaod from a blessing into a curse?Brandon Sanderson has done an excellent job telling his tale. I am reminded of the work of David and Leigh Eddings when I see the way Sanderson brings his characters to life off the page. For all its complexity, the story continually moves forward instead of falling prey to its own nuances. All in all I recommend Elantris."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Sanderson creates a captivating world in Elantris, a mix between magical wonderland and hellish zombie-filled nightmare. The book quickly grabs one's attention, but early on Sanderson dissipates the horror aspects of the story. The story slows at that point, and is spoken by committee: groups of characters meet at parties, whisper in throne rooms, converse at the pub, plan at a lookout. These are surrounded with novel fantasy elements, a classically told love story, and well-done plot lines. Sanderson could easily have made Elantris much edgier, which I would have preferred. The fast start and satisfying ending combine for an interesting fantasy story, one well suited to younger readers."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I've been reading fantasy books for over 30 years now. I guess I've read just about all of the major and most of the minor authors out there. The one thing that I look for in a book regardless of genre is great character development. Elantris should be considered a primer for aspiring fantasy writers in how to write self motivated non stereotypical characters in a fully imagined world. The plot takes more twists and turns than I've experienced in many of the multi-tome works out there. And the twists *always* caught me totally off guard! I won't reveal any here, but I will say its been years since I held a book in my hands with my jaw on the ground as I sat amazed at what just took place. This book is truely refreshing and it indeed a notable introduction to Mr. Sanderson's talent. I look forward to reading his future works - this man is one to watch folks.All that being said, I need to put a note about the level of action in the book for those of you that are looking for glorified dungeons and dragons type of action adventure - this book does not have that type of theme. Rather it is centered about the city of Elantris and its inhabitants and the action is more political and character interactive. So, if you're looking for a good swashbuckling adventure, look elsewhere ... or grow up a little and read this book to find out how a fantasy book should be written!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I really enjoyed this story and can't wait to see his next novel. The characters are enjoyable and the story is paced well. I recommend reading it!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"The book is engaging: the story moves at a nice clip and there are some neat ideas. However, I had some major problems with the book, most of which can probably be explained (though not excused) by the fact that this is clearly a first-time author. The problem's the characters: there is virtually no character development (Hrathen is somewhat of an exception). The characters basically don't make sense. Take Raoden: the guy loses everything, including his body as he knew it, his status, is cursed and outcast... and pretty much remains the same person?? He remains, as someone described below, a cocky young man. The author is perhaps callow or has never met a disabled person, or actually been in pain for some period of time. Well, fine, what about at least trying to imagine it? Same with the princess: sure, she was trained for it, but wouldn't living in a country with obviously different mores, and attempting to change it to boot, change you a little bit? Or at least give you some insight? Nope, nothing.Other issues: the names sound seriously lame like something out an RPG (Hrathen? Fjorden? Teod?), annoying and arbitrary time markes (10 years, 3 months). Not serious issues - if I cared about the characters one bit. Was kind of rooting for the priest, because he was actually somewhat interesting.2 1/2 stars."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This is a great book. I really like Brandon Sanderson's writing. I especially like how the \\"bad guy\\" ends up saving the good guys in the end."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Good stand alone srory...which is nice since everyone and his brother / or sister is trying to be Tolkien. Its a shame he couldn't do the FINAL book in WoT in one.Write a good story that you can tell in two or three volumes. Or better yet, One. Jordan, Martin, Stirling....all HAD good stories and then decided to milk them for the bucks....probably publisher pressure."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"At one of my favorite but long lost websites for readers, Readerville, we once discussed why fantasy always seems to come in trilogies or, even worse, open-ended series of six or ten or an unending number of books. Since each entry in a fantasy seems to run close to 600 pages, one more or less commits to reading at least 1800 pages when diving into the first in a series, sometimes a wearisome prospect when all one wants to do is read something diverting. It's not a problem limited to fantasy -- Norman Spinrad discusses the same problem in the science fiction realm in the October/November 2006 issue of Asimov's Science Fiction -- but fantasy does seem especially prone to multiples. Writers complain that publishers require them to write in multiples rather than merely in 750 page blockbusters, because it's more profitable to market three 600-page books. The result is that we wind up with Charles Stross's The Merchant Princes trilogy, delightful books but with too much padding; or Gene Wolfe's The Knight and The Wizard, a single book arbitrarily divided into two volumes. Art must be sacrificed for commerce.Fortunately, authors still occasionally write stand-alone fantasies. One of the more recent, and more promising, in this category is Brandon Sanderson's Elantris. Sanderson's first novel is self-contained, even if its ending does hint at more to come in the same universe. The book is engagingly written, with plenty of intrigue, events spinning out of control, favorite characters in peril, and a magic that works rather like a science. Best of all from my perspective, one of the three primary viewpoint characters is a smart, competent woman who changes the fate of a kingdom and of her world.Sanderson's Elantris begins when Prince Raoden of Arelon wakes early one morning to find that he's been transformed while he slept. In the past, this curse would have been a blessing; now it means his exile from his city into Elantris, a neighboring city when the dead live. For that is what he is now: dead. His family \\"buries\\"him -- actually, some poor sap who resembles him -- as his \\"corpse,\\" his heart not beating but his mind as alive as ever, is forgotten.As Raoden is being escorted to the gates of a sort of hell, Princess Sarene of Teod, his betrothed, is arriving in Arelon to meet him. Although the marriage was arranged for reasons of state, Sarene and Raoden have been communicating through their Aons (bodiless beings who serve humans of their own accord), and Sarene is eager to meet her bridegroom. The unhappy news of Raoden's death greets her at the dock. Sarene immediately understands that this means, for political purposes, that she is a widow, for the treaty between the two nations provided for an immediate marriage to be recognized if anything should happen to either of the parties. Although Sarene is a wholly political creature who understands and accepts her fate, she is disappointed that she is a widow without ever having been a bride for more reasons than one.Sarene plunges into the political life of Arelon, quickly learning that the theoretical threat she and her father had perceived from Fjordell, a neighboring country that is rabidly committed to Shu-Dereth, a religion that demands ultimate obedience. Fjordell -- or, more properly, the powers that be in Shu-Dereth -- have sent Hrathen, a very high priest, to convert the nation, and quickly. Arelon's king ignores the threat, but Sarene attempts to subvert it instead, a high stakes game with the fate of nations at stake.Raoden is busy as well, in his far more limited universe. In Elantris, he tries to bring order to chaos, to give the people there a reason to rise above their savagery. He also studies the magic that used to make Elantris run, and to determine why that magic became a curse. He does his best to resist hunger and pain, for hurts do not heal in this city.It's a complicated, many-stranded tapestry that Sanderson weaves in Elantris. We read chapters from the viewpoints of Sarene, Raoden and Hrathen, and learn of all manner of skullduggery, wisdom and ambition. The plot and its devices are sufficiently different from the run-of-the-mill fantasy to make this book something special; you won't find a quest or knights or horses or dragons here, merely humans struggling in a world that happens to include magic. The writing is bright, witty and engrossing. Sanderson is a writer to watch.It really is too bad, though, that Sanderson had to throw in those teasers for another novel in the same universe. Readers apparently can't get enough of the universes they love, and publishers profit, but writing itself suffers when a book is incomplete. Sanderson has found a way to make Elantris stand on its own, avoiding the pitfalls of too many trilogies -- or quartets, or decologies -- in which the first and intermediate novels end in cliffhangers. It would be nice to say that he's managed to resist the lure of the multi-volume epic, but his new book, Mistborn, is explicitly the first of \\"The Final Empire.\\" Sanderson's website doesn't say how many books will make up this series, always a frightening sign. Much as I look forward to reading Mistborn, I hate the thought of starting a story I necessarily can't finish, possibly for years to come. As usual, capitalism and art seem to be incompatible."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Well written, intriguing plot, good characters. One of those stories that sticks with you-- you'll find yourself thinking about it months after reading it."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I'm not going to say much but this was one of the best fantasy books I have read in a long time. Kept me up until 4 a.m finishing it even though I had work the next day. I get up at 7 a.m. so a book that can keep me up like that is rather rare."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I went back and forth between giving this a three or a four rating, but only because I really wanted to give it a five. If that makes sense? It's because this book had the possibility of being a classic.The world building, the character development, and the plot were all exceptional. I won't go into the plot because it's already been done. But it has all of the things you would want out of a good political fantasy novel.I had two problems with it: 1.) There were a few too many \\"ta da!\\" moments which were barely foreshadowed and 2.) the end felt a bit rushed. That being said, I enjoyed the pacing of the novel at the end - it kept me engaged and on the edge of my seat, something that it takes a lot of skill to do with a book as long as this.The other thing that I loved about the novel is that it was complete. I am becoming so tired of series that never seem to end. Of course, a good fantasy is going to make me fall in love with the world and I am going to want more - but at the same time, I want the story to be complete when I finish a book. I understand that the author may (or is in the process of writing) more books in this worldscape, but this book is complete in and of itself.I will be recommending this book to friends and look forward to reading more from this author."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I'm giving this book a 5 just for the fact that it's flawlessly written and even more important, it's fresh.Yep, you can't go wrong with ELANTRIS. A super well defined plot, with twist and some suprises well positioned during each chapter. Well developed characters and sub-characters that helps the story go smoothly.The magic described in this book it's also extremely new and fresh. It's different in a good way. It's all over the place but the author manages to make it part of the history not the main character.Another thing to add, it's a fantasy book, not a fantasy series. So those of you who are kind of tired of buying 7 books of a series, you will find ELANTRIS a good excuse to read fantasy again. NOTE - (Nevertheless, Mr. Sanderson in his web page says that he might write more ELANTRIS in the future)An excellent first book indeed, already buying more stuff from Mr. Sanderson.Cheers."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"The book's characters are flat. The author puts too much detail in without advancing the story at all. There is no development of either plot or character. He could have told the same story in fewer than half the number of pages. It is not worth the time. Don't read it."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Its becoming harder and harder today to find such a great talent like Brandon Sanderson. This book is incredible, on par with some of the best fantasy out there.The most intriguing element to me of this story is that it is centered around a city (Elantris). My imagination got some practice building this place in my mind, something it hasn't gotten to do in a long time. From start to finish, Elantris itself plays a key role in the story, a fact that I found, well, really cool.The action begins right at the beginning, unexpectedly, and in the first few chapters I got a little confused, thinking I had missed something. But as you keep reading, everything is revealed, so if you pick this book up (which you should), avoid the temptation to keep flicking back and forth to find answers.Interesting revelations are spread out through the book and will keep the reader on its edge until the very end. When the end comes its a little too fast-paced, but I can't think of any good way to change it. Not to mention all loose ties are cleaned up, a good thing considering this is a stand-alone. That might be my only real complaint, but so many authors push their books out too far. Even though I'd like to see the characters again, its not necessary and I'd hate to see the story ruined. This book easily in my top five fantasy, and I'm confident most would agree with me after reading it."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I read Elantris for an English assignment, and I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Needless to say, I loved it!Elantris is one of the most origianl fantasy books I have read. The story is creative, and not something that has been recycled. It is new, exciting, and fast paced. Not only did I love the story, but I fell in love with the characters. Sarene is a strong female character that breaks all the sterotypes of women heroes. I also came to enjoy the character Hrathen. Througout the book it is hard to tell if he is good or bad. I haven't ever encoutered a character with such internal struggle in any book. It is so refreshing to see an atagonist that actually seems real, and you can see their conflict with their evil side.This book doesn't just have amazing characters, but it is fast paced, exciting, and humourous. Thats right, its funny at points! It blends fantasy with a refreshing blend of humor that doesn't seem out of place or gaudy.I recommend this book to all fantasy lovers!Brandon Sanderson is a welcome new fantasy writer with a great talent. I hope to see more work from this author!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I was really impressed with this book. The author takes you into the action quickly making you care about the characters and want to read on. He makes you work a little to figure out what is going on, which makes the plot more interesting and enjoyable. The twists and turns in the book are fascinating and there is rarely a dull moment (if ever). You get so enthralled with it, you don't want to put it down. It's so fun and unique--unlike any other fantasy I've read recently. It has a great prose style that is clear and descriptive, but not overly so. The characters are wonderful and believable and the plot is very smart. It's also nice to know that it is a standalone novel and so we don't get to the end and realize we have to wait for a sequel to find out what happens. I can't wait for the next novel published by Brandon. I'm sure it will be just as great. Orson Scott Card has given it wonderful reviews as well and he is one of the greatest scifi/fantasy writers of the past few decades!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I agree--it's one of the best fantasies I've read in recent years (see Card's review on his own site). From page one, Elantris is more than the typical quest fantasy, the expected \\"stranger leaves town\\" or \\"stranger arrives in town\\" plot. The pacing keeps you wanting to turn the pages, while the characters make you care about them. Original and insightful. A must read."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Brandon Sanderson's debut novel is the best work of fantasy that has come out in years. It is gripping from the very first sentence, and keeps the reader enthralled for every one of its 487 pages. He creates worlds that are so real that the reader feels like a part of them, so vividly that it's easy to see it and belong to them. Like Tolkien, he has a knack for creating new races, places, and even language --- look at the end for an interesting glossary that adds to the reality of the novel. He invents legends and mythology. His many plot lines and characters come together seamlessly by the end, all the puzzle pieces locking together in an ingenius way. His writing style is beautifully moving without becoming overly flowery or excessive. It's rare to find an author who can come up with just the right words to convey an idea, but Sanderson is one of those authors.Everyone that I have introduced this novel to has been keenly delighted by it and has had difficulty in setting it aside. Orson Scott Card couldn't put it down, and raved about its perfection as a fantasy novel for days, saying this was ONE novelist he was anxious to see make it in the genre. After reading \\"Elantris,\\" it's easy to understand what made him praise this work so highly.Sanderson can capture his readers and keep them hooked, taking them through unexpected paths and turns. It is so refreshing to read an author who is so unique and original. TOR has bought two other novels, and I, for one, am eagerly awaiting their publication."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"My dad has been recommending Brandon Sanderson for ages. He said I should start with the Mistborn series but I was daunted by the length of that series, so I decided on Elantris since it's a standalone novel. And I was so not disappointed. I got so hooked I could hardly put it down to go to sleep. It was epic, and so exciting and tense near the end that I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. I saw that Orson Scott Card highly recommended this book, and he's one of my favorite authors; I think anyone that loves him will love this book too. I'm really looking forward to reading the rest of Sanderson's books. He's clearly a very intelligent, thoughtful and extremely entertaining storyteller. I definitely hope that this book gets a full sequel, but the ending was so satisfying that I'm not sure how to follow it up. Highly, highly recommend."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I was the first person to check out this book from my library when it first came out in 2005. I was 20, so not a teeny- bopper or full- blown adult either. Since that first reading, I have read it many times over, and have even bought it for other people to read. To this day, I will always name this as my absolute favorite book and recommend it to anyone. The writing is fantastic, I feel like I know the characters and can actually see the action in my mind when I read. Every time I read it, I can't put it down until I'm done, even though I already know what happens."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"A bit of caution on my review: I listened to the Graphic Audio narration of the book, which I suspect made the story a heart-wrenching, engaging experience. Some of the soundtracks made it all worthwhile. Regardless of this however, on reflection, I found that there were several deficiencies with the book, which I'll try to outline below shortly.Spoilers below.A couple detractors:The resolution to all of the plots was far too contrived and convenient.a) I'm not a fan of \\"comic book deaths\\", where you can never be sure whether a character is dead until you've seen the dismembered head. I am okay with the main protagonist coming back from the brink of insanity, but you shouldn't kill hundreds of people and have them come back from death.b) I'm also not a fan of the hero figuring out something that should have been intuitively obvious to the scientists who had been looking at the problem from the very beginning. Sanderson explains this away by saying that the servants rose up against their masters the day that the magic of Elantris stopped working, but I found this to be too unrealistic."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Interesting, character driven fantasy. Very political as people and factions struggle for control in a uniquely crafted world, with a dearth of swords and fighting (although not completely without)."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I have to say I was agreeably surprised by Elantris.In this day and age where most authors need three books or more to build a fantasy world, Brandon Sanderson manages to do very convincing work and Elantris is a very good stand alone Fantasy novel.I have read the Mistborn serie by the same author so I was not new to his work, still despite it being a first novel I would rank Elantris among my top 10 standalone fantasy novel. Not as high as Tigana, but still a very good work.The characters are likable and Mr Sanderson takes time to develop them, doing an especially good job with his female heroin. The plot is good but the end feels a little rushed, probably due to length constraints.All in all, I now understand why so many are raving about Brandon Sanderson and I look forward to reading his others books."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I am a fan of this genre as well as others that fall under the \\"Science Fiction\\" umbrella. I judge a book based on how deeply I am absorbed in the story... how deeply rapt I become in the characters, setting, story line, and ease of reading. Elantris for me was an excellent read that I couldn't put down. I was not ready for the adventure to be over when I reached the end of the book. I have read many, many fantasy books by many different authors. Elantris is definitely in the top ten of those, one that I will keep and read again several times in the coming years. That, indeed, is a rare thing for me to do. Easily 5 stars for me."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"picked this up after reading his first two mistborn books. elantris and the mistborn books are as different as black and white and all exceedingly enjoyable. I was easily drawn into the story and its characters through sanderson's refreshing writing style. I'm eagerly waiting his next book(s)."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Brandon Sanderson has written one of the strongest stand alone fantasy books in years.Once upon a time the city of Elantris was the source of wisdom and magic in the world. After a cataclysm occurs the city is left dying and diseased with its once glorious inhabitants reduced to being squalid, poor, and often insane. Prince Raoden has become one of this city's cursed inhabitants, and unless he can find the secret to the decay of Elantris, the world will fall under the sway of the evil Fjordell empire.Everything about this book is well done, especially, for an author's first book. The characters are well developed and readers quickly form emotional ties with them. The book is filled with well written political intrigue and struggle. There aren't a lot of battles within the book, but the one big battle in it is very well done and will cause readers to sit at the edge of their seat. The book does not contain graphic violence or sexual content so it is a great read for fantasy lovers of all ages.Readers are left hoping that someday there will be a sequel to this book not just because many of the story lines are left deliberately unsettled, but also, because the author has crafted a beautiful world. I hope that someday Sanderson will return to Elantris, but whether he does or not, this sample of Sanderson's talent thrills me."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I think people have been reading too much Goodkind and Jordan. Most of the complaints of the genre seem to be posted at them and everyone forgets the hundreds of other authors out there. Also I find it good to remember that some of these novels were written twenty years ago when the clich&eacute; wasn't clich&eacute;. In modern fantasy, there a plenty of good single book fantasies out there (example: Bujold, Clarke, every single Discworld novel) and there is tons of originality out there, especially with the Gen X writers that are coming up at the moment (of which Sanderson is one). Within reason at least. They all use the same archetypes, even \\"Elantris,\\" which is made out to be far more original than it really is.The main protagonists are still the same archetypes we have been seeing for years (the Inspired Prince, the Political Princess, the Warrior Prophet), the secondary characters can be both decently done and also one-note, and a lot of the ideas have come up too. The city of Elantris is one part Atlantis myth, one part \\"Lord of the Flies\\", \\"Lost\\", and \\"No Escape starring Ray Liotta\\", the Seon are will-o-wisps, etc. It has been done before. People need to stop looking for originality for the sake of originality and just point out good novels.Which \\"Elantris\\" very much is. It's a great story that is often compelling and interesting, especially the world inside the cursed city which I found I never got enough of and often would check through the Hrathen and Sarene chapters hoping they would be short so I could get back to the pain of Elantris. The characters can be funny, if a bit too perfect at times, and the prose is passible, though nothing I'd write home about. If anything that's the area I'd like to see Sanderson improve the most on. In many places his prose and dialogue are very rough and he has trouble both switching the conversation without a very abrupt feel and also bringing about a certain depth or weight. Often scenes come across as very light when different wording would have made it sink in more and the characters sometimes talk more like a modern day American.Final Thought: Not the second-coming by any means, but still a great debut. Can't wait for more of his stuff (hopefully a sequel in this world one day?). The Sanderson of ten years from now should be a forced to be reckoned with. Pick \\"Elantris\\" up to see how his journey begins.Added Thought: Note to Terry Goodkind, \\"Elantris\\" has the same theme as all of the \\"Sword of Truth\\" yet while not subtle, is bearable in its themes and incredibly enjoyable. This is how you write a moral tale, not with walls of text and chapter long speeches, but with the occasion character thought, analogy, and metaphor."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I found Elantris to be disappointing, but I did struggle between rating it a two star or three star disappointments. Sanderson had a lot of good ideas that both impressed and delighted me. The nature of magic, the nature of the political entanglements (both between countries and within Arelon ), the basic conception of the trouble and its eventual resolution were all good.What did not impress or delight me was the execution of the story.1) It reminded me too much of an outline. Each scene was an island of some depth and complexity, but there was the scantest of connective flow between each scene. Enough to maintain the direction of the story, but none of the richness one finds with the Bujolds, Gaimans or Brusts of this world. I felt as though everyone in the story was moving in lockstep choreography to the needs of the writer, as opposed to the personal motivations of each respective character.2) The characters were touted as being politically adroit, but I found them to be juvenile and hamfisted. Sarene was supposed to be an experienced diplomat with a command of the subtle, but she was invariably direct and pushy or melodramatically manipulative and pushy.3) Sanderson mistakes chaos for drama. From the point where Hrathen goes into Elantris, which I admit was a brilliant move, Sanderson presents scenes where one pointlessly chaotic thing happens after another. It is supposed to give us a sense of tension and anxiety and make us wonder what will happen next. I just felt ineffectively manipulated.I think that if Sanderson can smooth out his approach, stop rushing around, and flesh out his thoughts then he will become a fine writer. Clearly, as I finished the book, I was interested enough in what was happening to withstand the presentation. But I cannot say that I actually enjoyed the ride."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I seriously dont know what people are thinking when they give this book 5 stars...they must not have read very many books if they rate this one of the best books they ever read. And to compare Sanderson to Tolkien...please! Its good, I enjoyed it, but it wasnt a book I'd read again. There were many flaws in both the characters and the storytelling.First, the two main characters, Raoden and Saerene were the most unbelievable of the book...outlandish luck and the ability to overcome the most tragic of circumstances in the blink of an eye was a little too far fetched for my tastes.My favorite characters were Hrathen and Galladon. I appreciated the inner turmoil of Hrathen and thought it was well written. Galladon on the other hand I enjoyed for his comic relief. His character lacked depth, but by design, not from poor writing.I was annoyed at how easily the Sanderson made up for the constraints that he put on the characters and the plot. Everything had to be concluded in a months time...so Saerene won over the nobles in an hours time, Raoden transformed Elantris in days, Hrathen began converting Kae within days...all because the writer said so...give me reasons, dont give me the same dribble my parents gave me as a youngster...\\"because I said so!\\"Other examples: how did Galladon and Raeoden get down off the roof early on in the book? The had run up a roof to get away from Saor's men and caused the steps to collapse...yet Sanderson didnt tell us how they got down without injuring themselves. And why was it that the old Elantrian didnt go to the pool early on before the Shaod took him entirely? And how did Raoden know what to do when he was about to get thrown into the pool by Galloden that would allow the AonDor to be freed? And how come nobody came to suspect that Raoden had been sent to Elantris instead of killed...it never occurred to anyone...how annoying. And there is no way I would believe that Iadon would allow Saerene to go into Elantris to give food when he had sent his son in less than a month ago...what a huge political risk. The book is riddled with inconsistencies such as these, however, the last section of the book is exciting. Dilaf is a great character and the Dakhor Monks...nice! I would love to learn more about Fjordell in other books and the monasteries that the monks trained and a little more about Wryn. I would give this book 3 1/2 stars if I could. 4 stars would be above average and its not \\"above average\\" Its more \\"fair to good\\""},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I first saw the book Elantris at my library. After reading the back cover, it seemed to be fascinating, so I checked it out and read the entire book. Boy, was I rewarded. Elantris is my new favorite book. I won't say \\"Eragon\\" was not entertaining, because it was, but \\"Elantris\\" was definitely far more creative. Harry Potter and Eragon just copy off of the old fantasy masters, but Brandon Sanderson, author of \\"Elantris\\" actually came up with something entirely new and fresh, but captivating at the same time. From politcs to religion to fantasy magic and violence, Elantris is perfect for every fantasy reader. I give it ten out of five stars and dub it the best book of the decade!!!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"As an author able to complete someone else's vision (the Wheel of Time books), Sanderson does a great job - the transition was completely seamless, and left me extremely hopeful for Sanderson's own authorship. Elantris, however, was poorly done. It lacked romantic tension, it lacked plot tension - I wasn't ever completely sure the world was facing a threat or if some crazy priest just cooked it up, and the heroic prince rather predictably saves the day. Sarene's \\"witty\\" banter was painfully transparent and poorly done, and her \\"manipulation\\" of the king apparently was put to an end by her simple proclamation of \\"let us pretend I am not an idiot\\", leading the king to immediately realize she is not. Raoden is so infallible that he can turn zombified people into cognizant, engaging human beings, and he also happens to be the only one who can learn the AonDor, a product of his 10 years of being in the royal family, no doubt. There were inconsistencies in the Hrathen priest character; you read his very diabolical-sounding thoughts, however in his next silent monologue he seems downright charitable on the same topic, without much turmoil. Two stars because I read it through without putting it down in disgust, but reads like it was written in a week, an overblown short story without any rounds of revision."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"There was an episode of the Simpsons where the family's front lawn was being used as a showdown ground between the Mafia and the Yakuza (I'm going somewhere with this...). Marge calls desperately to Homer to get into the house for his own safety, but Homer is hesitant. Throughout the fight, there's been a small Yakuza thug dressed in white watching the whole fight with detached interest.MARGE: Homie, maybe we should go inside.HOMER: But, Marge, that little guy hasn't done anything yet. Look at him. He's going to do something and you know it's going to be good.[Marge pulls him back into the house and shuts the door. A loud ninja yell is heard, followed by a thump]HOMER: Aw...So. What does this all have to do with one of the best fantasy novels I've read recently? I'm not sure, but Homer's funny, isn't he? But seriously... Elantris, the first novel by Brandon Sanderson, is much like the above scene. An amazing premise to start, a LOT of politics and socializing, followed by an astounding battle sequence to close the show. Sanderson keeps you hooked in and interested through all of the talk of government, trade organizations, religious disputes, and cultural clashes, because you know the payoff is going to be worth it. You're not closing the door on this one. Elantris, simply put, is the city of the Gods. Inhabitants of the surrounding towns are \\"afflicted\\", seemingly at random, by a process called the Shaod. The Shaod leaves them with shining skin, great hair, and the ability to perform magic and miracles. Those affected by the Shaod came together to form the city of Elantris, a peaceful, benevolent society built to serve the greater good of the land. As the tagline says, Elantrians \\"could live in bliss, rule in wisdom, and be worshipped for eternity. Eternity ended ten years ago.\\"The Shaod was replaced by the Reod, an event that would leave all Elantrians weakened, crippled, and deformed. Their skin was dark and blotchy. Their hearts no longer beat. They could not die, nor could they heal. A small cut or a stubbed toe would never lose its initial pain. The accumulation of these injuries over time would drive Elantrians mad. Once the Reod hit, a new aristocracy arose, and the Elantrians were locked into their formerly glorious city, left there to rot and be forgotten.One morning, Raoden, Prince of the city Kae, awakens to find himself \\"dead\\", a victim of the Reod. He is led to Elantris and dumped, to be forgotten. Across the world, his arranged bride Sarene, whom he's never met, was on her way to Kae. Upon learning of Raoden's \\"death\\" Sarene does not shrink. She works against the harsh rule of Iadon and seeks a way to bring happiness and equality to the kingdom. Meanwhile, Raoden struggles to bring hope to the Elantrians, the most hopeless of all. He must first unite three warring gang factions while working to discover a cure for the Reod. The Kingdom of Kae must also contend with the fact that a strong religious country has designs to take over the nation, converting the world to their ways.Most authors would have used their first book to tell part of this tale, but Sanderson has delivered an epic, one-volume masterpiece. The book will inevitably draw comparisons to Tolkien, but it wouldn't be entirely fair to call Sanderson's work derivative. Elantris is highly original, instantly engaging, and one of the top books of the year."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This was Sanderson's first novel and it shows. This book was almost embarrassingly bad compared to the Mistborn Trilogy and the books he wrote in the Wheel of Time. The characters are flat, the political and military situations unrealistic, the story is predictable, and the prose is amateur. If this was the first novel I read of his, I probably wouldn't read another."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"\\"Elantris\\" tells the tale of a city of gods that has, mysteriously, fallen into disrepute. The gods of this city began to die, creating chaos within the bounds of the city walls, and those normally chosen as gods through a system of random selection by powers at be became, instead, afflicted with the diseased look of the present gods. Sanderson poses an interesting question: When gods fall, what do they become?Chaos is rampant along the streets of Elantris, with random factions of former, fallen gods scrounging for morsels of food and handfuls of cloth. Gods cannot die, yet any injury to the flesh lingers in the form of unbearable pain. Thus, confrontation = death in the form of enduring agony for any harmed in Elantris. For those locked within the confines of its gates, doomed to everlasting hell, life is not godlike in the slightest.Meanwhile, outside the boundaries of the city, forces at be conspire to take over the world, and the foreign-born Princess Sarene attempts to prevent that from happening. Betrothed to Prince Raoden, Sarene arrives in his hometown only to discover that the Prince has \\"died\\" of a mysterious illness. Rather, Raoden was afflicted with the disease of the Elantrians and taken to the city in the dark of night.\\"Elantris\\" is the story of Raoden, as he navigates the streets of Elantris, attempting to bring the gods back to their former glory, and Sarene, as she attempts to stave off the powers that be. What is left unsaid, however, is that hope exists for Sarene only if Elantris can be saved and the gods can be restored to their former glory; in this respect, the fates of the two unknowingly are combined.Sanderson strikes gold with his first work. \\"Elantris\\" is highly original, highly entertaining, and it will leave you wanting for more."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Much like his Mistborn trilogy, Sanderson has crafted an amazing world of magic and characters that you can't help but care about. As a stand-alone novel, there is not much wasted space in here - the story moves along pretty quickly and wraps up fairly cleanly (although there are a few dangling issues which could indicate another follow-up novel at some point).If I had to pick another story that is similar, I would point to The Psalms of Isaac series by Ken Scholes. If you read that and liked it, you will enjoy Elantris. If you enjoyed Elantris, go ahead and start in on Scholes series, you wont be dissapointed.I read a ton of sci-fi and fantasy (everything from Feist to Jordan to the classics and the never-to-be-a-classic) and I have got to say that this was indeed one of my favorite fantasy novels ever."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I am no professional book critic by any means, however, I am one who does not like to see repetitive storylines and likes for depth to be in the arc of the story. I loved this because of it's originality, the book is fairly easy to follow along with, and it follows different people at one time."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"if you want a well written, well structured, calculated story with detached characters and a semi predictable relationship/ending then this is your book. i really wanted to like this, to get into it and loose myself, to really care what happened next...but I couldn't. For me it was devoid of all emotion. so if safe, intellectual stories are your thing then get it. it was well written. personally i prefer messy, emotional, unbalanced characters and stories that have characters that are closer to real life."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This was the first Sanderson book that I read. I was immediately hooked in the first chapter of the book by the world building and interesting characters; the mystery of the Elantrians and the political maneuverings of the different parties kept me interested throughout the rest book. Sanderson writes in a clean readable style without watering down his prose, he is truly the rising star of great Fantasy literature. This book is not only for fans of fantasy but for anyone who enjoys great plot, pacing, characters, and adventure. As a final note, if you happen to read this (\\"you\\" being Brandon) I am begging you to continue the story of Elantris after the Wheel is done."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"While most fantasy readers know him as the one who is helping to finish the Wheel of Time, fantasy readers are doing themselves a disservice my not reading this tome. Sanderson puts the protagonist Prince Raoden into a fall from grace on the first page as he is inflicted with the curse of Elantris. As the cover description states, Elantris was once the home of godlike beings that could heal nearly any affliction. But 10 years prior, the curse of the Shaod struck and rendered the Elantrians impotent and nearly dead.Instead of centering the story just through Raoden's eyes, Sanderson does a good job of telling the story of Elantris through Raoden's promised bride Sarene and the priest Hrathen. While it's not apparent at first, the triangular political plot devices of Raoden, Sarene and Hrathen orbits within and without the circular plot of restoring Elantris.I've seen a couple of reviews that indicate that a couple of the protagonists act too perfectly. While that might resonate with Raoden a bit, Sarene and Hrathen are fully developed characters that expose their flaws and strengths throughout the story. The scene that really puts this book-and not discussed in prior reviews thus far-is in Chapter 32, where Sarene reminisces over her first fiance, Graeo. Even though the pertinent passage is only a page, it provides true character depth that is rarely seen in fantasy. Throughout the book, Sanderson's depictions of his characters are rarely godlike, especially in the wake of the fall of the godlike Elantrians 10 years prior.The magic system that is conceived in this book is thoroughly original and detailed, as indicated in the glossary. The restoration of the magic system-and Elantris-is always a central plot in this book, and Sanderson never wavers from that with both the research and attempts by Raoden, Sarene and Galladon to revive that system.While it may be argued that the romance is cut short in favor of finding a cure for Elantris and Aredhel, I still found the romance glimmering through in equal amounts throughout the narrative. I truly loved the scenes where Sarene was banished to Elantris, and got to know Raodel a little better.It is amazing how much ground Sanderson is able to cover in a single novel. This is a fully detailed and rich world with a vibrant magic system. There is a volatile world still going on beyond the boundaries of this novel, which Sanderson will hopefully explore at some point. Sanderson has given the reader characters you care about, both good and bad. There is a precise writing balance that is rarely seen in debut novels, especially for fantasy writers. When you have reached the end of this book, you will definitely want to read more of this world. Absolutely recommended."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Brandon Sanderson, in everything he does, (barring maybe the Wheel of Time books) has his own feel. I mean, when you read these books, you know they're Brandon Sanderson books. I don't really know how to explain it better than that, but there's always a certain quality to them that you don't see in other novels. I, personally, love Brandon Sanderson, and consider him among my favorite authors. I recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasy; the characters are fun, the story is interesting, and you wont ever be too bored with one chapter. It's obviously one of his earlier works, and they do get more polished along the way, but it's still great."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I'm not much into book series, because I find that I lose interest in stories that take several books to finish. But I love good fantasy. I found the stand-alone titles by Brandon Sanderson, Elantris and Warbreaker, and I loved them both (so much, in fact, that I may start reading his Mistborn series). Elantris is very well paced and the characters are captivating. Politics, love, magic, vengeance, friendships, life, death and everything in between. Great surprises at the end too!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Elantris was my first book to read by author, Brandon Sanderson. I was impressed with his ability to craft a store outside the norm. You won't find the usual characters (Elf's and Wizards) found in he majority of Fantasy titles. I look forward to reading more from Sanderson!"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Like many people, I had never heard of Brandon Sanderson before the announcement that he had been selected to complete Robert Jordan's The Wheel of Time series. All I can say is THANK YOU, HARRIET for choosing him and introducing me to my new favorite fantasy author!This was the first book that I read by Brandon, shortly after learning that he would be working on A Memory of Light. Though he had published this book and the Mistborn trilogy by that point in his career, I started with this one because I was very hesitant to commit to reading a trilogy by an unknown-to-me author, especially considering that my first impression of his writing would affect my enjoyment of the ending to the Wheel of Time. I visited Brandon's website, read the epilogue to Elantris, and I was immediately convinced that he was the right person to finish my beloved Wheel of Time series. I probably ran a few red lights on my way to the bookstore to pick up a copy of Elantris!In short, I LOVED this book. It has everything I want in a book, fantasy or another genre: politics, religion, intelligent characters, unique elements (in this case, the magic system), a well-developed world, etc, etc. I was quickly drawn into the story and invested in the three characters (though I hated Hrathgen the first time I read it, his story line was actually my favorite the second time through). The transitions between the three characters' viewpoints were handled well and the overall story played out beautifully. I was incredibly impressed with Brandon's ability to write a UNIQUE story and to handle multiple plots and story lines with skill and maturity. I was immediately convinced that he was the perfect author (short of Robert Jordan himself) to write the final volumes of The Wheel of Time.If you like this book, go out and buy Mistborn IMMEDIATELY! In fact, buy all three books at once, because you will not be able to put them down. As far as The Wheel of Time goes, the first two volumes by Brandon have been superb and I look forward to A Memory of Light. I highly recommend Brandon as an author and look forward to reading his work for years to come."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I actually liked this a lot more then the Mistborn series. In fact I didn't even finish the Mistborn series I was so disgusted with it, and when my boyfriend told me the end I was glad to have not wasted the time.I found the charaters in this book very appealing, although sometimes a bit unreal, thats not always bad.I had thought from the Mistborn series that Sanderson wasn't very good at writing about love, but he did a much better job of it in this book.I think Hrathen was by far the best written charater in the book, he has a lot more compassion and awarness then anyone else.I would most certainly recomend this book, and most espeshally over the Mistborn series."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Not on Mistborn level but still a readable book. I must admit, I started and finished another book while midway through this one because nothing was happening. Would recommend if you like books that cram all of the action in an insane,cluster-!#$@ at the end."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I really enjoyed Sanderson's take on Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time Series and decided to try some of his other books. I like this book, but I felt like the end was rushed and that Sanderson had more to tell. I'm going to read his Mist Born series next to see if it's better. If Sanderson decided to write a sequel I'd check it out."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I had never read Brandon Sanderson before. I am a huge Robert Jordan fan and since Brandon is finishing the Wheel of Time series, I wanted to see what kind of writer he was. Elantris is a great book. He brings life and vitality to the characters and makes you cheer their successes and cry for their pain. I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Where do I begin? I think since I read the Mistborn books before this (his fantasy debut) it gives me a bit of an edge. I can see some of the theories and ideas that he formed in Elantris taking fuller life in the Mistborn books (especially in regards to religious ideals and political upheavel). Though Elantris has nothing to do with Mistborn beyond its the same genre and author, at their core I think they dealt with the same things. How religious fervor can blind followers, how unstable a government is with a weak King (or ruler), how even seemingly evil men can be shielding a far worse menace.There are some troublesome spots, or at least character motivations that weren't fully developed. Dilaf, a Derethi priest, for instance gets an eleventh hour change of status that is plausible (given the overall nature of the Fjordell government), but his blind hatred of Elantris is only given a cursory glancing. The reason is mentioned earlier in the book offhandedly by Raoden, but the connection to Dilaf isn't made until very close to the end of the book. There is also the matter of Adien, one of Sarene's cousins, who gets a brief 'This is why he was like this all this time' and then 'Now he's better'. The question of the Aons is also left dangling--where do they come from, how are they made?Throughout we 'see' events from three different third person viewpoints. Raoden, stuck in Elantris after he is struck down by the mysterious Shaod. Sarene, after she arrives in Arelon to find herself a widow before a bride. And lastly Hrathen, a High Priest of Derethi who is determined to convert the populace of Arelon quickly to avoid the bloodshed that could follow otherwise. This gives us a rounded view of events occuring throughout all of Arelon, but also offers insights when paths intersect (or collide in some cases). Where Sarene sees the game of matching wits with Hrathen as a game necessary to save others, Hrathen sees her as an opponent who challenges him and makes him think. He respects her even as he curses her interference. Where Sarene thinks giving food to the Elantrian citizens is a helpful offering, Raoden bemoans the bad timing of the charity.In the end I enjoyed the book immensely and can fully appreciate everything that Sanderson took from this and expanded upon in the Mistborn books."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I picked up this book after hearing that Brandon Sanderson was to take over Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. I wanted to see what kind of author Brandon Sanderson was. I was well rewarded for my time and I will definitely be checking out his other books. Elantris is an excellent fantasy read with an original world and believable characters. It manages to avoid being too predictable or too simple. I read somewhere that this was Brandon Sanderson's first novel, but you can't tell this by reading the book. I have read books by established fantasy writers that don't reach the high standards of this one. Others have summarised the overall plot of the book so I will just give a brief description of what I particularly enjoyed about this book:All of the characters are well-realised and believable. I liked that the hero spent most of the book bald and ugly suffering under the curse of Elantris. I say this because too many authors fall into the trap of making the main characters beautiful in order to explain the attraction between two characters. Removing the physical attractiveness of the hero gave the relationships between the hero and other characters much more depth.The rotting city of Elantris manages to be horrifying and pitiful at the same time. Those cursed by the Shaod do not heal, but they cannot die unless you burn their bodies or cut off their heads (vaguely reminiscent of vampires). Thus they stumble around the city, acquiring more bumps and bruises over time until the pain becomes too much and they collapse, becoming mindless living corpses who never move again. Elantris is littered with such bodies who do little but mumble.This is a stand alone fantasy novel, which is good for those reluctant to commit to a series. However, if Brandon Sanderson did decide to write more books set in this world I would be keen to read them. There were a few questions unanswered by the end of the book such as: Who built Elantris? How does the Shaod select its victims? What will happen with the Empire in the rest of the world?I really really liked this book. If you're a fan of classic fantasy you probably will too."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"Started collecting Brandon Sanderson books, so I bought this and 2 mistborn. This one is just ok. Good to read once, probably wont read it again. Not a compelling book to ready multiple times like WOT. Just hope the WOT series continues to be readable"},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"My son recommended the Mistborn series so I bought the first book \\"Elantris\\". Wrong Book! I didn't know it was the wrong book. I began to read it and was captured. Like Lackey and Eddings Elantris fits the classical definition of fantasy.Elantris is a well written book. Its setting is engaging and it has a wonderful plot line. The characters are a tad bit stereotypical but still people you can relate to. All in all it is a book of hope, determination, and perseverance."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"I will admit I had never heard of Brandon Sanderson until he was given the reigns to finish the Wheel of Time series. Reading his blog and his website I was left a little skeptical that some relatively unknown fantasy author was the right choice to close out the epic series that Wheel of Time is. Then I read Elantris. And now all I can say is my fears are completely gone and I actually wonder if the ending may not be in better hands now then with Robert Jordan.. I know, that's sacrilegious to say.What Brandon Sanderson did with Elantris is nothing short of amazing. He crafted a world that is quickly understood with multiple races of people and different philosophies. Created some well thought out characters and then guides us through the tale through their eyes. I found myself quickly connecting to the various characters and caring about what they were going through. What was most impressive was how deftly Sanderson could transform your initial opinion of a character at the beginning of the novel and have you feeling 180 degrees different by the end.What I really appreciate is that this is a stand alone novel. There is no long term commitment with this and the story is compelling and wrapped up nicely at the end. But with that said, I am left wanting more of the world that Elantris is based in. There is plenty of room for a sequel here. Sanderson threw tantalizing bread crumbs of further mysteries that were left mostly veiled by shadow that I would love to see further explored in a new novel.If you are a fan of fantasy fiction, you won't go wrong with this book. An interesting magic system, good amounts of action and political intrigue and very well crafted characters make this a winner."},{"Title":"Elantris","review":"This is my second Brandon Sanderson book. I actually started with his most recent book,Warbreaker (Sci Fi Essential Books). That was good enough to get me to look at his other books, so I read this on my most recent vacation. It met my expectations and confirmed that I like his style of fantasy.The setting of a glorious city gone awry created a fascinating background for his tale. The lead characters had intriguing personalities and possessed great leadership skills. The political intrigue was a very key and fun part of the story. I especially liked the princess and her drive and ability to take charge of things.The antagonists were also done well, especially Hrathen. The story had enough twists to keep my interest as I read the book.I recommend this book to anyone that likes or want to explore the fantasy genre. I will be sure to read his other books."},{"Title":"Check It While I Wreck It: Black Womanhood, Hip-Hop Culture, and the Public Sphere","review":"Throughout the history of Hip-Hop, its relationship with women (particularly Black women) and feminism has been strained. Though there have been a few success stories regarding women on the scene and behind the scenes of the Hip-Hop movement, women's place in it have been, for the most part, invisible, degrading, and kept to a minimum. In Gwendolyn's Pough's exciting new book, Check It While I Wreck It, the assistant professor of women's studies at the University of Minnesota examines the dysfunctional relationship between Black women, feminism, and Hip Hop.The book commences with a history of Black women in the public sphere who have contributed to the betterment of African-Americans such as Angela Davis, the historical Black clubwomen, and women who were trailblazers in the blues music industry. Pough reveals how Black women laid the foundation for future successes for the entire race. Pough writes \\"Black women were major players through Reconstruction, the civil rights movement, and the Black Power movement.\\" In fact, because of their exclusion, the author even suggests a re-writing of history.Later the author gives us a more recent history of women's contributions to the arts and Hop, including Sylvia Robinson, the label owner of Sugar Hill Records, break dancer Baby Love, and female rapper Roxanne Shante. The book gives major props to Grammy-winner Queen Latifah, Sista Soulja, MC Lyte, and poet Jessica Care Moore.Pough also critiques the products of popular culture such as movies like Boyz N The Hood and Just Another Girl on the IRT, books such as Sista Soulja's The Coldest Winter Ever and Omar Tyree's Flyy Girl, and of course rap records such as L.L. Cool J's I Need Love, and Latifah's U.N.I.T.Y.The book is best when examining the problems that exist between women and Hip-Hop, from the objectification of women in music videos to the acts of hyper-sexual rappers such as Lil' Kim and Foxy Brown. Pough writes \\"Today, in addition to the old images of the sexually promiscuous Black women...we have the bitches, hos, stunts, hoochies, pigeons, chickenheads, and baby mamas put forth by Black men rappers. The need to struggle against stereotyped images is still present.\\" Let's hope this book will keep the discussion that invokes change alive.\\"Check It While I Wreck\\" is a thoroughly researched, erudite, and culturally relevant work that is virtually impossible to put down. Reminiscent of the writings of bell hooks, this scholarly work in feminist theory and Hip-Hop culture is destined to be an instant classic taught in college lecture halls across the country."},{"Title":"Check It While I Wreck It: Black Womanhood, Hip-Hop Culture, and the Public Sphere","review":"Unfortunately I must disagree with the other reviewers in that Pough's book is a history of women in hip hop. It is actually much more than that. Check It While I Wreck It is mainly a discussion of black women in the public sphere and questions how black women are portrayed not only in hip hop culture but in black culture. The author asks the reader to review some of the things we as women love so much about hip hop and ask how much these things have influenced today's young women. She gives her own reasons of why women have a hard time breaking into the hip hop culture and engages in the age-old question: can black women uplift themselves and embrace their own culture without the emmasculation of black men. With that said, if you are looking for a history of women in hip hop, this may not be your best source. However, if you looking for a study of black womanhood as a culture and its evolution, this would be a great choice."},{"Title":"Check It While I Wreck It: Black Womanhood, Hip-Hop Culture, and the Public Sphere","review":"When hip hop made its debut onto the urban scene in the 1970s, most saw it as a fad that would eventually fade into oblivion. Some thirty years later this culture, essentially born from urban decay, with its eclectic mix of rap music, poetry, dance, dress and attitude, has become universal.In her new book CHECK IT WHILE I WRECK IT, Gwendolyn Pough, assistant Professor of Women's Studies at the University of Minnesota, highlights some of the contributions of noted female rappers to hip hop and explores their impact on the evolution of the genre.Dr. Pough explains the phenomena of \\"bringing wreck\\" a catch phrase often used in hip hop circles, as a form of praise, to describe \\"skill and greatness.\\" The author uses this terminology to ascribe to the ways in which various female rappers; from the lyrically raunchy Foxy Brown and Lil Kim to the socially conscious Queen Latifah and Lauren Hill have brought \\"wreck\\" to the world of hip hop by causing \\"disruptions which somehow shifted the way black people were viewed in the society at large.\\" The author further expounds on the theory that the hip hop culture has the power to \\"affect change and bring wreck in a meaningful way\\" and exhorts female rappers to recognize the tremendous possibilities of hip hop and use it as a force for good.CHECK IT WHILE I WRECK IT is a thought-provoking, enlightening read which affords all readers a window into the world of an often misunderstood, yet extremely popular culture. At the core of this book is the author's call for female rappers to continue to \\"bring wreck\\" to the hip hop world, as they strive to carve their own niche in this essentially male dominated culture.Reviewed by Autumnof The RAWSISTAZ Reviewers"},{"Title":"Check It While I Wreck It: Black Womanhood, Hip-Hop Culture, and the Public Sphere","review":"\\"Wave ya hands in the air and shake\`em like you just don't care.\\" These are words often used to hype the crowd for hip-hop concerts around the country. I found myself singing the same tune as I read this remarkable tribute to African American culture, hip-hop and feminism. Pough does an exceptional job of researching the roots of black women in the hip-hop phenomena, which has swept the world and become embedded in its very foundation. The hip-hop culture is broken down and explained through the lens of black women detailing how it has changed and how women are viewed. She traces the rhetoric of women in all hip-hop genres: urban literature, rap & soul music, development of the spoken word, and black film. The essence of the title, Pough explains is how black women bring \\"wreck\\" which is a form of praise to describe the \\"skill and greatness\\" of the lyrics.Do you know the great women of hip-hop? You should take the time to sit down with this account of rap legends - Roxanne Shante, Queen Latifah, MC Lyte, Yo Yo, Salt-N-Pepa and many more. You will learn about Sylvia Robinson, the owner of Sugar Hill Records, break-dancer Baby Love, and poet lyricist Jessica Care Moore and Sista Soulja. Pough uses the work and dedication of these women to help readers understand how women are portrayed in hip-hop. She reaches back to Sojourner Truth preaching black power and equal rights use then leaps forward to Queen Latifah performing socially conscious rap and Salt-N-Pepa exuding sexuality in their breakout lyrics. From the stereotypical roles of \\"mammy\\" to the present day images of \\"chickenhead\\", black women have used rap music to outline their life, reconfigure their identities, and breakdown the historical stereotypes and negative images that male rappers have constructed.Pough has provided the world with a well-researched, provocative account of hip-hop culture and the women who have added to its success. Readers can relive the development of hip-hop and sing the songs, remember the films, dances and slang made popular starting from the early 1970's to the present. This is a must-have book for every hip-hop lover, feminist, or African American studies student/department. The issues discussed in this book will provide hours of discussion for anyone who reads it. Pough has brought \\"wreck\\" to the area of academia.Reviewed by M.

You can't tell me that hip hop has not arrived and that the black woman didn't help it arrive I mean woman are playing important roles in hip hop movies I know you all saw Brown Sugar where Taye Diggs and Sanaa Lathan are representatives of hip hop she is a part of it just as much as he is but no man will ever tell you hip hop is represent like it is black and white / man and female but Gwendolyn Pough has no problem telling you the truth behind the culture we know as Hip Hop.After reading the book I sat back for a moment and really thought of what Ms. Pough said and her book now for me it was easy to accept as a young black woman working in the hip hop industry as a radio personality I see it all the time some black female artist trying to go up against whatever fella that's on the corner rapping its nothing to see a sister battling it out to maintain her place in the game they will get raunchy with their words and say something that you wouldn't expect but they will do what it takes to stand with the fellas because they know what its like to be in the male world of hip hop. So I stand give Ms Pough a applause for her dedication and hard work to make today's world understand that woman have a place in every culture even hip hop."},{"Title":"Posers, Fakers, and Wannabes: Unmasking the Real You (TH1NK)","review":"If you have even a passing interest in Christianity, but struggle to know what to do with the often conflicting behaviors exhibited by many who claim to all be following the same basic belief system, then this book is an excellent look at what it could and should be. How is it that the message of the Gospel is often acted out on a stage for the benefit of our own ego?Brennan Manning has an uncanny ability to sift through the surface, and dive straight into the places we often do not want to acknowledge exist within all of us. In this book he tackles the \\"image conscious\\" Christian, more concerned with how they look, than what they are doing. In it he exposes just how far off the message of love and peace we have often gone. With all of our masks, pettiness, vanity and ego we consume ourselves with, where is our focus on our true cause; to love God and love our neighbor as ourselves?Of particular interest is how he manages to be blunt and direct in many very personal ways, yet all in his usual self effacing style which leaves one motivated not judged. When reading Manning, one is left with the overwhelming sense that they are simply in a conversation with someone who is speaking on their level. While I know a few too distracted with dogma and doctrine to understand his perspective, he writes about the very real struggle to let go of ego and image, and focus on what is really important. His looks into the problems of racism, homophobia, and neglect of the poor among Christians are especially powerful considering they contrast so much with loving and reaching out to others as Jesus did.Although the editing and copy itself is at times a bit distracting with its multi-type fonts on every page, it does allow you to take bite sized bits of information and ponder the meaning behind it. Rarely have I stopped so many times while reading to reflect on my own issues. An excellent read and good insights!"},{"Title":"Posers, Fakers, and Wannabes: Unmasking the Real You (TH1NK)","review":"This wonderful book reinforces the notion (absurd to many) that \\"God loves us exactly the way we are - but that he loves us too much to let us stay like this.\\" A true shot in the arm for anyone seeking the truth about God and self, and wondering what's next in life.Despite the disarming title, Manning has not written a \\"self-help\\" book, he's written about divine help, found through surrender and brokenness before God. Every page drips with trenchant observations, amusing anecdotes, quotes from notable thinkers and philosophers (Carl Jung among them) and quotes from the Bible (using the wonderfully direct and earthy translation from \\"The Message\\").\\"Posers, Fakes & Wannabes\\" is so full of wisdom, humor, and \\"Big Ideas\\", I found myself savoring the opportunity to spend time with this book, reading, and rereading many passages, thinking about my own life and about God.And, no, this book is not \\"heady stuff\\" for academics. Written in plain spoken prose, this book is appropriate for anyone, from teenagers to geezers.A must-have for \\"the seekers\\" among us."},{"Title":"Posers, Fakers, and Wannabes: Unmasking the Real You (TH1NK)","review":"\\"Abba's Child\\" is, in my opinion, the quintessential Brennan Manning. Though I have thoroughly enjoyed all that he has written. I have read and reread the book many times over as there is too much to process at first pass.\\"Posers, Fakers, and Wannabes\\" is a student adaptation of \\"Abba's Child.\\" While, in general, I am not a fan of audience adapted works, I had heard good things and purchased a copy to give away to a younger friend of mine. Of course I wanted to peruse it before giving it away and found myself reading it through, enthralled by the original content with new language. I found it to be equally as powerful-- not the least watered or dumbed down.If you have read any other Manning, or if you are an avid reader and contemplative thinker, go ahead and buy \\"Abba's Child.\\" But, regardless of who you are, \\"Posers, Fakers, and Wannabes\\" is a well done adaptation of a great book. I don't believe you will be disappointed."},{"Title":"Posers, Fakers, and Wannabes: Unmasking the Real You (TH1NK)","review":"From the reality of a Poser, faker, and wannabe I was unmasked.

Basically, being a poser is a person who habitually pretends to be something he is not. Well, OK, but so what? The so what is that this destroys any real genuineness, usefulness, peace and compassion. Sure, these things can be faked to some extent, for a while, but if they are not true, then the soul is crushed and becomes bitter. Definitely not a life of freedom. The book was marketed as primarily for teens, but I was just as challenged and engaged as an adult reader.In other hands this book could have come across as preachy and self-serving, but not here. I will usually mark quotations and passages that I think are particularly relevant in books I read, but this would have been one continuous highlight if I had done that. It really is that insightful and that good. It is full of Scripture references, quotes from famous (as well as unknown) people, and relevant popular culture references. I came away not only with insight into how The Poser distorts and discourages real growth, but with the motivation and tools to identify and change areas that could easily remain suppressed.I received a copy of this book for review purposes from NavPress. No other compensation was received."},{"Title":"Posers, Fakers, and Wannabes: Unmasking the Real You (TH1NK)","review":"the Living Room Couch (blogspot)Book Reviews You Want to ReadStory behind the story:NavPress provided me with a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. I am under no compulsion to provide a favorable review. But I wonder, is it bad that I brought my free book and free coffee into Panera to claim my free pastry and free internet? Panera gets a positive review!!Story Line:This recasting of \\"Abba's Child\\" for an emerging generation of readers focuses primarily on the first label in the title - \\"The Poser.\\" The idea is to realize who we are in Christ and how to live honestly with our struggles. Brennan Manning, author of The Ragamuffin Gospel, speaks from personal experience about the danger of acting like we have it all together in front of others. Some of his first declarations are opening up about the reality of sin in his life. He no longer is going to hide behind the \\"Christian smile\\" and the \\"everything is good with God\\" mindset. He shows us the better (and freeing) alternative of honesty to the world, myself, and God. He reveals that our identity is Christ is a much greater realization in my life than self-deception.The Real Story:I heard a pastor say recently that if you want to grow in your Christian walk, camp out on what God's love for me really looks like. This refreshing look at the love of God and brutal honesty about myself really gave me some great things to dwell on.I do have a word of caution. This book's target audience is the teen generation. This message is essential for any teen generation, but there are some more mature themes and even at least one instance of mild language. We also have some theological disagreements. If a teen is encouraged to read this book, it would be important for a parent to travel this road with them and read the book (maybe even in advance).If I were to title this book, I would leave out the \\"Fakers and Wannabes\\" as I believe this may be the only time these words are used within the pages. Keep it simple... \\"Posers: unmasking the real you\\"However, with all that said, these authors have gained my respect as fellow believers. They have struggled, but are willing to openly share their struggles. My favorite passage is in the closing pages - the story of the dog's dilemma. Excellent.Check out:\\"My Identity in Christ\\" Bible Study; The Preacher's \\"Ecclesiastes\\" - \\"Soap Bubbles, Soap Bubbles...all is Soap Bubbles.\\"Rating:3 smiling masquerade masks out of 5."},{"Title":"Posers, Fakers, and Wannabes: Unmasking the Real You (TH1NK)","review":"After reading this I really have to get a copy of Abba's Child by Brennan Manning! I was interested in reviewing this book since I work with the youth at our church. I loved the very casual writing style of Brennan Manning. I appreciate how very open and candid both authors are about their flaws and short-comings and that they are very comfortable in God's love. They nailed it on the head when discussing our feelings of uncomfort when we are confronted with God's unconditional love.The aim of this book is to bring into light what Christ spoke so plainly over 2000 years ago and what God has whispered across time and eternity: You are loved just the way you are!! God sees the individual as what he/she will become. It is vitally important to accept ourselves as we are in the light of God's love and the knowledge that we are a work in progress.I can't wait to recommend this to others, especially teens. I wish someone had written this when I was a young person. So that I could have lived in the richness of God's blessings for a longer time. It has not been until recent years that I have become more at peace with my identity in Christ and like Manning, I too have to daily put to death \\"The Poser\\".This is a powerful book. Parents read it for yourself then read it with your teens!

He also decides to spend a week watching MTV and consuming everything youth culture so that he can pick up a few buzzwords here and there to go with his flashy new ensemble.\\"NOW, they will listen to my stories\\", thinks grandpa.But here's the problem: If Grandpa's stories are still lame a few buzzwords and a new look isn't going to change anything after about 5 minutes. They'll notice but they won't remember any of grandpa's stories. Grandpa can't be rescued by buzzwords.What is worse, though, is if grandpa actually does have really cool stories. What will happen is that rather than hearing grandpa's cool story all the kids will walk away with is the scarring-image of grandpa's four spiky hairs. The story gets lost by the distracting medium. Grandpa doesn't need to use buzzwords.In Posers=Fakers=Wannabes Jim Hancock has attempted to give Brennan Manning's best-selling book Abba's Child a makeover youth edition. This book falls under the second scenario. I don't agree with everything Manning teaches but he is an apt and thought-provoking author. Brennan Manning is the grandpa that has good stories and doesn't need buzzwords.The problem that I have with this book is that the message is lost because of the medium. How strange that this book is fundamentally about \\"being set free to be who you really are\\" and yet it's packaged as if Manning isn't able to be who he truly is. If he wants to engage the youth culture then he had better be a poser, a faker, or a wannabe; he had better spike his hair and use a few buzzwords. And that is a shame because the youth of today need to hear Manning's message.Now don't get me wrong, there is plenty of Manning here to be recognizable. I may even be overstating my case a tad. Hancock does not abuse Manning's writing and make him indiscernible. The problem though is that today's teenagers see through the buzzwords and are often turned off by them. They long for \\"just grandpa\\" and not \\"grandpa trying to be a teenager\\".The content of Abba's Child is really good and the central message is very helpful: stop faking it, be real, trust in Jesus. Every page oozes with that theme. Again, I'm not saying that this youth version is horrible. It can be very beneficial. The problem is that the philosophy that undergirds the change is dangerous. Rather than rewriting Abba's Child to make it appeal to teens, why not encourage mom's and dad's to go through the original with their children?If the point to grandpa's story is something akin to, \\"son, be who God made you to be\\" but he tells it using buzzwords that are foreign to him doesn't it undercut his message? I'm all for adaptability and writing and speaking in a way that youth can relate to. But teens (all people) have a tendency to go to the level we set for them. Abba's Child doesn't need to be made cool...it just might need a little stretching and guidance to go along with it.Buy Abba's Child: The Cry of the Heart for Intimate Belonging. Or if you think I need to buy some square-rimmed glasses and spike up my hair (in other words you disagree and want the hip-version) you can buy it here: Posers, Fakers, and Wannabes: Unmasking the Real YouI received this book free from NAVPress in exchange for a review."},{"Title":"Posers, Fakers, and Wannabes: Unmasking the Real You (TH1NK)","review":"Posers, Fakers & Wannabes: Unmasking the Real You by Brennan Manning and Jim Hancock is a Christian youth book for inspirational Christian living.Perhaps I was missing an essential part of the background or premise of this book, but I just didn't \\"get\\" it.This book was extraordinarily disorganized. It had poor flow not only through a whole chapter, but even in a single paragraph. There were simple grammatical errors and a great deal of slang and improper English were used.

They are perfect for my needs. I dip into them whenever I want more information about a particular feature.Although the books say they can be used by someone who is new to Web site design, I think you need a little background before using these books. (I mean, what do the descriptions of XML or JavaScript mean if you don't already know what they are?)The best features of these books are:1) Tour of the Dreamweaver user interface. This is handy whether you are moving to a new version of Dreamweaver or have never used it before. You get a good introduction to all the basic features.2) In-depth discussions of Dreamweaver features. Not only do you get the information on how to use Dreamweaver features, but also very complete discussions of why and when to use them. This is the kind of knowledgeable information you just don't get in a user manual from the manufacturer.3) Tips and guidelines. Very useful hints on overcoming common problems. For example, a sidebar on overcoming line spacing difficulties gives four different workarounds for adjusting line spacing.By the way, the author, Joe Lowery, has a reputation for being a great Dreamweaver resource, willing to help with technical problems and a very nice guy.

So when this book promised to cover backstrap looms I bought it.It covers backstrap looms in that it gives you the most basic string between two sticks version. The loom it covers uses a manufactured heddle that requires you to either thread it while on the warping board, or cut your warp and tie it to the sticks. I wanted info on string heddles and one type is shown but not explained. It's the individually tied loop heddle, not the continuous string heddle I was searching for.

This is perfect, because it forces you to think about the Chinese word and meaning without spoon-feeding you the translation.The drawings were originally done in 1993, and are a little dated (especially regarding technology), but this sort of adds to their charm.

How Sarny learns about reading, writing and the man who was brave enough to teach it to her. There are two main characters in the book. Sarny a young female slave, and Nightjohn, a slave who had gained his freedom and returned to teach others.The setting of this book takes place on a large plantation in the South. It takes place during the time when slavery was at its peak and the plantation owners made all the laws. Sarny first saw Nightjohn when he was brought onto the plantation naked and showing signs that he had been badly treated. She first spoke to him when he asked to trade for some tobacco and questioned what he could possibly trade. Learning reading and writing was his answer.It was very dangerous for slaves to learn to read and write during this period. Sarny was caught writing a word and suffered the consequences of seeing her mammy beaten. Then Nightjohn had two toes chopped off when he came forward for teaching Sarny. Nightjohn left but promised to come back after a while. Sarny didn't believe he would, but he did. Then he took her to an underground area where he had other young people from surrounding plantations and where he was teaching.I thought this book was very interesting. It showed me how badly the slaves were treated but also how much courage Nightjohn had to come back and teach others. I would recommend this book because it wasn't that long, but told you a lot. Also for people who like slavery."},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"The book Night John was a book you truly never wanted to put down.The beginning was pretty slow because they really stretched everything outmore than it really had to be, but the ending wrapped it up perfectly.This book is about a slave named Sarny. Who was a slave at theWhite House and her master was old Waller, a very cruel man. But one daya slave named John came there. He said he wanted to teach Sarny to readand write. But old Waller was against slaves reading or writing. Sarnyand John both knew it, but John kept teaching. When Sarny learnedher first word, she wrote it everywhere in the dirt then rubbed it out.But right when Sarny was about to rub it out old Waller came and saw.Sarny just stared at him.I would suggest this book to strong 4th grade readers all 5thgrade readers and slower 6th grade readers because of how big thefont is and how short the book is. This book should only lasta week or so."},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"Do you like slavery books? If you do, you got to check this out. This may be the best slavery book ever. This book is called Nightjohn by: Gary Paulsen. This book has lots of excitement in it and very interested in. You would like this book as much as I did. I mean when I saw the cover, I didn't really thought that it looks so cool, but you know how they say don't judge stuffs by its cover. This book has sadness, full of meanness in this book. If you read this book, you'll know how it felt or was back then.In this book there were two main characters. Nightjohn, and Sarny. Nightjohn is an African American guy, who tries to teach slaves how to read and write. Sarny is an African American girl who is brave and tough enough to learn how to read and write. There's one more guy. He's the meanest man on earth. He's dangerous, mean, and disgusting. This guys name is Waller. The meanest, and most dangerous man in the world. All these things happened in the southern United States. Waller didn't allow anybody to know how to read and write. If he catches you learning that he'll torture you until you almost die. Back then nobody would teach the slaves how to read and write. Sarny wants to learn, but mammy doesn't let her, because of Waller.People should read this book, because you should know how sad or mad they were. They were tortured and force to do work. You should read it so you'll know how to treat other people. Being a slave is like being bullied and getting tortured with whips or with other weapons. Having slaves is not cool, it's racism. I mean who would do that stuff to other people that who is different from you and different religion from you. If you care you should check this out. Remember Nightjohn by: Gary Paulsen.

You can't read or write, but if Waller, the slaves' owner, saw you reading or writing, he would cut off your toes or fingers. Or he even might have killed you! Nightjohn, written by Gary Paulsen, was a good book.Nightjohn was the main character of the book. John was a slave that could read. He tries to teach Sarny how to read. Waller didn't want the slaves to read because he doesn't want them to get together and make an escape plan.I think someone should read Nightjohn because the book tells you about slavery. The book tells you how the slaves work, sleep, and how they can't do much stuff. This story would be good for someone who likes stories about the past"},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"Would you like to get your toes cut off just for teaching someone how to read? Would you like to get whipped everyday if you don't do your work? Night john by Gary Paulsen is a great book. I chose this book because it told me about what slaves did a long time ago.The characters were Sarny, Night john, Momma, Jim, and Waller, the mean guy. The setting was at Waller's farm were they work all day, eat out of troughs, and they sleep in rooms called quarters. There was a school Night john made. It was in a pit so they called it pit school. The problem was Sarny wanted to learn how to read and write but if she got caught she would get whipped. Night john is the one that is teaching her.The reason why people should read this book is because they would know what happened to people when they were slaves.

Although the book would make an excellent springboard for a high school discussion about the abuses of slavery, I would recommend that you read it yourself before giving it to grade school or even junior high age readers.

The main idea in this book is that it's back in the time when there used to be slaves. A man named Nightjohn was trying to teach people to read but he wasn't allowed because slaves weren't allowed to read.I htink people should read this book because it talks about discrimination. maybe if people read this book they wouldn't be so racist against other cultures. I think it's sad how people used to treat others just because of their race. I'm also glad that we don't still have slaves because that would be really bad.Another reason i think people should read this book because it could be based on true events. This book talks about slaves and how they were treated so it could be based on a lot of things. This might make it more interesting for the reader to read. Like things that happened to the slaves when they tried to run away or what happens when they get caught reading.The last reason I think people should read this book because it's very interesting.

The slaves are hard workers. There's a man named Night John Who Comes at night and teaches the slaves English and the alphabet, so they can read. He especially teaches Sarny. They are not taught by their owner so Night John teaches them. But if he gets caught he's in big trouble.This book is a three star rating. It's good because Nightjohn a tries to teach slaves, but usually gets chased away by dogs. He teaches Sarny the alphabet if Sarny gives him tobacco. He also teaches him reading and words of the English language. But the reason it's only three stars is because slave book all seem the same.When the slaves bathe they use grease. It' because Waller doesn't give the slaves water. But looks healthy and better. But grease doesn't really cover up the smell. It blends their color of skin so you can not really see the chunks of grease.The reason why the dogs attack black people is they hurt the pups when their young so when the dogs are older they attack black people. That's why when the owner says attack the attack the slaves they will. The dogs are still mad at the slaves so they want to kill them.The end of NightJohn goes where he comes back. To teach Sarny more English the slaves can count on him to come back.

In Sarny's case, a young slave in the book Nightjohn by Gary Paulsen, she had always wanted to be able to read and write. Since she was a slave, Sarny could never learn how to read or write. She could never learn until John, a slave that her master had bought. John then began teaching her how to read and write. Quickly she learned a letter every night, when everyone was asleep. After a couple of days she learned more about John's past. She learned reading and writing until he ran North promising Sarny that we would return.I have really enjoyed reading this short and memorable story.

I chose this book becuase it was a short book on my summer reading list (somewhere around 90 pages)but i ended up loving it. Nightjohn is a story of an African-American slave girl named Sarny. She and many other people are forced to work all day and if they do anything wrong, they risk being beaten, whipped, or even killed. One of the things they are told not to do is read, but Nightjohn, another slave who had escaped to the north and was taught to read, does not follow this rule. When he comes to the plantation, and offers his ability to read in exchange for some tobacco is when the protagonist, Sarny, makes a decision that influences the entire story. She gives him the tobacco and learns her first letter, A. Each night she is taught a new letter and learns how to make them into words. Another event that greatly impacted the story is when Sarny begins to carelessly write the words she learned in the sand and other places. The master, Clel Waller, sees this and begins to interrogate the person who takes care of Sarny, named mammy. She says she does not know anything about it but is still being abused so Nightjohn confesses. As a punishment, he has both of his big toes chopped off. In addition, I think that when Sarny chose to continue learning letters in \\"school\\" with some other kids that Nightjohn had picked up, was a big decision because each time she learns to read or goes to the school she I risking her life."},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"I think this book is very good.

I just finished &quot;NightJohn&quot;. I thought this book was very well written. I understood it very well. But I do recommened something before you read this book. I am an 8th grader, and I have just finished studying in my History class about the Civil War , and slavery, and I recommened that you should learn alittle about the Civil War, and slavery before you read this book. Because you wouldn\`t understand it if you didn\`t know about. I liked this book alot. The semi- part life time tale of Sarny. Sarny is a young black slave who is born into a plantation in the South. She tells the story in a very &quot;horrific&quot; way I think. She tells of her &quot;master&quot; and how badly they are treaten. I gave this book 5 stars for its well written contents. I almost was going to give it 4 stars because of the continual cursing. But by all means, this is a great book , and I would buy it again."},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"I had to read Nightjohn for school and it was a truly fabulous book.

Sarny makes a deal with John that she will give him tobacco if he will teach her to read and write. This he does. She learns letters and them spells a word.

I disagree with the reviews above when they say that the violence is redundant and excessive. Truth is, life was really like that on the plantation. The reader is almost transported back in time. This book is a good contrast to many history books that tend to downplay the intense cruelty inflicted on southern slaves. My recommendation? Take this book with you to Williamsburg, VA and ask the tour guides questions about it as they tell you how &quot;well treated&quot; the slaves were."},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"I read this at the recommendation of a young adult librarian to see if it might be appropriate for my 11-year-old daughter who is a reluctant reader. I very much enjoyed the book, but I'm glad that I read it first. Even though I am sure that even struggling readers of this age group can handle the language, the topics covered are difficult even for adults. The world depicted here is one of savage cruelty that attempts to strip away the humanity of its victims. The fact that people survived -- and even resisted effectively -- is amazing.Nightjohn is an African-American slave just before the Civil War who escapes to freedom. He returns South to teach other slaves how to read and write. Many of the slaves, including Nightjohn and his young student Sarney, seem to know that literacy is the doorway to a forbidden world.I would highly recommend this book for adults (yes, the reading level is easy but the story is one you will remember) and for mature kids. This may be the perfect book for emotionally mature children who struggle to find a book that they can read easily but that does not talk down to them. This powerful book about literacy may be just the hook you need for a reluctant reader. However, I highly recommend that parents read this first to judge if their child is ready for the topics that are covered here."},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"The setting for this wonderful book is a plantation in the Old South. The story is told by a young girl who quietly survives under terrible conditions. Her world is described to us in simple words like you might expect a youngster to use. She talks about the coming of Nightjohn, a man who escaped slavery, who made it to the North, only to return to the South with a mission.I thought Paulsen did a fantastic job of bringing this girl's \\"voice\\" alive. It was succinctly clear how horrible the institution of slavery was. How ignorance was perpetuated. And how human nature cannot be stymied even by these most wretched of conditions.I highly recommend this to adults, young adults, and middle-school-aged kids. I do add the caveat though that it might not be appropriate though for very sensitive youngsters. There's some gritty events here.AR: 3.8a mini-review(Pam T for booksforkids-reviews)"},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"I think you nshould read Night John by Gary Paulsen because this book is about slavery. Personally, I like the part with the quarters because the slaves make a lamp from pork fat and a bowl that was pretty cool. Also in the book, the slaves have a lot of rules like they can not have any lights on, no praying, reading, and no writing. As well, there are punishments too. If you read or write you will get your thumb or toes cut off or smashed off. If you pray and have a light on you will probably get yelled at or whipped.You should read Night John because it is about slaves. For instance, the things we did to them. Like we cut off body parts, killed them, whipped them, and chased them. I think that is not right and not nice.Also, I did not know some of the things they did like chasing them with dogs and cutting off body parts if they read or if they wrote. Also, there is something I know, like they whipped them. When you read this book you can learn more about slaves and what they did to them.Did you know it was against the law for slaves to read because if the slaves read then they will want to run their lives and try to escape. In other words, I am glad they can read now and run their lives because they only have one.This book is very interesting. It is a good book so yo should read it. Also, you should read it because there is lot of parts that are about slaves. There are funny parts and sad parts. Also, gross parts (if you like that). That is why you should read Night John!"},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"What would you do if you never knew how to read or write? In Sarny's case, a young slave in the book Nightjohn by Gary Paulsen, she had always wanted to be able to read and write. Since she was a slave, Sarny could never learn how to read or write. She could never learn until John, a slave that her master had bought. John then began teaching her how to read and write. Quickly she learned a letter every night, when everyone was asleep. After a couple of days she learned more about John's past. She learned reading and writing until he ran North promising Sarny that we would return.I have really enjoyed reading this short and memorable story. It has really changed the way I think about slavery. It is so cruel what the master will do to some of Sarny's friends. Read this book to find out if John returns. You will not regret reading this awesome historical-fiction!"},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"Nightjohn is a very exiting book. This book is about a 14-year-old slave named Sarny who meets a slave who ran away to the north, but came back to teach slaves how to read. Sarny is very excited about learning to read. I would recommend this book to boys or girls 8-11 years old. I liked this book because it kept you on the edge of your seat."},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"I believe that the book NIGHTJOHN was a great book about slavery. It had the points that the owners thought and what the slaves thought. Plus it also expressed what would happen if you were caught doing something that you shouldn't have."},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"I liked this book because it was interesting.It was about a slave named Nightjohn. It was interesting to me because I did not really know what happened in the 1800's. Some of the things that happened were: He got beaten because he could read;they were hanged if the girls would talk to boys thay got beaten if thay prayed."},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"This book should hook you as a Gary Paulsen fan. His research for the book is enough to break your heart as you hear about the desire of slaves to read. It also demonstrates that freedom can be accomplished by being able to read. Don't miss the follow up, Sarny. It made my 6th graders, even the boys, get teary eyed!"},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"This is my fourth year to teach the book, Nightjohn, in my sixth-grade classroom. Nightjohn is set in the 1800's on a plantation. Sarny, a slave girl the age of most of my sixth graders, is the narrator. As the book unfolds, we get to experience the life of a slave during this period of time in America's history. It has thirteen curse words in it, and I had to black them out before letting my students have a copy. I did that job during the summer so my students could have the privilege of reading this one-of-a-kind book. Only by looking at the past can we possibily hope to make the present better. Nightjohn will evoke laughter, sadness, and despair as you read. As I teach children everyday how to read, it breaks my heart to realize that slave children were deprived of this great gift. I recommend this book highly. It has an extraordinary message that everyone needs to remember!"},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"Nightjohn is a good book and helps you understand the suffering of the African slaves. What happens is John, a slave, learns how to read and write so... THUNK!!!! off with his toes."},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"Out of all of the books I've read in my twelve years (well over fivehundred books) this is definitely in my top ten, if not five. It is extremely accurately written, you can tell that there must have been tons of research done. I laughed, I pondered, but most of all I felt sad and sometimes cried. Believe me, you've got to read this one!"},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"this book was very interesting, It wasnt so captivating at first, but when the main charecters were introduced the story became very exciting. This story told about slavery on a plantation;it is told about slavery from a young slave child named sarny who was being taught to read from a man named Night john, I recommand this book to enyone whois interested in the past and how slavery life was for the blacks. If book like these werent writen, nowone would know about this life and maybe slavery still would be in affect to this day. The neat thing is the story is true and was told from a real child, Allso reading this you learn their launguadg, Well enjoy."},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"Set in the slave-owning 1850's, this grimly concise novel narrates the impact of the arrival of John, a new slave on a modest plantation. He had actually escaped to the North to Freedom, but he chose to return surreptitiously in order to teach other slaves how to benefit from the white man's secret weapon: How to Read! This skill was for whites only and jealouslsy guarded--absolutely forbidden among the slaves, and viciously punished. His first pupil is 12-year-old Sarny, who trades him tobacco leaves in return for her first three letters: ABC.Narrated in the first person by plucky Sarny, this short book presents the gruesome reality of the shocking conditions suffered by Black people in the 19th century. The author has spared no ghastly detail to recreate our national shame. What is so appalling is the fact that the setting is NOT fiction."},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"Night John Gary PaulsenBantam Doubleday DellHave you ever read a story about a person being abused and not being very well taken care of, well you should read the book Night John, because this book is interesting in the way that other people have gotten hurt and how things use to happen when people had done something wrong and did not obey what they were being told to do. If you like books that are interesting and that are about slavery, Not in the way that you agree about slavery, just the fact that it is something that may grab your attention. These books are kind of mind sweeping your mind away, and they just make you want to read more and more until you finish the book.In this book you will discover the life of the african american people and you will find that life now is not nearly as bad as it was when there were slaves in the world. In my own opinion I think that we are much better off than the slaves were, and that the slaves are not because they had to listen to their master, and if they didn't, then toe was chopped of of each foot, or they had to be whipped with a leather whip on the back until the skin was hanging off.If you are interested in this book, than that is great, because the book will grow on you and you will feel grateful for what you have an will be happy that you are not in what they have in their life. You should read this book, because it is a book that will make you want to be somebody that can help these people that are doing absolutely nothing and they do not deserve what they are getting for a treatment. It will be a jaw dropping book, that will catch your attention in the second that you even look at the book even the title will give you a good idea of what the book may be about."},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"NightJohn was one of the few books that stuck in my mind. This book taught me to appriciate that I live in the time where we moslty always get along. This book is about a 10 year old African American slave that lives on the Waller plantation. people think she is dumb because she is quiet, but that is how she learn she listens and learn things. then one day while working on the roses in the garden by the \\"white house\\" where Sarny over heard that Mr. Waller bought a new slave. the wife said that he cost one thousand dollars. later that day there came Mr. Waller with a man nadked as the day he was born came to the main yard. then he just runns him in to the faild to start working. later that night he sits alone in a corner of the quaters. he asks for a lip of tobacco. since Sarny was working in the flower bed she had to chew and spit tobacco on the roses to keep the bugs away. she still had some left over and wonders what he could have to offer for he had nothing. then he says that he would trade it for letters. Sarny wondered what these \\"letters\\" he was talking about. will she trade or not?"},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"I really enjoyed the story line of this book. I think the story was well researched. I didn't realize when I purchased the book that it would be so short. I was very sorry to see it end. I know that there is a sequel which I would love to read but I hate to pay again for such a short read."},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"Searing in its simplicity, this book reminds us of just what whites did to blacks in this country and why these horrors are behind the racial struggles and inequities that haunt us still. The book is well done, and painful to read, but is a great intro or revisiting of this atrocious reality."},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"The book got here in a timely fashion, was better than the \\"very good\\" status it had online, and had no errors or difficulties in the process. Thanks! Recommended!"},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"and I like that about him. I think this is perfectly acceptable reading for tweens and teen audiences. He tells it like it was for his characters, and I think my tweens and teens understood that, appreciated it, and respected the book and story because of it."},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"I cannot say too many good things about this production. I was tired when I ordered it, so was surprised when it came and I discovered that there were no sub-titles! Anyhow, I was impressed with the quality of the production, the \\"telling-it-like-it-was\\", the acting which was VERY fine, the story which rings true, etc. etc., and it made me ashamed all over again of the treatment imposed upon black slaves in the south in the 1800's. I truly hope that the guilty white plantation and slave \\"owners\\" sincerely repented of their oppression of the blacks before they died!The story centers around \\"Nightjohn\\", a black adult slave who somehow managed to learn to read & write elsewhere (some of the dialogue explained this I'm sure, but without subtitles I missed it), and he takes it upon himself to teach this secretly to a little 12-year old slave girl, which is punishable by death if he's caught. But he risks it. Beau Bridges plays the part of the evil slave-owner, and does a great acting job, for you really hate him!!This is an excellent movie, and should be seen by everyone who wants to know how things were in the 19th century in the USA. A valuable lesson can be gleaned from this movie, that we are all human beings and as such are all children of our Heavenly Father, regardless of our race or color, and therefore are all of us brothers and sisters. A concept strange and apparently hard to accept by some, but nevertheless true. Too bad that it took LAWS to eliminate slavery, instead of love for each other.If this DVD offered subtitles, I'd give it TEN stars!! (at least) But again let me say that it is in no way an ameteurish production! Top-notch all the way!"},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"This book was an excellent read. It gave a real insight into what the slaves went through in the 18th and 19th centuries and the hardships they endured; however, many did everything they could to get away from these horrible situations. It was a sad story but well worth reading."},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"Review of Nightjohn, march 28,2007Review by Jiang,WeiKaiIf you are finding any information or want to know more about slavery, this is the book that you need to read.Nightjohn, a slave with a little knowledge of read and write.And he never keep the knowledge just to him.He started to teach young slaves how to read and write,anyway things were not always going right.His master,Waller,found out everything,and pusished him by whiping him and cut his toe off.This book had a great historial fiation event,and also easy to read and have alot of information of slavery,so i give this book five out of five star."},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"Nightjohn by Gary PaulsenNightjohn is a book about a slave named Nightjohn. Nightjohn is very smart. He can read and write. He is sold to a new owner. There is a slave on the farm who wants to learn to read and write.This book is about Nightjohn's new life. He teaches a slave named Sarney how to read and write. This was dangerous because if he were caught, the slave owner would cut off either his toes or both his thumbs. After a while, Sarney got so excided about the fact that she could read and write that she wrote the words she knew in the dirt. The slave owner found Nightjohn teaching the slave how to read.Nightjohn got both toes chopped off with an ax. After that, Nightjohn took Sarney to a club he had started. There, Nightjohn continued to teach slaves how to read and write.I liked this book because of how Nightjohn teaches Sarney how to read and write.

Sarny was still into it and so Night John had a wonderful solution...He organises a secret school where he invites the children slaves in to learn about reading and writing. If you were a child slave, you wouldn't have to go if you were scared but you'd have a choice. From then on, Sarny and Night John saw eachother everynight and Sarny never ever got cought again writing in the dirt!By Kimita."},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"NIGHTJOHN\\"Nightjohn\\" was an extraordinary book about slaves and one slave,Sarny, who did what no one could do. After her mother was sold, she stayed with her mammy, but it was not her mother. She was the mother of the plantation children.The plantation was owned by Waller. Waller would not allow the slaves to read or write. Gary Paulson shows great details about life as a slave. Waller brought Nightjohn to the plantation. He was in chains and had scars on his back like someone had taken a cheese grater and ran down its back with it. Nightjohn wanted to teach Sarny to read and write and he did. It's a remarkable story about Sarny and her long road to read and write. Not only watching mammy and fellow slaves get whipped and punished, Sarny never gave up. She showed spirit and determination to overcome her goals.If I was a slave I would follow my dream like Sarny.If you like history about slaves then I recommend this book.GRADES 4th-12th should read this book."},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"This book is about Sarny, telling the story of John. He is the new slave brought to the plantation. He knows how to read and write and Sarny wants to learn. Every night for some tobacco, John teaches Sarny a letter of the alphabet so she can learn to read and spell words. This book tells it like it is (or WAS) it takes you through the story as if you were there learning with Sarny and witnessing all the events happening on the plantation. This was a great book and I highly recommend reading it, it is actually educational and still interesting."},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"\\"Night John\\" was the best book I have ever read. Gary Paulsen books have lots of action. I want to read more of his books. The book was about a girl named Sarny who wanted to learn words from a guy named Night John. It was based on what happened in the 1800's. There were a lot of slaves and Sarny and Night John were some of them. I liked \\"Night John\\" because Sarny didn't give up on learning to read. Sarny and Night John ran into a lot of problems trying to learn to read. If you really want to read a good book, read \\"NIGHT JOHN\\". It was so exciting and you will never want to put it down."},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"This book is great for students that are into learning about slavery, and things that would happen to them if they did something wrong. I would only recomond this book to anyone older than 12."},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"This short, poignant novel gives readers a graphic, often painful view into the day-to-day lives of slaves. John and Sarny's friendship drives the plot forward, and readers will be taken by both characters' drive to better their lives through reading and learning."},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"I would recommend the book NightJohn to anybody who likes to read Gary Paulsen. NightJohn has a few characters in it but there are three main characters. Mammy. Sarny, and John. The book takes place in the south on a slave plantation. It talks about how life was back then. The one thing that stood out to me was that they have certain slaves that is all they do is have baby's. And the one in this book they call Mammy, she is a quiet women who is very attached to her kids. One of them that sticks out is Sarny. Sarny is a girl that is very egger to learn and sad that she does not have any education. That is when John comes in to the story. John is a man that the master just bought and added to his collection of slaves. John and Sarny start to be good friends. John is different than all of the other slaves John is educated. John can read and spell. Sarny makes a deal with John that if he teaches her to read then she will give him tobacco. John thinks that is a far trade. The cost for getting a education if you were a slave was not taken very serious.... They might have had to pay but Sarny could read and write. NightJohn is a good book to read if you want to get a taste on how life for a slave was."},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"Even if your NOT a Gary Paulsen fan, I guaruntee you'll love this book! I couldn't put it down while reading. Just the way he writes will fantasize you. Since this is a review, I'm basically going to tell you what it says on the back. Nightjohn, a slave, escaped previously to the North, learning how to read and write. He encounters many pupils in the slave plantations when he returns. This book discribes one of Nightjohn's pupils, Sarny, and goes into stunning detail. If you've already read this book, see the movie: Nightjohn: with Beau Bridges as the master and Carl Lumbly as Nightjohn."},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"Have you ever wondered what it must have been like to have been a slave on a Southern Plantation? If so, you must read the historical fiction book, Nightjohn, by Gary Paulsen.

Nightjohn comes to live on the plantation that Sarny lives on and teaches her to read and write. He feels all slaves need to be literate so they could understand what was happening around them and to keep account of their own lives. The struggles and hardships he goes through to share his gift of reading and writing is unbelievable.

This book takes place in the 1800's during slavery times. It is about a 12 year old slave girl named Sarney. She was separated from her mother when she was four years old and she was raised by a woman named Old Delie. Sarney's job was to chew tobacco spit on the rose bushes,to get rid of aphids.Sarney wanted to learn how to read and write. Then Clell Waller buys a new slave named Nightjohn.

At this plantation he meets up with another enslaved young girl named Sarny.NightJohn makes a deal with her and his trade is that he will teach her to readand write. Waller catches Sarny writing words in the sand and the reat of the book is filled with sadness and hard times for Sarny and NightJohn.This book was great. I liked it for the detailsin the writing and for the suprise ending. The reason i liked the wrkiting is because of the detailed description the author gave of the plantation. I think that this book had such an effect on me that I will never forget NightJohn's courage.This book reminds me of the time thatI went to Florida because on the way back we tour of a Georgia plantation.I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to read about history because this book is about a part of our history that most of us would like to forget."},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"If you are not a big fan of reading like me and you have to have the perfect book then you will love Nightjohn. It is a mshort read but Gary Paulsen keeps you in the story like you are witnessing everything that is going on. The book takes place in the early 1800's. It is about a thirteen year old slave girl named Sarny who in the beging of the book starts talking about when she was young she was sepperated from her mother. She also describes what it was like to be sold at an auction. Later on in the book she is a little older and she describes what her duties are as a slave working in and around the plantation house &quot;the big house.&quot; One day, a new slave comes to work on the plantation. The man comes out of the wagon butt naked and has absolutly nothing. Later that night Sarny traded a tobacco leaf with this new slave named Nightjohn. But little does Sarny know that Nightjohn has an amazing gift that hardly any slaves have which is the abilitly to read. You have to read the book to find out all the positive things about reading and all the things that get her in a lot of trouble. This book is one of Gary Paulsens' more sensative books. i recomend this book to anyone, even if you hate to read i promis that you will love it. That is why i gave this book five stores because you read the first book and it pulls you right in."},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"A short yet hard hitting story about slavery. Written in eubonics, it tells the story of a slave girl's relationship with the title character, a fellow slave, in her words.

Best read with a parent or other adult to help explain terminology and answer questions. Don't be discouraged. It is a great read and an excellent snapshot of history."},{"Title":"Nightjohn","review":"NightJohn is a book that should be read by all 6th through 12th graders at some point.

I want to share it with other Nightjohn readers and Gary Paulsen fans:&quot;a note about Nightjohn:The research for this short book took over five years and it was heartbreaking. At many times, reading through the slave narratives I would find myself crying quietly, weeping for them, for the very real people I have tried to portray in the story. They wanted only one thing--to be free--and they knew reading, learning to read, was the best way to freedom. It still is...
