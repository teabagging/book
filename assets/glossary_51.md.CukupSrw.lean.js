In January 1998, in the dead of an Alaskan winter, a cataclysmic Arctic storm with hurricane-force winds and towering seas forced five fishermen to abandon their vessel in the Gulf of Alaska and left them adrift in thirty-eight-degree water with no lifeboat. Their would-be rescuers were 150 miles away at the Coast Guard station, with the nearby airport shut down by an avalanche. The Last Run is the epic tale of the wreck of the oldest registered fishing schooner in Alaska, a hellish Arctic tempest, and the three teams of aviators in helicopters who withstood 140-mph gusts and hovered alongside waves that were ten stories high. But what makes this more than a true-life page-turner is its portrait of untamed Alaska and the unflappable spirit of people who forge a different kind of life on America's last frontier, the \\"end of the roaders\\" who are drawn to, or flee to, Alaska to seek a final destiny.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=g0cmpxMXbhoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"mountain laurel","description":"\\"A fascinating story, rich in emotion.\\" --Diana Gabaldon, New York Times bestselling author of the Outlander series North Carolina, 1793 Ian Cameron, a Boston cabinetmaker turned frontier trapper, has come to Mountain Laurel hoping to remake himself yet again--into his planter uncle's heir. No matter how uneasily the role of slave owner rests upon his shoulders. Then he meets Seona--beautiful, artistic, and enslaved to his kin. Seona has a secret: she's been drawing for years, ever since that day she picked up a broken slate to sketch a portrait. When Ian catches her at it, he offers her opportunity to let her talent flourish, still secretly, in his cabinetmaking shop. Taking a frightening leap of faith, Seona puts her trust in Ian. A trust that leads to a deeper, more complicated bond. As fascination with Seona turns to love, Ian can no longer be the man others have wished him to be. Though his own heart might prove just as untrustworthy a guide, he cannot simply walk away from those his kin enslaves. With more lives than his and Seona's in the balance, the path Ian chooses now will set the course for generations of Camerons to come. A story of choice and consequence, of bondage and freedom, of faith and family.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tizwDwAAQBAJ&dq=mountain+laurel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beacon Lights of History 8 Volumes","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=f-WBAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ADC Montgomery County, Maryland: Includes Olney, Potomac, Kensington, Laytonsville, Silver Spring, Germantown, Chevy Chase","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WCQxWQbGfA0C&dq=ADC+Montgomery+County,+Maryland:+Includes+Olney,+Potomac,+Kensington,+Laytonsville,+Silver+Spring,+Germantown,+Chevy+Chase&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In Situ Soil Remediation (Soil & Environment)","description":"In situ remediation techniques have experienced a boom over the last few years, thereby producing a wide range of valuable experiences.

When a leading orthodox Jew makes such a declaration, its significance can hardly be overstated. Pinchas Lapide is a rabbi and theologian who has specialized in the study of the New Testament. In this book he convincingly shows that an irreducible minimum of experience underlies the New Testament account of the resurrection, however much of the details of the narrative may be open to objection. He maintains that life after death is part of the Jewish faith experience, and that it is Jesus' messiahship, not his resurrection, which marks the division between Christianity and Judaism. Dr. Lapide quotes Moses Maimonides, the greatest Jewish thinker, in his support: All these matters which refer to Jesus of Nazareth...only served to make the way free for the King Messiah and to prepare the whole world for the worship of God with a united heart.

When it exploded onto the literary scene in 1945, Black Boy was both praised and condemned. Orville Prescott of the New York Times wrote that  if enough such books are written, if enough millions of people read them maybe, someday, in the fullness of time, there will be a greater understanding and a more true democracy.  Yet from 1975 to 1978, Black Boy was banned in schools throughout the United States for  obscenity  and  instigating hatred between the races.  Wright s once controversial, now celebrated autobiography measures the raw brutality of the Jim Crow South against the sheer desperate will it took to survive as a Black boy. Enduring poverty, hunger, fear, abuse, and hatred while growing up in the woods of Mississippi, Wright lied, stole, and raged at those around him whites indifferent, pitying, or cruel and Blacks resentful of anyone trying to rise above their circumstances. Desperate for a different way of life, he headed north, eventually arriving in Chicago, where he forged a new path and began his career as a writer. At the end of Black Boy, Wright sits poised with pencil in hand, determined to  hurl words into this darkness and wait for an echo.  Seventy-five years later, his words continue to reverberate.  To read Black Boy is to stare into the heart of darkness,  John Edgar Wideman writes in his foreword.  Not the dark heart Conrad searched for in Congo jungles but the beating heart I bear.  One of the great American memoirs, Wright s account is a poignant record of struggle and endurance a seminal literary work that illuminates our own time.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1oTEDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Salons: The Joy of Conversation (Utne Reader Books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=utIFPwAACAAJ&dq=Salons:+The+Joy+of+Conversation+(Utne+Reader+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Young and the Evil","description":"Praised unflinchingly by Djuna Barnes and Gertrude Stein, this stunning work, first published in 1933 by the Obelisk Press, Paris, is a non-judgemental depiction of gay life and men who earn their living there, told through characters like Julian (modeled on Ford) and Karel (based on Tyler).","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=O4qqPQAACAAJ&dq=The+Young+and+the+Evil&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Basics of Life (Artists Devotional)","description":"4HIM'a award-winning music and powerful lyrics have propelled them to the top of the Christian music charts.

It was about the whole clan gathering at dinnertime over meals to be remembered forever. Luann Landon's cookbook/memoir transports us to that world of formal midday dinners, closely guarded recipes, and competitive cooks. Dinner at Miss Lady's takes us back there through the memories, meals, and recipes of one Southern family. Landon recreates the old Southern way of life in comic and tender anecdotes--from the near disaster of losing the tiny dinner bell to revenge exacted by giving the wrong recipe for a cake. This is the world of Landon's extended family: the glamorous and indolent Aunt Clare; the industrious, proud grandmother Murlo; the other grandmother, spoiled, indulgent Miss Lady and her good-humored husband, Judge; and most important, Henretta, the protective cook, able to mend family battles with a perfect blackberry-rhubarb cobbler. Adding to the vividness of this memoir are menus from those memorable meals, including birthday dinners, homecoming feasts, graduation celebrations, and sumptuous spring and fall parties. Landon shares detailed recipes for over sixty heirloom dishes: Cousin Catherine's Chicken Vermouth with Walnuts and Green Grapes, Beets in Orange and Ginger Sauce, Tennessee Jam Cake, Caramel Ice Cream. A rich portrait of a life almost lost to us, Dinner at Miss Lady's is a memoir cooked to perfection, one to savor both for its stories and for its food.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Z3J4EAAAQBAJ&dq=Dinner+at+Miss+Lady%27s:+Memories+and+Recipes+from+a+Southern+Childhood&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ADAM Student Atlas of Anatomy","description":"Renowned for its innovative approach to understanding the human body, this second edition features full-color art throughout, using a three-dimensional approach to anatomic structure.

Social Justice and Political Change, involves the collaboration of thirty social scientists in twelve countries, and represents broad-ranging comparative research. The book grows out of a collaborative study of public opinion about social justice. Though conceived prior to the revolutions that swept Central and Eastern Europe in 1989, the ISJP did not put its survey into the field until the summer of 1991, in a new climate of open international exchange in social research. Employing common methods of data collection and, within the limits of translation, identical survey instruments, the ISJP investigated public opinion in seven newly emerging post-Communist countries and five of the worldi?1/2s most influential capitalist democracies, with special sensitivity to divergencies in the newly united Germany. Among the themes addressed by the volumei?1/2s distinguished contributors are the views and beliefs of citizens in the post-Communist states on the transition to market economies and parliamentary democracy; the role of ideology in legitimating inequality; the structural determination of beliefs about justice; the processes that shape individual level evaluations; and the major implications of public opinion and mass participation in the democratic process.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=fyFWDwAAQBAJ&dq=Social+Justice+and+Political+Change:+Public+Opinion+in+Capitalist+and+Post-Communist+States+(Social+Institutions+and+Social+Change)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Key of Knowledge","description":"With the promise of a million dollars each dangled before them, the women couldnt refuse.

Foreign companies, mainly from Europe and Japan, have built factories and acquired U.S. firms at an ever-increasing rate. Jonathan Crystal finds inconsistencies in how American businesses have responded to this globalization of production. U.S. firms, especially multinationals, have conflicting interests regarding investment protection, Crystal shows. Many American firms, under siege from overseas competitors, have already expended considerable energy in obtaining trade protection, but they are competing not only with foreign imports but also with locally established foreign-owned firms. American businesses may favor stricter regulation of foreign companies that threaten their bottom line, but they also consider their own interests as global investors subject to retaliatory protection in other countries. Restrictions on \\"foreign\\" investment, it seems, are not so attractive when they are imposed by other countries. Unwanted Company examines the different ways in which important U.S. industries (including semiconductors, automobiles, steel, consumer electronics, telecommunications, and airlines) reacted to this new challenge. It focuses on the political responses of U.S.-owned firms to how Washington ought to regulate foreign direct investment and how it ought to treat foreign-owned firms in the United States. Some industries welcomed (or at least didn't oppose) foreign investment, whereas others sought restrictive and discriminatory policies. Crystal demonstrates how the nature of the domestic political environment shapes the translation of economic interests into policy preferences.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DaJhDwAAQBAJ&dq=Unwanted+Company&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christ and the Church: In Orthodox Teaching and Tradition","description":"\\"In this dogmatic essay, Archbishop Gregory Afonsky expounds upon thirty years of research and teaching in the field of ecclesiology to demonstrate the divine origin of the Church and its importance in the life of the believer.

The Odds follows the lives of these three professional gamblers through a college basketball season in a one-of-a-kind city struggling to reconcile its lawless past with its family-friendly makeover. With a wiseguy attitude and a faultless eye and ear for the sights and sounds of Vegas and its denizens, Chad Millman has created a portrait that the Wall Street Journal called \\"fascinating. . . often screamingly funny.\\" The Las Vegas Review-Journal had just one word for the book: \\"Superb.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eWva977rHhoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pan Michael,: An historical novel,","description":"The third and final book of Henryk Sienkiewicz s Trilogy takes a closer and more intimate look at one of the series  protagonists: Pan Michael Volodyovski. The Polish Commonwealth has been through intense periods of war, and the peace that follows leaves one of its greatest heroes, Pan Michael, finally free to marry his beloved Panna Anusia. But in a twist of fate, she falls ill and dies, leaving Michael despairing of life to the point of him joining a monastery. His friends, shocked at the loss of the great knight which has now left the Commonwealth unprotected, hatch a plan to bring him back to his true calling. As with many of the characters in the Trilogy, Michael is fictional but based heavily on historical record: his character s exploits and circumstances owe a lot to the real Polish knight Jerzy Wo?odyjowski, who was also in Jan Sobieski s cavalry. Pan Michael was, like the other books in the Trilogy, initially serialized in Sienkiewicz s newspaper S?owo, before being collected into a novel five years later in 1893. The book, and the Trilogy as a whole, was very well received, and allowed Sienkiewicz to resign his editorial post to focus on his novels. The novel was the first of the Trilogy to be filmed (as 1969 s Colonel Wolodyjowski), and it was also later converted into a successful television series in Poland. This edition is based on the 1893 translation by Jeremiah Curtin. This book is part of the Standard Ebooks project, which produces free public domain ebooks.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=37F3EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Illustrated Encyclopedia of Combat Aircraft of World War II","description":"Contains more than seven hundred illustrations of military aircraft of World War II used by both Allied and Axis Countries, together with capsule specifications and history","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eq6KAgAACAAJ&dq=Illustrated+Encyclopedia+of+Combat+Aircraft+of+World+War+II&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Companion Prayers: A Guide to Prayer From the Companions of St. Anthony","description":"A detailed research of a Catholic Radio homily by Father Karopi.

While much advice handed out these days focuses on teen behavior and on what to do once drugs have become a problem in the home, Raising Drug-Free Kids takes an innovative approach and focuses instead on preventative measures that can be followed early on in a child's life. Developmental psychologist and parent educator Aletha Solter provides parents with simple, easy-to use tools to build a solid foundation for children to say \\"no\\" to drugs. Organized by age group, from preschool through young adulthood, the handy 100 tips will show parents how to help their children to: Feel good about themselves without an artificial high. Cope with stress so they won't turn to drugs to relax. Respect their bodies so they will reject harmful substances. Have close family connections so they won't feel desperate to belong to a group. Take healthy risks (like outdoor adventures) so they won't need to take dangerous ones.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=O7tWEP63XJ4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Building and Detailing Scale Model Muscle Cars","description":"Gift local 1-11-2003 $15.95.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ao2nzB5Qs5QC&dq=Building+and+Detailing+Scale+Model+Muscle+Cars&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Maisie knew (Doubleday anchor books)","description":"Richard Hathaway presents the full text of the 1897 novel \\"What Maisie Knew,\\" by American writer Henry James (1843-1916).

Many argue that this speech is so detestable that it should be banned under law. But is this an area covered by the First Amendment right to free speech? Or should it be banned? In this elegantly written book, Laura Beth Nielsen pursues the answers by probing the legal consciousness of ordinary citizens. Using a combination of field observations and in-depth, semistructured interviews, she surveys one hundred men and women, some of whom are routine targets of offensive speech, about how such speech affects their lives. Drawing on these interviews as well as an interdisciplinary body of scholarship, Nielsen argues that racist and sexist speech creates, reproduces, and reinforces existing systems of hierarchy in public places. The law works to normalize and justify offensive public interactions, she concludes, offering, in essence, a \\"license to harass.\\" Nielsen relates the results of her interviews to statistical surveys that measure the impact of offensive speech on the public. Rather than arguing whether law is the appropriate remedy for offensive speech, she allows that the benefits to democracy, to community, and to society of allowing such speech may very well outweigh the burdens imposed. Nonetheless, these burdens, and the stories of the people who bear them, should not remain invisible and outside the debate.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-954ZWnhhr0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Official Patient's Sourcebook on Mnire's Disease: A Revised and Updated Directory for the Internet Age","description":"Arranged alphabetically, each volume provides in-depth coverage of pediatric diseases and disorders, along with issues related to physical and cognitive/behavioral development.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=om1YAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Official+Patient%27s+Sourcebook+on+Mnire%27s+Disease:+A+Revised+and+Updated+Directory+for+the+Internet+Age&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SECRETS OF A PREGNANT PRINCESS (SENSATION S.)","description":"A secret night of bliss   a scandalous nine-month consequence!

In response to this heightened activity Barry D. Adam has updated his 1987 study of the movement to offer a critical reflection on strategies and objectives that have been developed for the protection and welfare of those who love others of their own sex. This revised volume addresses the movement's recovery of momentum in the wake of New Right campaigns and its gains in human rights and domestic partners' legislation in several countries; the impact of AIDS on movement issues and strategies and the renewal of militant tactics through AIDS activism and Queer Nation; internal debates that continually shift the meanings composing homosexual, gay, lesbian, and queer identities and cultures; the proliferation of new movement groups in Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia, and Africa; and new developments in historical scholarship that are enriching our understanding of same-sex bonding in the past. Adam delineates the formation of gay and lesbian movements as truly a world phenomenon, exploring their histories in the United States, Great Britain, Germany, France, Canada, Scandinavia, Australia, and countries for which very little information about the activities of gay men and lesbians has been made available. In this global picture of the mobilization of homosexuals Adam identifies the critical factors that have given personal and historical subjectivity to desire, that have shaped the faces and territories of homosexual people, and that have generated homophobia and heterosexism. Treating the sociological aspects of the rise of the gay and lesbian movement, Adam also looks at \\"new social movements\\" theory in relation to the gay and lesbian movement and cultural nationalism - whether in the form of cultural feminism or queer nationalism - which he considers an important, perhaps inevitable, moment in the empowerment of inferiorized people.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=6A6HAAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Rise+of+a+Gay+and+Lesbian+Movement,+Revised+Edition+(Social+Movements+Past+and+Present+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jack Van Impe Prophecy Bible (Special Limited Edition /Words of Christ in Red)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=oDUNAgAACAAJ&dq=Jack+Van+Impe+Prophecy+Bible+(Special+Limited+Edition+/Words+of+Christ+in+Red)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Quintiles and Tredeciles: The Geometry of the Goddess","description":"In Quintiles and Tredeciles, the author explores the little-known 72-degree and 108-degree aspects and explains their cosmic significance in the individual chart.

Historical details on the meanings of numbers - taken from numerology; sacred geometry; masonic, religious, and Egyptian symbology; and astrology - transport the reader to times when numbers did not simply designate quantities but were an \\"extreme reduction of philosophic thought\\" and \\"concrete definitions of energetic formative principles of nature.\\" This fascinating work is necessary reading for novice and experienced astrologers and provides a wonderful and tempting introduction to those with a budding interest in astrology and numerology.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=7U35NwAACAAJ&dq=Quintiles+and+Tredeciles:+The+Geometry+of+the+Goddess&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Riemann Legacy: Riemannian Ideas in Mathematics and Physics (Mathematics and Its Applications (closed))","description":"very small domain (environment) affects through analytic continuation the whole of Riemann surface, or analytic manifold . Riemann was a master at applying this principle and also the first who noticed and emphasized that a meromorphic function is determined by its 'singularities'. Therefore he is rightly regarded as the father of the huge 'theory of singularities' which is developing so quickly and whose importance (also for physics) can hardly be overe~timated. Amazing and mysterious for our cognition is the role of Euclidean space. Even today many philosophers believe (following Kant) that 'real space' is Euclidean and other spaces being 'abstract constructs of mathematicians, should not be called spaces'. The thesis is no longer tenable - the whole of physics testifies to that. Nevertheless, there is a grain of truth in the 3 'prejudice': E (three-dimensional Euclidean space) is special in a particular way pleasantly familiar to us - in it we (also we mathematicians!) feel particularly 'confident' and move with a sense of greater 'safety' than in non-Euclidean spaces. For this reason perhaps, Riemann space M stands out among the multitude of 'interesting geometries'. For it is: 1. Locally Euclidean, i. e. , M is a differentiable manifold whose tangent spaces TxM are equipped with Euclidean metric Uxi 2. Every submanifold M of Euclidean space E is equipped with Riemann natural metric (inherited from the metric of E) and it is well known how often such submanifolds are used in mechanics (e. g. , the spherical pendulum).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LqTqCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Critical Essays on Tennessee Willaims: Tennessee Williams (Critical Essays on American Literature)","description":"A comprehensive collection of essays about Tennessee Williams, containing both early reviews and a broad selection of modern scholarship, including six original essays commissioned for this volume.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3h4gAQAAIAAJ&dq=Critical+Essays+on+Tennessee+Willaims:+Tennessee+Williams+(Critical+Essays+on+American+Literature)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jesus Mean and Wild: The Unexpected Love of an Untamable God","description":"Many Christians are used to the idea of a meek and mild Jesus, the stereotypical \\"nice guy.\\" Countering these all too prevalent notions, Mark Galli offers a unique study of seventeen troubling passages from the Gospel of Mark to prove we should be anything but comfortable with Christ.

However, the dependence of GDP levels on its history of shocks, what economists refer to as  hysteresis,  argues for unifying the analysis of growth and cycles. In this paper, we review the recent empirical and theoretical literature that motivate this paradigm shift. The renewed interest in hysteresis has been sparked by the persistence of the Global Financial Crisis and fears of a slow recovery from the Covid-19 crisis. The findings of the recent literature have far-reaching conceptual and policy implications. In recessions, monetary and fiscal policies need to be more active to avoid the permanent scars of a downturn. And in good times, running a high-pressure economy could have permanent positive effects.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=K7AaEAAAQBAJ&dq=Further+evidence+on+business+cycle+duration+dependence+(Working+papers+%3B+working+paper)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pneumatic Conveying of Solids: A theoretical and practical approach (Particle Technology Series)","description":"Pneumatic conveying is one of the most popular methods of handling bulk powdered and granular materials in mining, chemical and agricultural industries.

In each case evolution has a \\"direction,\\" a tendency to produce more highly organized patterns. The \\"spirit of evolution\\" lies in its directionality: order out of chaos. After arriving at the emergence of mind, Wilber traces the evolution of human consciousness through its major stages of development, pointing out that at each stage there is the \\"dialectic of progress\\" every increase in consciousness is bought at a price: new freedom also means new license to choose destruction. He particularly focuses on the rise of modernity and post-modernity what they mean, how they relate to gender issues, to psychotherapy, to ecological concerns, and to various liberation movements. Most important, he asks: Can spiritual concerns be integrated with massive developments of the modern world?

A band of California cops set loose in no-man's-land to come home heroes. Or come home dead. Not since Joseph Wambaugh's bestselling The Onion Field has there been a true police story as fascinating, as totally gripping as Lines and Shadows. The media hailed them as heroes. Others denounced them as lawless renegades. A squad of tough cops called the Border Crime Task Force. A commando team sent to patrol the snake-infested no-man's-land south of San Diego. Not to apprehend the thousands of illegal aliens slipping into the U.S., but to stop the ruthless bandits who preyed on them nightly--relentlessly robbing, raping, and murdering defenseless men, women, and children. The task force plan was simple. They would disguise themselves as illegal aliens. They would confront the murderous shadows of the night. Yet each time they walked into the violent blackness along the border, they came closer to another boundary line--a fragile line within each man. And crossing it meant destroying their sanity and their lives. Praise for Lines and Shadows \\"With each book, it seems, Mr. Wambaugh's skill as a writer increases. . . .

Furthermore, synchronization circuits comprehend such a large part of the receiver hardware that their implementation has a substantial impact on the overall costs. For these reasons design engineers are particularly concerned with the development of new and more efficient synchronization structures. Unfortunately, the advent of digital VLSI technology has radically affected modem design rules, to a point that most analog techniques employed so far have become totally obsolete. Although digital synchronization methods are well established by now in the literature, they only appear in the form of technical papers, often concentrating on specific performance or implementation issues. As a consequence they are hardly useful to give a unified view of an otherwise seemingly heterogeneous field. It is widely recognized that a fundamental understanding of digital synchronization can only be reached by providing the designer with a solid theoretical framework, or else he will not know where to adjust his methods when he attempts to apply them to new situations. The task of the present book is just to develop such a framework.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=w0gGCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Yankee Science in the Making","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=YYxcc0n-yOAC&dq=Yankee+Science+in+the+Making&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Endosseous Implants: Scientific and Clinical Aspects","description":"This book renders a scientific analysis of all the criteria for successful placement of intraoral endosseous implants.

The legacy of its long dynastic rule, extending back more than 3,000 years, includes fascinating contributions to philosophy, religion, art, science, and mythology that continue to influence the modern world. China explores the ideas and achievements of this unique culture through a combination of authoritative, accessible scholarship and magnificent imagery. Drawing on the most recent discoveries and theories, the book presents China's history, society, and beliefs from the legends of prehistory to the end of imperial power in 1912. It investigates the key cultural, spiritual, and artistic traditions of this vast civilization and describes the country's major scientific and technological innovations, such as gunpowder, printing, and the compass. An investigation of trading routes, both by land and sea, challenges the conventional view of China as an isolated, insular civilization, stressing instead the impact of its sophisticated society upon the world. A final section discusses the continuing legacy of the imperial period through the turbulent years of the twentieth century up to the present day.

Then, in July 1971, Henry Kissinger arrived secretly in Beijing on a mission which quickly led to the reopening of relations between China and the West and changed the course of post-war history. For the past forty years, Kissinger has maintained close relations with successive generations of Chinese leaders, and has probably been more intimately connected with China at the highest level than any other western figure. This book distils his unique experience and long study of the 'Middle Kingdom', examining China's history from the classical era to the present day, and explaining why it has taken the extraordinary course that it has. The book concentrates on the decades since 1949, presenting brilliantly drawn portraits of Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping and other Chinese leaders, and reproducing verbatim Kissinger's conversations with each of them. But Kissinger's eye rarely leaves the long continuum of Chinese history: he describes the essence of China's approach to diplomacy, strategy and negotiation, and the remarkable ways in which Communist-era statesmen have drawn on methods honed over millennia. At the end of the book, Kissinger reflects on these attitudes for our own era of economic interdependence and an uncertain future. On China is written with great authority, complete accessibility and with many wider reflections on statecraft and diplomacy distilled from years of experience. At a moment when the rest of the world is thinking about China more than ever before, this timely book offers insights that no other can.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GldTEJnmbeAC&dq=On+China&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arthurian Myth and Legend: An A-Z of People and Places","description":"The wealth of mythology and legend that surrounds the story of King Arthur and his Knights of the Round Table ensures that it remains one of the most popular and intriguing areas of literature to study, not least because it has a foundation in history.

Eighteen-year-old Mary returns from the sophisticated French court to claim her throne in cold, backward Scotland. A gloomy reception proves least among the na?ve young monarch's challenges: her arrival provides the opportunity for smoldering vendettas to explode and for intricate conspiracies to form and then unravel-intrigue besets her on every side. Mary's self-righteous brother, James, seeks to rule in her place; her brilliant Secretary of State, Lethington, dedicates his energies to placing the Stuarts on the throne of England; and her cousin, Elizabeth I, dazzling and unscrupulous, fears Mary as a threat to her crown and to her life. Mingling a poet's passion with an historian's insight, Tannahill chronicles an era of easy violence, desperate action, and grand conspiracy. In Fatal Majesty, masterful characterization combines with lightning pace and classic plotting to deliver a tragic romantic saga with all the complexity of a major political thriller.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QXtpCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Tale of Healer Miguel Perdomo Neira: Medicine, Ideologies, and Power in the Nineteenth-Century Andes (Latin American Silhouettes)","description":"This new book tells the story of Miguel Perdomo Niera, a healer whose amazing cures during his travels through the northern Andes in the 1860s and 1870s evoked both enormous hostility and widespread adulation. A combination of narrative and analysis, the book documents Perdomo's experiences in Colombia and Ecuador and offers valuable insights into the social history of medicine during the Great Transformation in nineteenth-century Latin America. Reactions to Perdomo also illuminate the conflicts between colonial and modern and between religious and secular belief systems in Latin America during this time. This era pitted the norms of colonial Latin America against forces of change that shaped contemporary Latin America. Perdomo's practice of medicine demonstrated a strong religious influence that liberals thought were incompatible with a modern, secular society. Seldom have the contentions surrounding competitive medical systems been so starkly illuminated as in the case of Perdomo. One of a group of empirics, also known as cranderos, bleeders or barbers, who offered health care to people in Latin America, Perdomo did not charge for his services. Many people were perplexed by his cures. The drugs that he used allegedly enabled him to perform minor surgery without pain, swelling, or excessive bleeding. Supporters wrote numerous testimonials expressing their gratitude for his ability to cure illnesses that had plagued them for years. But Perdomo also had his detractors. Physicians, formally trained medicos, and those who supported scientific modernization were critical of Perdomo's practice of Hispanic medicine, even though it was part of the medical system of the day. Blending Catholic healing beliefs with indigenous and African medical ideologies, Hispanic medicine challenged the innovations occurring in the professional medical community.

These differences reflect human evolutionary history and the disparate selection pressures women and men experienced, say the authors of this thought-provoking book. Catherine Salmon and Donald Symons provide a concise review of the fundamental importance of evolutionary history to human psychology, discuss how male and female sexual psychologies differ, and then demonstrate how sex differences in erotica illustrate this.\\" \\"The authors focus particular attention on a new erotic subgenre - slash fiction - written mostly by and for women. Slash depicts romantic and sexual relationships between heterosexual male characters in television and film, such as Starsky and Hutch (S/H) and Captain Kirk and Mr. Spock (K/S), and is so named for the punctuation mark indicating the pair. Salmon and Symons argue that slash fiction has much in common with the romance genre and that the heroes of both genres are \\"warrior lovers\\" who embody the qualities our female ancestors valued in a mate. But while romance novel readers fantasize about being \\"Mrs. Warrior,\\" slash fans prefer the fantasy of being \\"co-warrior.\\" The authors consider why this might be so and examine the essential ingredients of female sexual fantasy.

Sheppard began visiting her neighbors and forming friendships in remote coves and rocky clearings, and in 1935 her account of life in the mountains -- Cabins in the Laurel -- was published. The book included 128 striking photographs by the well-known Chapel Hill photographer, Bayard Wootten, a frequent visitor to the area. The early reviews of Cabins in the Laurel were overwhelmingly positive, but the mountain people -- Sheppard's friends and subjects -- initially felt that she had portrayed them as too old-fashioned, even backward. As novelist John Ehle shows in his foreword, though, fifty years have made a huge difference, and the people of the Toe River Valley have been among its most affectionate readers. This new large-format edition, which makes use of many of Wootten's original negatives, will introduce Sheppard's words and Wootten's photography to a whole new generation of readers -- in the Valley and beyond.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=4WSVAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"An Illustrated History of Trucks and Buses","description":"Surveys the development of buses and trucks from early eighteenth-century prototypes to today's rigs, off-road and construction vehicles, fire engines, and custom jobs","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=brxB-Rq1evYC&dq=An+Illustrated+History+of+Trucks+and+Buses&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Emerald Twilight (Green Lantern, #48, #49, #50)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RDHQPQAACAAJ&dq=Emerald+Twilight+(Green+Lantern,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MCSE TCP/IP Exam Cram 3E (Exam: 70-059)","description":"Covering key topics addressed on the TCP/IP exam 70-059, this book provides two practice exams that assess the reader's readiness for the exam and features practice questions in the format of the actual test.

For instance, the book recommends against the use of some of the IPv6 standard APIs - unfortunately, there are some IPv6 APIs that are inherently insecure, so the book tries to avoid (and discourage) the use of such APIs.

Member of a 600-man expedition sent out from Spain to colonize \\"La Florida\\" in 1527, he survived a failed exploration of the west coast of Florida, an open-boat crossing of the Gulf of Mexico, shipwreck on the Texas coast, six years of captivity among native peoples, and an arduous, overland journey in which he and the three other remaining survivors of the original expedition walked some 1,500 miles from the central Texas coast to the Gulf of California, then another 1,300 miles to Mexico City. The story of Cabeza de Vaca has been told many times, beginning with his own account, Relaci n de los naufragios, which was included and amplified in Gonzalo Fernando de Oviedo y V ldez's Historia general de las Indias. Yet the route taken by Cabeza de Vaca and his companions remains the subject of enduring controversy. In this book, Alex D. Krieger correlates the accounts in these two primary sources with his own extensive knowledge of the geography, archaeology, and anthropology of southern Texas and northern Mexico to plot out stage by stage the most probable route of the 2,800-mile journey of Cabeza de Vaca. This book consists of several parts, foremost of which is the original English version of Alex Krieger's dissertation (edited by Margery Krieger), in which he traces the route of Cabeza de Vaca and his companions from the coast of Texas to Spanish settlements in western Mexico. This document is rich in information about the native groups, vegetation, geography, and material culture that the companions encountered. Thomas R. Hester's foreword and afterword set the 1955 dissertation in the context of more recent scholarship and archaeological discoveries, some of which have supported Krieger's plot of the journey. Margery Krieger's preface explains how she prepared her late husband's work for publication. Alex Krieger's original translations of the Cabeza de Vaca and Oviedo accounts round out the volume.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FSxMAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Down in the Daisies: A Baby Animal Counting Book","description":"One seal pup, two polar bear cubs, three lambs - here's an adorable collection of baby animals with their mothers, counting up from one to ten, from all over the world and in all kinds of weather.

Rick Gates, who served as Donald Trump s deputy campaign chairman in 2016 and as a cooperating witness in the Mueller investigation, gives readers a rare, in-depth look at one of the most controversial elections and presidents in U.S. history. From a perspective only he can offer, Rick answers the important questions: How was Trump able to beat sixteen high-profile, experienced Republican contenders, and Hillary Clinton, to win in 2016? How did the campaign work? What really happened with Russian election interference and the Mueller investigation? And more. With refreshing candor, Rick shares his story, observations, and facts with the intent that readers form their own opinions and draw their own conclusions. The result is a thought-provoking account that informs and educates readers on both sides of the political aisle as we approach the 2020 election. In up-close detail, Rick takes us through his personal journey to explain how Trump defied the odds, the polls, and even his own party to become the 45th president of the United States. He shares pivotal moments behind the scenes of the campaign and inauguration that have never been shared before, revealing critical decisions and political tactics that explain how Donald Trump was able to upset the entire Republican political establishment and beat a system built on centuries-old traditions. He also shows us how Donald Trump brought his personal brand to the presidency and how, in the end, the political establishment had no choice but to adapt to him because Trump would never adapt to them. Following the inauguration, Rick was entangled in the Robert Mueller investigation on Russian election interference. In Wicked Game, Rick lifts the veil to detail exactly what happened behind the operations of the Mueller probe, providing the first major account from an insider indicted in the investigation. In the government s sentencing memo in their case against him, federal prosecutors took the unusual step of praising Rick for his  extraordinary assistance  in their efforts:  Gates has worked assiduously to provide truthful, complete, and reliable information,  they wrote. Which makes it all the more compelling when Rick s account reveals the inadequacies of our legal system, and how a small group of people in Washington manipulated the political system for their own purposes undermining our democracy in the process. History has its eyes on America, and as people all over the world try to understand Trump s presidency in a time of global crisis and uncertainty heading into the 2020 election, Rick s powerful, firsthand account provides revealing and factual insights that he hopes Republicans and Democrats alike will learn from and apply as our nation moves forward.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iff1DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Growing Up Me: A Guide to Scrapbooking Childhood Stories","description":"Encouraging children to explore what is unique and special about themselves, Growing Up Me is a guide designed for parents, mentors and educators to use when helping children create a scrapbook that showcases their extraordinary young lives.

Alter has given fresh life to some of the most beloved . . . books in our heritage.  Philadelphia Inquirer The Song of Songs; Ruth; Esther; Jonah; and Daniel offer readers a range of pleasures not usually associated with the Bible. As distant in time from the Five Books of Moses as Updike is from Shakespeare, these Late Biblical books are innovative, entertaining literary works. Women often stand center stage. The Song of Songs is a celebration of young love, frankly sensuous, with no reference to God or covenant. It offers some of the most beautiful love poems of the ancient world. The story of Queen Esther s shrewd triumph is also a secular entertainment, with clear traces of farce and sly sexual comedy. The character of Ruth embodies the virtues of loyalty, love, and charity in a harmonious world. Enigma replaces harmony in Daniel s feverish night dreams. The apocalyptic strangeness of Daniel echoes in works from the New Testament s Book of Revelations to the lyrics of Bob Dylan. And Jonah, the tale of a giant fish who, on God s command, swallows the prophet and imprisons him in his dark wet innards for three days, ends with a question that lingers, unanswered, leaving the reader to ponder the many limitations of humankind.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WAF-BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Edgewalkers: Defusing Cultural Boundaries on the New Global Frontier","description":"Edgewalkers comprise a unique group of people who belong to two or more ethnic, cultural, or spiritual worlds.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DVG5AAAAIAAJ&dq=Edgewalkers:+Defusing+Cultural+Boundaries+on+the+New+Global+Frontier&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Big Book of Lionel: The Complete Guide to Owning and Running America's Favorite Toy Trains","description":"Lionel products are today more technologically advanced than ever, thanks to such innovations as FasTrack and the Legacy control system.

The story of Jann Wenner, Rolling Stone's founder, editor, and publisher, and the pioneering era he helped curate, is told here for the first time in glittering, glorious detail. Joe Hagan provides readers with a backstage pass to storied concert venues and rock-star hotel rooms; he tells never before heard stories about the lives of rock stars and their handlers; he details the daring journalism (Tom Wolfe, Hunter S. Thompson, P.J. O Rourke) and internecine office politics that accompanied the start-up; he animates the drug and sexual appetites of the era; and he reports on the politics of the last fifty years that were often chronicled in the pages of Rolling Stone magazine. Supplemented by a cache of extraordinary documents and letters from Wenner's personal archives, Sticky Fingers depicts an ambitious, mercurial, wide-eyed rock and roll fan of who exalts in youth and beauty and learns how to package it, marketing late sixties counterculture as a testament to the power of American youth. The result is a fascinating and complex portrait of man and era, and an irresistible biography of popular culture, celebrity, music, and politics in America.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m4EkDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tomorrow : Adventures in an Uncertain World","description":"Bradley Trevor Greive's (BTG) 'Tomorrow', extends his remarkable reputation for creating profound books from life's most basic and enduring questions.

This study of Sufism serves as a guide for finding your purpose & acting according to it. To the Sufi, actions, thoughts, feelings, spoken words, all transmit vibrational patterns which produce reactions in the universe. The goal is to understand which reactions please the Creator as opposed to one's ego. The Sufi route to this goal is via the heart, for love is the medium of unity necessary for a connection between a person & the Divine. The book discusses the practices that open a student's inner organs of perception to an expanded world of radiance which is normally unseen. The Shaykh serves as the guide & protector on this journey & the book clearly describes the responsibilities of both the Shaykh & the Sufi student. The ultimate goal of the Sufi path is the purification of one's heart, a process known as \\"surrender,\\" i.e., the achievement of complete mastery over the selfish urgings of ones egoistic nature. Intention & sincerity are the springboards of the surrender process -- the inner aspect which gives meaning to our outer deeds.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=CbjIAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Sun+Will+Rise+in+the+West+:+The+Holy+Trail&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gospel of Jesus: The Pastoral Relevance of the Synoptic Problem","description":"William Farmer has devoted much of his career to addressing the question of the relationship among the three Synoptic Gospels--Matthew, Mark, and Luke.

As  empieza el viaje de la extraordinaria autobiograf a de Jorge Ramos, un periodista que encarna este esp ritu aventurero a la perfecci n, y que espera, alg n d a, encontrar un lugar en el cu l se sienta como en casa.

Hable de lost amores de su vida, de su pasi n por el periodismo de sus viajes y entrevistas y de su propio concepto de realizaci n espiritual.

En este libro conocemos al hombre de la televisi n al que millones de latinos e hispanoparlantes le han dado toda su confianza durante a?os.

Ramos cuenta de sus conflictos, de ni?o, con los sacerdotes benedictinos, de sus luchas como estudianted en Los  ngeles a principios de los ochentas, de su primera incursi n en el periodismo norteamericano y de las advertencias de las grandes cadenas de televisi n en ingl s de que jam s llegar a a un puesto importante si no perd a su acento.

As a result of this, Salman Rashid's family fled Jalandhar for Pakistan, the newly created country across the border. They were among the nearly two million people uprooted from their homes in the greatest transmigration in history. Besides those who fled, other members of the family became part of a grimmer statistic: They featured among the more than one million unfortunate souls who paid with their lives for the division of India and creation of Pakistan. After living in the shadow of his family's tragedy for decades, in 2008, Rashid made the journey back to his ancestral village to uncover the truth. A time of madness tells the story of what he discovered with great poignancy and grace.

Living a Sustainable Lifestyle for Our Children's Children shows how sustainable development is a process of living that cuts across many of the major concerns facing society today and establishes how we can move beyond these present risks. It presents an easy to understand description of sustainability, where humans find the means to coexist in a manner that maintains biodiversity, wildlands, and decent environments while also achieving economic prosperity and equality, present and future. The book challenges people to transform their awareness of human-nature interactions into a deeper commitment to both protecting and wisely using our global natural resources. Going beyond science, technology, and politics, this book discusses how we live and why we live the way we do, while addressing the basics of life: how to know what is in our water, air, food, and land. The good news is, a shift to sustainable development is occurring. Ordinary people living ordinary lives, looking at how they live, how that in turn affects nature, and how fundamental nature is to our existence, is the beginning. And, this book poses tough questions, not for another debate, but to initiate reader awareness, understanding, and motion. We hope to advance understanding of what people can do differently to alter the surging tide of material inequity and declining resources by offering numerous alternatives for the individual considering their ability to make a difference.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SStBEvFSnQ8C&dq=Living+a+Sustainable+Lifestyle+for+Our+Children%27s+Children&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sherman Kent and the Board of National Estimates : collected essays (SuDoc PREX 3.2:K 41)","description":"Perhaps no other American city is so defined by an indigenous architectural style as Baltimore is by the rowhouse, whose brick facades march up and down the gentle hills of the city.

What were the forces that led to the citywide renovation of Baltimore's rowhouses? The Baltimore Rowhouse tells the fascinating 200-year story of this building type. It chronicles the evolution of the rowhouse from its origins as speculative housing for immigrants, through its reclamation and renovation by young urban pioneers thanks to local government sponsorship, to its current occupation by a new cadre of wealthy professionals.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=2k3uliKiFlAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Style and Difference","description":"Ideal for students in upper-level composition, literature, or creative writing courses, this brief style guide gives practical advice on how students with basic grammar knowledge can produce writing with style (and with the correctness that matters) for both academic and professional purposes.

With the aid of examples from nearly 100 contemporary published writers, Style and Difference shows how good writing style differs from, as well as conforms to, the established conventions and rules of writing. Style and Difference offers instructors flexibility in their syllabi: this text can be used as a supplement to a handbook or instead of a handbook; chapters can be paired or used in any sequence; and the readings in Part V, Writers on Style, lend themselves to discussions about style that are appropriate at any time during the term. All chapters both conventional and contra-conventional offer examples of how other writers apply various elements of style.

Yes, but from a fresh point of view. The wife of Shore, as she was called by all the writers of her time, was the mistress of Richard's older brother, King Edward IV. This king has been forgotten, perhaps because Shakespeare found his brother more interesting. He was in fact a popular king, a tall and handsome warlord, a brilliant general who defeated the armies of Lancaster and seized the throne when he was only nineteen. For a medieval ruler, Edward IV showed an extraordinary interest in trade and commerce. His father, duke of York and largest landholder in England, never quite captured the crown, because he never had enough cash to hire enough soldiers. Edward IV learned as a boy that political power requires lots of money, and that money is made in the marketplace, so he cultivated the merchants of the City of London. He put through laws that helped their trade, he insisted on being included in their deals--and he mingled with them socially, which is how he met the subject of this story, daughter of one rich merchant and wife of another. Josephine Tey's brilliant novel The Daughter of Time has provided us with most of what we know about how badly Richard III has been treated by both history and William Shakespeare. Richard was not the monster Shakespeare put on the stage. While Edward IV was alive, Richard duke of Gloucester was his loyal younger brother. He killed many people, but so did Edward. It was his later battles with Edward's widow and her many ambitious relatives that drove Richard to do the deeds that have made him so infamous, and so fascinating. The novelist steps in to supply the details, but historians confirm that soon after Edward IV got a look at her, the wife of Shore was moved to Windsor--not reluctantly--while her husband transferred himself and his business to Flanders. Not long after that, she petitioned the Pope for a divorce, alleging that she wanted children but her husband was impotent. But that's all background. This story begins on April 8, 1483, when Edward IV -- only forty years old -- suddenly collapses.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9dOLAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Wife+of+Shore+:+A+Search&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Let a Simile Be Your Umbrella","description":"This twelfth collection from the Pulitzer Prize-winning political columnist's \\"On language\\" column from the \\"New York Times Magazine\\" dissects curious coinages, trends, and errors in English usage.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I0RZAAAAMAAJ&dq=Let+a+Simile+Be+Your+Umbrella&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Reverence for Wood","description":"This book underscores the important role that wood has played in the development of American life and culture.

This book is the first to apply the combined insights of social, political, and cultural history to an important but little-explored area of medieval and early modern Europe, the Burgundian Netherlands. Realms of Ritual traces the role of ritual in encounters between the dukes of Burgundy (later the Habsburg princes) and the townspeople of Ghent, the most important city in the county of Flanders. Arnade analyzes city-state ceremonies through which Ghent's aldermen, patricians, guildsmen, and the city's military and drama confraternities confronted local power and the growth of the Burgundian state. In the first serious reappraisal of Johan Huizinga's classic work The Waning of the Middle Ages, Arnade confirms Huizinga's vision of a Low Country society rich in public symbols, yet reveals the city-state conflict within which such ritual thrived. He offers a dramatically new perspective on the Northern Renaissance, as well as a historical/anthropological model for the study of urban-state relations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-C1zDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Waning+of+the+Middle+Ages:+A+study+of+the+forms+of+life,+thought,+and+art+in+France+and+the+Netherlands+in+the+dawn+of+the+renaissance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Palestinians (Minority Rights Group. Report)","description":"In 1918 Christian and Muslim Arabs formed over 90 per cent of the population of Palestine. Fifty years later, those left were a powerless minority in their own land, while most were refugees outside Palestine. Since 1967, Israel has been an occupying force in Gaza and the West Bank, expropriating for example over 60 per cent of the West Bank's land area, dispossessing many Palestinians. While Israel's actions have been condemned in United Nations Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, Israel continues its actions largely unchecked. Within Israel, Palestinians are systematically discriminated against in almost, all areas of society. While condemning the Israel governent's policies, the Report also discusses the abuses of the newly-established Palestinian Authority. The Report provides information on the outlook for Palestinian society and examines why the peace process - once seen to offer a constructive way forward - is now in tatters. The Report offers a concise and accessible analysis of the background to this situation and cogently argues that the international community must act as a matter of urgency to enable a just settlement to be found - one that promotes and protects Palestinians' rights and enables Israel and the Palestinian Authority to work towards peaceful coexistence - based on respect for international law.

Perhaps the aim of the book might be put in this way: to acquaint the reader who goes on to become a biblical scholar in the fullest technical sense with basic material that he will not have to unlearn. - Preface.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Qbw0AAAAIAAJ&dq=The+Hebrew+scriptures%3B:+An+introduction+to+their+literature+and+religious+ideas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hittite Myths (Writings from the Ancient World)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=kdAqMQAACAAJ&dq=Hittite+Myths+(Writings+from+the+Ancient+World)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Shadows of Reality: The Fourth Dimension in Relativity, Cubism, and Modern Thought","description":"In this insightful book, which is a revisionist math history as well as a revisionist art history, Tony Robbin, well known for his innovative computer visualizations of hyperspace, investigates different models of the fourth dimension and how these are applied in art and physics. Robbin explores the distinction between the slicing, or Flatland, model and the projection, or shadow, model. He compares the history of these two models and their uses and misuses in popular discussions. Robbin breaks new ground with his original argument that Picasso used the projection model to invent cubism, and that Minkowski had four-dimensional projective geometry in mind when he structured special relativity. The discussion is brought to the present with an exposition of the projection model in the most creative ideas about space in contemporary mathematics such as twisters, quasicrystals, and quantum topology. Robbin clarifies these esoteric concepts with understandable drawings and diagrams. Robbin proposes that the powerful role of projective geometry in the development of current mathematical ideas has been long overlooked and that our attachment to the slicing model is essentially a conceptual block that hinders progress in understanding contemporary models of spacetime. He offers a fascinating review of how projective ideas are the source of some of today s most exciting developments in art, math, physics, and computer visualization.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TRABcDhRNYcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Power of a Praying Wife: Prayer Journal","description":"The Power of a Praying?

By sixteen, Frank was one of the most notorious skinhead gang leaders on the East Coast. By eighteen, he was doing hard time in an Illinois prison. Behind bars, Frank began to question his hatred, thanks in large part to his African-American teammates on a prison football league. Shortly after being paroled, Frank defected from the white supremacy movement. The Oklahoma City bombing inspired him to try to stop the hatred he once had felt. He began speaking on behalf of the Anti-Defamation League and appeared on MTV and other national networks in his efforts to stop the hate. In time, Frank partnered with the Philadelphia Flyers to launch an innovative hate prevention program called Harmony Through Hockey.

In Diaries to an English Professor (1994), he explored the ways in which undergraduate students can use psychoanalytic diaries to deal with conflicted issues in their lives. Surviving Literary Suicide (1999) investigated how graduate students respond to novels and poems that portray and sometimes glorify self-inflicted death. And in Risky Writing (2002), Berman considered the ways teachers can encourage college students to write safely on a wide range of subjects often deemed too personal or too dangerous for the classroom, from grieving the loss of a friend to confronting sexual abuse. on understanding the other can transform the experience of learning. Berman begins with a discussion of several well-known stories and films featuring literature instructors who exert a formative influence on their students, including Good-bye, Mr. Chips, The Blackboard Jungle, Up the Down Staircase, and Dead Poets Society. He then goes on to examine the pedagogical importance of empathy, trauma, and forgiveness in helping students cope with the ordinary and extraordinary challenges of everyday life. powerful, insightful, authentic essays about lived experience that reveal both intellectual and emotional growth. In the book's final chapter, Berman considers the risks and benefits of empathic teaching, demonstrating how teachers can play a therapeutic role in the classroom without being therapists. Teachers who are regarded as trusting, supportive, and dependable, he argues, become attachment figures, influencing students to be more sensitive to and connected with their classmates' lives. Or, as Berman succinctly puts it, empathic teaching leads to empathic learning, an education for life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=W7h5AAAAIAAJ&dq=Empathic+Teaching:+Education+For+Life&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Piercingthe Darkness","description":"Now in ebook, the classic sequel to bestseller This Present Darkness, about another small town in the midst of an unseen supernatural battle for truth.

Reischauer Lectures, 1988)","description":"This engaging book challenges the traditional notion that Japan was an isolated nation cut off from the outside world in the early modern era. This familiar story of seclusion, argues master historian Marius B. Jansen, results from viewing the period solely in terms of Japan's ties with the West, at the expense of its relationship with closer Asian neighbors. Taking as his focus the port of Nagasaki and its thriving trade with China in the sixteenth through the nineteenth centuries, Jansen not only corrects this misperception but offers an important analysis of the impact of the China trade on Japan's cultural, economic, and political life. Creating a vivid portrait of a city that lived on and for foreign trade, the author details Nagasaki's pivotal role in importing luxury goods for a growing Japanese market whose elite wanted more of everything that ships from China could bring. Silk, sugar, and ginseng were among the cargoes brought to Nagasaki as well as books that, by the late Tokugawa period, signaled the dangers of Western expansionism. The junks from China brought people as well as goods, and the author provides clear evidence of the influence of Chinese expatriates and visitors on Japanese religion, law, and art. Japan's intellectuals prided themselves on their full participation in the cultural milieu of the continental mainland, and for them China represented an ideal land of sages and tranquility. But gradually China came to represent, instead, a metaphor for the \\"other\\", as Japan's quest for a national identity intensified. Among the Japanese, a new image of their nation was beginning to emerge: a Japan superior to Asia in general and to China in particular.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=11dbNDpaxOAC&dq=China+in+the+Tokugawa+World+(The+Edwin+O.+Reischauer+Lectures,+1988)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Lady of His Own (Bastion Club)","description":"The seven members of the Bastion Club have served loyally in the perilous service of the Crown.

An early traveller to the Americas who sailed on one of Columbus's voyages, Las Casas was so horrified by the wholesale massacre he witnessed that he dedicated his life to protecting the Indian community. He wrote A Short Account of the Destruction of the Indies in 1542, a shocking catalogue of mass slaughter, torture and slavery, which showed that the evangelizing vision of Columbus had descended under later conquistadors into genocide. Dedicated to Philip II to alert the Castilian Crown to these atrocities and demand that the Indians be entitled to the basic rights of humankind, this passionate work of documentary vividness outraged Europe and contributed to the idea of the Spanish 'Black Legend' that would last for centuries.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MTWIHI6Fk_sC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Awesome Power of PowerJ","description":"This primer teaches how to do Java programming using PowerJ, a Rapid Application Development tool from Powersoft.

As a perpetuator of the Final Solution he stands alongside Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler as one of history's most notorious murderers, yet ever since Hannah Arendt's seminal book, \\"Eichmann in Jerusalem: A Report on the Banality of Evil\\", there has been disagreement about the essence of Eichmann and by extension, about the definition of evil action. Was he a human monster or a petty bureaucrat? To what degree did the totalitarian organization to which he belonged absolve him and his staff from individual choice and responsibility for atrocities? This title looks at the words and actions of Eichmann and the bureaucrats he worked with in Berlin and throughout the more significant Gestapo offices in Western Europe. It claims that Hannah Arendt's thesis about the banality of evil was wrong. In chilling detail, it presents a group of people completely aware of what they were doing, people with high ideological motivation, people of initiative and dexterity who contributed far beyond what was necessary. While most of these bureaucrats sat behind desks rather than behind machine guns, there was nothing banal about the role they played in the destruction of European Jewry","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZKGvAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Principles of Corporate Finance (Mcgraw Hill Series in Finance)","description":"This new international edition provides increased coverage of the procedures for estimating the cost of capital, expanded coverage of risk management techniques and the use and misuse of derivatives, and additional coverage of agency problems.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nsrHuwEACAAJ&dq=Principles+of+Corporate+Finance+(Mcgraw+Hill+Series+in+Finance)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rambles in Cairo","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Q4pQAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How We Know What Isn't So: The Fallibility of Human Reason in Everyday Life","description":"Thomas Gilovich offers a wise and readable guide to the fallacy of the obvious in everyday life.

Higher-than-expected casualties during the liberation of France had forced the Army to comb its ranks for replacement infantrymen. Plucked in 1944 from the safety and privilege of the Army Specialized Training Program (the World War II version of the college deferment of the Vietnam years), twenty-two-year-old John Babcock suddenly found himself an infantry private headed to Europe. Raised in an upper-middle-class family, this sensitive and literate youth was thrust into a group of coarse, uneducated, and sometimes brutal draftees who were headed to the 78th Infantry Division as replacements. Babcock demonstrates that the \\"greatest generation\\" was not always that. Instead, it was like any other cohort--full of liars, cowards, and ordinary men who simply wanted to stay alive and go home. Babcock lets us see the war through his eyes--just over the rim of the foxhole. Undergoing his baptism of fire in the Battle of the Bulge, he endures the trials of combat, advancing through attrition to become the senior sergeant in the company. This ordinary enlisted infantryman in \\"just another combat division\\" takes the reader from infantry basic training and seven months of combat to postwar occupation duty in Germany and back home. It is one infantry rifleman's story rather than an account of how his division fit into the grander scheme of the war in Europe--though the author relates to that by providing the reader with a roadmap of dates and locations taken. Babcock offers an intimate taste of combat, casualties, how he fought, and with which weapons (in clear \\"civilian\\" language), and both the heroism and cowardice of his fellow soldiers. Published in cooperation with the Association of the United States Army, it is a gripping account of how an ordinary American boy felt and experienced the so-called good war.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UANRaxBeMzcC&dq=Taught+to+Kill:+An+American+Boy%27s+War+from+the+Ardennes+to+Berlin&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Falling for Mr. Wrong","description":"After her ambitious film producer husband leaves her, Polly decides to give up men and concentrate on her career as a literary agent.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tnEPeTlWAyIC&dq=Falling+for+Mr.+Wrong&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"With Broadax and Firebrand: The Destruction of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest","description":"Warren Dean chronicles the chaotic path to what could be one of the greatest natural disasters of modern times: the disappearance of the Atlantic Forest. A quarter the size of the Amazon Forest, and the most densely populated region in Brazil, the Atlantic Forest is now the most endangered in the world. It contains a great diversity of life forms, some of them found nowhere else, as well as the country's largest cities, plantations, mines, and industries. Continual clearing is ravaging most of the forested remnants. Dean opens his story with the hunter-gatherers of twelve thousand years ago and takes it up to the 1990s through the invasion of Europeans in the sixteenth century; the ensuing devastation wrought by such developments as gold and diamond mining, slash-and-burn farming, coffee planting, and industrialization; and the desperate battles between conservationists and developers in the late twentieth century. Based on a great range of documentary and scientific resources,With Broadax and Firebrand is an enormously ambitious book. More than a history of a tropical forest, or of the relationship between forest and humans, it is also a history of Brazil told from an environmental perspective. Dean writes passionately and movingly, in the fierce hope that the story of the Atlantic Forest will serve as a warning of the terrible costs of destroying its great neighbor to the west, the Amazon Forest.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MYL2Esiy-lMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Caribbean Stud & Let It Ride Poker: The Real Deal","description":"Fifteen, chapters outline the rules of play, players options, payout schedules, overall house odds, plus the best winning strategies.

Sturdy and rustic, this furniture can be a beautiful addition to any indoor decor, although it's most often used to set the scene outdoors. There, the furniture is subjected to a lifetime of abuse. Yearly it moves from somewhere hidden away (probably dark and musty winter storage) to front-and-center on the summer stage. Now, hour after hour it is beaten on by intense UV light, drenched in driving rains, then fried again in the summer sun. Through it all, the furniture patiently endures--ever handsome, ever inviting, ever lasting. To survive summertime abuse and the semiannual ritual of being dragged into and out of storage, outdoor furniture must be sturdy, rugged, and well built--all qualities that epitomize Adirondack pieces. This bulletin contains instructions for building an Adirondack chair, matching footstool, companion side table, and Westport chair (an ancestor of the modern-day slatted Adirondack chair). Each project will take the moderately skilled carpenter less than a day to fabricate; for the beginner, maybe a weekend.

Recent years have brought new scientific understanding of these profound and fundamental issues. In lively prose, Professor Padmanabhan paints a picture of contemporary cosmology for the general reader. Unlike other popular books on cosmology, After the First Three Minutes does not gloss over details, or shy away from explaining the underlying concepts. Instead, with a lucid and informal style, the author introduces all the relevant background and then carefully pieces together an engaging story of the evolution of our Universe. Padmanabhan leaves the reader with a state-of-the-art picture of scientists' current understanding in cosmology and a keen taste of the excitement of this fast-moving science. Throughout, no mathematics is used and all technical jargon is clearly introduced and reinforced in a handy glossary at the end of the book. For general readers who want to come to grips with what we really do and don't know about our Universe, this book provides an exciting and uncompromising read. Thanu Padmanabhan is a Professor at Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics in Pune, India. He is the recipient of numerous awards and author of three books, Structure Formation in the Universe (Cambridge, 1994), Cosmology and Astrophysics Through Problems (Cambridge, 1996), and, together with J.V. Narlikar, Gravity, Gauge Theories and Quantum Cosmology. He is also the author of more than one hundred popular science articles, a comic strip serial and several regular columns on astronomy, recreational mathematics, and the history of science.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-nrzm4aWHn4C&dq=After+the+First+Three+Minutes:+The+Story+of+Our+Universe&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Key of Light (Key Trilogy)","description":"Fate brings three women together for a chance to unlock their deepest desires in this collection that includes all three novels in the Key Trilogy from #1 New York Times bestselling author Nora Roberts.

When the author's fifteen-year-old son survives a terrible car crash in spite of massive trauma to his brain, she and her family know only that his story has not ended. Their efforts, Erik's own efforts, and those of everyone who helps bring him from deep coma to new life make up a moving and inspiring story for us all, one that invites us to reconsider the very nature of \\"self\\" and selfhood. Ruthann Knechel Johansen, who teaches literature and narrative theory, is a particularly eloquent witness to the silent space in which her son, confronted with life-shattering injury and surrounded by conflicting narratives about his viability, is somehow reborn. She describes the time of crisis and medical intervention as an hour-by-hour struggle to communicate with the medical world on the one hand and the everyday world of family and friends on the other. None of them knows how much, or even whether, they can communicate with the wounded child who is lost from himself and everything he knew. Through this experience of utter disintegration, Johansen comes to realize that self-identity is molded and sustained by stories. As Erik regains movement and consciousness, his parents, younger sister, doctors, therapists, educators, and friends all contribute to a web of language and narrative that gradually enables his body, mind, and feelings to make sense of their reacquired functions. Like those who know and love him, the young man feels intense grief and anger for the loss of the self he was before the accident, yet he is the first to see continuity where they see only change. The story is breathtaking, because we become involved in the pain and suspense and faith that accompany every birth. Medical and rehabilitation professionals, social workers, psychotherapists, students of narrative, and anyone who has faced life's trauma will find hope in this meditation on selfhood: out of the shambles of profound brain injury and coma can arise fruitful lives and deepened relationships.

This book reveals the insubstantiality of their arguments. Creationism is no longer the simple notion it once was taken to be. Its new advocates have become more sophisticated in how they present their views, speaking of \\"intelligent design\\" rather than \\"creation science\\" and aiming their arguments against the naturalistic philosophical method that underlies science, proposing to replace it with a \\"theistic science.\\" The creationism controversy is not just about the status of Darwinian evolution it is a clash of religious and philosophical worldviews, for a common underlying fear among Creationists is that evolution undermines both the basis of morality as they understand it and the possibility of purpose in life. In Tower of Babel, philosopher Robert T. Pennock compares the views of the new creationists with those of the old and reveals the insubstantiality of their arguments. One of Pennock's major innovations is to turn from biological evolution to the less charged subject of linguistic evolution, which has strong theoretical parallels with biological evolution, both in content and in the sort of evidence scientists use to draw conclusions about origins. Of course, an evolutionary view of language does conflict with the Bible, which says that God created the variety of languages at one time as punishment for the Tower of Babel. Several chapters deal with the work of Phillip Johnson, a highly influential leader of the new Creationists. Against his and other views, Pennock explains how science uses naturalism and discusses the relationship between factual and moral issues in the creationism-evolution controversy. The book also includes a discussion of Darwin's own shift from creationist to evolutionist and an extended argument for keeping private religious beliefs separate from public scientific knowledge.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xezuCwAAQBAJ&dq=Tower+of+Babel:+The+Evidence+against+the+New+Creationism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Horror Stories (Kingfisher Story Library)","description":"This is a chilling compilation of the very b est in horror writing from the gothic terror of Edgar Allan Poe, to contemporary writers such as Leon Garfield and Susan Price.

In Ultimate Questions, acclaimed philosopher Bryan Magee provocatively argues that we have no way of fathoming our own natures or finding definitive answers to the big questions we all face. With eloquence and grace, Magee urges us to be the mapmakers of what is intelligible, and to identify the boundaries of meaningfulness. He traces this tradition of thought to his chief philosophical mentors Locke, Hume, Kant, and Schopenhauer and shows why this approach to the enigma of existence can enrich our lives and transform our understanding of the human predicament.

This plant manager's guide explains how to use control charts, and the tremendous benefits that can be expected when Statistical Process Control is properly applied. These benefits include enhanced product performance, reduced cost, and streamlined delivery. Some of the topics discussed are: reading control charts, using control charts, good tools misused, tools for running your machine, benefits of running machines with SPC. Special appendices provide additional information about control chart calculations and plotting control limits. This book explains the role that SPC plays within a well-run factory; it is for businesspeople that want the big picture. After 30+ years of working with and teaching plant managers, author James Abbott has identified the qualities that set apart the most successful and promotable of this group. These managers have an intricate understanding of their machines, they are expert at assessing each component of their operation, and everyone at their facility has explicitly defined duties. These qualities are achieved by learning a specific set of holistic skills. The most powerful weapon in the plant manager's arsenal is Statistical Process Control (SPC). You don't need to be a math genius to harness the full power of SPC, but you do need to understand the role of engineers, quality professionals, and operators and how each fits within a well-run manufacturing facility. Promotable plant managers know WHO uses control charts and who uses capability studies WHAT Operations should be focusing on (hint: it isn't the product!) WHEN tacticians vs. strategists should be making decisions WHERE results should be posted WHY SPC improves performance, cuts cost, and streamlines delivery HOW to quickly benefit using SPC This book provides a unique opportunity for plant managers to study the interrelationships necessary to take full advantage of Statistical Process Control. Mr. Abbott's practical experience has shown that by adding decision-making, accountability, and knowledge base tools to the traditional control charts and capability studies, improvements are more quickly attained and more easily sustained. Running Your Machines with SPC explains how and why to use control charts. In addition to the conventional control charts and capability studies, you will be introduced to bonus tools like the Walkabout(r) Dependency Diagram. You will practice plotting readings on a control chart and learn what the data is saying about the process. Finally, you will follow along as a fictional candy company tries to implement SPC, but misuses some good tools. When the candy company correctly uses SPC, the benefits are immediately evident.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eCkhswEACAAJ&dq=Running+Your+Machines+with+SPC+(Walkabout)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Inner Chipmunk: Celebrating Just What Is","description":"Your inner Chimp can be your best friend or your worst enemy...this is the Chimp Paradox Do you sabotage your own happiness and success?

Criminal law is considered by many to be the most exciting of the legal specialties, and here the authors turn to the type of dramatic crimes and trials that have so captivated the public -- becoming fodder for countless television shows and legal thrillers. But the eight cases in this collection have also set historical precedents and illuminated underlying principles of the American criminal justice system. Future president John Adams makes clear that even the most despised and vilified criminal is entitled to a legal defense in the argument he delivers on behalf of the British soldiers who shot and killed five Americans during the Boston Massacre. The always-controversial temporary-insanity defense makes its debut within sight of the White House when, in front of horrified onlookers, a prominent congressman guns down the district attorney over an extramarital affair. Clarence Darrow provides a ringing defense of a black family charged with using deadly force to defend themselves from a violent mob -- an argument that refines the concept of self-defense and its applicability to all races. The treason trial of Aaron Burr, accused of plotting to \\"steal\\" the western territories of the United States and form a new country with himself as its head, offers a fascinating glimpse into a rare type of prosecution, as well as a look at one of the most interesting traitors in the nation's history. Perhaps the best-known case in the book is that of Ernesto Miranda, the accused rapist whose trial led to the Supreme Court decision requiring police to advise suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have an attorney present -- their Miranda rights. Each of the eight cases presented here is given legal and cultural context, including a brief historical introduction, a biographical sketch of the attorneys involved, highlights of trial testimony, analysis of the closing arguments, and a summary of the trial's impact on its participants and our country. In clear, jargon-free prose, Michael S Lief and H. Mitchell Caldwell make these pivotal cases come to vibrant life for every reader.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sf9KCPObEAYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oxford Book Of Poetry For Children","description":"A collection of poems by English poets.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=T24SPwAACAAJ&dq=Oxford+Book+Of+Poetry+For+Children&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Japanese Army Air Force Camouflage and Markings World War II","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=q4DrHyUfooMC&dq=Japanese+Army+Air+Force+Camouflage+and+Markings+World+War+II&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"North with the Spring: A Naturalist's Record of a 17,000 Mile Journey with the North-American Spring (The American Seasons, No. 1)","description":"With this book Troelstra gives us a superb overview of natural history travel narratives.

The collections authors frankly portray the mistakes they made in the field, their struggle to analyze the events unfolding before their eyes, the psychological and emotional frustration seemingly endemic to doing ethnography, and the ethical complexities of researching living people. The authors present these essays not as models of ideal fieldwork or as a series of lessons about how to overcome potential hurdles one faces in the field, but rather as a window into the complexities of being an ethnographer in the contemporary world. Against a backdrop of subject populations increasingly informed about global relations of power and, more specifically, informed about the topography of American imperialism, these humanistic essays vividly reflect recent shifts in both the focus and methods of anthropological research, as well as the dilemmas underlying the construction of anthropological knowledge. They are meant to spark discussion and debate. While tailored to an audience relatively new to ethnographic fieldwork (and intended as a teaching tool), this collection should appeal to anthropologists and ethnographers at all points in their career.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=BfAVAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Disco duck and other adventures in novelty music","description":"From \\"Monster Mash\\" to \\"The Macarena\\" -- this fun and fascinating book tells the true stories behind the novelty hits that took the nation by storm.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MDPaAAAAMAAJ&dq=Disco+duck+and+other+adventures+in+novelty+music&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Poker According To Maverick","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=msFVzgEACAAJ&dq=Poker+According+To+Maverick&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Nursing Review for Nclex-Rn","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AbZCGwAACAAJ&dq=American+Nursing+Review+for+Nclex-Rn&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Medium, The","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5rpoAAAAIAAJ&dq=Medium,+The&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dark Witness","description":"Running from the law, Hannah and Billy head north to hide out until Josie Bates can figure out a way to clear Billy s name.

Sachs is renowned for his work around the globe advising economies in crisis.

Anthropologists have been slow to consider the difficulties presented by the expansion of the EU model and its implications for Europe in the 21st Century. Representing a new trend in European anthropology, this book examines how people adjust to their different experiences of the new Europe. The role of culture, religion, and ideology, as well as insiders' social and professional practices, are all shown to shed light on the cultural logic sustaining the institutions and policies of the European Union. On the one hand, the activities of the European institutions in Brussels illustrate how people of many different nationalities, languages and cultures can live and work together. On the other hand, the interests of many people at the local, regional and national levels are not the same as the Eurocrats'. Contributors explore the issues of unity and diversity in  Europe-building' through various European institutions, images, and programmes, and their effects on a variety of definitions of identity in such locales as France, Denmark, the United Kingdom, Ireland and Belgium.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=O2kQEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chess openings : ideas & analysis ;: Four knights' game and Belgrade gambit","description":"Not a list of moves, but simple and logical explanations of opening systems.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c61mna53jdwC&dq=Chess+openings+:+ideas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Healing: Key to Spiritual Balance","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GlcPAAAACAAJ&dq=Healing:+Key+to+Spiritual+Balance&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Biosolids Engineering","description":"This is a collection of methods of practical design, calculation and numerical examples that illustrate how organized, analytical reasoning can lead to the discovery of clear, direct solutions to pollution especially in the areas of biosolids management, treatment, disposal and beneficial use.

In his relentless quest for excellence at the University of Connecticut, he has led the Huskies to five national championships.Yet his soul never rests.For Auriemma, life affords only the briefest moments of happiness-a good round of golf, forty minutes of great basketball, a day at the beach with his family, a nice glass of wine-while disaster is seemingly always waiting to strike. It's a fatalistic philosophy, a remnant of his hardscrabble early years, but it's an outlook that has driven him to unparalleled success.In this deeply personal memoir, Geno Auriemma reveals for the first time the man behind the legend. He talks candidly about his coaching style-famed for being one of the most demanding in all the sports world. He spills the beans about his stormy dealings with other coaches such as his archrival, Pat Summitt of the University of Tennessee.

Arguing against those who think Paul was an apostate from Judaism, Nanos maintains Paul's continuity with his Jewish heritage. Several key arguments here are: Those addressed in Paul's letter were still an integral part of the Roman synagogue communities.

This book develops a model of the listener that explains how the listener interprets the chords in a progression. It develops the theory, covering expectation and return, categories of chord types, movement and finality, and mood and stability. It then applies the theory to pop, jazz, and modern music. Why is it that many chord progressions in modern music fail to ignite listener interest? What makes other chord progressions popular? In The Functions of Chords, the author analyzes chords and their impact on the listener in various progressions. His analysis provides a surprising answer to these questions: The function of chords is to convey information. The book explains the sources of the information in chords and what the listener does with that information---in terms every composer and musician will understand. The key to the author's analysis is a new focus on the listener. The author builds a model of the listener to predict how chord progressions affect the audience. He then takes the next step and challenges the composer to heed the listener's response. He provides theoretical explanations of expectation and return, mood, and stability, tritones and conflict, movement and finality. He develops chord types that allow a composer to develop an algorithm. The Functions of Chords not only presents a new theory, but shows how you can apply this theory to pop, jazz, or modern music. The theory can be applied to algorithmic composition and may shed light on the physiology of musical perception.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mkgAAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Functions+of+Chords:+For+Pop,+Jazz,+and+Modern+Styles&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Home at Grasmere: The Wordsworths and the Lakes (The illustrated letters)","description":"This is a collection of the writings of William and Dorothy Wordsworth, Coleridge, De Quincy and others, describing the life of the Wordsworths and their circle when they lived at Grasmere in the Lake District.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-5VqQgAACAAJ&dq=Home+at+Grasmere:+The+Wordsworths+and+the+Lakes+(The+illustrated+letters)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"My Father's Rifle: A Childhood in Kurdistan","description":"A young Kurd comes of age in a war-torn land. This beautiful, spare narrative tells of the life of a boy named Azad--in fact the author, a Kurdish filmmaker--as he grows to manhood in Iraq during the 1960s and 1970s. Azad is born into a vibrant village culture, to a family that is proud of its Kurdish past and hopes for a free Kurdish future. He loves his mother's orchard, his cousin's stunt pigeons, his father's old Czech rifle, his brother who is fighting in the mountains. But before he is even of school age, Azad has experienced strafing and bombing; he watches as friends and neighbors are assassinated; and he sees his father humiliated when he tries to get food for his starving family. Forced into a refugee camp in Iran for years, his family realizes, on their return, that Saddam Hussein and his regime are destroying the autonomy he had promised their people. In a burst of adolescent impatience, Azad briefly runs off to the mountains to fight for Kurdish liberty, like his brother. But Azad has also discovered art--drawings, poetry, film--and he senses that he must find his own way to advance the Kurdish cause. My Father's Rifle ends with his heartbreaking departure from his parents and flight across the Syrian border to freedom. Stunning in its unadorned intensity, My Father's Rifle is a moving portrait of a boy who embraces the land and culture he loves, even as he leaves them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=e2uITaldRgoC&dq=My+Father%27s+Rifle:+A+Childhood+in+Kurdistan&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ten Thousand Light-years from Home","description":"Hunting the deadly canyon cougar in the most remote corner of the Grand Canyon, a buffalo hunter, a forest ranger, a hard-bitten Utah cowboy, and a Navajo scout find themselves in an ultimate fight against a terrifying man-killer.

It has been marked through the years by episodes of drama and comedy, of failure as well as triumph, and by outrageous strokes of luck, deserved and undeserved, and sometimes by human tragedy. It has seen deep intellectual friendships, as well as ferocious animosities, and once in a while acts of theft and malice, deceit, and even a hoax or two. Scientists come in all shapes - the obsessive and the dilettantish, the genial, the envious, the preternaturally brilliant and the slow-witted who sometimes see further in the end, the open-minded and the intolerant, recluses and arrivistes. From the death of Archimedes at the hands of an irritated Roman soldier to the concoction of a superconducting witches' brew at the very close of the twentieth century, the stories in Eurekas and Euphorias pour out, told with wit and relish by Walter Gratzer. Open this book at random and you may chance on the clumsy chemist who breaks a thermometer in a reaction vat and finds mercury to be the catalyst that starts the modern dyestuff industry; or a famous physicist dissolving his gold Nobel Prize medal in acid to prevent it from falling into the hands of the Nazis, recovering it when the war ends; mathematicians and physicists diverting themselves in prison cells, and even in a madhouse, by creating startling advances in their subject. We witness the careers, sometimes tragic, sometimes carefree, of the great women mathematicians, from Hypatia of Alexandria to Sophie Germain in France and Sonia Kovalevskaya in Russia and Sweden, and then Marie Curie's relentless battle with the French Academy. Here, then, a glorious parade unfolds to delight the reader, with stories to astonish, to instruct, and most especially, to entertain.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sTArAZsHejkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Divorcing a Parent: The Healthy Choice for Many Adult Children","description":"Do you come away from contact with your parent with unbearable feelings of rage, low self-esteem and depression?

The poet and the artist battle it out in Rome before a crowd that includes Galileo, a Mary Magdalene, and a generation of popes who would throw the world into flames. In England, Thomas Cromwell and Henry VIII execute Anne Boleyn, and her crafty executioner transforms her legendary locks into those most-sought-after tennis balls. Across the ocean in Mexico, the last Aztec emperors play their own games, as the conquistador Hern n Cort s and his Mayan translator and lover, La Malinche, scheme and conquer, fight and f**k, not knowing that their domestic comedy will change the course of history. In a remote Mexican colony a bishop reads Thomas More s Utopia and thinks that it s a manual instead of a parody. And in today s New York City, a man searches for answers to impossible questions, for a book that is both an archive and an oracle.  lvaro Enrigue s mind-bending story features assassinations and executions, hallucinogenic mushrooms, bawdy criminals, carnal liaisons and papal schemes, artistic and religious revolutions, love and war.

The perils are great. In The Eye of War, Antoine Bousquet provides both a sweeping historical overview of military perception technologies and a disquieting lens on a world that is, increasingly, one in which anything or anyone that can be perceived can be destroyed in which to see is to destroy. Arguing that modern-day global targeting is dissolving the conventionally bounded spaces of armed conflict, Bousquet shows that over several centuries, a logistical order of militarized perception has come into ascendancy, bringing perception and annihilation into ever-closer alignment. The efforts deployed to evade this deadly visibility have correspondingly intensified, yielding practices of radical concealment that presage a wholesale disappearance of the customary space of the battlefield. Beginning with the Renaissance s fateful discovery of linear perspective, The Eye of War discloses the entanglement of the sciences and techniques of perception, representation, and localization in the modern era amid the perpetual quest for military superiority. In a survey that ranges from the telescope, aerial photograph, and gridded map to radar, digital imaging, and the geographic information system, Bousquet shows how successive technological systems have profoundly shaped the history of warfare and the experience of soldiering. A work of grand historical sweep and remarkable analytical power, The Eye of War explores the implications of militarized perception for the character of war in the twenty-first century and the place of human subjects within its increasingly technical armature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uCp0DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Not So Basic New Hire Orientation","description":"An effective new employee orientation program can mean the difference between a happy and committed employee, and a disgruntled and non-productive employee.

Every spring, millions of geese embark on an arduous three-thousand-mile homeward journey from their winter quarters in the southern United States to their breeding grounds in the Canadian Arctic. One year William Fiennes, recovering from a long illness, decided to go with them. Intrigued by what he d read about the birds  extraordinary annual journey, he was also desperate to escape the depression that had dogged his convalescence, and the belief that at age twenty-six, his life had ground to a halt. Part memoir, part nature study, part travelogue, the story of Fiennes s journey is not just about geese. It s about homecoming: the birds on their long trip home, the pull of nostalgia, the urge to leave home and the even stronger urge to return. Fiennes is a gifted natural writer with a distinctive voice that is deeply thoughtful, wry and keenly observant. His book vibrates with ideas, with stories and anecdotes, with humankind as well as wild fowl. The joy of being alive, being on the move and  above all  going home are poignantly captured in this intelligent, exuberant book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0ISYaOkqnaIC&dq=The+Snow+Geese:+A+Story+of+Home&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"We Cry Out: Living with Developmental Disabilities","description":"How does a developmental disability affect an individual throughout the course of life?

In this volume the author weaves together an array of fresh perspectives on clause structure, constructions, interactional linguistics, cognitive science and complex dynamic systems to construct a grammar of spoken Chinese. The volume contains discussions of a large number of topics: contiguity relation, the roles of repair strategies in the shaping of constituent structure, non-canonical word order constructions, pragmatics of referring expressions, classifier constructions, noun-modifying constructions, verb complementation, ethnotheory of the person and constructions specific to the language of emotion, sequential sensitivity of linguistic materials, meaning potential in interaction, the nature of variability and stability in Chinese syntax from the perspective of complexity theory. The result is a volume that highlights the connections between language structure, situated and embodied nature of cognition and language use, and affords a true entr e to the exciting realm of Chinese grammar.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=GepFAgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Your Sacred Self","description":"The bestselling author of Your Erroneous Zones, Pulling Your Own Strings, and Wisdom of the Ages combines psychological insights and guidelines for achieving spiritual fulfillment to present a three-step program designed to help readers look inside themselves to find a new sense of self-awareness and spiritual joy.

Step by step, Dyer shows us how to progress from emotional awareness to psychological insight to spiritual alternatives in order to change our experience of life from the need to acquire to a sense of abundance; from a sense of one's self as sinful and inferior to a sense of one's self as divine; from a need to achieve and acquire to an awareness that detachment and letting go bring freedom.

Bugbee s writings are remarkably different in form and register from anything written in twentieth-century American Philosophy. The beautifully written essays collected here show Bugbee s continuing commitment that  anyone who throws his entire personality into his work must to some extent adopt an aesthetic attitude and medium.  Together, the book reintroduces a major thinker of nature, an environmental philosopher avant la lettre who has much to contribute to American and continental thought.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DZWUDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"AN ESSAY ON THE NATURE AND CONDUCT OF THE PASSIONS AND AFFECTIONS: WITH ILLUSTRATIONS ON THE MORAL SENSE (THIRD EDITION, 1742).","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HyEUMwEACAAJ&dq=AN+ESSAY+ON+THE+NATURE+AND+CONDUCT+OF+THE+PASSIONS+AND+AFFECTIONS:+WITH+ILLUSTRATIONS+ON+THE+MORAL+SENSE+(THIRD+EDITION,+1742).&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Active Network Design (International Series in Signal Processing and Filtering)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SgVtAAAAIAAJ&dq=Active+Network+Design+(International+Series+in+Signal+Processing+and+Filtering)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chess openings : ideas & analysis ;: King's pawn openings, three knights' game","description":"Not a list of moves, but simple and logical explanations of opening systems.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=c61mna53jdwC&dq=Chess+openings+:+ideas&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Feast of Peonies","description":"This novel is set in present day Chicago.

Stanley Kubrick's 1968 film 2001: A Space Odyssey famously featured HAL, a computer with the ability to hold lengthy conversations with his fellow space travelers. More than forty years later, we have advanced computer technology that Kubrick never imagined, but we do not have computers that talk and understand speech as HAL did. Is it a failure of our technology that we have not gotten much further than an automated voice that tells us to  say or press 1 ? Or is there something fundamental in human language and speech that we do not yet understand deeply enough to be able to replicate in a computer? In The Voice in the Machine, Roberto Pieraccini examines six decades of work in science and technology to develop computers that can interact with humans using speech and the industry that has arisen around the quest for these technologies. He shows that although the computers today that understand speech may not have HAL's capacity for conversation, they have capabilities that make them usable in many applications today and are on a fast track of improvement and innovation. Pieraccini describes the evolution of speech recognition and speech understanding processes from waveform methods to artificial intelligence approaches to statistical learning and modeling of human speech based on a rigorous mathematical model specifically, Hidden Markov Models (HMM). He details the development of dialog systems, the ability to produce speech, and the process of bringing talking machines to the market. Finally, he asks a question that only the future can answer: will we end up with HAL-like computers or something completely unexpected?","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3NjxCwAAQBAJ&dq=Database+Backed+Web+Sites:+The+Thinking+Person%27s+Guide+to+Web+Publishing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The path to Rome,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dtqIngEACAAJ&dq=The+path+to+Rome,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Best of Absolute Makos Postcard Book (Bruno Gmunder Postcardbooks)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=He0DwQEACAAJ&dq=Best+of+Absolute+Makos+Postcard+Book+(Bruno+Gmunder+Postcardbooks)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Suicide Charlie: A Vietnam War Story","description":"Suicide Charlie: the bastard infantry company that fought where the combat was bloodiest. Norman Russell was nineteen, a sportswriter for a small-town newspaper, when he was drafted for the Vietnam War and landed in the army's hottest spot as an infantryman in the 25th Division. Charlie Company, better known as \\"Suicide Charlie,\\" had earned its nickname. Mole City was their next assignment. A combat patrol base smack in the middle of the enemy's resupply route off the Ho Chi Minh Trail into South Vietnam, Mole City was a sitting duck designed to provoke the NVA forces across the border. Outmanned and overrun, Charlie Company barely survived the furious onslaught as mortars, rockets, and rocket-propelled grenades rained down, shrapnel exploded all around, and bullets screamed overhead. For Russell, whose own father committed suicide after returning from infantry duty in World War II, it marked his \\"acquaintance with the Devil\\" -- and the beginning of a remarkable journey through the despair and depravity of war, the camaraderie that made the horror almost endurable, and the torturous questions that lingered long after his tour of duty in Vietnam.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=TosBEoC-pJoC&dq=Suicide+Charlie:+A+Vietnam+War+Story&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Realms of Gold","description":"English archaeologist Frances Wingate, divorced mother of four, and distinguished scholar Karel Schmidt, selfless and marriage-imprisoned, stay-at-home, come inexorably together once more after years of on-again, off-again romance","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AJXZvgEACAAJ&dq=The+Realms+of+Gold&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Black Woman's Guide to Beautiful Hair: A Positive Approach to Managing any Hair Type and Style","description":"Presents a program for African American women to take care of their hair and scalp.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZjgFsNqNvIIC&dq=The+Black+Woman%27s+Guide+to+Beautiful+Hair:+A+Positive+Approach+to+Managing+any+Hair+Type+and+Style&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THAIS","description":"Why does a Thai smile at you after crashing into the back of your car?

In the poignant and humorous essay On Being Ill, Virginia Woolf observes that though illness is a part of every human being's experience, it is not celebrated as a subject of great literature in the way that love and war are embraced by writers and readers. We must, Woolf says, invent a new language to describe pain. Illness, she observes, enhances our perceptions and reduces self-consciousness; it is \\"the great confessional.\\" Woolf discusses the taboos associated with illness and she explores how it changes our relationship to the world around us. Notes from Sick Rooms addresses illness from the caregiver's perspective. With clarity, humor, and pathos, Julia Stephen offers concrete and useful information to caregivers today. Originally published by Paris Press in 2002 as On Being Ill, this paperback edition includes an introduction to Notes from Sick Rooms and to Julia Stephen by Mark Hussey, the founding editor of Woolf Studies Annual, and a poignant afterword by Rita Charon, MD, the founder of the field of Narrative Medicine. Hermione Lee's brilliant introduction to On Being Ill is a superb introduction to Virginia Woolf's life and writing.

Maris of Amberly, a fisherman s daughter, wants nothing more than to soar on the currents high above Windhaven. So she challenges tradition, demanding that flyers be chosen by merit rather than inheritance. But even after winning that bitter battle, Maris finds that her troubles are only beginning.

They are a journey of one woman, and the many she. She of the stories resists a name. She doesn't really' know why but she honors her knowing anyway. She simply invites each she to emerge as they bubble up inside of her as she travels along and alone on this fifteen day trip. As she travels, she recognizes common themes, patterns, her thinking. She also learns to trust a feeling energy versus a thinking energy to lead her forward and help her in her choices. This feeling energy helps her make connections to the humanity all around her. Beyond the barriers of language is a silent language: the language of the smile, of softness, of warmth and the language to bridge to one other. Her selves emerge and as she observes them and their thought-filled ways, they fall away quietly, unleashing something unexpected at the end of her trip. There is a silent agreement that we all have to release this. The She Stories are for those who wonder about their own workings, wherever they are in their life. All of us have many selves that live inside of us and to root them out, we must be very intentional as we move in relationship within the world. It seems we must do this alone, yet know that we are never alone. Where does one begin their quest? .to better know one's own process? better find one's own way? .become aware of what one is drawn to? It seems through a non-linear inner listening process--a continual exploration and reflection of the self in everyday living as well as in new places and with new people. Importantly, to become aware of our own process through the stories we tell ourselves.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zf8IX1k7ytkC&dq=What%27s+Wrong+with+Black+Women%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Idol Season 3: All Access (Prima's Official Fan Book)","description":"The Bachelor's Guide To Life is jam-packed with detailed information and answers to common questions that every single guy has as they strive to achieve happiness and success.

It was from my family that I learned children come first and elders are to be respected, that I learned to give care and solace to those in need, to be thankful always and to give and receive affection often, to live up to my word and duty and to forgive, forget, have fun, and to never miss a chance to tell someone, 'I love you.' It is my family that I think about when in moments of reflection I ask myself what I am worth, what I have done with my life, and what I am going to do tomorrow.\\" - Best-selling author Gregory E. Lang Building a happy, healthy family is a high priority for most of us these days. In Why We are a Family Lang celebrates his family and all families with the traditions, togetherness, and lasting fellowship that strengthens everyone in them. He sees that love is what holds a family together and makes it strong by providing a reservoir of strength and comfort for every member to draw from. Born into a large, loving family, Lang counts his blessings every day for the support and affection his extended family brings to his life. Because of the strong ties that bind his family together, he has no trouble outlining what it means to be a family. From \\"We help one another, but we don't keep score\\" to \\"We love to sit together and reminisce,\\" his 100 reasons for why a family is a family will ring true for families of all kinds. With photographs of families by varying sizes and backgrounds, Why We are a Family affirms all that is good about one of the basic building blocks of our lives and the world around us.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WA2CAZBTwUsC&dq=Why+We+Are+a+Family:+100+Reasons&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bruce Davidson: Subway","description":"This volume presents Bruce Davidson's personal selections from his lesser-known color archive. Ranging from a period of fifty-six years and counting, these images are representative of the photographer's color career. Assignments from various magazines (Vogue, National Geographic, Life magazine) and commercial projects led him to photograph fashion (early 1960s), the Shah of Iran with his family (1964), keepers of French monuments (1988), the supermodel Kylie Bax (1997), and college cheerleaders (1989). He photographed in India and China, but also at home in New York, in Chicago, and along the Pacific Coast Highway. In 1968, Michelangelo Antonioni invited him to document the making of his film Zabriskie Point. Davidson also continued to pursue personal projects, e.g. photographing the Yiddish writer and Nobel Prize laureate Isaac Bashevis Singer (1972-75), the New York City subway (1980), and Katz's Delicatessen (2004). Often staying on in a country after an official assignment, he documented Welsh coalfields, family holidays in Martha's Vineyard, and travelled through Patagonia and Mexico.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aA9FnQEACAAJ&dq=Bruce+Davidson:+Subway&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Practical Guide to Witchcraft and Magick Spells","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HQaMjwEACAAJ&dq=A+Practical+Guide+to+Witchcraft+and+Magick+Spells&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The philosophy of physical science (Ann Arbor paperbacks)","description":"Modem philosophy of science has turned out to be a Pandora's box. Once opened, the puzzling monsters appeared: not only was the neat structure of classical physics radically changed, but a variety of broader questions were let loose, bearing on the nature of scientific inquiry and of human knowledge in general. Philosophy of science could not help becoming epistemological and historical, and could no longer avoid metaphysical questions, even when these were posed in disguise. Once the identification of scientific methodology with that of physics had been queried, not only did biology and psychology come under scrutiny as major modes of scientific inquiry, but so too did history and the social sciences - particularly economics, sociology and anthropology. And now, new 'monsters' are emerging - for example, medicine and political science as disciplined inquiries. This raises anew a much older question, namely whether the conception of science is to be distinguished from a wider conception of learning and inquiry? Or is science to be more deeply understood as the most adequate form of learning and inquiry, whose methods reach every domain of rational thought? Is modern science matured reason, or is it simply one historically adapted and limited species of western reason? In our colloquia at Boston University, over the past fourteen years, we have been probing and testing the scope of philosophy of science.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=qfvtCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Worlds of the imperium","description":"American diplomat Brion Bayard is on assignment in Stockholm when he notices he's being shadowed.

William A. Wallace seems to have a historical grasp which will have to be matched by any further workers: he sees directly into Galileo's primary epoch of intellectual formation, the sixteenth century. In this volume, Wallace provides the companion to his splendid annotated translation of Galileo 's Early Notebooks: The Physical Questions (University of Notre Dame Press, 1977), pointing to the 'realist' sources, mainly unearthed by the author himself during the past two decades. Explicit controversy arises, for the issues are serious: nominalism and realism, two early rivals for the foundation of knowledge, contend at the birth of modem science, OI better yet, contend in our modem efforts to understand that birth. Related to this, continuity and discontinuity, so opposed to each other, are interwoven in the interpretive writings ever since those striking works of Duhem in the first years of this century, and the later studies of Annaliese Maier, Alexandre Koyre and E. A. Moody. Historio grapher as well as philosopher, WaUace has critically supported the continuity of scientific development without abandoning the revolutionary transforma tive achievement of Galileo's labors. That continuity had its contemporary as well as developmental quality; and we note that William Wallace's Prelude studies are complementary to Maurice A.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=V3frCAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mel Bay Juan Serrano/Flamenco Guitar Solos Book/CD Set","description":"This is a superb collection of 8 original flamenco concert guitar solos and two exciting guitar quartets. the selections feature Juan Serrano's usual technical brilliance and capture the vitality, fire and haunting Moorish moods characteristic of flamenco music.

At that time, criminology was a very limited activity, depending almost exclusively on the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) initiated by the FBI in 1929 for measurement of crime based on victim reports to the police and on police arrests. A ty- cal mode of analysis was simple bivariate correlation. Marvin Wolfgang and colleagues were makingan importantadvancebytrackinglongitudinaldata onarrestsin Philadelphia,an in- vation that was widely appreciated. And the ?eld was very small: I remember attending my ?rst meeting of the American Society of Criminology in about 1968 in an anteroom at New York University; there were about 2530 people in attendance, mostly sociologists with a few lawyers thrown in. That Society today has over 3,000 members, mostly now drawn from criminology which has established its own clear identity, but augmented by a wide variety of disciplines that include statisticians, economists, demographers, and even a few engineers. This Handbook provides a remarkable testimony to the growth of that ?eld. Following the maxim that  if you can t measure it, you can t understand it,  we have seen the early dissatisfaction with the UCR replaced by a wide variety of new approaches to measuring crime victimization and offending.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JmKeDAEACAAJ&dq=Criminology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Death and Life of Superman","description":"On November 18, 1992, news of Superman's death shocked the world as the legendary Man of Steel was killed defending Metropolis from the monster called Doomsday.

Bearing in mind that doing discourse analysis without a contrastive base is as incomplete as doing contrastive analysis without a discourse base, the specific aim of this book is to argue that translation can add depth and breadth to both contrastive linguistics as well as to discourse analysis. Authentic data from both spoken and written English is used throughout to add clarity to theoretical insights gained from the study of discourse processing. Each aspect of the model proposed for the analysis of texts is related separately to a problem of language processing and in domains as varied as translation, interpreting, language teaching etc. The global objectives pursued in this volume are the training of future linguists and the sensitization of users of language in general to the realities of discourse.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=lkoAnwEACAAJ&dq=Communication+Across+Cultures:+Translation+Theory&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Do You Want it Good or Tuesday?: From Hammer Films to Hollywood: A Life in the Movies","description":"Jimmy Sangster proves the pen is mightier than the stake as he reflects upon his film career from his early apprenticeship in the British film industry to Hammer Films mainstay and then to a stint in Hollywood and television. \\"Mr. Sangster's autobiography is written with the same flair that made him a successful and respected film writer, as he takes us on a witty, informative and honest ride from Hammer Horror to American network television.\\"--Tom Johnson, author Hammer Films: An Exhaustive Filmography","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hzsIAQAAMAAJ&dq=Do+You+Want+it+Good+or+Tuesday%3F:+From+Hammer+Films+to+Hollywood:+A+Life+in+the+Movies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Roland Barthes (Routledge Critical Thinkers)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ZLQStAEACAAJ&dq=Roland+Barthes+(Routledge+Critical+Thinkers)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"William the Outlaw","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_tlYtQAACAAJ&dq=William+the+Outlaw&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"PFC Programmer's Reference Manual","description":"This comprehensive guide to the PowerBuilder Foundation Classes lists all the objects and functions that a programmer might use for a project including notes on each function.

As public outrage grows, the U.S. Border Patrol assigns their special agent Brian Hudson the task of solving the mystery surrounding her death and saving the agency from further embarrassment in the court of public opinion. Brian s investigation, initially stifled by internal bureaucracy, corruption and deception, lurches into a frenzied jumpstart when one of the trafficked, scorned and discarded victims, Ekamon Jansuk, squeezes through a barely audible distress call from her hiding place in a barricaded house in an affluent northern California suburb. In San Francisco, Lynn Chidu is forced to choose between jail time and succumbing to sexual harassment, thanks to administrative irregularities uncovered by a senior corporate executive with a history of female molestation. Lynn opts to become a corporate spy at the urging of human rights activist Robin Kirchoff, who suspects that Lynn s employer is a front for a worldwide high-tech human trafficking ring; whose intrusive and pervasive cutting edge technology aids crime families and organizations around the world to traffic women for every conceivable use and debased exploitation. To rescue thousands of trafficked women conned and entrapped against their will across the U.S., Brian, Lynn, and Robin will have to risk their lives to outwit a management team bent on cornering the ten billion-dollar human trafficking industry and changing the rules of U.S. border enforcement.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zCzbAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"She Who Changes: Re-imagining the Divine in the World","description":"Can we re-imagine divine power as deeply related to the changing world? Can we re-imagine the creation of the world as an ongoing process of co-creation in which every individual from particles of atoms to human beings plays a part? Can we re-imagine Goddess/God as the most relational of all relational beings? Can we re-imagine the world as the body of Goddess/God? If we can, then we can understand the deeper meaning of female images of divine power, including Goddess, God-She, Sophia, and Shekhina. Many traditional understandings of divine power begin with thinly disguised rejections of the female body and connection to the natural world. Women theologians from Jewish, Christian, Goddess, and other traditions are re-imagining divine and human power as embodied, embedded in a changing world, and deeply related to all beings in the web of life. Drawing on the work of process philosopher Charles Hartshorne - whose insights deserve a wider hearing - Carol P. Christ offers intellectual foundations for deeply held feelings about the meanings of female images of divine power. Her gift is the ability to make complex ideas seem simple and radically new ideas seem familiar. This book is addressed to everyone who has ever wondered about the implications of re-imagining God as female.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nz0GDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Appetites, a novel (A William Abrahms Book)","description":"Glynnis McCullough, terribly drunk, quarrels with her husband Ian and falls through a window to her death--an accident leading to his conviction on a murder charge and their suburban community's shock","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Lx1bAAAAMAAJ&dq=American+Appetites,+a+novel+(A+William+Abrahms+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Optical Resonators: Fundamentals, Advanced Concepts and Applications","description":"Optical Resonators provides a detailed discussion of the properties of optical resonators for lasers from basic theory to recent research.

Short stories often begin \\"in medias res,\\" which means that the reader is \\"thrown\\" directly into the action of the story, without being elaborately informed about the earlier events. This effects a steady build up of tension and calls the reader's attention. In addition to that, this species of narrative writing usually contains an open ending or a surprising twist at the end. Instead of detailed descriptions, insinuations and sketchiness dominate, consequently the style of writing is to some extent laconic. The language can be considered to be unostentatious and simple, and so are most of the protagonists. Moreover, short stories deal with a short period of time, mostly merely a few days or weeks. Besides, this genre often deals with conflicts (either interior or exterior), a sudden turning point in peoples life or frontier experiences. In this context, the essay juxtaposes Philip MacCann's \\"A Drive\\" and Frank O'Connor's \\"Guests of the Nation\\" concerning several aspects such as themes, point of view, language, style and characterization, whereas the last chapter contains a brief summary.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0FvdtHjMOWgC&dq=Guests+of+the+Nation&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Forensic Anthropology (Inside Forensic Science)","description":"An essential supplement to a forensic anthropology text, this reader provides case studies that demonstrate innovative approaches and practical experiences in the field.

Having been nurtured by the sharply constrasting legacies of China and Portugal, this unique city manages to meld cultural differences and avoid the destructiveness of ethnic clashes. It is thus likened here to the Roman deity Janus, who is usually depicted with two faces looking in opposite directions. By concentrating on the ambivalent history of Macau, the author reveals the historical reality of cultural vacillation between two political entities and the emergence of a creole minority - the Macanese. With a judicious use of English, Chinese, and Portuguese sources, she has provided a pathbreaking, multi-focal perspective of the last Portuguese outpost in Asia. In light of the 'decolonization' of Macau in December 1999, the author's analysis challenges the easy assumptions of the causal sequence: colonialism/postcolonialism, and opens up an interdisciplinary purview of a local instance in cross-cultural studies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mOEZBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Essential Chihuahua (Essential (Howell))","description":"Total care, training, companionship, feeding and grooming your dog.

Ten years ago, an FBI investigation in conjunction with the U.S. Attorney s Office in the Southern District of New York was about to expose a scandal in the art world that would have been front-page news in New York and London. After a trail of fake paintings of astonishing quality led federal agents to art dealers, renowned experts, and the major auction houses, the investigation inexplicably ended, despite an abundance of evidence collected. The case was closed and the FBI file was marked  exempt from public disclosure.  Now that the statute of limitations on these crimes has expired and the case appears hermetically sealed shut by the FBI, this book, Caveat Emptor, is Ken Perenyi s confession. It is the story, in detail, of how he pulled it all off. Glamorous stories of art-world scandal have always captured the public imagination. However, not since Clifford Irving s 1969 bestselling Fake has there been a story at all like this one. Caveat Emptor is unique in that it is the first and only book by and about America s first and only great art forger. And unlike other forgers, Perenyi produced no paper trail, no fake provenance whatsoever; he let the paintings speak for themselves. And that they did, routinely mesmerizing the experts in mere seconds. In the tradition of Frank Abagnale s Catch Me If You Can, and certain to be a bombshell for the major international auction houses and galleries, here is the story of America s greatest art forger.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=8V8RmFasm5oC&dq=Caveat+Emptor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pig Book: How Government Wastes Your Money","description":"The federal government wastes your tax dollars worse than a drunken sailor on shore leave.

Brian Karas with the Henry Wadsworth Longfellow classic. His brow is wet with honest sweat; He earns whate'er he can, And looks the whole world in the face, For he owes not any man. The neighborhood blacksmith is a quiet and unassuming presence, tucked in his smithy under the chestnut tree. Sturdy, generous, and with sadness of his own, he toils through the day, passing on the tools of his trade, and come evening, takes a well-deserved rest. Longfellow's timeless poem is enhanced by G. Brian Karas's thoughtful and contemporary art in this modern retelling of the tender tale of a humble craftsman.

The Prayer of St. Francis boldly but gently challenges us to resist the forces of evil and negativity with the spirit of goodwill and generosity. And Nerburn shows, in his wonderfully personal and humble way, how we each can live out the prayer's prescription for living in our everyday and less-than-saintly lives. \\"Where there is hatred, let me sow love...Where there is injury, let me sow pardon...\\" Expanding upon each line of the St. Francis Prayer, Nerburn shares touching, inspiring stories from his own experience and that of others and reveals how each of us can make a difference for good in ordinary ways without being heroes or saints. Struggling to help a young son comfort his best friend when his mother dies, moved by the courage of war enemies who reconcile, being wrenched out of self-absorbed depression by responding to someone else's tragedy, taking a spirited old lady on a farewell taxi ride through her town-these are the kinds of everyday moments in which Nerburn finds we can live out the spirit of St. Francis. By incorporating the power and grace of these few lines of practical idealism into our thoughts and deeds, we can begin to ease our own suffering-and the suffering of those with whom we share our lives. And, remarkably, find a way to true peace and happiness by tapping into our basic human goodness. As we open our hearts and embrace his words, St. Francis \\"touches our deepest humanity and ignites the spark of our divinity.\\" Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace. Where there is hatred let me sow love, Where there is injury let me sow pardon, Where there is doubt, faith, Where there is despair, hope, Where there is darkness, light, And where there is sadness, joy... In this beautifully written book, Kent Nerburn leads us into the heart of the St. Francis Prayer and line by line demonstrates how St. Francis's words can resonate in our lives today.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=29jrP6CASP0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The big goose and the little white duck","description":"A boy brings home a pet goose for his mother's birthday present, but grandfather threatens to eat it at his own eighty-eighth birthday dinner.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=PU7hAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+big+goose+and+the+little+white+duck&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Raven's Gathering: Bard IV","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=P1Q2NQAACAAJ&dq=Raven%27s+Gathering:+Bard+IV&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ready for College: Everything You Need to Know","description":"Create programs that prepare students for college, careers, and the new and challenging assessments of the Common Core State Standards Written for all educators but with an emphasis on those at the secondary level, this important resource shows how to develop programs that truly prepare students for both the Common Core assessments and for college and career readiness.

These are the homes of the earliest settlers, statesmen, frontiersmen, great writers, artists, architects, and industrial magnates. These are the places, carefully saved and preserved, that represent a cultural heritage. Despite their popularity, it is not uncommon to find museums that are in poor repair, their collections neglected and their staffs grossly overworked. Many are run by well-meaning and hard-working volunteers who have little or no professional training. Often they survive on shoestring budgets and are able to present only limited programs. Serving both as a hands-on guide and reference, this book examines these problems, offering practical advice and solutions which can be easily implemented. Its useful \\"lessons\\" include governance, where to find help, care of collections, conservation, security, and interpretation--all designed to increase the professionalism of the historic house museum.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TERgaqn74ZQC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Steve Mizerak's Winning Pool Tips","description":"The celebrated master of the game shares his own personal tips, strategies, and advice on improving every aspect of your game.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=xm4Bc5lGsPAC&dq=Steve+Mizerak%27s+Winning+Pool+Tips&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rise of the Agricultural Welfare State: Institutions and Interest Group Power in the United States, France, and Japan (Princeton Studies in American Politics)","description":"A long-dominant reading of American politics holds that public policy in the United States is easily captured by special interest groups. Countering this view, Adam Sheingate traces the development of government intervention in agriculture from its nineteenth-century origins to contemporary struggles over farm subsidies. His considered conclusion is that American institutions have not given agricultural interest groups any particular advantages in the policy process, in part because opposing lobbies also enjoy access to policymakers. In fact, the high degree of conflict and pluralism maintained by American institutions made possible substantial retrenchment of the agricultural welfare state during the 1980s and 1990s. In Japan and France--two countries with markedly different institutional characters than the United States--powerful agricultural interests and a historically close relationship between farmers, bureaucrats, and politicians continue to preclude a roll-back of farm subsidies. This well-crafted study not only puts a new spin on agricultural policy, but also makes a strong case for the broader claim that the relatively decentralized American political system is actually less prone to capture and rule by subgovernments than the more centralized political systems found in France and Japan. Sheingate's historical, comparative approach also demonstrates, in a widely useful way, how past institutional developments shape current policies and options.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3lUgEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essays (Penguin Classics)","description":"One of the greatest philosophers of the nineteenth century, Schopenhauer (1788-1860) believed that human action is determined not by reason but by 'will' - the blind and irrational desire for physical existence. This selection of his writings on religion, ethics, politics, women, suicide, books and many other themes is taken from Schopenhauer's last work, Parerga and Paralipomena, which he published in 1851. These pieces depict humanity as locked in a struggle beyond good and evil, and each individual absolutely free within a Godless world, in which art, morality and self-awareness are our only salvation. This innovative - and pessimistic - view has proved powerfully influential upon philosophy and art, directly affecting the work of Nietzsche, Wittgenstein and Wagner among others.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EWt_5YLqHcAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ending Affirmative Action: The Case For Colorblind Justice","description":"In the 1960s, we resolved as a nation never to judge people by the color of their skin.

How, asks Terry Eastland, did such a turnabout take place, and how can we restore colorblind law in America today? In this compelling and powerful book, Eastland lays bare the absurdities and injustices of affirmative action, and presents the strongest case to date for doing away with race-based and gender-based preferences a ringing call for all Americans to reclaim our nation's shared values of equal protection under the law, without reference to race, color, creed, gender, or national origin.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_jGUWshEkdgC&dq=Ending+Affirmative+Action:+The+Case+For+Colorblind+Justice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Girardet: Recipes from a Master of French Cuisine","description":"Over 100 classic recipes are presented in the first English-language edition of this cookbook from one of the grand patriarchs of French cuisine.

Every year something violent seems to happen to him. His psychologist is baffled, and his mother lives in constant panic. He has always managed to survive-to land on his feet, like a cat. But cats have only nine lives, and Louis has used up eight, one for every year.. When he falls off a cliff during a picnic, the accident seems almost predestined. Louis miraculously survives-but the family has been shattered. Louis' father has vanished, his mother is in shock, and Louis lies in a deep coma from which he may never emerge. In a renowned coma clinic, a specialist tries to coax Louis back to consciousness.

These lectures are the first extensive application of Husserl's newly developed genetic phenomenology to perceptual experience and to the way in which it is connected to judgments and cognition. They include an historical reflection on the crisis of contemporary thought and human spirit, provide an archaeology of experience by questioning back into sedimented layers of meaning, and sketch the genealogy of judgment in \`active synthesis'. Drawing upon everyday events and personal experiences, the Analyses are marked by a patient attention to the subtle emergence of sense in our lives. By advancing a phenomenology of association that treats such phenomena as bodily kinaesthesis, temporal genesis, habit, affection, attention, motivation, and the unconscious, Husserl explores the cognitive dimensions of the body in its affectively significant surroundings. An elaboration of these diverse modes of evidence and their modalizations (transcendental aesthetic), allows Husserl to trace the origin of truth up to judicative achievements (transcendental logic). Joined by several of Husserl's essays on static and genetic method, the Analyses afford a richness of description unequalled by the majority of Husserl's works available to English readers. Students of phenomenology and of Husserl's thought will find this an indispensable work.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rSZrCQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Maternity the Musical!: Funny Songs About Cravings, Sonograms, and Everything Else an Expectant Mom's Got or Gonna Get","description":"If motherhood is a sorority, then pregnancy is its nine-month hazing ritual.

He shows how unquestioning faith in market forces blinds us to crucial instabilities, and how those instabilities have chain-reacted to cause the current crisis a crisis that has the potential to get much, much worse.

Once we understand the fears, frustrations and loyalties that sabotage our dreams and best efforts at personal growth, we can free ourselves from doubt and defeat and find out what we really want to do with our lives. Who You Were Meant to Be explains how to use our inner guidance to find our most personal and energizing life purpose. Writing in a friendly, active style, psychologist Lindsay Gibson shows us how to get free of the misguided guilt and loyalty that confuse loving others with sacrificing oneself. We can undo self-defeating ideas and claim our right to happiness and autonomy in our life choices.

Oden make the case that there is a significant theological consensus holding the evangelical church together. With copious citations from statements produced since 1950 that are widely representative of international evangelical faith, Packer and Oden let these witnesses speak for themselves.Packer and Oden survey several key documents of evangelicalism, particularly the Lausanne Covenant (1974), the Manila Manifesto (1989), The Gospel of Jesus Christ: An Evangelical Celebration (1999) and The Amsterdam Declaration (2000). Charting sixteen different theological themes, they also include references to numerous documents produced by evangelical theological seminaries and societies, mission agencies, parachurch organizations and assorted special convocations. More than informational, One Faith arises out of the hope that it may not only edify the evangelical church but also provide a potential foundation for a new ecumenism that gives glory to the God of our Lord Jesus Christ according to the good news of his gospel.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RustYh6trHAC&dq=One+Faith:+The+Evangelical+Consensus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Presentations Made Easy","description":"Offers strategies and warm-up exercises for helping students speak in front of a group.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ANX6BTlF38gC&dq=Presentations+Made+Easy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Monster in the House (Picture Books (Dominique & Friends))","description":"A little girl explains why she thinks her baby brother is really a monster.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cJ0JAAAACAAJ&dq=A+Monster+in+the+House+(Picture+Books+(Dominique&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"God's Workmanship","description":"We cannot know God, in depth without recognizing and acknowledging His absolute, glorious sovereignty over all things, in all times, and in every aspect of our lives.

It may seem contradictory that Buddhist teachers Kulananda and Dominic Houlder have also been highly successful in the business arena, but they have learned that Buddhist teachings do not require a life of poverty, and can indeed go hand-in-hand with wealth and prosperity. Mindfulness and Money brings to light the teachings of Buddha as they apply to the money part of life, and shares the stories of others who have found the Buddhist path to freedom, creativity, and abundance. Using the Buddhist Wheel of Life as a starting point, the authors explore the mechanism by which desire for money and material things is confining, and how mastery of desire can free us to live peacefully with our finances. Kulananda and Houlder offer five precepts for living on the Path of Abundance, including kindness, generosity, contentment, honesty, and awareness. Through prescriptive meditations, reflections, and exercises, we can begin to earn and spend more purposefullythe key to finding financial peace, whatever one s income. An enlightening combination of practical wisdom and spirituality, Mindfulness and Money is a valuable asset for all seekers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iUx7DasisakC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE SILENT GONDOLIERS.","description":"Recounts the story of Luigi the Gondolier and the secret of the sudden silence of the singing gondoliers of Venice's Grand Canal.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wmRi-ecIRJkC&dq=THE+SILENT+GONDOLIERS.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mackenzie on time: How to save two hours a day","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GJG3IAAACAAJ&dq=Mackenzie+on+time:+How+to+save+two+hours+a+day&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Smoke-Screen","description":"From the leading authority on marijuana a man who has served as White House advisor on drugs to three different administrations and who NBC News once called  the prodigy of drug politics\\" comes the remarkable and shocking expos  about how 21st century pot, today s new and highly potent form of the drug, is on the rise, spreading rapidly across America by an industry intent on putting rising profits over public health. Smokescreen: What the Marijuana Industry Doesn't Want You to Know examines the inside story behind the headlines, containing accounts from Sabet s time in the Obama administration to stunning revelations from whistleblowers speaking out for the first time. What it finds is how the marijuana industry is running rampant without proper oversight, leaving Americans  health seriously at risk. Included are interviews with industry insiders who reveal the hidden dangers of a product they had once worshipped. Also contained in these pages are insights from a major underground-market dealer who admits that legalization is hastening the growth of the illicit drug trade. And more to the heart of the issue are the tragic stories of those who have suffered and died as a result of marijuana use, and in many cases, as a result of its mischaracterization. Readers will learn how power brokers worked behind the scenes to market marijuana as a miracle plant in order to help it gain widespread acceptance and to set the stage for the lucrative expansion of recreational pot. The author of this compelling first-person narrative leading the national fight against the legalization of cannabis through his nonprofit, Smart Approaches to Marijuana (aka SAM) is Kevin Sabet. As a policy advisor to everyone from county health commissioners to Pope Francis, and a frequent public speaker on television, radio and through other media outlets, his analysis is consistently relied upon by those who recognize what s at stake as marijuana lobbyists downplay the risks of massive commercialization. A book several years in the making, filled with vivid characters and informed by hundreds of interviews and scores of confidential documents, Sabet's Smokescreen lays bare the unvarnished truth about marijuana in America.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mDcPEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE AGE OF MIRACLES","description":"NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY People ? O: The Oprah Magazine ? Financial Times ? Kansas City Star ? BookPage ? Kirkus Reviews ? Publishers Weekly ? Booklist With a voice as distinctive and original as that of The Lovely Bones, and for the fans of the speculative fiction of Margaret Atwood, Karen Thompson Walker s The Age of Miracles is a luminous and unforgettable debut novel about coming of age set against the backdrop of an utterly altered world. NEW YORK TIMES BESTSELLER  Maybe everything that happened to me and to my family had nothing at all to do with the slowing. It's possible, I guess. But I doubt it. I doubt it very much.  Spellbinding, haunting, The Age of Miracles is a beautiful novel of catastrophe and survival, growth and change, the story of Julia and her family as they struggle to live in an extraordinary time. On an ordinary Saturday, Julia awakes to discover that something has happened to the rotation of the earth. The days and nights are growing longer and longer, gravity is affected, the birds, the tides, human behavior and cosmic rhythms are thrown into disarray. In a world of danger and loss, Julia faces surprising developments in herself, and her personal world divisions widening between her parents, strange behavior by Hannah and other friends, the vulnerability of first love, a sense of isolation, and a rebellious new strength. With crystalline prose and the indelible magic of a born storyteller, Karen Thompson Walker gives us a breathtaking story of people finding ways to go on, in an ever-evolving world.

This period and its personalities, as well as a taste of the style and spirit of the Legalists' discourse, are made accessible to the student and general reader, placing into focus the roots of the great Chinese philosophy-as-statecraft tradition. The Legalists - most famously Li Kui, Shang Yang, Shen Buhai, Shen Dao, and Han Fei - had a great impact not only on the institutions and practices of Chinese imperial tradition but also on the Maoist totalitarianism of the People's Republic of China.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7YQYDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Silas Marner,: The weaver of Raveloe,","description":"A gentle linen weaver in a small English town is wrongly accused of a theft goes into seclusion and finds redemption in his unselfish love for an abandoned child who mysteriously appears at his cottage.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lX1MAAAAcAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Craven house","description":"Trapped by a storm in a mysterious and frightening house, the reader is given several alternative choices to manipulate the plot and plan an escape.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=f96JP6Eu2_MC&dq=Craven+house&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Splendor of Silence","description":"Arriving in the west India state of Rudrakot where he hopes to find his idealistic brother, who went missing after joining the local struggle for independence from the British, wounded World War II army captain Sam Hawthorne finds his search complicated by his love for the daughter of a political agent.

Palestine and Israel examines the history of this battle from the perspective of international law, and it argues that a long-term solution to the conflict must protect legitimate interests to remain viable an element the author believes has so far been seriously neglected. This extensively documented work details the complex politics and agonizing struggles that have characterized the clash between Jews and Arabs, examining in depth the competing claims to Palestine and the extent to which legitimate interests remain to be fulfilled. Beginning with the early Zionist settlement in Palestine that rose from the effort by Jews to escape long-standing discrimination in Europe, Qigley investigates the origins of the dispute, including the British occupation of Palestine, the British Mandate, and the involvement of the United Nations. He examines the 1948 War, the establishment of Israel, and explores the legal and political status of Jews there. After a detailed analysis of the 1967 War and Israel s occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, he concludes with recommendations for resolving the conflict, including discussions of the responsibility of other states for the persisting injustice, the role of other states in settling the dispute, and steps to a possible solution.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=GX8jX9dJXIAC&dq=Israel+Pocket+Library:+Jerusalem+(Israel+Pocket+Library,+volume+4+of+16)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cry of Jesus on the Cross: A Biblical and Theological Study","description":"The cry of Jesus on the cross described in the gospels of Mark and Matthew was a wail of pain and abandonment. Many Christians have been scandalized by it. On one hand it is an expression of the humanity of Jesus, while at the same time it links him with his Jewish heritage and the rich imagery of the psalms. Italian theologian Gerard Rosse has examined the many meanings of Jesus' cry. He first considers the historical question - whether these were truly the words of Jesus. If we assume that they are, what do the words mean? Was it merely a cry of despair, or does it reveal something of the relationship between Jesus and the One called Abba? Theologically, what light does it cast on the inner life of the Trinity? Rosse also considers the reality of abandonment in the world today and what the outcry of Jesus reveals about our solidarity with all abandoned people.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VGCvCwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Cry+of+Jesus+on+the+Cross:+A+Biblical+and+Theological+Study&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Water in Environmental Planning","description":"A classic advanced undergraduate/graduate level text showing how knowledge of hydrology, fluvial geomorphology, and river quality are used in environmental planning.

Using both official reports compiled by prefets and much more critical commentaries by those whose homes and land had been devastated, Hugh Clout charts the geography of destruction and then analyses the work of the state-directed services, the creation of reconstruction cooperatives, the controversial reclamation of the profoundly devastated 'red zone', and ultimately the reconstruction of the countryside across the ten northernmost departements of northern France.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nSprHxTuXdAC&dq=After+The+Ruins:+Restoring+the+Countryside+of+Northern+France+after+the+Great+War+(History)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Greening of America","description":"Offers an analysis of the causes and nature of the cultural crisis which precipitated a revolution in the consciousness of the United States in the late 1960s","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5vZmyAEACAAJ&dq=The+Greening+of+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Monsters on the Bus (Sesame Street Jellybean Books(R))","description":"The Wheels on the Bus, a perennial favorite of the toddler set, gets a uniquely Sesame Street spin in this very funny Little Golden Book.

Along the way, The Rebel gives us an extraordinary snapshot of post-war America through the lens of celebrity and politics, and a very intimate look at famous lives away from the pages of history. It is a story of rebellion, idealism, love, courage and tragedy - it is the story of James Dean, and the story of 20th-century America in all its magnificent, gritty, heartbreaking madness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-ZARHAAACAAJ&dq=The+Rebel+:+An+Imagined+Life+of+James+Dean&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Promise of Mediation: The Transformative Approach to Conflict","description":"The award-winning first edition of The Promise of Mediation, published ten years ago, is a landmark classic that changed the field's understanding of the theory and practice of conflict intervention. That volume first articulated the \\"transformative model\\" of mediation, which greatly humanized the vision of how the mediation process could help parties in conflict. In the past decade, the transformative model has proved itself and gained increasing acceptance. It is now being used in such diverse arenas as workplace, community, family, organizational, and public policy conflicts, among others. In this new edition, the authors draw on a decade of work in theory development, training, practice, research, and assessment to present a thoroughly revised and updated account of the transformative model of mediation and its practical application, including a compelling description of how the field has moved toward increasing acceptance of the transformative model a new and clearer presentation of the theory and practices of transformative mediation, with many concrete examples a new case study that provides a vivid picture of the model in practice, with a commentary full of new information about how to use it effectively clarifications of common misconceptions about the model a vision for the future that shows how the model can coexist with other approaches and where the \\"market\\" for transformative mediation is emerging This volume is a foundational resource on transformative practice, for both readers of the first edition and new readers - including mediators, facilitators, lawyers, administrators, human resource professionals, policymakers, and conflict resolution researchers and educators. More generally, this book will strike a chord with anyone interested in humanizing our social institutions and building on a relational vision of society.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ra33EB_wjGkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Diaspora: Jews amidst Greeks and Romans","description":"What was life like for Jews settled throughout the Mediterranean world of Classical antiquity--and what place did Jewish communities have in the diverse civilization dominated by Greeks and Romans? In a probing account of the Jewish diaspora in the four centuries from Alexander the Great's conquest of the Near East to the Roman destruction of the Jewish Temple in 70 C.E., Erich Gruen reaches often surprising conclusions. By the first century of our era, Jews living abroad far outnumbered those living in Palestine and had done so for generations. Substantial Jewish communities were found throughout the Greek mainland and Aegean islands, Asia Minor, the Tigris-Euphrates valley, Egypt, and Italy. Focusing especially on Alexandria, Greek cities in Asia Minor, and Rome, Gruen explores the lives of these Jews: the obstacles they encountered, the institutions they established, and their strategies for adjustment. He also delves into Jewish writing in this period, teasing out how Jews in the diaspora saw themselves. There emerges a picture of a Jewish minority that was at home in Greco-Roman cities: subject to only sporadic harassment; its intellectuals immersed in Greco-Roman culture while refashioning it for their own purposes; exhibiting little sign of insecurity in an alien society; and demonstrating both a respect for the Holy Land and a commitment to the local community and Gentile government. Gruen's innovative analysis of the historical and literary record alters our understanding of the way this vibrant minority culture engaged with the dominant Classical civilization.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=t1IR4WtFjGUC&dq=Diaspora:+Jews+amidst+Greeks+and+Romans&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Survival, Evasion and Escape","description":"The printed Escape and Evasion Manual is in the convenient 5 x 8 inch format.

A half-mad, unbearably beautiful heiress follows a strange man home, seeking total sexual abandon: He only wants to watch game shows. A woman falls in love with a hunchback; when his deformity turns out to be a prosthesis, she leaves him. A wife whose husband has just returned from the war struggles with the heartrending question: Can she still love a man who has no lips? Aimee Bender's stories portray a world twisted on its axis, a place of unconvention that resembles nothing so much as real life, in all its grotesque, beautiful glory. From the first line of each tale she lets us know she is telling a story, but the moral is never quite what we expect. Bender's prose is glorious: musical and colloquial, inimitable and heartrending. Here are stories of men and women whose lives are shaped--and sometimes twisted--by the power of extraordinary desires, erotic and otherwise.

This change in priorities has been accompanied by a curtailed military budget and the end of the two-war doctrine. Amitai Etzioni argues that pivoting towards the Far East is premature and flawed in principle. China can and should be treated for the near future as a potential partner in a changing global order, rather than contained and made into an enemy. At the same time, he argues, the true hot spots continue to be in the Middle East, albeit not in Iraq or Afghanistan, but in Iran and Pakistan. Less urgent but of great importance are the ways the West deals with a complex and varied Muslim world, with political Islamic parties and social movements, and with future waves of Arab awaking. Here the distinction between security and nation building becomes essential for both normative and strategic reasons. Etzioni expects that we will see few armed humanitarian interventions of the kind we witnessed in 2011 in Libya. To this end, he examines policies that threaten and favor the promotion of human rights. This timely book is written with Etzioni s customary deep appreciation for important issues.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VJhb0t0XuE8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Weekend Millionaire's Real Estate Investing Program","description":"\\"Everything you need to know to make millions by investing in real estate.

Carriers have political boundaries. They range at will with planes that can be refueled in the air to strike targets thousands of miles inland. From the improvised wooden platforms of the early 20th century to today's nuclear-powered supercarriers, Hearn explores how combat experience of key individuals drove the development, technology, and tactics of carriers in the world's navies. In the early 20th century, during the days of the dreadnaughts, innovators in Europe and North America began to fly contraptions made from wood, canvas, wire, and a small combustion engine. Naval officers soon wondered whether these rickety bi-planes could be launched from the deck of a surface vessel. Trials began from jury-rigged wooden platforms built upon the decks of colliers. The experiments stimulated enough interest for the navies of the world to begin building better aircraft and better aircraft carriers. The novelty of a ship that could carry its own airstrip anywhere on the world's oceans caught fire in the 1920s and helped induce a new arms race. While the rest of the world viewed carriers as defensive weapons, Japan focused on offensive capabilities and produced the finest carrier in the world by 1940. World War II would see the carrier emerge as the greatest surface ship afloat. Since then, no war has been fought without them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=sg8ivuKMD5cC&dq=Carriers+in+Combat:+The+Air+War+at+Sea&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Half-Scratch Magic: 200 Ways to Pull Dinner Out of a Hat Using a Can of Soup or Other Tasty Shortcuts","description":"A handy guide to quick-and-easy cookery explains how to transform a variety of convenience foods into culinary delights by combining pantry staples with freshly prepared purchased items, offering more than two hundred delicious recipes for hors d-oeuvres, entrTes, biscuits and breads, and desserts, as well as a variety of clever shortcuts for busy cooks.

Her only concession to her lingering fear is to give up criminal law. She figures an invasion of privacy lawsuit is a nice, safe civil action that will help her support her young son and pay the bills for her one-woman law office. She figures wrong. Nina's client is Terry London, a filmmaker whose documentary about a missing girl is raising disturbing questions. The girl's distraught parents believe the film invades their privacy. But Terry's brutal murder changes everything. Breaking her promise to herself, Nina decides to defend Terry's accused murderer, a man she'd known years before and hoped never to see again. Suddenly the secrets of Nina's past are beginning to surface in a murder case that gets more dangerous every day. The evidence against her client is shocking and ironclad--a video of Terry's dying words. The only chance Nina has to save the man may be illegal.

In Follow the Blue Blazes, the reader embarks on a journey to discover a part of Ohio largely unseen except along this great path. Beginning with the startling rock formations and graceful waterfalls of Old Man s Cave in southern Ohio, and leading clockwise around the state to visit expansive forests, lovely parks, ancient mounds, historic canals and battlefields, and scenic river trails, experienced trailsman Robert J. Pond provides a captivating look at each section of the trail. Each chapter features an overview of a 100-mile section of the trail and three self-guided featured hikes. The overviews, with accompanying maps, may be read consecutively to acquaint the reader with the entire course of the blue blazes. But most readers will best enjoy the Buckeye Trail by taking the guide along on featured hikes. Each hike is supported by a detailed but easy-to-follow map and includes explicit directions to trailheads and approximate hiking times. In addition to many outlying areas, the extensive Buckeye Trail is accessible in or near Cincinnati, Dayton, Toledo, Cleveland, and Akron. Robert Pond has supplemented each description with interesting details about the geology and the diverse habitats of flora and fauna. Readers, too, can enjoy the beauty and wonders of Ohio if they Follow the Blue Blazes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=prXzjVIRwXAC&dq=Follow+the+Blue+Blazes:+A+Guide+To+Hiking+Ohio%27s+Buckeye+Trail+(Ohio+Bicentennial)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"We Shook the Family Tree","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I1W9swEACAAJ&dq=We+Shook+the+Family+Tree&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The rest (Telegraph Books poetry series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0m4gAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+rest+(Telegraph+Books+poetry+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Family Affair","description":"Includes Macomber's \\"Family Affair,\\" in which Lacey Lancaster spurns the advances of her handsome neighbor, Jack Walker, in spite of their cats' mutual attraction, and a novella selected by Macomber and written by Darlene Panzera.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FR-3ngEACAAJ&dq=Family+Affair&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Best of Attractions Postcard Book (Postcardbooks)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0woHAAAACAAJ&dq=Best+of+Attractions+Postcard+Book+(Postcardbooks)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essentials of Chinese Wushu","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=JRraAAAACAAJ&dq=Essentials+of+Chinese+Wushu&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Rocky Mountain Rancher (Silhouette Special Edition, No 951)","description":"SEEN AND HEARD The Thunder Canyon NuggetYou might remember bubbly Lizbeth Stanton from behind the bar at the Thunder Canyon Resort and on the arm of every eligible bachelor in town.

His music, however, remains largely underresearched. Rethinking Reich redresses this imbalance, providing a space for prominent and emerging scholars to reassess the composer's contribution to music in the twentieth century. Featuring fourteen tightly focused and multifarious essays on various aspects of Reich's work--ranging from analytical, aesthetic, and archival studies to sociocultural, philosophical, and ethnomusicological reflections--this edited volume reveals new insights, including those enabled by access to the growing Steve Reich Collection at the Paul Sacher Foundation archive, the premier institution for primary research on twentieth-century and contemporary classical music. This volume takes on the timely task of challenging the hegemony of Reich's own articulate and convincing discourses on his music, as found in his Writings on Music (OUP, 2002), and breaks new ground in the broader field of minimalism studies.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ft-RDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Building Database Applications on the Web Using PHP3","description":"\\"Building Database Applications on the Web Using PHP3 provides everything you need to understand and work with PHP3.

The configuration of the system and, in particular, the position where the adaptive processor is placed generate different areas or application fields such as: prediction, system identification and modeling, equalization, cancellation of interference, etc. which are very important in many disciplines such as control systems, communications, signal processing, acoustics, voice, sound and image, etc. The book consists of noise and echo cancellation, medical applications, communications systems and others hardly joined by their heterogeneity. Each application is a case study with rigor that shows weakness/strength of the method used, assesses its suitability and suggests new forms and areas of use. The problems are becoming increasingly complex and applications must be adapted to solve them. The adaptive filters have proven to be useful in these environments of multiple input/output, variant-time behaviors, and long and complex transfer functions effectively, but fundamentally they still have to evolve.

Although it has become a commonplace practice in the United States, we know very little about how or why it began, or how or why it developed into the practice that we see today. Arissa Oh argues that international adoption began in the aftermath of the Korean War. First established as an emergency measure through which to evacuate mixed-race \\"GI babies,\\" it became a mechanism through which the Korean government exported its unwanted children: the poor, the disabled, or those lacking Korean fathers. Focusing on the legal, social, and political systems at work, this book shows how the growth of Korean adoption from the 1950s to the 1980s occurred within the context of the neocolonial U.S.-Korea relationship, and was facilitated by crucial congruencies in American and Korean racial thought, government policies, and nationalisms. It also argues that the international adoption industry played an important but unappreciated part in the so-called Korean \\"economic miracle.\\" Korean adoption served as a kind of template as international adoption began, in the late 1960s, to expand to new sending and receiving countries. Ultimately, Oh demonstrates that although Korea was not the first place that Americans adopted from internationally, it was the place where organized, systematic international adoption was born.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0Hz8CAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fragile Science: The Reality Behind the Headlines","description":"Everyday the headlines bring news of the latest health scare, with worrying predictions for where developments in science will take us.

His investigations reach their own, startling conclusions. Could it be possible, for example, that using sunscreen is actually increasing our chance of skin cancer?

In it, Bloom, whose magnificent translation of Plato's Republic has been universally hailed as a virtual rediscovery of that timeless text, again brings together the translator's gift for journeying between two languages and cultures and the philosopher's perception of the true meaning and significance of the issues being examined in the work. The result is a clear, readable, and highly engrossing text that at the same time offers a wholly new sense of the importance and relevance of Rousseau's thought to us.In addition to his translation, Bloom provides a brilliant introduction that relates the structure and themes of the book to the vital preoccupation's of our own age, particularly in the field of education, but also more generally to the current concerns about the limits and possibilities of human nature. Thus in this translation Emile, long a classic in the history of Western thought and educational theory, becomes something more: a prescription, fresh and dazzling, for the bringing up of autonomous, responsible that is, truly democratic human beings.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ObOWswEACAAJ&dq=Emile:+Or,+On+Education&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Wadsworth Handbook (with InfoTrac)","description":"With practical advice on topics ranging from writing effective essays, paragraphs, and sentences to documenting sources and designing Web pages, THE WADSWORTH HANDBOOK is the essential tool for any college student!

Drawing upon years of unparalleled experience in diplomacy and government, Azzam examines the social and economic ramifications of the Muslim state, one based on humane ideals of law and justice expressed in the Qur'an, and one which can provide the foundation for a just society. Abd al-Rahman Azzam (1893-1976) is generally considered as the father of the Arab League. He served as the League's first Secretary-General between 1945-52 as well as distinguishing himself in a long career as an ambassador and parliamentarian. As Vincent Sheean points out in his introduction, 'In Damascus as well as in Djakarta, Istanbul and Baghdad, this man is known for valour of spirit and elevation of mind...He combines in the best Islamic mode, the aspects of thought and action, like the Muslim warriors of another time who are typified for us Westerners by the figure of Saladin.' Malcolm X's reading of The Eternal Message of Muhammad and his meeting with Azzam Pasha are vividly recounted in his Autobiography. It is clear that these events marked the point in his life at which Malcolm X turned towards orthodox traditional Islam.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jsqIAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Eternal+Message+of+Muhammad&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Silver Lies: A Silver Rush Mystery (Silver Rush Mysteries)","description":"They all came to Leadville with the same purpose: Get in. Get rich. Get out. As 1879 draws to a close, this Rocky Mountain boomtown has infected the world with silver fever. It's not much different than the dot.com mania or the corporate scams that heat up over a century later. Unfortunately for Joe Rose, a precious-metals assayer, death stakes its own claim. Joe's body is found trampled into the muck behind Inez Stannert's saloon. Inez already had much more to deal with than pouring shots of Taos Lightning and cleaning up a corpse. A lady educated on the East Coast, she has a past that doesn't bear close scrutiny, including her elopement with a gambling man who has recently disappeared. Most townsfolk, including Inez's business partner, Abe Jackson, dismiss Joe's death as an accident. Death, after all, is no stranger in Leadville. But Inez wonders: Why was this loving husband and father carrying a brass token good for \\"one free screw\\" at the parlor house of Denver madam Mattie Silks? When Joe's widow Emma asks Inez to settle Joe's affairs, almost against her will, Inez uncovers skewed assays, bogus greenbacks, and blackmail. Lies and secrets run deep in Colorado, secrets more likely to lead to a hanging than to today's congressional hearings or country-club prisons for the crooked and the greedy. Then again, maybe Joe's murder was purely personal....

In it, Sartre offers nothing less than a brilliant and radical account of the human condition. The English philosopher and novelist Iris Murdoch wrote to a friend of \\"the excitement - I remember nothing like it since the days of discovering Keats and Shelley and Coleridge\\". What gives our lives significance, Sartre argues in Being and Nothingness, is not pre-established for us by God or nature but is something for which we ourselves are responsible. Combining this with the unsettling view that human existence is characterized by radical freedom and the inescapability of choice, Sartre introduces us to a cast of ideas and characters that are part of philosophical legend: anguish; the 'bad faith' of the memorable waiter in the caf ; sexual desire; and the 'look' of the other, brought to life by Sartre's famous description of someone looking through a keyhole. Above all, by arguing that we alone create our values and that human relationships are characterized by hopeless conflict, Sartre paints a stark and controversial picture of our moral universe and one that resonates strongly today. This new translation includes a helpful Translator's Introduction, notes on the translation, a comprehensive index and a foreword by Richard Moran.\\"--Book jacket.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n788EAAAQBAJ&dq=Being+and+Nothingness+An+Essay+on+Phenomenological+Ontology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dave Barry's Greatest Hits","description":"When Dave Barry is on the loose, no one is safe!

B. S. Haldane was asked what could be inferred about God from a study of his works, Haldane replied,  An inordinate fondness for beetles.  With 350,000 known species, and scientific estimates that millions more have yet to be identified, their abundance is indisputable as is their variety. They range from the delightful summer firefly to the one-hundred-gram Goliath beetle. Beetles offer a dazzling array of shapes, sizes, and colors that entice scientists and collectors across the globe. The Book of Beetles celebrates the beauty and diversity of this marvelous insect. Six hundred significant beetle species are covered, with each entry featuring a distribution map, basic biology, conservation status, and information on cultural and economic significance. Full-color photos show the beetles both at their actual size and enlarged to show details, such as the sextet of spots that distinguish the six-spotted tiger beetle or the jagged ridges of the giant-jawed sawyer beetle. Based in the most up-to-date science and accessibly written, the descriptive text will appeal to researchers and armchair coleopterists alike. The humble beetle continues to grow in popularity, taking center stage in biodiversity studies, sustainable agriculture programs, and even the dining rooms of adventurous and eco-conscious chefs.

In this new age, marriages would no longer be dictated by necessity or convenience, but by love and beauty; ethnic obstacles, already in the process of being broken down, especially in Latin America, would disappear altogether, giving birth to a fully mixed race, a \\"cosmic race,\\" in which all the better qualities of each race would persist by the natural selection of love. \\"This bilingual edition of The Cosmic Race by Jos  Vasconcelos gives the reader a clear and concise introduction to contents that have caused much critical controversy.

So says Louis Armstrong, a tough kid who just happened to be a musical genius, about one of the places where he performed and grew up. This raucous, rich tale of his early days in New Orleans concludes with his departure to Chicago at twenty-one to play with his boyhood idol King Oliver, and tells the story of a life that began, mythically, on July 4, 1900, in the city that sowed the seeds of jazz.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=S7TSDQAAQBAJ&dq=Satchmo:+My+life+in+new+Orleans&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Faith Club: A Muslim, A Christian, A Jew-- Three Women Search for Understanding","description":"Traces how three American women of different faiths worked together to understand one another while identifying the connections between Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, during which they openly discussed the issues that divided them.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HrVPGGs4kBAC&dq=The+Faith+Club:+A+Muslim,+A+Christian,+A+Jew--+Three+Women+Search+for+Understanding&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In the Arms of Morpheus: The Tragic History of Morphine, Laudanum and Patent Medicines","description":"Examines how the drinking of laudanum for medical reasons developed and how it became an everyday safeguard against pain, poverty, and boredom.

Published early in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I and only five years after the death of the Roman Catholic Queen Mary I, Foxe's Acts and Monuments was an affirmation of the Protestant Reformation in England during a period of religious conflict between Catholics and Protestants. Foxe's account of church history asserted a historical justification that was intended to establish the Church of England as a continuation of the true Christian church rather than as a modern innovation, and it contributed significantly to a nationalistic repudiation of the Roman Catholic Church. The sequence of the work, initially in five books, covered first early Christian martyrs, a brief history of the medieval church, including the Inquisitions, and a history of the Wycliffite or Lollard movement. It then dealt with the reigns of Henry VIII and Edward VI, during which the dispute with Rome had led to the separation of the English Church from papal authority and the issuance of the Book of Common Prayer. The final book treated the reign of Queen Mary and the Marian Persecutions.

But The Making of a Chef is not just about holding a knife or slicing an onion; it's also about the nature and spirit of being a professional cook and the people who enter the profession. As Ruhlman now an expert on the fundamentals of cooking recounts his growing mastery of the skills of his adopted profession, he propels himself and his readers through a score of kitchens and classrooms in search of the elusive, unnameable elements of great food.

That s why we created the Georgia Real Estate License Exam Prep (GA-RELEP) the way we did. Since we have been managing real estate schools and developing curriculum for forty years, we know how all this works  or fails to work. GA-RELEP is comprehensive in that it contains both key content review and testing practice. And the text review is Georgia-specific  not just simplistic national content, but terse, relevant and accurate Georgia laws and regulations presented as a well-organized set of state  key point reviews  ideal for pre-test memorization. But let s not dismiss the importance of the national content either. GA-RELEP s national key point reviews are a succinct compression of tested national principles and practices that comprise the national portion of state license exams from coast to coast. Our content is drawn from our own national textbook, Principles of Real Estate Practice  one of the most widely used principles textbooks in the country. Finally, our national content, as well as our question selection, is further tailored to the state testing outline promulgated by AMP/PSI for Georgia. Thus the breadth and depth of the law reviews and test questions reflect the topic emphasis of your state s testing service and your Georgia license exam. A word about the test questions  GA-RELEP s testing practice section consists of ten national practice tests, three state practice tests, and one state exam sample test. The practice tests are roughly 50 questions in length and the sample test is 100 questions. The test questions are designed to cover the content covered by the law reviews  which reinforces your learning of the total body of information tested by your state exam. The questions are direct, to the point, and designed to test your understanding. When you have completed a given test, you can check your answers against the answer key in the appendix. You may also note that each question s answer is accompanied by a brief explanation, or  rationale  to further reinforce your understanding. In the end, as you know, it s all up to you. Unlike other publications, we are not going to tell you that using this book will guarantee that you pass your state exam. It still takes hard work and study to pass. But we have done our best here to get you ready. Following that, the most we can do is wish you the best of success in taking and passing your Georgia real estate exam. So good luck!!

THE KING OF THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN is a verse-by-verse commentary of Matthew's Gospel, written from a dispensational, premillennial perspective that is essential to correctly understand God's prophetic kingdom program. This thorough commentary traces the theme of Christ's kingship from His royal virgin birth, through His authoritative teaching and sign miracles, to His sacrificial death, bodily resurrection, and commission to His disciples. The author holds the text of Matthew's Gospel in highest regard as the inspired Word of God. He balances practical application with scholarly attention to the details of historical background, grammar, and word meaning. Readers of this commentary will gain greater insight into the earthly life, ministry, and mission of the King and His coming kingdom. Dr. Thomas O.

At its center is Naty: born in 1925, educated in the United States, a socialite during the Batista era, who after marriage to a prominent doctor and the birth of a daughter became intoxicated with Castro and his revolution (here, published for the first time, are the letters they exchanged while he was in jail). Though her husband and daughter immigrated to the United States after Castro's victory, Naty remained in Cuba to raise her second child, Castro's unacknowledged daughter, only to be ultimately confronted by his dismissive, withering judgment: \\"Naty missed the train.\\" Her two daughters, one of whom settles well into life in America, while the other never recovers from her father's intransigent repudiation of her; her granddaughter, who Naty desperately believes will return to Cuba when--not if--Castro is removed from the island; and her mother, an unregenerate reactionary: these are the lives that complete this extraordinary story. Each of the women is irrevocably marked with a part of the island's terrible and poignant tale, and Wendy Gimbel has created a rich and intense narrative of their lives and times. Havana Dreams leaves us with an indelible impression of familial obligation and illicit love; of the heady but doomed romanticism of revolution; and of the profound consequences of Cuba's contemporary history for the ordinary and most intimate lives of its people.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kqzx3ZDQ8ywC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Usborne Illustrated Dictionary of Math","description":"Discusses terms and concepts dealing with numbers, calculations, plane and solid geometry, graphing, algebra, trigonometry, and vectors.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vwsFnwEACAAJ&dq=Usborne+Illustrated+Dictionary+of+Math&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oh, Baby!","description":"From the bloating to the belching to the Baby Story marathons that might just drive you crazy, prime-time star and new mom Tia Mowry delivers the lowdown in a frank, hilarious guide to modern pregnancy.

This edition includes a new introduction by Walter Salles and an array of new material that was assembled for the 2004 edition coinciding with the release of the film, including 24 pages of previously unpublished photos taken by Che, notes and comments by his wife, Aleida Guevara March, and an extensive introduction by the distinguished Cuban author, Cintio Vitier. \\"A journey, a number of journeys. Ernesto Guevara in search of adventure, Ernesto Guevara in search of America, Ernesto Guevara in search of Che. On this journey, solitude found solidarity. 'I' turned into 'we.'\\" Eduardo Galeano \\"As his journey progresses, Guevara's voice seems to deepen, to darken, colored by what he witnesses in his travels. He is still poetic, but now he comments on what he sees, though still poetically, with a new awareness of the social and political ramifications of what's going on around him.\\" January Magazine \\"Our film is about a young man, Che, falling in love with a continent and finding his place in it.\\"  Walter Salles, director of the film version of The Motorcycle Diaries \\"All this wandering around 'Our America with a Capital A' has changed me more than I thought.\\"  Ernesto Che Guevara, from The Motorcycle Diaries","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4GJOEAAAQBAJ&dq=Motorcycle+Diaries&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Diary of an Oil Expat Family","description":" Heidi Vaughan's account of her family's expatriate experience in Norway will give anyone thinking about doing an overseas assignment a real and sincere look at life as a foreigner far from home.

It is the story of a young man's development from a man of inaction to a man of action, from a man with no direction to a man with a purpose. The story is set in the 1960s, but opens with the ending scene some years later. The protagonist is sitting under a cottonwood tree in Rainbow Park on Chicago's southeast side. He is writing. As he writes, he is approached by a midget whom he recognizes from years ago when he was in the military stationed in Germany. In fact, he has been waiting for the midget for years. The midget pulls a gun on him, and asks if he is 'the one.' He avoids the question. The midget asks again, \\"are you the one?\\" The story shifts to the beginning, to the protagonist as a young man enrolling in college. His name is Noel Bodie. Noel is despondent because his options in life are limited, and he seems to be at the mercy of the forces outside his sway. As the story progresses, Noel comes to realize that one can increase the options available in one's life, if one but has the nerve to do it. He transforms himself into Al Pearsons. In the end, Noel- now Al- is a new man, a bold man, a man capable of anything. More importantly, he is now a man of wisdom.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QdBuxMcqFuAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Divine Comedy of Dante Alighieri- Hell; Purgatory; Paradise (The Harvard Classics Collector's Edition)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FppOITmw_8EC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Devils","description":"Age has done everything except mellow the characters in Kingsley Amis s The Old Devils, which turns its humane and ironic gaze on a group of Welsh married couples who have been spending their golden years when  all of a sudden the evening starts starting after breakfast  nattering, complaining, reminiscing, and, above all, drinking.

However, they soon left in droves because of the fast, unrelenting line speed and high rate of injury. Those who stayed wanted higher wages and safer working conditions, but every time they tried to form a union, the company quickly cracked down, firing union leaders, assaulting organizers, and setting minority groups against each other. Author and journalist Lynn Waltz reveals how these aggressive tactics went unchecked for years until Sherri Buffkin, a higher-up manager at Smithfield, blew the lid off the company s corrupt practices. Through meticulous reporting, in-depth interviews with key players, and a mind for labor and environmental histories, Waltz weaves a fascinating tale of the nearly two-decade struggle that eventually brought justice to the workers and accountability to the food giant, pitting the world s largest slaughterhouse against the world s largest meatpacking union. Following in a long tradition of books that expose the horrors of the meatpacking industry from Upton Sinclair s The Jungle to Eric Schlosser s Fast Food Nation Hog Wild uncovers rampant corporate environmental hooliganism, labor exploitation, and union-busting by one of the nation s largest meat producers. Waltz s eye-opening examination sheds new light on the challenges workers face not just in meatpacking, but everywhere workers have lost their power to collectively bargain with powerful corporations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0mtaDwAAQBAJ&dq=Hog+wild!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Uncle John's original bread book: Recipes for breads, biscuits, griddle cakes, rolls, crackers, etc","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cZVyPQAACAAJ&dq=Uncle+John%27s+original+bread+book:+Recipes+for+breads,+biscuits,+griddle+cakes,+rolls,+crackers,+etc&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bones, Stones and Molecules: \\"Out of Africa\\" and Human Origins","description":"Bones, Stones and Molecules provides some of the best evidence for resolving the debate between the two hypotheses of human origins.

The Collegeville atlas of the Bible offers those with an interest in their historical and religious heritage a guided tour through the Bible. It describes the stories and events of the Bible and places them in their historical and geographical context. Fabulous 3-D cutaways, maps, and ground plans, all based on the latest historical evidence, enhance the comprehensive text and bring the dramatic events of the Old and New Testaments to life in glorious detail. When the Bible says that Abraham migrated from Ur, Jacob fled to Haran, and Jesus healed and taught in Galilee, many people think of these places as merely names with a semi-legendary status. But with recent archaeology, sites such as Jericho, Hazor, Megiddo, and Masada are now living monuments to the dramatic action described in the Bible. The Collegeville atlas of the Bible illustrates the most important of these sites, while capturing the atmosphere of biblical times with graphic reconstructions, and photographs of archeological remains and biblical artifacts. The Collegeville atlas of the Bible begins with the events of Genesis and follows the sequence of the biblical books, ending with Revelation. The main text gives succinct outlines of biblical stories and explains points of theology. Special features, such as The making of the Psalms\\" and *Modern Bedouin Encampments, - shed fascinating light on a variety of topics. Central to The Collegeville atlas of the Bible is its use of 50 maps (route maps, ground plans, and locators) to detail biblical territories and routes, and to pinpoint the locations of important events. In the Old Testament, for example, a Mesopotamian ziggurat will show how the Tower of Babel might have looked, while Solomon's Temple is shown in al its magnificence. In the New Testament, the city of Jerusalem and the siege of Masada are among the visual panoramas presented. In addition, feature map spreads show major journeys and empires, and location shots add their own authentic vistas. Specially-commissioned reconstructions and beautifully illustrated reflective page spreads build on this foundation to add contextual information to the discussion of biblical stories. Additionally, 300 superb full-color photographs take the reader to the Holy Land as it is today in order to better understand how it was in biblical times. The Collegeville atlas of the Bible is divided into two main sections corresponding to the Bible itself: The Old Testament In the Beginning The Patriarchs To the Promised Land From Judges to Kings Decline, Fall and Restoration The Hellenistic Age The New Testament Jesus's Early Life The Ministry of Jesus Death and Resurrection The First Christians Revolution and Revelation Special features: Specially-commissioned 3-D artworks and ground plans based on the most up-to-date archaeological finds reconstruct the palaces, cities, and towns chronicled in the Bible. Expert text explains the stories of the Bible from Genesis to Revelation, explaining the history and the theology related to each one. Carefully selected quotations are taken from the Bible, alongside quotations from other historical sources, for a new angle on these ancient stories. Detailed relief maps show the routes of individuals and the movements of peoples, from Abraham's first journey in Mesopotamia to the Exodus of the Israelites from Egypt, to Paul's last journey to Rome. Detailed descriptions and images of surviving artifacts prompt discussion of aspects of everyday life in the Holy Land. Fully illustrated reflective spreads add a thoughtful discussion of many biblical stories. Authoritative and comprehensive, its 50 maps, 18 major artworks, and 300 full-color photographs make this atlas of the Bible a visual feast. Will appeal to anyone interested in archaeology and ancient history, especially the cultures of ancient Egypt, Greece, Rome, and the splendid empires of the Middle East.

Some view taking another person's life as just and reasonable punishment while others see it as an inhumane and barbaric act. But the intensity of feeling that capital punishment provokes often obscures its long and varied history in this country. Now, for the first time, we have a comprehensive history of the death penalty in the United States. Law professor Stuart Banner tells the story of how, over four centuries, dramatic changes have taken place in the ways capital punishment has been administered and experienced. In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the penalty was standard for a laundry list of crimes--from adultery to murder, from arson to stealing horses. Hangings were public events, staged before audiences numbering in the thousands, attended by women and men, young and old, black and white alike. Early on, the gruesome spectacle had explicitly religious purposes--an event replete with sermons, confessions, and last minute penitence--to promote the salvation of both the condemned and the crowd. Through the nineteenth century, the execution became desacralized, increasingly secular and private, in response to changing mores. In the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, ironically, as it has become a quiet, sanitary, technological procedure, the death penalty is as divisive as ever. By recreating what it was like to be the condemned, the executioner, and the spectator, Banner moves beyond the debates, to give us an unprecedented understanding of capital punishment's many meanings. As nearly four thousand inmates are now on death row, and almost one hundred are currently being executed each year, the furious debate is unlikely to diminish. The Death Penalty is invaluable in understanding the American way of the ultimate punishment. Table of Contents: Abbreviations Introduction 1. Terror, Blood, and Repentance 2. Hanging Day 3.

Given the emotional nature of the subject (few people known to me are wishy-washy about whether the death penalty is moral or immoral), Banner walks the line of neutrality skillfully, without seeming evasive. --Steve Weinberg, Legal Times Reviews of this book: Stuart Banner's The Death Penalty is a tour de force, remarkable for its neutrality as it traces the ways in which the death penalty has been applied, and for what kinds of crimes, from the Colonial era to the present. Banner...writes like a historian who believes perspective is best gained by dispassionately setting out what happened and letting everyone come to his or her own conclusions. I think, in this book, that works wonderfully. On a subject in which emotions run so high, it seems awfully useful to have a dispassionate voice. After all, if Banner allowed his own feelings on the death penalty--pro, con or somewhere in the middle--to be known, the book easily could be dismissed as a diatribe. He doesn't, and it can't. --Judith Neuman Beck, San Jose Mercury News Reviews of this book: Law professor Banner...offers a persuasive examination of the evolution of capital punishment from Colonial times onward. He makes clear that the death penalty has possessed generally consistent support from the US populace, although changes in the sensibilities of juries, executioners, legal theoreticians, and judges have occurred...Highly recommended. --R. C. Cottrell, Choice Reviews of this book: Stuart Banner aptly illustrates in The Death Penalty, like the nation, the death penalty has changed with the times...Banner's account spotlights a number of interesting trends in American history...Mostly evenhanded in the tour he provides through the history of the death penalty and its role in and reflection of American society, he has managed to provide an accessible look at what is a profoundly controversial and complicated subject. --Steven Martinovich, Ft. Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel Reviews of this book: \\"For centuries,\\" Stuart Banner tells us, \\"Americans had been proud to possess a criminal-justice system that made less use of the death penalty than just about any other place on the globe, including the countries of western Europe.\\" But no longer. Now we possess \\"one of the harshest criminal codes in the world.\\" The Death Penalty helps explain that turnaround, but only in the course of a complicated story in which different factors emerge at different times to play often unforeseeable roles...[This is a] superbly told history. --Paul Rosenberg, Denver Post and Rocky Mountain News Reviews of this book: Stuart Banner's lucid, richly researched book brings us, for the first time, a comprehensive history of American capital punishment from colonial times to the present. He describes the practices that characterized the institution at different periods, elucidates their ritual purposes and social meanings, and identifies the forces that led to their transformation. The book's well-ordered narrative is interspersed with individual case histories, that give flesh and blood to the account. --David Garland, Times Literary Supplement Reviews of this book: [An] informative, even-handed, chillingly fascinating account of why and how the U.S. government and many state governments decided to sponsor executions of criminals--even though innocent defendants might die, too. --Jane Henderson, St. Louis Post-Dispatch Reviews of this book: Stuart Banner's The Death Penalty is a splendidly objective achievement. Delightfully written, free of academic pretense, liberally sprinkled with apt references from contemporary sources, the book exhaustively explores the multifaceted evolution of America's penal practices. --Elsbeth Bothe, Baltimore Sun The Death Penalty is certain to be the definitive account of the American experience with capital punishment, from its beginnings in the seventeenth century, to the execution of Timothy McVeigh in 2001. This is a first rate piece of scholarship: well written, deeply researched, fascinating to read, and full of insights and good common sense. It is, in my view, one of the finest books to deal with this troubled and troubling subject. Historical and legal scholarship owe a debt of gratitude to Stuart Banner. --Lawrence Friedman, Stanford Law School A masterful book. This is a long overdue account which fills a huge gap in our understanding of America's long and complex relationship to state killing. With meticulous scholarship and lucid prose, Banner has written a compelling account of the place of capital punishment in our society. It sets the standard for all future scholarship on the history of the death penalty in America. --Austin Sarat, author of When the State Kills: Capital Punishment and the American Condition The Death Penalty, a study we have badly needed, is the first history of the nation's engagement--as well as its disengagement--with capital punishment from the country's earliest days to the present. With a sure grasp of the constitutional issues, Stuart Banner greatly advances a conversation at last underway about the rightness of putting people to death for having inflicted a death. Banner's greatest and most useful feat is remaining dispassionate on a subject that he cares deeply about--as do a growing number of his fellow Americans. --William S. McFeely, author of Proximity to Death The Death Penalty beautifully explains the changing paths traveled by supporters and opponents of capital punishment over the years. It explores a subject of enormous symbolic importance to Americans today, linking our views about the death penalty to our larger concerns about crime. --David Oshinsky, author of \\"Worse Than Slavery\\": Parchman Farm and the Ordeal of Jim Crow Justice Banner's book is a superbly detailed and textured social history of a subject too often treated in legal abstractions. It demonstrates how capital punishment has gnawed at the conscience and imagination of Americans, and how it has challenged their efforts to define themselves culturally, politically, and racially. --Robert Weisberg, Stanford Law School","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FzayhpsWJ5oC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Patricia Unterman's San Francisco Food Lover's Guide","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=N8O0xgEACAAJ&dq=Patricia+Unterman%27s+San+Francisco+Food+Lover%27s+Guide&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American PT boats in World War II","description":"American PT Boats in World War II is an illustrated study of the development, construction, tactics, and combat actions, of U.S. PT Boats.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=n01iPAAACAAJ&dq=American+PT+boats+in+World+War+II&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Brief History of Imbecility: Poetry and Prose of Takamura Kotaro","description":"Takamura Kotaro (1883-1956) drew on his studies in New York, London, and Paris to lay the foundations in Japan for Western-style Japanese sculpture through his intricate wood carvings and powerful bronzes. But Takamura also composed poems infused with startling energy, directness, and narrative clarity. Among the first to use the vernacular masterfully in verse, he has long been recognized as one of Japan's premier modern poets. The poetry included here is divided into three parts: \\"The Journey\\" represents a chronology of the poet's life; \\"Chieko\\" is a selection of poems about Takamura's wife which describes his devotion to her for more than thirty years through courtship and marriage, during her illness and insanity, and continuing after her death; and \\"A Brief History of Imbecility\\" is a sequence of twenty autobiographical poems composed in 1947. The essays, appearing in English for the first time, offer a more complete understanding of Takamura's relationship to art, his complex experience of Paris, and his views on beauty and creativity. Included here are \\"The Latter Half of Chieko's Life,\\" a moving prose complement to the Chieko poems, and \\"A Last Glance at the Third Ministry of Education Art Exhibition,\\" a scathing review of the modern art world, the first of its kind in Japan.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=88bjo4y6mLQC&dq=A+Brief+History+of+Imbecility:+Poetry+and+Prose+of+Takamura+Kotaro&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Broken Sky: #03","description":"Broken Sky is an epic tale of fighting fantasy, inspired by Japanese manga comics and videos.

This is a one-volume romp through a whole array of counterintuitive science experiments that require little more than common household items and a sense of curiosity. Prepare to have your surprise sensors on overload as Neil Downie stretches math, physics, and chemistry to do what they have never done before. This book describes twenty-nine unusual but practical experiments, detailing how they are done and the math and physics behind them. It will delight both casual and inveterate tinkerers. Of varying levels of complexity, the experiments are grouped in sections covering a wide field of physics and the borders of chemistry, ranging from dynamic mechanics (''Kinetic Curiosities'') to electricity (''Antediluvian Electronics'') and combustion (''Infernal Inventions''). The chapters are titillatingly titled, from ''Twisted Sinews'' and ''Mole Radio'' to ''A Symphony of Siphons'' and ''Tornado Transistor.'' More-detailed explanations, along with simple mathematical models using high-school level math, are given in boxes accompanying each experiment. Armchair scientists will welcome this edifying and entertaining alternative to idleness, not least for the buoyant prose, enriched by historical and literary anecdotes introducing each topic. With this book in hand, tinkerers, whether dabblers in science or devotees, students or teachers, need never again wonder how to impress friends, the judges at the science fair, and, not least, themselves.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=_f1ZDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Starting Over : How to Change Your Career or Start Your Own Business (Money: America's Financial Advisor)","description":"This invaluable guide offers a definitive game plan for anyone seeking to redefine his or her work status--for finding a new career or even starting a personal business.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NIOg5b90AB8C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Beyond the Great Snow Mountains: A Novel","description":"Originally appearing in short story magazines and never published in book form before, this is a collection of ten action packed adventure stories that abound with historical detail, fascinating characters and pure magic.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wgakAAAACAAJ&dq=Beyond+the+Great+Snow+Mountains:+A+Novel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Saint Vs Scotland Yard","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=XPf2PQAACAAJ&dq=The+Saint+Vs+Scotland+Yard&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Adsense: The Behavioral Science of Advertising","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KxX_bJfqavcC&dq=Adsense:+The+Behavioral+Science+of+Advertising&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Erotic World of Faery","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rFKVQgAACAAJ&dq=The+Erotic+World+of+Faery&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Damned if You do, Damned if You Don't","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Uy-VtgAACAAJ&dq=Damned+if+You+do,+Damned+if+You+Don%27t&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vicious Bliss: Fallen","description":"When the hatred feels like a spike in my brain, I'm going to search for a cure and not come back.

His works have influenced the fields of aesthetics, ethics, rhetoric, communication, semiotics, and sociology, as well as literary studies. Kenneth Burke's Logology and Literary Criticism emphasizes the importance of religious ideas and religious rhetoric in the development of his work. \\"My Outlaw Book\\" is how Burke himself often referred to his book The Rhetoric of Religion: Studies in Logology. Robert Garlitz closely studies the four essays on Logology and argues that they show us more clearly than many of his other books the analogical forms of thought that shape Burke's brilliant contributions to twentieth century American letters. Garlitz concludes his book with a logological meditation on Joseph Conrad's epic novel, Nostromo. An Appendix publishes for the first time seven letters Kenneth Burke wrote to Garlitz in 1980-81. \\"One of the best studies of The Rhetoric of Religion . . . . Quite good for its detail, accuracy, and clarity. Garlitz is especially adept at putting complex material in perspective. More than other commentators . . .he fully recognizes the centrality of the analogy at the heart of the book, embracing the logic-narrative problem that Burke contemplates.\\" --Ross Wolin author of The Rhetorical Imagination of Kenneth Burke. University of South Carolina Press, 2001. Robert Garlitz received his PhD from the University of Chicago and is Professor of English at Plymouth State University. He is the author of Robert Lax: Speaking Into Silence and with Rupert Loydell, Snowshoes Across the Clouds.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4CRBPgAACAAJ&dq=Kenneth+Burke%27s+Logology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE SPOILS OF WAR","description":"\\"It's striking how many of the presidents Americans venerate--Abraham Lincoln, George Washington, Franklin D.

Highly anticipated since its initial online appearance and immediate viral proliferation, first-time authors and ersatz Victorian scholars Joy DeLyria and Sean Michael Robinson have painstakingly created a satirical and fictional world based on the characters and narrative of television's most loved drama, The Wire. To be published in time to celebrate The Wire's tenth anniversary, Down in the Hole: the unWired World of H.B. Ogden is a collection of excerpts and illustrations from The Wire, a Victorian serial novel of DeLyria and Robinson's invention, credited to fictional author H.B. Ogden. Excerpts from Ogden's work are knit together by the history of the novel, its author and illustrator, and the adventures of the passionate archivists who uncovered this forgotten text. The Baltimore Sun writes: \\"...[This] quintessentially Victorian vision of Ogden's The Wire...is a scintillating piece of faux-scholarship. It's set in an alternate universe where the HBO series doesn't exist and where The Wire in any form, including Horatio Bucklesby Ogden's, has yet to be discovered.\\" Gawker asks: \\"So, how long before we can actually buy this illustrated version of The Wire?

From its beginnings, RET has dealt with problems of human disturbance. It presents a theory of how people primarily disturb themselves and what they can do, particularly with the help of a therapist or counselor, to reduce their disturbances (Ellis, 1957a,b, 1958a,b, 1962). Almost im mediately after the creation of RET, it became obvious that the meth odology could be used in many other fields-especially those involving human relations (Ellis & Harper, 1961a), and in love, sex, and marital relationships (Ellis, 1958a, 1960, 1963a,b; Ellis & Harper, 1961b). The evident popularity and clinical utility of RET in different cultures and its increasing application to contemporary problems of living indicate that rational-emotive therapy continues to be vital and dynamic. The growing appeal of RET may be due in part to its essentially optimistic outlook and humanistic orientation; optimistic because it pro vides people with the possibility and the means for change. Showing to people how their attitudes and beliefs are responsible for their emo tional distress and interpersonal problems (and not some out-of-con scious early childhood experience), awakens in them the hope that, in reality, they have some control over their destiny.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YkTaBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Morgue Mama: The Cross Kisses Back (Morgue Mama Mysteries (Hardcover))","description":"\\"Irascible, fearless and unapologetic, Maddy is a heroine cozy fans will embrace.\\" Publishers Weekly Newspaper librarian Maddy Sprowls never gives story ideas to the editors at The Hannawa Herald-Union.

Hollingdale in Penguin Classics. Nietzsche was one of the most revolutionary and subversive thinkers in Western philosophy, and Thus Spoke Zarathustra remains his most famous and influential work. It describes how the ancient Persian prophet Zarathustra descends from his solitude in the mountains to tell the world that God is dead and that the Superman, the human embodiment of divinity, is his successor. Nietzsche's utterance 'God is dead', his insistence that the meaning of life is to be found in purely human terms, and his doctrine of the Superman and the will to power were all later seized upon and unrecognisably twisted by, among others, Nazi intellectuals. With blazing intensity and poetic brilliance, Nietzsche argues that the meaning of existence is not to be found in religious pieties or meek submission to authority, but in an all-powerful life force: passionate, chaotic and free. Frederich Nietzsche (1844-1900) became the chair of classical philology at Basel University at the age of 24 until his bad health forced him to retire in 1879. He divorced himself from society until his final collapse in 1899 when he became insane. A powerfully original thinker, Nietzsche's influence on subsequent writers, such as George Bernard Shaw, D.H. Lawrence, Thomas Mann and Jean-Paul Sartre, was considerable. If you enjoyed Thus Spoke Zarathustra you might like Nietzsche's Beyond Good and Evil, also available in Penguin Classics.

Royal biographer Robert Lacey traces the Queen Mother's story through the milestones of our time - starting with her carefree childhood and using pictures to match her own history with that of the century. The future Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother became a public figure in 1923 with her engagement and marriage to 'Bertie', the shy and stammering Prince Albert, Duke of York, and it was her triumph to help transform her bashful husband into the brave and inspiring figure of King George VI. Through historic newspaper and magazine front pages (which record and recall the landmarks of our era), the epoch-making events of the century in which The Queen Motherp played a part are chronicled, and her role as mother, grandmother and great-grandmother in a rapidly changing world is also traced. She is a symbol of the best and bravest in Britain's recent past, but she is also a reminder of the enduring values to take in the next millennium - courage, civility, duty and grace.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ODwCHAAACAAJ&dq=The+Queen+Mother%27s+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Composition of scientific words;: A manual of methods and a lexicon of materials for the practice of logotechnics","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=llZQAAAAMAAJ&dq=Composition+of+scientific+words%3B:+A+manual+of+methods+and+a+lexicon+of+materials+for+the+practice+of+logotechnics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Women Players In England, 1500-1660: Beyond The All-Male Stage (Studies in Performance and Early Modern Drama)","description":"Offering evidence of women's extensive contributions to the theatrical landscape, this volume sharply challenges the assumption that the stage was 'all male' in early modern England. The editors and contributors argue that the pervasiveness of female performance affected cultural production, even on the professional London stages that used men and boys for women's parts. English spectators saw women players in professional and amateur contexts, in elite and popular settings, at home and abroad. Women acted in scripted and improvised roles, performed in local festive drama, and took part in dancing, singing, and masquing. English travelers saw professional actresses on the continent and Italian and French actresses visited England. Essays in this volume explore: the impact of women players outside London; the relationship between women's performance on the continent and in England; working women's participation in a performative culture of commerce; the importance of the visual record; the use of theatrical techniques by queens and aristocrats for political ends; and the role of female performance on the imitation of femininity. In short, Women Players in England 1500-1660 shows that women were dynamic cultural players in the early modern world.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=eKWbDwAAQBAJ&dq=Women+Players+In+England,+1500-1660:+Beyond+The+All-Male+Stage+(Studies+in+Performance+and+Early+Modern+Drama)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The adventures of Odysseus and the tale of Troy","description":"A retelling of the events of the Trojan War and the wanderings of Odysseus based on Homer's Iliad and Odyssey.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1-A6AAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Race and the Education of Desire: Foucault's History of Sexuality and the Colonial Order of Things","description":"Michel Foucault's History of Sexuality has been one of the most influential books of the last two decades. It has had an enormous impact on cultural studies and work across many disciplines on gender, sexuality, and the body. Bringing a new set of questions to this key work, Ann Laura Stoler examines volume one of History of Sexuality in an unexplored light. She asks why there has been such a muted engagement with this work among students of colonialism for whom issues of sexuality and power are so essential. Why is the colonial context absent from Foucault's history of a European sexual discourse that for him defined the bourgeois self? InRace and the Education of Desire, Stoler challenges Foucault's tunnel vision of the West and his marginalization of empire. She also argues that this first volume ofHistory of Sexuality contains a suggestive if not studied treatment of race. Drawing on Foucault's little-known 1976 College de France lectures, Stoler addresses his treatment of the relationship between biopower, bourgeois sexuality, and what he identified as  racisms of the state.  In this critical and historically grounded analysis based on cultural theory and her own extensive research in Dutch and French colonial archives, Stoler suggests how Foucault's insights have in the past constrained and in the future may help shape the ways we trace the genealogies of race. Race and the Education of Desire will revise current notions of the connections between European and colonial historiography and between the European bourgeois order and the colonial treatment of sexuality. Arguing that a history of European nineteenth-century sexuality must also be a history of race, it will change the way we think about Foucault.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vGRDpKo4JoUC&dq=Race+and+the+Education+of+Desire:+Foucault%27s+History+of+Sexuality+and+the+Colonial+Order+of+Things&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Duct Shui","description":"East meets West meets Duct Tape.

With its terrific die-cut package (just to hold it feels peaceful, like a perfectly balanced roll of duct tape), Duct Shui is the newest work of inspired nuttiness from the guys who created the 365 Days of Duct Tape Calendar, The Jumbo Duct Tape Book, and other books. In feng shui, wind chimes and bird feeders stimulate the flow of chi (energy) in a yard. In Duct Shui, attract birds by duct taping plastic decoys to a birdbath. In feng shui, placing a wind chime in the front area of a home or office will summon people to help you. Duct Shui teaches that if you really want help, get some duct tape stuck in your hair and then pull hard--the screams will draw plenty of attention. In feng shui, a wind chime over the stove will cure binge eating. Duct Shui says enough with the wind chimes already!-you can cure binge eating by placing duct tape firmly across your mouth.

In 1993 Sandra Dalka-Prysby, of Beverly Hills, Michigan, was a forty-eight-year-old wife and mother to three teenagers. Standing 5 feet 7 inches tall, she weighed 325 pounds and smoked up to three packs of cigarettes a day. But Sandy loved life. She wanted to be there when her children became adults, participating fully in her family's joys and triumphs. So she vowed to take charge of her eating habits, give up cigarettes, and lose 150 pounds. And within four years with the help of God, to whom she often prayed for strength; her family, who gave ongoing love and support; the editors of Family Circle magazine, who provided her with a nutritionist while chronicling her weight-loss for their millions of readers; and diet and exercise guru Richard Simmons, who stepped in when Sandy had reached a discouraging plateau she exceeded her goal. Giving up the cigarettes turned out to be the easy part, but by 1997 Sandy had at last succeeded in losing 170 pounds. And she has kept the weight off ever since. A self-proclaimed PD (Professional Dieter), Sandy is an unimpeachable witness to the struggles that many women (and men) will recognize from their own lives.

That s why we created the Georgia Real Estate License Exam Prep (GA-RELEP) the way we did. Since we have been managing real estate schools and developing curriculum for forty years, we know how all this works  or fails to work. GA-RELEP is comprehensive in that it contains both key content review and testing practice. And the text review is Georgia-specific  not just simplistic national content, but terse, relevant and accurate Georgia laws and regulations presented as a well-organized set of state  key point reviews  ideal for pre-test memorization. But let s not dismiss the importance of the national content either. GA-RELEP s national key point reviews are a succinct compression of tested national principles and practices that comprise the national portion of state license exams from coast to coast. Our content is drawn from our own national textbook, Principles of Real Estate Practice  one of the most widely used principles textbooks in the country. Finally, our national content, as well as our question selection, is further tailored to the state testing outline promulgated by AMP/PSI for Georgia. Thus the breadth and depth of the law reviews and test questions reflect the topic emphasis of your state s testing service and your Georgia license exam. A word about the test questions  GA-RELEP s testing practice section consists of ten national practice tests, three state practice tests, and one state exam sample test. The practice tests are roughly 50 questions in length and the sample test is 100 questions. The test questions are designed to cover the content covered by the law reviews  which reinforces your learning of the total body of information tested by your state exam. The questions are direct, to the point, and designed to test your understanding. When you have completed a given test, you can check your answers against the answer key in the appendix. You may also note that each question s answer is accompanied by a brief explanation, or  rationale  to further reinforce your understanding. In the end, as you know, it s all up to you. Unlike other publications, we are not going to tell you that using this book will guarantee that you pass your state exam. It still takes hard work and study to pass. But we have done our best here to get you ready. Following that, the most we can do is wish you the best of success in taking and passing your Georgia real estate exam. So good luck!!

In the diabolically imaginative Operation Shylock (1993), a character named Philip Roth encounters a look-alike who claims Roth's identity and who tours Israel promoting a bizarre reverse exodus of the Jews-proselytizing the \\"real\\" Roth is intent on stopping, even if it means impersonating his impersonator. \\"This splendidly wicked book\\" is how the critic Frank Kermode described Sabbath's Theater (1995), a comic masterpiece of epic proportions whose gargantuan hero, Mickey Sabbath, grieving the loss of his unsurpassable mistress, embarks on a turbulent journey into his past besieged by the ghosts of those who loved and hated him most.

In this bracing history, Kathleen D. McCarthy traces the evolution of these ideals, exploring the impact of philanthropy and volunteerism on America from 1700 to 1865. What results is a vital reevaluation of public life during the pivotal decades leading up to the Civil War. The market revolution, participatory democracy, and voluntary associations have all been closely linked since the birth of the United States. American Creed explores the relationships among these three institutions, showing how charities and reform associations forged partnerships with government, provided important safety valves for popular discontent, and sparked much-needed economic development. McCarthy also demonstrates how the idea of philanthropy became crucially wedded to social activism during the Jacksonian era. She explores how acts of volunteerism and charity became involved with the abolitionist movement, educational patronage, the struggle against racism, and female social justice campaigns. What resulted, she contends, were heated political battles over the extent to which women and African Americans would occupy the public stage. Tracing, then, the evolution of civil society and the pivotal role of philanthropy in the search for and exercise of political and economic power, this book will prove essential to anyone interested in American history and government.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=3k9gTcIIFf8C&dq=American+Creed:+Philanthropy+and+the+Rise+of+Civil+Society,+1700-1865&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Division Street America","description":"Life stories, based on personal interviews, of some seventy selected residents of Chicago, Ill. intended to portray changes occurring in the U.

Drawing on the author's unique data sets and years of research experience in the industry, 'Bottom-Line Call Center Management' helps call center managers evaluate their current status, implement cost-effective changes, and measure results of their changes to ensure a culture of accountability within the call center at all levels increasing the bottom line. The processes include an evaluation of current customer service representatives, defining, delimiting and assessing the labor shed of the center, and exploring the customer service representative's unique skills and leveraging those skills into a unique and dynamic work environment. Likewise, the process also determines the learning skills and competencies necessary to meet and exceed the basic requirements for all call centers. Furthermore, each step has a pre, in-process, and post evaluation to ensure projects are progressing according to plan. Lastly, all evaluations are measured against the bottom line through a return on investment (ROI) model. The framework for this book uses the culture of call centers, defined and lived through the customer service representatives, as the lens to view all processes, measurements, accountability and return on investment. This framework is critical since there has been much emphasis on technology-as-a-solution which treats the employees as a hindrance instead of the enablers of positive change. Likewise, customer service representatives eventually act as strong determinants of success with the call center and thus the bottom line.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=M_IJBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SPACE WAR.","description":"Michael J. Coumatos is a former U.S. Navy test pilot, ship's captain, and commodore; U.S. Space Command director of wargaming; and a government counterterrorism advisor. William Scott is a retired bureau chief of Aviation Week and Space Technology and a nine-year Air force veteran who served as aircrew on nuclear sampling missions. He is a six-time Royal Aeronautical Society \\"Journalist of the Year\\" finalist, and won the Society's 1998 Lockheed Martin Award for the \\"Best Defense Submission.\\" He also received both the 2006 and 2007 Messier-Dowty awards for \\"Best Airshow Submission.\\" With the help of New York Times bestselling author William J. Birnes, these renowned experts have joined forces to grippingly depict how the first hours of World War III might play out in the year 2010. Coumatos, Scott, and Birnes take the reader inside U.S. Strategic Command, where top military commanders, space-company executives, and U.S. intelligence experts are conducting a DEADSATS II wargame, exploring how the loss of critical satellites could lead to nuclear war. The players don't know that the war they are gaming has already begun, miles above them in the lifeless, silent cold of space. Jam-packed with the actual systems and secret technologies the United States has or will soon field to protect its space assets, Space Wars describes a near-future nuclear nightmare that terrorists will relish but politicians prefer to ignore. In a quieter, more peaceful time, Space Wars would be an exciting work of fiction. But with the United States now at war, Space Wars is all too real. .

In this innovative combination of place-writing, memoir and cultural study, Peter Davidson takes us on atmospheric walks through nocturnal cities in Britain, Europe and North America, and revisits the field paths of rural England.Surveying a wide range of material, the book extends, chronologically, from early romantic painting to contemporary fiction, and geographically, from the Low Countries to Japan. It features familiar lighted windows in English literature (in the works of poets such as Thomas Hardy and Matthew Arnold and in the novels of Virginia Woolf, Arthur Conan Doyle and Kenneth Grahame) and examines the painted nocturnes of James Whistler, John Atkinson Grimshaw and the ruralist Samuel Palmer. It also considers Japanese prints of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; German romanticism in painting, poetry and music; Proust and the painters of the French belle  poque; Ren  Magritte's 'L'Empire des Lumi res'; and North American painters such as Edward Hopper and Linden Frederick. By interpreting the interactions of art, literature and geography around this evocative motif, Peter Davidson shows how it has inspired an extraordinary variety of moods and ideas, from the romantic period to the present day.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=jCQ7zgEACAAJ&dq=Lighted+windows&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Like Color to the Blind","description":"The author of Nobody Nowhere and Somebody Somewhere shares her thoughts on falling in love, her unconventional relationship with Ian, a fellow autistic, and the joys and stresses of finding a soul mate. 35,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=UQkhAQAAIAAJ&dq=Like+Color+to+the+Blind&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Receptors: Models for Binding, Trafficking, and Signaling","description":"This book offers a bridge at the interface between engineering and cell biology, demonstrating how a mathematical modelling approach combined with quantitative experiments can provide enhanced understanding of cell phenomena involving receptor ligand interactions.

Spanish painting has shared this fate, seen as a dark reflection of devout piety, gravity, and austerity. Yet painting in Spain is far richer than this view supposes. During the Renaissance the splendid court of Philip II led a society made wealthy by a monopoly on New World trade. His Spain became a mecca for the finest artists of Europe, especially those from Italy and the Netherlands. During the next 250 years, a glorious art of painting flourished at the Habsburg and Bourbon courts in Madrid, and in the cities of Seville, Valencia, and Toledo: majestic, fiercely emotional, elegant, and urbane. From the insightful portraits of El Greco and Velazquez to the stark poetry of Zurbaran's religious works, from images of monarchic authority to courtly entertainments, painters working in Spain created an art of extraordinary stature, woven into the international world of Mannerism, the Baroque, and the Rococo. Janis Tomlinson traces these myriad influences as they developed from generation to generation of artists, culminating in the unique accomplishment of Francisco Goya, last of the old masters and first of the moderns.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=99fqAAAAMAAJ&dq=From+El+Greco+to+Goya:+Painting+in+Spain+1561-1828+(Perspectives)+(Trade+Version)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Metallica - Legendary Licks 1988-1996: An Inside Look at the Guitar Styles of Metallica (Legendary Licks Series)","description":"(Guitar Method).

As a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation, she embraces the notion that plants and animals are our oldest teachers. In Braiding Sweetgrass, Kimmerer brings these two lenses of knowledge together to take us on  a journey that is every bit as mythic as it is scientific, as sacred as it is historical, as clever as it is wise  (Elizabeth Gilbert). Drawing on her life as an indigenous scientist, and as a woman, Kimmerer shows how other living beings asters and goldenrod, strawberries and squash, salamanders, algae, and sweetgrass offer us gifts and lessons, even if we've forgotten how to hear their voices. In reflections that range from the creation of Turtle Island to the forces that threaten its flourishing today, she circles toward a central argument: that the awakening of ecological consciousness requires the acknowledgment and celebration of our reciprocal relationship with the rest of the living world. For only when we can hear the languages of other beings will we be capable of understanding the generosity of the earth, and learn to give our own gifts in return.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vmM9BAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mammals of Madagascar","description":"This title is a reduced format field guide adaptation of the highly acclaimed Pica Press book Mammals of Madagascar.

Its many neighborhoods boast diverse and shifting ethnic enclaves, an abundance of architectural styles, and an amazing number of churches and festivals. Generously illustrated with both historical and contemporary photographs, The Neighborhoods of Brooklyn is an indispensable and entertaining guide. Begun as an offshoot of The Encyclopedia of New York City, which provides much of the historical background, the book takes its character from the neighborhoods themselves, as detailed by the Citizens Committee for New York City and Brooklyn Borough Historian John Manbeck. Taking us on a tour of some 90 neighborhoods (including ghost neighborhoods that no longer exist), the book identifies the boundaries of each one through a neighborhood profile and a street map. There is also an essay on each neighborhood as well as an insert with practical tips on subways, buses, libraries, police precincts, fire departments, and hospitals. In addition, each entry includes eclectic neighborhood facts: Erasmus Hall Academy, in Flatbush, boasts such famous graduates as Barbra Streisand and Bobby Fischer; during Poland s 1990 elections, more than 5,000 absentee ballots were postmarked Greenpoint. The introduction by Kenneth T. Jackson gives an overview of Brooklyn, while an index allows readers to locate key sites within the borough. In 1898, when it was the third largest city in the United States, the City of Brooklyn merged with New York City to become one of its five boroughs. A century later it is time to salute this unique community in a book that will be an essential resource for past, present, and future residents. The Neighborhoods of Brooklyn is the first in a series on New York s five boroughs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=iKFqHAAACAAJ&dq=The+Neighborhoods+of+Brooklyn+(Neighborhoods+of+New+York+City)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rise and Fall of the Horror Film","description":"Dr. Soren's history of horror films stresses how essential it is that future filmmakers and critics realize the tremendous debt that the horror film owes to the history of art.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=DNknwAEACAAJ&dq=The+Rise+and+Fall+of+the+Horror+Film&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"And no birds sang","description":"Feisty icon; passionate Canadian; unrelenting foe of all pretension; energetic provocateur-at-large and most importantly, superb and dedicated writer, there cannot be a Canadian alive who is unaware of the legacy that is Farley Mowat. And No Bird Sang and A Whale for the Killing are the first books in a new Douglas & McIntyre library of handsomely redesigned paperback editions of Farley Mowat's work. Turned away from the Royal Canadian Air Force for his apparent youth and frailty, Farley Mowat joined the infantry in 1940. The young second lieutenant soon earned the trust of the soldiers under his command, and was known to bend army rules to secure a stout drink, or find warm -- if non-regulation -- clothing. But when Mowat and his regiment engaged with elite German forces in the mountains of Sicily, the optimism of their early days as soldiers was replaced by despair. With a naturalist's eyes and ears, Mowat takes in the full dark depths of war -- and his moving account of military service, and the friends he left behind, is also a plea for peace. It is one of the most searing and unforgettable World War II memoirs from any Canadian.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tEaWBQAAQBAJ&dq=And+no+birds+sang&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Year of the Death of Ricardo Reis","description":"From the Nobel Prize-winning author:  A capacious, funny, threatening novel  of wandering souls and political upheaval in 1930s Portugal (The New York Times Book Review). The year is 1936, and the dictator Ant nio de Oliveira Salazar is establishing himself in Portugal, edging his country toward civil war. At the same time, Dr. Ricardo Reis has returned home to Lisbon after a long sojourn in Brazil. What s brought him back is word that the great poet, Fernando Pessoa, has died.

Away from the crushing disapproval of his father, he lived alone in a teepee in the mountains. Everything he needed he built, grew or killed. He made his clothes from deer he killed and skinned before using their sinew as sewing thread. But he didn't stop there. In the years that followed, he stopped at nothing in pursuit of bigger, bolder challenges. He travelled the Mississippi in a handmade wooden canoe; he walked the two-thousand-mile Appalachian Trail; he hiked across the German Alps in trainers; he scaled cliffs in New Zealand. One Christmas, he finished dinner with his family and promptly upped and left - to ride his horse across America. From South Carolina to the Pacific, with his little brother in tow, they dodged cars on the highways, ate road kill and slept on the hard ground. Now, more than twenty years on, Eustace is still in the mountains, residing in a thousand-acre forest where he teaches survival skills and attempts to instil in people a deeper appreciation of nature. But over time he has had to reconcile his ambitious dreams with the sobering realities of modernity.

Certainly there is nothing like the fast-talking dame of screen comedies in the 1930s and '40s. In this engaging book, film scholar and movie buff Maria DiBattista celebrates the fast-talking dame as an American original. Coming of age during the Depression, the dame -- a woman of lively wit and brash speech -- epitomized a new style of self-reliant, articulate womanhood. Dames were quick on the uptake and hardly ever downbeat. They seemed to know what to say and when to say it. In their fast and breezy talk seemed to lie the secret of happiness, but also the key to reality. DiBattista offers vivid portraits of the grandest dames of the era, including Katharine Hepburn, Irene Dunne, Rosalind Russell, Barbara Stanwyck, and others, and discusses the great films that showcased their compelling way with words -- and with men. With their snappy repartee and vivid colloquialisms, these fast-talkers were verbal muses at a time when Americans were reinventing both language and the political institutions of democratic culture. As they taught their laconic male counterparts (most notably those appealing but tongue-tied American icons, Gary Cooper, Henry Fonda, and James Stewart) the power and pleasures of speech, they also reimagined the relationship between the sexes. In such films as Bringing Up Baby, The Awful Truth, and The Lady Eve, the fast-talking dame captivated moviegoers of her time. For audiences today, DiBattista observes, the sassy heroine still has much to say.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NvAaw_zOikUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chemical Process Control: An Introduction to Theory and Practice","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=EzNYOgAACAAJ&dq=Chemical+Process+Control:+An+Introduction+to+Theory+and+Practice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Animals and Men Their Relationship as Reflected in Western art from Prehistory to the Present Day","description":"The distinguished art historian examines man's attitudes towards animals throughout history and shows how these, often paradoxical, feelings have been continuously expressed in art.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gVuWQgAACAAJ&dq=Animals+and+Men+Their+Relationship+as+Reflected+in+Western+art+from+Prehistory+to+the+Present+Day&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lectures on Philosophy","description":"This book offers a comprehensive reinterpretation of J.L. Austin s philosophy. It opens new ways of thinking about ethics and other contemporary issues in the wake of Austin s philosophical work. Austin is primarily viewed as a philosopher of language whose work focused on the pragmatic aspects of speech. His work on ordinary language philosophy and speech act theory is seen as his main contribution to philosophy. This book challenges this received view to show that Austin used his most well-known theoretical notions as heuristic tools aimed at debunking the fact/value dichotomy. Additionally, it demonstrates that Austin s continual returns to the ordinary is rooted in a desire to show that our lives in language are complicated and multifaceted. What emerges is an attempt to think with Austin about problems that are central to philosophy today such as the question about linguistic inheritance, truth, the relationship between a language inherited and morality, and how we are to cope with linguistic elasticity and historicity. Lectures on a Philosophy Less Ordinary will appeal to scholars and advanced students working on Austin s philosophy, philosophy of language, and the history of analytic philosophy.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=kKw_EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Exalted Time of Tumult","description":"It is the second Age of Man, the age before the world turned.

And neither Kaysen s cheery gynecologist, nor her internist, nor a laconic  vulvologist  has the cure. An alternative health nurse suggests direct application of tea, baking soda, and boric acid. Others recommend novocaine, oatmeal,  bio-feedback,  and anti-depressants. Nothing works. As sex becomes more and more painful, Kaysen s relationship with her boyfriend disintegrates and she turns to her best friends, her wicked sense of humor, and finally wry self-reflection to get herself through. Using this unusual lens, Kaysen challenges us to think in new ways about the centrality and power of sexuality. The Camera My Mother Gave Me is an unexpected and revelatory book from one of our most candid, insightful and consistently surprising writers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XPPR0FYmRsgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hope the Archbishop","description":"David Hope has recently retired as Archbishop of York. The son of a builder from Wakefield in Yorkshire, Hopes rise to high office in the Church of England was meteoric. A man of deep piety and spiritual depth, Hope has also earned a reputation as a man who sorts out problems with Yorkshire briskness and efficiency. He sorted out the financial chaos of the Diocese of London and he has solved the problems of many an errant clergyman by the sound exercise of ecclesiastical discipline. The undisputed leader of the Anglo Catholic wing of the Church of England, he has addressed Evangelical Rallies as well as Euchasistic Congresses. In this biography, Rob Marshall paints the portrait of one of the great ecclesiatical figures of the post war years. Much of the book is extremely funny- not least the account of how Hope sorted out the corruption of St Stephen's House, the Anglo Catholic Seminary in Oxford. Most moving of all is the chapter about the Tatchell affair. For the first time ever, here is a full account of how Hope coped with the personal strain of being hounded by Peter Tatchell, the founder of Outrage, who determined to 'out' him and in the process destroy his career. At a time when the Church of England is torn apart by strife and dispute, this book demonstrates that Hope's Christian vision is one which may still give Anglicans courage to face the future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=rmPaAAAACAAJ&dq=Hope+the+Archbishop&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Geisha's Granddaughter","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=QdpF7YfIFcYC&dq=The+Geisha%27s+Granddaughter&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From the Painted Stick","description":"Pete Prougert keeps to himself, or tries to. As a substitute teacher in the middle of Massachusetts, Pete finds himself remembering the life of a child born before recorded time. Was this his incarnation? Is he being forwarded a celestial memo or is his interest in the marginally suspicious student named Kevin an obsession of hysteria caused by his isolation from society? Kevin isn't just an outcasted and rebellious student. His anger plagues him and sets him on a mission for violence. In Gordon Goulden's second novel, From the Painted Stick, social mores mingle in a cocktail of mysticism, angst and the eternal hope for life beyond death.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=tzfcPLNGUosC&dq=From+the+Painted+Stick&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Asimov's Science Fiction, October 1991","description":"In The Year's Best Science Fiction: Ninth Annual Collection, Gardner Dozois produces another volume in the series that Locus calls 'the field's real anthology-of-record.'
