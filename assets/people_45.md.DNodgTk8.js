That was about the SAS in WWII Fitzroy Maclean was part of that unit. I had been looking to see if anyone else in that unit had written anything. I am glad I found this book. The first SAS guys were amazing people. Fitzroy Maclean happen to be one of the highest educated of those men. You take a guy who has the hardness and darning to be one of the first SAS guys. Then you add his education and diplomatic training to the mix and you have one heck of a combination. This book is really about a guy who is bigger then life living it to the fullest. Please read it."},{"Title":"Eastern approaches","review":"The adventures that this man experienced comes to few people and could only happen during a period of history in which cataclysmic events occurred over a period of several years.

Inside history related from a first hand witness. It brings to life the reality of the times."},{"Title":"Eastern approaches","review":"This is an exciting autobiography, which I have read and reread over the years. Of particular interest is the author's introduction into the SAS.This book will become a permanent fixture in your library."},{"Title":"Eastern approaches","review":"Pre WWII, Maclean finagled trips through parts of the USSR where no westerner had previously been, even crossing into Afghanistan from the north at one point. He spent much of WWI aiding Marshal Tito's effort to drive the Germans out of the Balkans. Fascinating stuff, this, eloquently written and he's a damn good storyteller."},{"Title":"Eastern approaches","review":"This book is of great historical value. The narration is witty and elegant. I would recomant it to everybody interested in European history."},{"Title":"Eastern approaches","review":"The episodes described in this classic adventure are so outlandish, colorful, and gripping that one might almost mistake them for promotional material from a 1940's matinee poster: &quot;Thrill as our hero journeys into remote Central Asia! Tremble as he observes Stalin's show trials! Cheer as he battles Nazis in North Africa and aids our brave allies in Yugoslavia!&quot;However, Sir Fitzroy's integrity, understated compassion, and flinty humanity keep these accounts focused, precise, and grounded in reality. This book is valuable not only as a description of far-flung lands and critical battles, but as a testiment to all that was best in his generation of citizen-soldiers. MacLean restores dignity to the term &quot;aristocrat&quot;. He is the man you'd want by your side as you marched into hell - odds are, he'd get you in and out again."},{"Title":"Eastern approaches","review":"In Paris he served as a member of the foreign service, from there he transferred to Moscow and while in Moscow ventured by train and by foot into regions of that country off limits to foreigners and he did so pursued by the N.K.V.D.(pre K.G.B. secret police). Later he was parachuted into Yugoslavia to meet up with Tito's forces and there greatly contributed to the resistance against the Nazis. The most exciting part of this though(though its all unbelievably exciting)is reading about his part in the North African campaigns. Maclean was a brilliant practitioner in the T.E. Lawrence brand of fighting, in fact there is a photo of him in full desert headress driving a machine gun clad rover over the dunes on one of his many hit and run strikes. He reported directly to Churchill and the two would meet in Cairo. A gentleman fighter if there ever was one. Would love to read the transcripts of those conversations. This is the Lawrence of Arabia of WWII. Fascinating portraits of Russia and its eastern provinces in the thirties, of Englands temporary and uneasy alliance with Titos communist forces in Yugoslavia, and those impossibly romantic desert scenes of gentleman Fitzroy leading caravans of jeeps and rovers behind heavily defended enemy lines to supposedly unreachable destinations and against all odds winning victory after victory. Hip Hip Hooray."},{"Title":"Eastern approaches","review":"This is one of my all time top 3 books. I first read this when I was 15 and was swept up in the adventure and daring; it's something I've read many times since. Fantastically well written, it evokes a lost world of British honour, one far more real than James Bond. Talking of lost worlds I would strongly recommend to anyone reading this The Lost World by Arthur Conan Doyle, another rip- roaring yarn."},{"Title":"Eastern approaches","review":"This is a must read for anyone who likes real-life adventuring set in the periods just prior to, and then during, WW II. A can't-put-down, fast-moving account of a young career diplomat's (turned high-danger soldier's) high-spirited but deadly serious exploits in front-line leadership. It moves through three exciting acts: pre-WW II diplomacy in the Caucasus region, desert warfare in N. Africa, and finally, liaising and fighting with Tito's Partisans in 1942-44 Jugoslavia.History is brought to life in MacLean's rich tapestry of personal experiences spiced as they are with close shaves and harrowing escapades. This is one of the best books of its kind, this will keep you on the edge of your seat. A real-life Boys Own epic, it never loses either its flow of humour or its masterful literary style. MacLean is a gifted story teller."},{"Title":"Eastern approaches","review":"In the mid-thirties Fitzroy Maclean was a junior diplomat at the British embassy in Paris. Bored with the pleasant but undemanding routine, he requested a posting to Moscow, and &quot;Eastern Approaches&quot; opens with Maclean on a train, pulling out of Paris. Most of this first section of the book covers his repeated attempts to explore Soviet central Asia. He reached Bokhara, Samarkand, Tashkent and many other places, and though there are sadly few pictures it is a riveting story -- fighting Soviet bureaucracy; being trailed by the NKVD; negotiating with locals for food and a place to sleep. At one point he manages with difficulty to persuade the Soviets to let him cross into Afghanistan: communicating primarily in sign language he manages to obtain an escort to Mazar-i-Sharif, through a lawless area with a cholera outbreak.Maclean was in Moscow until late 1939, and so was present during the great Stalinist purges. One long chapter is devoted to one of the largest of these, in which Bukharin, Yagoda and other stalwarts of the Stalinist regime were accused (and of course convicted) of heinous crimes. The details of the trial, and the responses of the accused, are utterly fascinating; Maclean's analysis equally so.When war broke out, Maclean was prevented from enlisting at first because of his position as a diplomat. He eventually managed to sign up by a subterfuge, and in North Africa Maclean distinguished himself in the early actions of the newly formed SAS. He rose from private to officer rank, and Churchill personally chose him to lead a liaison mission to central Yugoslavia, where Tito and his partisans were emerging as a major irritant to the German control of the Balkans. The last third of the book recounts how over eighteen months Maclean built Allied/Partisan cooperation from nothing to a key element in the last phases of the war. By the end, Maclean was a Major-General, and a friend of Tito's.Maclean is a fine writer, with the British gift for understatement and wry humour. His exploits are said to have formed the basis for the character of James Bond, though Maclean would never confirm or deny this. The sequence when he personally kidnaps a Persian general who is collaborating with the Germans is certainly straight out of a Bond film. The book is spectacularly entertaining: if you have any taste for history, adventure, travel writing or war-time memoirs, this is as good as it gets."},{"Title":"Eastern approaches","review":"This book is one of my three or four favorite books of all time. I am rereading it to keep up with current events; Macleans's adventures in Kazakhstan and Afghanistan in the 1930s give a view of this part of the world that is still relevant; he captures all the sights, sounds, and smells.The book is really three books:Part 1 contains Maclean's travels through the Soviet Union as a diplomat, spy, and adventurer in the late 1930s, including his description of the show trial of Bukharin, and his comical adventures going to see Samarkand, Tashkent, and Bokhara -- more out of romantic curiosity than for conducting any official business. A wonderful book about Russia under Stalin.Part 2 -- Maclean joins the war, even though the foreign office has forbidden him to leave his post; he does so by running for Parliament (hence loving his civil servant status), and after winning election, he promptly &quot;runs away&quot; to join his regiment. He ends up in the Long Range Desert Group, doing all kinds of commando work agains the Germans in North Africa.Part 3 -- Maclean becomes the liason to Tito, whom the British are not sure even exists, by parachuting into Yugoslavia. Maclean and his team supply Tito's partisans and coordinate raids that tie down German divisions. Maclean cannot keep Tito from being other than what he is -- a communist, and so the book ends a little poignantly.This is one of the finest -- perhaps the finest -- first hand account of history, ranking right up there with Chruchill's 5 volumes on the second world war. This book is told on a much lower level, but the canvas Maclean covers is nearly as broad.How this was never made into a movie with Sean Connery is beyond me. Some people maintain that Maclean was the prototype of James Bond, but there is a much more human, almost Don Quixote quality to him that makes him and his book unforgettable."},{"Title":"Eastern approaches","review":"Winston Churchill greatly admired TE Lawrence, who as &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; led the Arab revolt in WW1. In WW2, Churchill equally admired Fitzroy MacLean, another well-born Brit who tied his fortunes to a foreign guerrilla warfare operation. But where Lawrence was doomed and dark and full of his own agonies, MacLean carries his charm and wit (and what Australians would call &quot;a larrikin streak&quot;) throughout his extraordinary adventures. If MacLean had not existed he would have had to be invented. We meet him as a 20-something diplomat, subverting Stalin's spies in a series of solo explorations into the forbidden zones of Central Asia. He also observes, and astutely analyses, the infamous Soviet show-trial in which Bukharin and other heroes of the 1917 revolution met their fate. When war breaks out, he contrives to escape the diplomatic service, signing on as a lowly private. He ends the war as a general, his breast weighed down with medals from Britain, Yugoslavia, and even the Soviet Union. He is 34. This is the story of those days - racy, funny, bizarre, and full of daring. His adventures with the legendary SAS commando, engaged in lightning strikes deep in Rommel's rear in the North Africa desert are gripping stuff. Selected by Churchill himself to parachute into the Balkans, MacLean takes a frontline role with Tito in arranging the ultimate defeat of German forces there. Essential background reading for anyone remotely interested in the Balkan tragedies of the last decade or so. Soldier, diplomat, linguist, wit, Fitzroy MacLean was reputedly the inspiration for the original James Bond. Undoubtedly a beneficiary of the British class system, he was also an ornament to it. 50 years after its first publication, this remains a unique window to some of the most extraordinary upheavals of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Eastern approaches","review":"For those of you who are not in the know Fitzroy Maclean and his adventures served as the basis for conceiving the original James Bond Novels. Ian Fleming and Maclean worked closely with each other during the war.This is the ultimate book for those who would yearn for the active life --- who wonder what it is like to be trailed by soviet spies; who think of the thrill of sleeping in pine scented forests of the Balkans while being hunted by Nazis; who would don a turban and travel with the real hard men of the Long Range Desert Group (none of those softy American seals, marines and the like) into the Western Desert during WWII --- but are too engrossed in reading to leave their armchairs.Reading this book makes one realise what it really is like to live an active life. Throw away your Anthony Robbins, if you want inspiration read this book."},{"Title":"Eastern approaches","review":"This is a truly unique book and comparable only with Churchill's 'My Early Life' as an adventure history.

Clear interpretation of the war time state of Yugoslavia from the man who pursuaded Churchill to support Tito as the only real opposition to the Nazi occupation.

Like all other such concepts, our everyday experience with human mercy is only partially adequate for its full understanding. Nonetheless, deeper understanding of Divine Mercy can fundamentally reshape and uplift our own attitude and practice of mercy.In this his second encyclical, Pope John Paul II picks up where he had left off in \\"The Redeemer of Man\\" (Redemptor Hominis).

In fact, it could be argued that all of the Christian message could be summed up in the idea of a merciful God whose every salvific action stems from the utmost transcendental mercy. We are all called not only to partake of that mercy, but also to extend it in our own lives towards all those that we come in touch with.One of the most important points that Pope makes in this encyclical is that mercy, when properly understood, is not about the assertion of a power differential between two individuals and/or institutions. Mercy is intrinsically about the communion of two parties, and ultimately an opportunity to participate in the inner life of God. The dichotomy between mercy and justice that is often posited in certain intellectual circles is a false dichotomy. True justice presupposes mercy, and is its intrinsic and inseparable attribute.

If you have not read it this book is a great choice. If you have you might find \\"The Myth of Laziness\\" redundant at times.The central message of the book is exactly the same as in \\"A Mind at A Time\\" namely that academic non-performance is a result of many distinct factors and cannot be adequately addressed as long as people trivialize it as \\"laziness\\" or \\"dumbness\\".Levine identifies several specific cognitive deficiencies that can result in non-performance: attention, memory, language, spatial ordering, sequential ordering, motor, higher thinking, and social thinking. Armed with correct diagnosis of the underlying causes the teacher can tailor an effective individual approach to help a student who would otherwise be doomed to languish in remedial education classes with all the stigma of retardation that's attached to it.If you are just curious about the research in this field you would probably be better off with \\"A Mind At A Time\\". If you are a practicing education professional you might benefit from reading both books."},{"Title":"The Myth of Laziness","review":"This book is organized as a series of case studies building up to three chapters of recommendations.Levine's insight into children is stunning. It is why people come from all over the country to see him in North Carolina. I am sure he wishes as ardently as anybody that his genius were transferrable. While this book gives one an appreciation of his methods, it also highlights how subjective the judgments really are. Any parent who has been through the rounds of physical therapists, speech therapists, child psychologists, ritalin, Prozac, tutors, school counsellors, etc. etc. will know that not all experts have the same powers of perception, and they certainly don't all agree.I of course love the advice with which I agree. Turn off the TV! Have the kids read. Practice writing. He gives some very concrete and useful advice on how to do this... forms you can copy and suggest that your child's teachers hand out with assignments.As another reviewer suggests, examining the unique balance of skills and weaknesses in each child, and tailoring life and learning plans to meet their special needs, takes a tremendous amount of resources. Public school classroom teachers charged with 35 young minds, or a modestly paid and trained counsellor responsible for a whole school cannot possibly be expected to handle every child's issues.There are always alternatives -- many, confusing and conflicting -- for parents with the money and time to investigate them. The sad reality is that society just can't devote enough resources to give all kids the attention that would benefit them. How to apply Levine's insights and techniques to as many kids as possible within what voters are willing to spend is an interesting question."},{"Title":"The Myth of Laziness","review":"Mel Levine's first book \`A Mind at a Time' succeeded in taking a common sense approach to the important subject of learning types. This book does the same thing, but focuses on one specific functional challenge - that of a lack of productivity.1. Levine continues to assert that different learning styles require different teaching strategies. As a result, he does not believe that any child is inherently lazy. While this is likely true for young children, it does not seem to be necessarily the case for adolescents or adults. (Levine would disagree) That is, laziness can be learned and even chosen later in life. In fact, I often find myself choosing the way of the sloth - to my own frustration and embarrassment.2. Levine identifies a number of causes of low performance. Some of these are internal like organizational problems, poor ability to verbally express, or poor writing skills. However, these types of things don't seem to be \`causes' as much as they do \`results' or \`symptoms'. He does go on to briefly discuss external factors like socioeconomic background, family life, and negative role models. Now these seem to be more root-causes - however, he doesn't spend much time on these, which I found to be disappointing.3. The thing that I do like about Levine is that he develops suggestions for what parents can do to encourage productive output in children. Additionally, he provides objective means for identifying if the problem is internal or environmental. I happen to believe the vast majority of people fall into the latter category - at least as the initial influence. However, it seems laziness becomes a choice as well. So, there's a bit of controversy here - which makes the book interesting and relevant.4. Lastly, Levine doesn't leave the reader in an ethereal and contemplative world, but brings problem solving down to a real-life level by providing worksheets, which assist children in planning stories and reports - to get their minds working.5. It seems it's so necessary to start fostering creativity, activity, and expression at a young age. Additionally, abundant parental praise related to accomplishments is also very needed. In short, this is a good book, however it would have been helpful if Levine had focused more in the area of relationships."},{"Title":"The Myth of Laziness","review":"I am a college student, and my mother is a high school administrator. During a break I found this in one of her stacks of books and read it on a whim. The result took me by surprise: The majority of this book resonated deeply with me, and has had a profound affect on my schooling ever since. I am a consistent underachiever, and I realized that I am like many of the kids Dr. Levine is working with (this is a revelation one of the parents in the book had as well). Understanding that I'm not \\"just lazy\\" allowed me to look objectively at what I have going for me and have already achieved, while reminding me that my significant problems in studying are exactly that-problems-and therefore I can work around them or try to improve myself in those areas.It's important to note that this is not a self-help book, and I wouldn't count on too many people having an experience like mine. However, I found this book to be excellent way to understand why seemingly capable students (me, for instance) have difficulties, and how to fix those difficulties. I don't believe that Dr. Levine lays all of the blame on educators as if they don't try to reach difficult students; his thesis is that people (parents; teachers; and, even though he doesn't say it, the students themselves) sometimes don't know how to approach a student who is having difficulty, and therefore cannot help this \\"lazy\\" student."},{"Title":"The Myth of Laziness","review":"Heard the taped version of THE MYTH OF LAZINESS, written andread by Dr. Mel Levine--a professor of pediatrics at the University ofNorth Carolina Medical School.Levine persuasively makes the point that children and adultsaren't really lazy when they can be seen not working up to theirpotential . . . rather, he contends that &quot;everybody yearns to beproductive&quot; . . . and what happens is that they are simplyexperiencing &quot;output failure&quot; due to different neuro-developmentalweaknesses.While the aforementioned may come across as gobbledygook, itreally isn't because of Levine's use of case studies . . . you'llbe able to relate to the seven children and adults profiled, eitherbecause you will see yourself and/or others you know.I liked the last few chapters best because they were devotedto concrete suggestions for what can be done to help supposedlylazy folks . . . tips on how to cultivate writing skills, as well ashow to set up an organized home office, are presented . . . also,teachers are urged to take into account the individuality of theirstudents' learning skills.Furthermore, I found several worksheets in the book version (that Iskimmed after listening to the tapes) that can be most helpfulto help students plan their stories and reports."},{"Title":"The Myth of Laziness","review":"This book is just as relevant as Dr. Levine's earlier books, such as &quot;All Kinds of Minds&quot; and &quot;Keeping a Head in School,&quot; which I read when my son was in grade school. I've also attended a conference where Dr. Levine was the keynote speaker. All of his advice was a tremendous help to me in understanding the reasons why our son was struggling so much in school. He was the classic example of the &quot;lazy&quot; student. Fortunately, he was in a small private school where teachers recognized the problem immediately, he was tested, and by understanding his learning disabilities when he was 6 years old, he successfully completed K-12 and is now in his sophmore year at college. I firmly believe the reason he is where he is today is that we kept him out of public schools, in environments where the teachers understood the way he needed to learn. He was never labeled as &quot;disabled&quot; or &quot;special needs&quot;, or put into &quot;special classes.&quot; The only difference between the schools he attended and public schools is that the teachers were not bound to the inflexible &quot;teach to the test&quot; format and could offer a range of learning experiences for their students based on individual ability. Teachers who &quot;get&quot; Levine's teachings know how to approach these kids, and our son is living proof that such enlightened teaching methods achieve success for the student.A previous review, written by a teacher, is a typical example of the mind-set of some public school teachers toward students who don't fit the public school model of learning. Blame the student -- it's not the school system's/teacher's problem that they're unwilling to recognize there's no such thing as a &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach to education. Yes, there may be some students who, because of home environment, will have difficulty ever achieving their potential, but too many kids have been written off too soon because of the rigid public school bureaucracy.It wasn't easy to find the money for tuition for 12 years of school, and we're struggling to pay college tuition/expenses now, but we'll never regret a single sacrifice or a single dime we spent. And we'll always be grateful to Dr. Levine for continuing to educate the public about misunderstood children."},{"Title":"The Myth of Laziness","review":"As a career coach I deal with clients who feel embarrassed about their own lack of motivation. And there's a lot of hype these days about &quot;assessments&quot; that are one step away from witchcraft. Here's the Real Deal.Levine argues that most people want to learn and succeed in their lives. What holds them back often is the way their brains are wired. (Okay, he's a lot more scientific.)I can personally relate to some of his examples. I've always had trouble controlling pieces of paper and my desk always looks as though I'd dumped a wastebasket upside down. Throughout my life people have sighed, &quot;You've got to get organized!&quot; Yet I've learned to accomplish a lot by compensating -- once I realized it was a cognitive deficit.And, as Levine points out, adults have an easier time than children. We don't have to excel in so many different areas.Levine acknowledges his own quirks. Don't give me anything you want back, he says, and if you want me to sign something, stand there till you get my signature! I can relate to those too.The lesson is that nearly everyone has strengths as well as functional deficits. If a child doesn't have the coordination for basketball or baseball, he or she can try another sport, like weight-lifting or wrestling.Levine presents knowledge in the form of case studies, which are both educational and easy to follow. He's honest: there are few Cinderella stories and happy endings. That's the part of the book that's most difficult to deal with. His center provides some of the best testing and counseling in the world, yet not everyone will be responsive. It's not enough to receive a diagnosis: you also need a supportive environment, especially if you're a child.I didn't care for Levine's chapter on &quot;what might have happened.&quot;I'd rather have seen composite cases or cases with details disguised, with stories of &quot;real&quot; endings. And people need to be aware of non-psychiatric settings that allow people to make progress. I've taken well-designed, non-competitive exercise classes that helped everyone's coordination -- including some who could barely shuffle into the class when they started.However, Levine deserves credit for not succumbing to the simplicities of the self-help genre. You won't find self-diagnostic tests or &quot;ten things you can do...&quot; here. He'sdrawn the line in the sand: he's writing as a physician and scientist.Perhaps the greatest contribution of this book will be to alert teachers, managers, parents and everyone to the great variety of learning skills and the possibility for cognitive deficits. Too many children are ridiculed and even punished for &quot;laziness&quot; and worse, and even adults can be hassled by ignorant bosses, spouses and friends."},{"Title":"The Myth of Laziness","review":"I bought this book because I took several courses with Dr. Levine while he was at Boston Children's and because of the children in my practice. It is superb. I have started recommending it to the parents in my practice. It explains very succintly and precisely various types of learning issues and how to handle them. It also helps parents be their children's advocate. Children should not be kept back unless the teachers know what is happening to that particular child. Children are starting school too late and too much is required of them when developmentally they are not able. Why is it that teachers accept differences in their colleagues but not among children. It is time that we stop putting round pegs in square holes. It is time that teachers teach better with more compassion and understanding. This is what Dr. Levine has been trying to do for years."},{"Title":"The Myth of Laziness","review":"Dr. Levine's book, The Myth of Laziness is great at breaking down why children and adolescents can have struggles with academics and even day to day tasks. I am also a developmental and behavioral pediatrician and in my work with children, parents, and teachers, have found that demystifying why a child/adolescent is struggling is the first step to developing a plan of both intervention and accommodation.Too often, however, the struggling child becomes a struggling adolescent before the problems are determined, if at all. This leads the individual to learn that it is much easier and less stressful to get a D or F by not doing the work rather than struggling with it for hours just to be told it is not worthy of a higher grade. Some do give up in elementary school but most continue to try until they hit middle school, when the demands multiply exponentially and they still haven't mastered the foundational skills.Dr. Levine wants people to actually spend time watching how the child attempts to take in, process, store, retrieve, and output the information. There are many soft neurologic signs that provide clues to the intensity of mental energy that is actually going on to try to comply, such as mouth movements, and the famous tongue sticking out, the fingers/knuckles on the other hand moving slightly as the student is trying to write, the keeping of the eyes close to the paper as they try to write, and for more than a few an increase in general motor movement as the brain goes into overdrive trying to send energy and information to the brain. One can also see the child close their eyes or appear to look upward as they are trying to figure something out, which is another involuntary sign of mental activity.These are signs that Dr. Levine teaches the physicians, teachers, social workers, and psychologists who take his classes in Chapel Hill. Unfortunately the larger number of those in the education field are unaware of that since it is not taught in the colleges.His books try to give a picture of how to look at the child's processing and learning styles and how to work with them.These students don't start out lazy and unmotivated. They learn to be this way as a life saving strategy from appearing stupid."},{"Title":"The Myth of Laziness","review":"Depending on what sort of \\"laziness\\" you are dealing with, you might find this book to be extremely helpful; or you might find it to be not at all helpful. By laziness, Mel evine is referring to not wanting to read, not wanting to write, not wanting to complete class assignments, and so forth.He covers a number of case studies and tells how various learning difficulties contribute to apparent laziness. I found his insights to be impressive and right on target in most cases, but I also thought that in a small minority of cases, he misunderstood the student and missed important clues.You are probably more likely to like this book and to find its suggestions helpful if you are from a white collar family than a blue collar family. I came from a farm family, and it became more and more apparent to me as I read Mel Levine's book, that what he valued as \\"work\\" and what my parents valued would have clashed greatly. In fact, I was called \\"lazy\\" for pursuing the very kinds of things that Mel Levine is trying to get others to pursue. When read from my background, Mel Levine's background as a upper middle class (or above) doctor serving upper middle class (or above) clients came through loud and clear.Overall, I found the book interesting, insightful, and possibly helpful, depending on what you are dealing with."},{"Title":"The Myth of Laziness","review":"It is an important book, as it tries to refute the myth of laziness. Levine argues that the so called \`laziness\`, is actually the result of a neurodevelopmental problem, and that every child \`yearns to be productive\`. According to his analysis a broad spectrum of neuro-development dysfunctions may prevent children from reaching their potential. I found Both claims very problematic as they ignor the social construction of reality as a major determinate factor."},{"Title":"The Myth of Laziness","review":"This book is truly horrible in every possible way. The book is extremely redundant (obviously to fill up pages in an effort to make a longer book out of minimal material), and is full of trivial and inconsequential information about Dr. Levine's young subjects.Evidently, Levine is very pleased with his lame attempt at being an entertaining writer, but the truth is that this is the most poorly written book of any kind ever produced! It is full of the most ridiculous examples of verbal circumlocution that I have ever witnessed. These polysyllabic phrases alternate with other sections that are extremely provincial and that seem to often digress from the subject at hand.Even though the author apparently has fairly extensive scientific training (Levine is an M.D., after all), this book is totally unscientific--full of personal antecdotes and conjecture, without any references to scientific studies and without any comparisons to control groups or test subjects. There is also no consideration given to the large number of variables that are affecting each of Levine's patients that he writes about here.Basically, the book is simply a collection of euphemisms for describing laziness and other character weaknesses and flaws. The labels that Levine uses, such as \\"mental energy dysfunction\\", \\"energy crisis\\", \\"low motor turnout\\", \\"extreme social distractibility\\", and \\"active-working-memory dysfunction\\" are laughable.What the poor young subjects written about in this book really need are parents, teachers and other adult mentors who actually care enough about them to have high expectations of them. They need adults who are willing to make them behave, do their homework, go to bed on time, etc. Having their negative characteristics simply given more flattering names is not going to help these poor young subjects one bit.This book does have a catchy title (a good hook), but there are many other books that address the same subject that are so much better. I could only recommend this book to those who suffer from extreme insomnia. I guarantee that it WILL put you to sleep fast!"},{"Title":"The Myth of Laziness","review":"This book is an excellent resource for teachers (reg & sped) regarding the so-called \\"lazy\\" student in your classroom.

Since children's learning ability can be hindered by many factors, the author suggests to find out what is the problem and develop a strategy to circumvent it. Easier said than done. The cases presented in the book do not cover all situations but can be helpful to clarify the issue and to understand better the mechanisms at work. For that the book deserves credit. As an aside, this book and A Mind at a Time by the same author have some policy implications that could and should be developed more thoroughly by dr. Levine. There is policy-maker material here."},{"Title":"The Myth of Laziness","review":"My son's teacher has exactly the same opinion as the reviewer that wrote High Hopes Dashed.

In my work at a community college, I see far too many teenagers who are the product of this sort of attitude. These students do poorly on exams and then protest their failing grades by telling me (for example) that they are visual learners and cannot absorb material from spoken lectures. Somehow, the onus for their education has been shifted to my shoulders, not their own. Had I read the blurb on the back cover, I would have known immediately that this book was not for me: &quot;Every kid would prefer to do his homework and be praised for its quality.... Therefore, when someone's output is too low, we shouldn't accuse or blame that individual. Instead, we should wonder what could be thwarting that person's output....&quot; (news flash: every kid would NOT prefer to do his homework.)Like too many other books on education in this day and age, this book focuses on how teachers and parents should change their standards to accommodate students, not on the work the students themselves need to do to adapt to the educational system. Dr. Levine creates a laundry list of ways in which teachers should reduce the expectations they have for &quot;lazy&quot; children, including asking them questions that only require &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answers rather than detailed responses (I don't know how a teacher is then supposed to evaluate the child's capacity for complex thought), not requiring them to solve problems on the board in front of other students, not penalizing them for spelling and handwriting, allowing them to give oral reports instead of written ones, letting them use calculators during math tests, and giving them extended time (or fewer questions) on tests. These may all be appropriate responses -- but not for the regular classroom. With today's overfull class sizes, a teacher could well end up with five or six children in a class, all of whom require different special accommodations. This is an impossible situation for a teacher. These children need to be in some sort of special education program, working one-on-one with someone who is trained in this area, and the onus needs to be on the student to learn to adapt to the discipline of the classroom, not on the teacher to relax the standards of the program (which will of course also adversely impact the education of the other students in the class). After all, the discipline of the classroom is intended to prepare students for that of the real world -- students should not be taught that the world of jobs, mortgages, and tax forms will make accommodations for them."},{"Title":"The Myth of Laziness","review":"NC Medical board has revoked Levine's license to practice medicine and taken the unusual step of inserting a clause regading him never practicing medicine again in any state.

I just happen to be reading this book when I had a boy in class, Ruben, who failed to complete any class work. It was easy to recognize his lack of fine motor skills. Once the problem was diagnosed, we were able to use multiple strategies to overcome this block and help Ruben find his level of success.As teachers, knowing how to diagnose a learing difficulty and being able to intervene with stratgies to help should be our goal. Dr. Levine, with his extraordinary insight and clinical experience takes the guess work out of this process for those of us in the field.A must read for teachers who want to see all of their students succeed, not just the ones who do what we say when we say it."},{"Title":"The Myth of Laziness","review":"Dr. Mel Levine, founder of \\"All Kinds of Minds Institute\\" and the Director of \\"The Center for Development and Learning,\\" debunks \\"The Myth of Laziness.\\" Levine maintains that everyone longs to be productive and useful, and that some children who are called lazy by their parents, teachers or peers, may in reality be suffering from \\"output failure.\\"Dr. Levine maintains that a whole spectrum of neuro-development dysfunctions may prevent children from reaching their potential. Examples of such dysfunctions are difficulty expressing oneself orally or in writing, an inability to organize one's time, workspace or materials, or a problem as basic as \\"graphomotor breakdown.\\" This means that a student's writing is sabotaged by movement problems that prevent his or her fingers from capturing ideas and putting them down on paper.In his specialty as a developmental-behavioral pediatrician, Levine has spent thirty years working with children who have had difficulty living up to the expectations of their parents, their schools and themselves. Levine has strategies for helping these children, starting with specific tests to diagnose which area of memory, language, attention, or motor function is causing the problem. He also suggests ways that that children can compensate for their deficits and make better use of their strengths.\\"The Myth of Laziness\\" is an informative look at some of the obstacles that many kids face during their school years. Readers should be warned, however, that the book contains hard-to-follow psychological and educational jargon. Fortunately, many case studies help clarify Levine's ideas for the reader who is not familiar with the language of developmental psychology. Principals, teachers, and parents should read this book and consider how they can incorporate some of its ideas in both public and private school programs. Perhaps, if kids with \\"output failures\\" receive skilled help at an early age, they may succeed in school and in life instead of falling through the cracks."},{"Title":"The Myth of Laziness","review":"Overall, this read has a bit of a clinical textbook feel to it and some of the chapters can be a bit wordy from time to time, but none-the-less this work is valuable if you are an elementary school teacher or a parent with young children in school.Mr Levine's most intriguing observations are as follows: The importance of tempo and flow while learning, specifically what happens when a particular sequence or task is too slow and/or effort-filled (labored).A lack of flow, Mr Levine found would typically result in students 'dumbing down' their thoughts just to get them on paper. Other obstacles he mentions included difficulty with such things as: failing to execute the appropriate pencil grip, problems with letter formation, and a failure to recognize appropriate letter combinations when learning to spell.His findings stress the absolute necessity of activating the right muscles in the correct order at the right speed and sequence to do the job of learning. If the execution of these steps didn't occur when composing the content of a work assignment the students would experience an adverse effect on the quality of their output, or worse yet would produce no output at all.Mr Levine concludes that when the learning 'assembly line' is instantaneous and automatic a student's potential for success in school dramatically increases and as a result students that once were thought to be lazy, become engaged with their work and product a greater quantity of work which is of better quality."},{"Title":"The Myth of Laziness","review":"Hello. I recently purchased several of Dr. Levine's books after my 5 year old was diagnosed with fine motor and graphomotor dysfunction. This book has enlightened me as to my son's condition and has made me better capable of helping my son. I am also prepared to speak with his teachers from the very start of school about his condition and now I will be certain not to allow the school system to fail my son for a condition over which he has no control. All I can say is \\"Thank you Dr. Levine. My boy's ok.\\" I also thank Amazon for publishing reader's reviews which prompted me to purchase this wonderful book."},{"Title":"The Myth of Laziness","review":"When I received this book from my aunt I was a little taken aback. Just because I had mentioned to her that I couldn't be bothered writing thank-you letters to everyone for this years Christmas presents! Anyway I started reading this book and found it a very insightful and important look at laziness and its supposed causes and effects. I have to say that I was impressed by the way the author gets to the core of the problem and sheds new light on lack of motivation, loss of energy and other factors which contribute to so-called laziness. It isn't the easiest read you'll ever have but taking up the challenge will surely prove worthwhile. Sadly I didn't manage to finish the book."},{"Title":"The Myth of Laziness","review":"Since I work with students who have a variety of learning differences that hinder their output, I was very encouraged by this book. It is so useful to have someone methodically lay out different case studies so you know what to look for, then provide the keys to overcoming those deficits. Only a few of my students fit the profile of \\"output failure\\" as described by Dr. Levine; however, his methods for assisting students to get organized (notes, schedules, school supplies) and for developing stories and reports, meet many of my students' needs.I especially like the demystification process, not only for the student, but also for the parents. Good grades are a source of very high pressure, and students with language learning differences, such as those on my caseload, usually earn C's when they are working their absolute hardest and have accommodations. Rather than admit that their child has difficulty learning, many parents believe the children are lazy, and therefore assign more work or insist on an additional class. This book provides tools to explain to parents how they can best benefit their child by being an advocate and the best cheerleader on the child's team, not the child's harshest critic. Dr. Levine advises \\"appropriate breaks\\" from work, so I too recommend a balance of life. He also provides a checklist for parents to \\"cultivate output\\".There is so much new information coming out regarding diverse ways to remediate, accommodate, and compensate for learning differences, and Dr. Levine is at the forefront of this movement. I especially appreciate that his work comes from his heart. His ambition in the field of pediatrics is driven by his genuine concern and compassion for his patients. This inspires me to be more ambitious in my reading and research as I seek to find the best teaching methods to match up with each of my student's individual needs. Dr. Levine reminds us that what works for one doesn't necessarily work for someone else, so in order to serve my students best, I need to be creative in my search for strategies, open-minded to change, and above all, patient in awaiting long-lasting results.On the flip side, Dr. Levine maintains that there is no harm in giving rewards, but I disagree. If a child is doing what is right in order to get a reward (or to avoid punishment), he is extrinsically motivated and he is not being truly responsible for his choices and actions. Giving rewards infers that doing right just for the sake of doing right is not enough. This philosophy is important because it not only affects a student's output or behavior but also his self-esteem, his sense of satisfaction with life, and his feelings of self-control and empowerment in all areas. I encourage my students to consider their choices and do what is right and appropriate at all times, whether anyone is noticing or not. I teach them that their lives are the sum total of their choices. I hope this type of thinking will keep them safe and on the right track no matter where they are or what they may be tempted to do, because their motivation will be intrinsic. This is a minor point. I would wholeheartedly recommend Dr. Levine's book."},{"Title":"The Myth of Laziness","review":"Follwing on his wonderful book &quot;A Mind at a Time&quot; -- Dr. Levine now tackles one particular group of individual learners, those kids who get labeled 'lazy' &amp; etc.. I hope teachers and school psychologists and school administrators and professors of teacher certification courses are paying attention to Dr. Levine. American education can be improved if these ideas make it into the mainstream of the education establishment."},{"Title":"The Myth of Laziness","review":"Even some of the best-informed educators lose objectivity in the classroom. Similarly, parents wonder what is really happening there, having to rely on the teacher's analysis and the child's rendition. With all of this potential confusion comes a mistake easily made and painful to undergo: labeling a bright but differently wired student \\"lazy\\". This book clears the air, reminds the adults to steer away from blame and coercion and adhere instead to productive strategies that will help a child learn in her own way.The book is particularly useful to adults who work with children whose most pressing obstacle is low output of school work. Here are strategies for improving productivity through self-tracking...the student can track his own progress in producing more completed assignments, for example, which relocates accountability and satisfaction where it belongs: with the student. Many strategies to attain improved output are presented and are generally practical, which is a breath of fresh air to all concerned.This is especially helpful if read following Mel Levine's \\"A Mind at a Time\\". For secondary and college age students, \\"Learning Outside the Lines\\", by Joathan Mooney and David Cole should take its place immediately on the reading list."},{"Title":"The Myth of Laziness","review":"Note, I am reviewing the audio copy of the book as read by the author. I really enjoyed his reading voice and knowing that he read the sentence with the intended emphasis.I work with under-privileged children of different ages, and I have the hardest time motivating these children. They have great potential, as shown be some subject areas that they excel in, but they just do not work hard or seem to care. One 17-year old child in particular was very baffling to me. He'd say things like \\"I don't care about math since I'll never use it in my life\\" or \\"I don't care about English class because I hate the teacher.\\" I took these and similar responses at face value thinking this kid was calling it straight. Well, after completing this book I realize how completely wrong my approach was. It turns out my kid wasn't telling the truth! (I know, I know... Big shock.) He really wanted to do well in these classes but has low energy leading to output failure. It all makes sense now after hearing the case studies (esp. Ginny) in Dr. Levine's book. I was able to look at my child (that I'm tutoring) with a fresh set of eyes and realize that he needed a new approach. For starters, my kid has sleeping issues. My kid is also a diabetic who was having high A1C levels. Although the book doesn't talk about diabetes affecting learning, the book's fresh perspective allow me consider the possibility. After researching, I learned that a study released in 2009 linked poor academic performance to high A1C levels. Naturally, I am helping my child lower his A1C numbers and get more consistent sleep. Once those problems are solved, I may look into other issues he may have. Thank you Dr. Levine for your book and for giving me new observations in dealing with children labeled as 'lazy'. I don't know yet if this kids grades will shoot up, but at least I feel like I have a better approach and no longer stabbing in the dark."},{"Title":"The Myth of Laziness","review":"\\"You can do it if you just put your mind to it.\\" \\"You just need to buckle down.\\" \\"She's incredibly smart she just needs to learn to focus.\\" \\"I guess I'm just lazy.\\" These are the sort of phrases that haunt a lot of people through school and into adulthood. Dr. Levine describes a series of composite case studies of people who suffer from what he calls, \\"output failure.\\" Filled with original thinking in neuroscience and education this book argues that many failures to achieve aren't do to simple moral failings put to diagnosible and treatable developmental problems.If you or your child is struggling in school and has perhaps even received a diagnosis of ADHD, ODD, or bipoloar disorder then you may find some new ideas here. As a pediatrician, Dr. Levine recognizes the value of medication to help with some conditions but he also acknowleges its limitations. He makes a credible case that many stumbling blocks especially to writing skills can be parsed with neurodevelopmental assesment and treated with behavioral strategies.There are some limitations to the book. First is its focus on children and adolesents. As a pediatrician its not unexpected the author's knowledge and advice revolves mainly around kids. But adults struggling with their productivity to the point it's affecting their lives significantly may find some help with this book. Often naming the problem itself provides catharsis. Secondly diet and exercise are ignored. The purpose of the book isn't to provide a comprehensive list of treatments but I think readers would benefit tangibly from a brief description of how much regular exercise can improve self esteem and productivity."},{"Title":"The Myth of Laziness","review":"This book offers glimpses into the lives of patients of Dr. Levine.

It makes you rethink how you view students. It has been one of the most influential books that I have read in quite some time. All teachers should read this."},{"Title":"The Myth of Laziness","review":"You don't get noticed much, after elementary school. If the problem was small there, and the teacher was able to deal with it by way of informal parent conferences, with a cooperative, pre-teen child, they don't stay small after that. We all know the one whose grades are hitting the fan, sometimes landing near the ceiling, but all too often, hitting the floor with a big splat. These are usually pretty regular kids. Sometimes, they act out after the problems get too big to clean up easily.Dr. Mel Levine gives vignettes on several children with a similar learning problem. The problems he is usually helping them with are ADHD, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, and basic disorganization problems which sometimes occur without the hyperactivity part, and so are not noticed as readily. Number One in the book, if the reader learned nothing else specific in it's 11 chapters plus Epilogue (follow-up on his patients),\\"You don't call it laziness!\\"He uses the phrase \\"output impaired\\" to describe the series of behaviors, instead of the more judgmental, commonplace term.Problems along these lines, just as other personality differences, start to hit parents and others in the face as the child gets to middle school. Once the protective, one-teacher, one-class per grade basis of the typical elementary school is gone, there is nobody to really get to know the child, or to make the child comfortable, who could then work with that child's individual learning styles. Going between five or six or more classes daily, the young student gets lost in the middle of the large throng of the hallways of the typical middle or high school.Who is Dr. Levine to be counselling some of these lost souls? He is billed as a professor of pediatrics at the University of North Carolina Medical School and director of its Clinical Center for the Study of Development and Learning. He is a medical doctor. He works with children.Once you slow down the world enough to look at an individual youngster as a human being -- something that does not occur all that often in the typical large, busy middle school or high school -- you can gain the trust of the student as a person, and make suggestions to their counsellors and teachers who may become involved, as to modifications of the learning and grading grind that make it more relevant to the output impaired youth.Read this book and you will get away from the way some in society want to categorize the child with learning problems. You will get excellent and concrete suggestions as to specifics that should be put in the Individualized Educational Plan or other special education modifications to the nose-grind of middle and high school. The kids might even get into college!"},{"Title":"The Myth of Laziness","review":"Mel Levine's book, \\"The Myth of Laziness\\" helps provide the reader with insight into the complexity of children's difficulties with written tasks. The author drives home the point that often what we may view as \\"lazy\\" due to poor performance or lack of productivity on written tasks, often seems to have a neuro-developmental basis. By identifying the reasons why someone is having difficulty with written tasks or why someone even tries to avoid the tasks, we can better help them. The book uses case studies to discuss some of the many challenges a person can have which can lead to poor written output by an individual. The book is definitely a great resource for anyone who has a child who is having difficulty with written tasks. Written tasks can certainly be a problem for many children who are very strong readers or have strengths in many other academic areas. Although, the book contains far from an exhaustive list of interventions for students having difficulty with written output, it certainly offers some good suggestions. If you are looking for such a list, this might not be the book for you. However, if you are looking to better understand the challenges a student with poor written output might be facing, this would be an excellent resource. It is entertaining to read about the various students from varying circumstances, what Dr. Levine's neuro-psychological testing revealed, and ideas and strategies they suggested to help the students. A lot can be learned from reading about each of the cases, even if (like a few of the reviewers) you don't agree with all of the suggestions Dr. Levine makes. I think we could all agree that just calling someone \\"lazy\\" and giving up on them, really doesn't help that person. Helping them to understand their strengths and weaknesses likely will help them along with a parent or teacher putting a few interventions in place."},{"Title":"The Myth of Laziness","review":"Once again, Mel Levine has created an excellent resource for parents, teachers and other professionals working with children.

On the one hand, he is a great athlete. I respect his work ethic. He has turned in a number of great performances and is no doubt one of the greatest to have ever played the game of basketball.There is a flipside. Michael Jordan got all kinds of special treatment while he was in the NBA. He was the first player I noticed who was granted all kinds of trips to the charity stripe because of unbelievably, ticky tack calls. He scored at least ten points a game at the free throw line from bogus calls. It was great when there was a picture session for 'greats of the game' with Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, and Michael Jordan. Magic told Larry not to stand too close to Michael or they might call a foul. In front of reporters and television viewers, that was a classic comment by Magic. I believe Mike got 99% of all calls in his favor because he was such a cash cow for the NBA. Dominique Wilkins was robbed of a slam dunk championship when Mike scored a perfect 50 doing the same dunk Dr. J did years before. I doubt Dr. J ever received a perfect 50 for it. Dominique's dunk was much more impressive, and he received a 49.5. Please. Mike got in a fight with Reggie Miller, and only Miller got suspended at first. Only after there was an outcry did Mike get suspended. How are Mike's punches different? Mike elbowed Kevin Johnson to the ground for all to see, and Kevin was called for blocking!I am not too impressed that the bulls beat the lakers in the NBA finals. Magic was double teamed every game every minute he was in. On top of that, James Worthy and Byron Scott were injured. Magic and Larry never won three championships in a row because the competition, teams, and players in the 80s were much better than the nineties. Luc Longley, Will Perdue, Bill Cartwright, or Bill Wennington stopping Kareem? Ha!Sport Magazine recently had a piece on the ten greatest moments and ten greatest players ever in the NBA. Mike was ranked number one all time player. Kudos to Mike for mentioning in 'For the love of the game' that to pick a &quot;greatest ever&quot; is impossible because of all the different eras and evolutions of basketball. The nineties bulls were given three of the ten greatest moments in NBA history. This is just more Mike bias. Give me a break. There are hundreds of classic and amazing moments in NBA history. One of the moments picked was Mike beating the Jazz in the final minutes of his last game. He put his hand on Bryon Russel's backside and shoved him out of the way. Then Mike made the game winnig shot. All eyes were on Mike, but the ref did not make the obvious call.There is also Mike's arrogance. According to him, Wilt Chamberlain was a fluke eventhough Wilt was a great all around player. He made a comment about Magic and Larry reaching a 'certain level of greatness' and that the two were not good on defense. What? Are we talking about the same Larry Bird? Shaquille Oneal is also much better and much improved than Mike gives him credit for. Shaq has turned into a solid defender, passer, and he works hard at both ends of the floor.Mike's corporate poster boy behavior is laughable. He did ads for AT&amp;T and then MCI. The Wayans family is also split between the two companies. Mike talked about the enviroment in Rayovac ads and then pitches hot dogs? Mike is not the only athlete who will pitch anything and everything to make millions. I wonder if Mike has checked into Nike's labor practices.Players like Mike and Charles Barkley soured me on the NBA. Charles played like a thug and got away with it because he was a star. Plus, Charles insisted on wearing number 34 at Philadelphia eventhough it was retired for NBA great Billy Cunningham. The star treatment and inflated egos has grown old, and that has turned a lot of people off to sports. I miss the Lakers and Celtics match ups of the 1980s."},{"Title":"Shinano: The Sinking of Japan's Secret Supership","review":"I had the honor of receiving a copy of this book directly from Joe Enright in September of 1990 prior to his relocation to Georgia. I had always been interested in World War II aviation and had not given the submariners much thought. If you like true war drama then this is your book. I read this book with great vigor. It was almost impossible to put down. The way the book is structured adds to the drama. One chapter from the American perspective and the next from the Japanese. Tom Clancy is quoted as saying, &quot;A brilliant snapshot of the war at sea, and the men who fought it.&quot; Find this book and give it a read!"},{"Title":"Shinano: The Sinking of Japan's Secret Supership","review":"It's funny how I came upon Capt. Enright's book, SHINANO. Sometime in the 1980's I became a little bit of an addict to the submarine simulation war game, SILENT SUB II. Trying to be as realistic as possible, this now-technically-outdated computer game acquaints you with famous World War II submarines and their courageous skippers as you become more familiar with its naval encounters.As a result of this familiarity, I ended up reading Richard O'Kane's books, WAHOO and CLEAR THE BRIDGE! (buying both from Amazon.Com). Talking to a friend of mine about O'Kane's books, I received a borrowed copy of SHINANO and became more impressed with Enright's work than any other war story I have read to date.The very story itself, even without literary excellence, is an incredible one. The Shinano was, and remains to this day, one of the most remarkable war vessels ever constructed. At a displacement weight of over 75,000 tons, she was the biggest ship ever built to that time, with 18&quot; guns that could hurl 4,000 pound projectiles over 25 miles. A battleship-converted-to-carrier, the Shinano was the hope of the Japanese military machine to reverse the war fortunes of an entire nation. On her maiden voyage she was escorted by three battle-savvy destroyers and manned by a crew of thousands. Her skipper, Capt. Abe, was one of the most experienced officers in the Japanese fleet. Who could have ever foretold that she would sink within days of leaving drydock?To this day, the sinking of the Shinano by Enright's U.S.S Archerfish in 1944 remains the biggest submarine &quot;kill&quot; on record. That one lone submarine could track a carrier, so well protected, sink her with four well-placed, but inferior American torpedos, and so readily leave the scene untouched, has to be one of the most remarkable naval encounters in history. I have no idea why this story has never been committed to film. The inane, fictional submarine stories that have been filmed since the 40's do not even begin to compare with this real-life, historical drama.On a developmental note, Enright went through great pains to seek out Japanese survivors of the Shinano after the war. His writing style grabs you from the open pages of the book, alternating chapters between the American and Japanese perspective as the chronology of events unfold. The suspense never lets up; in fact, I read the entire book in one sitting -- something that I, for one, rarely ever do.However, all is not war glory: you are able to sympathize with the Japanese perspective, and you realize the extent to which ordinary sailors (just as soldiers) become pawns in the tragedy of war. This balanced view of the conflict brings a kind of nobility and equinimity to the book that I find rare in war tales.If you like historical war stories, you'll find Joseph Enright's book among the very best in its class.Greg Catoncaton@ifu.netJuly 27, 1997"},{"Title":"Shinano: The Sinking of Japan's Secret Supership","review":"Capt. Enright's account of the night he sank the largest Japanese aircraft carrier ever built is superb! The way he expresses the Japanese side of the sinking is magnificent as well."},{"Title":"Shinano: The Sinking of Japan's Secret Supership","review":"I read this book while I was underwater in the PacificOcean and Sea of Japan so I am inherently attracted to it.It has been about seven years since I read it but I'lltry my best to give an accurate review. It is an accountof the sinking of the worlds largest ship by theUSS Archerfish (a submarine) during later part of W.W.II toldby the CO at the time, Joseph Enright. Japan had convertedthe last of the Yamato class battleships, the Shinano, to anaircraft carrier. The Shinano was the worlds largest aircraftcarrier and remained so until the USS Enterprise, CVN 65 wascommissioned in 1961. This story chronicles the events of thefateful night and next morning that led to its sinking. Ironicallycredit for its sinking was not given to the captain andcrew of the Archerfish until long after the war was over.Japanese efforts to keep its existence secret had been extensive.The U.S. had no idea such a ship existed. U.S. Intelligence wasso sure it did not exist that they told Cmdr. Enright what he sankwas an oil tanker and not an aircraft carrier. Paranoiaabout U.S. Intelligence and submarine operations proved tobe the Shinano's demise. Short cuts taken to get the ship out of Yokusuka and underway left the ship poorly prepared for sea, much less any concerted damage control effort. Undue caution on part of the Shinano's commanding officer helped the Archerfish and its crew sink this threat to American servicemen before she could fire a shot in anger. All in all the book is well written and keeps your interest. The Japanese point of view is also told, information being obtained from survivors of the sinking. I highlyrecommend this book to those of you with an interest in W.W.IInaval history.Frank L. LambEx Submariner, USS Guardfish SSN 612"},{"Title":"Shinano: The Sinking of Japan's Secret Supership","review":"During the years before the outbreak of World War II, the Japanese navy constructed two super-battleships, the Yamato and Musashi. There was a secret third ship, the Shinano, that was to be included in this class. However, with the rise of the aircraft carrier, it was decided to convert the Shinano from a battleship to a carrier. Measuring almost 900 feet in length, Shinano was the largest aircraft carrier in the world, and she held that distinction until the United States launched the USS Enterprise in the 1960s. Cloaked in secrecy, the conversion took place. Crewmembers were threatened with imprisonment or execution if they muttered even the slightest words about the existance of Shinano. Due to the extreme secrecy of her construction, many essential tests, which would later prove to be fatal, were not conducted on Shinano. For example, the watertight integrity of the bulkheads and seals were never tested properly.An ocean away, Captain Joseph F. Enright and his submarine Archer-fish, were leaving for the boat's fifth war patrol. Captain Enright had been haunted by the memory of failing to sink an enemy carrier earlier in the war while serving as commander of the submarine Dace. Feeling inadequate as a commander, he asked to be relieved of command. After serving at the American submarine base on Midway island as a relief crewman, he finally got his chance to command his own boat again, and he was determined to make sure that he didn't repeat his earlier mistakes this time around. Taking up his patrol station along the main Japanese island of Honshu, Archer-fish awaited action. This particular area of ocean had become known as the \\"hit parade\\", due to the large number of sinkings by American submarines. On Tuesday, November 28, 1944, Archer-fish sighted a large enemy vessel with four escorts. This proved to be Shinano. Unable to run at maximum speed due to only eight of her twelve boilers being lit, and also suffering from a problem with her propellers, Shinano was limited to a speed of approximately eighteen knots. What ensued over the next several hours could only be described as a classic game of cat and mouse. Enright and Archer-fish desperately tried to keep up with the Shinano while trying to anticipate any course changes she might make. Finally, at 0300 hours on Wednesday, November 29, 1944, the Archer-fish was ready to fire.A spread of six torpedoes leapt from her torpedo tubes, each being fired at eight second intervals. Four explosions rocked the Japanese carrier while Archer-fish dove for the safety of the depths. The ship was mortally wounded. Her protective bladder had failed to stop the torpedoes, and, in the words of Enright, they cut through the bladder \\"like a sword through butter\\". Later that morning, the Shinano, with her bow raised high out of the water, slipped below the surface of the Pacific Ocean. Her maiden voyage had lasted all of seventeen hours.This is a very exciting book. The format is excellent, with the chapters alternating between the action on the Archer-fish to the action on the Shinano. The first-hand account of the action by Captain Enright leaps off the pages and places the reader directly at the conning tower during the attack. Loaded with action and adventure, this book is a must for submarine readers."},{"Title":"Shinano: The Sinking of Japan's Secret Supership","review":"I disgree with some of the previous reviewers. This is a great read for adventure and it is true. It competes well with fictional Tom Clancy novels. A small U.S. submarine under an unlucky Captain sinks the largest ship in the Japanese Navy.Shinano was the sister ship to the battleship Yamato (A Glorious Way to Die) and converted into a carrier, the size of one of our nuclear carriers today. The Japanese intended to confront the U.S. Navy with the tremendous firepower of the Shinano. Instead a lowly submarine sinks the Shinano on her maiden voyage.Regardless of whether the submarine captain Enright or Ryan wrote the story, it is great adventure. Enright is certainly frank in his views, even about his own shortcomings. Both the Japanese and American sides are presented here and this makes it good reading. One understands the fog of battle, after reading about the pursuit of the carrier. A good quick read which is not fiction."},{"Title":"Shinano: The Sinking of Japan's Secret Supership","review":"previous reviews give credit to Enright as though he wrote the book- Enright was the war hero-, and was smart enough to get James Ryan to write a very descriptive and exciting narrative of what took place. lets give each credit for their respective contribution to history. thanks"},{"Title":"Shinano: The Sinking of Japan's Secret Supership","review":"This book is a must read for any WW2 buff. It shows how one sub crew can make an difference, even in a huge war like World War 2. The book gives many details without being boring or redundant. Captain Enright even gives the Japanese viewpoints on why they did what they did to avoid being torpedoed."},{"Title":"Shinano: The Sinking of Japan's Secret Supership","review":"This book was a good read. Not the best ever war story told, like some of the reviews would have you believe, but good enough to hold my attention for one entire night of reading.The main annoying part with this book was the fictionalized thoughts and conversations given to the Japanese who perished on the Shinano. Obviously, there's no way to ever know what these people actually said or thought. It makes it all so less real, and more like a novel, to try to animate them with artificial conversations and thought processes.The most fascinating aspect of this tale for me was the stark contrast between the military cultures that gave rise to the success of Captain Enright and the failure of Captain Abe.One might expect that the Japanese code of bushido, designed for a warrior culture, would enhance the fighting abilities of a military. Perhaps bushido worked great in the ancient days of quick and decisive sword battles, but as this book makes so very clear, bushido fails miserably in a prolonged modern war.One big flaw in bushido was that very time a leader failed at a major assignment, he was expected to commit suicide to atone for his shameful failure. The book presents a parable-like contrast between Abe's career and the career of Captain Enright. Enright started off as a big failure, missing an attack with a Japanese aircraft carrier because he failed to trust the consensus opinion of his crew (that the changing ocean currents which they discovered would carry the Japanese carrier they were chasing off course) and instead went with the by-the book headquarters prediction of the location of the carrier.Sending himself to the back lines in shame, Enright, unlike the Japanese ship captains, did not commit suicide, but was instead eventually given a second chance at commanding a submarine again. The second time around, he learned to go fully with his own instincts, and also that of his crew, in the process of tracking and sinking the Shinano. One big payoff in particular was his decision to set the running depth of his torpedoes to 10 feet instead of the official 30 feet. This ended up putting the torpedoes right at the upper joint of the anti-torpedo blister carried on the underwater hull of the Shinano. This joint area turned out to be a defective weak point in the anti-torpedo shielding, and it was this defect (along with incompletely finished watertight compartments that leaked) that allowed the Shinano to be sunk with only four torpedoes.A second big failing of bushido was that the subordinates were supposed to follow the orders of the leader unquestioningly. This works great in a military if the leader makes wise decisions all the time, but basically gets all the subordinates killed if the leader is wrong. As WWII progressed, and its initial victories faded, the Japanese military culture clearly suffered severely from an inflexible top-down decision making process that was incapable of taking advantage of information or experience accumulated by the lower ranks.In contrast, Captain Enright learned from his early failures to trust the advice of his subordinates, which proved invaluable as they stalked the Shinano.In the end, the sinking of the Shinano was not as dramatic of an achievement as one might think, and was due as much to Japanese military stupidiy as anything else. It was sunk basically on a short trip to another dock where it was to be fully outfitted for war. As such, the ship was unfinished and its mechanical integrity untested. Despite the enormous amount of armor, the ship's supposedly watertight compartments were not fully sealed when it set off on the trip, and so leaked horribly when the torpedoes struck - which was why it sank with only four holes in its side (in contrast, the Shinano's sister ships, the Yamato and Musashi, each took some 15-20 torpedo hits and uncounted numbers of bombs before sinking). The boilers were not all installed, and so the ship's speed was barely greater than that of the submarine initially, and dropped to below the submarine's speed when an overheating bearing forced one of the propellar shafts to be slowed down. The ship was given no aircraft to cover this trip.The code of bushido made it impossible for any subordinates to point out the many flaws in the construction of the ship, or to question the wisdom of sending the Shinano on its maiden voyage, unfinished and unprotected, right into waters that were known to be infested with American submarines.Captain Abe also made some horribly bad decisions - mainly in ignoring Enright's submarine rather than trying to sink it or run away from it when they first discovered the sub. I definitely got the feeling that Abe was appointed ship's captain only because he was a known quantity who diligently followed orders, and was one of the few ranking Naval captains who had managed to survive this late into the war. By this time in the war, bushido had taken the lives of many more capable captains than he."},{"Title":"Shinano: The Sinking of Japan's Secret Supership","review":"The sinking of the super-carrier Shinano by a single American submarine (The Archer-Fish) is one of the most unlikely and compelling ship engagements of the War.The Shinano started life as a super-battleship in the Yamoto and Musashi class. She was over 900 feet long and displaced 75,000 tons. Before she was completed, the Imperial Japanese Navy decided to convert her to an aircraft carrier. Her conversion was such a strictly guarded secret that the Americans were totally unaware of her existence.The Archer-Fish was led by a Captain Joseph F. Enright who had previously stepped down from command in disgrace for failing to sink an enemy aircraft carrier on a prior cruise while in command of the submarine Dace. Given a second chance, Enright took his boat right to the doorstep of Japan where this unlikely encounter took place.Enright co-wrote the book so first hand experiences, feelings and emotions abound. He even solicited input from some survivors of the Shinano. The action is fast and furious in a story of redemption that is stranger than fiction.There are some photographs, a bibliography and an index. The book is short and an easy read but no collection of submarine books would be complete without Shinano; a ship so secret that Enright was not given credit for sinking her until well after the War was over!John E.

Their great love affair felt unnatural and forced and I wasn't even sure until about 2/3's of the way through the book if Lucas even liked Jessica, much less loved her.

Perhaps her editor let her down a bit? And the Catholic portion was just not realistic. At that time in English history, Roman Catholics were just not tolerated with a good grace by the aristocracy. And some of the religious jargon was off, like the recitation of the Hail Mary in the beginning. OK, so I'm being picky, I'm sorry. It's just that too much of these reminders (and they were throughout the entire book), that something's disrupting the flow, and it becomes disjointed. For me anyway."},{"Title":"You Only Love Twice","review":"If you like a complex plot then do find a copy of this book. I must say that this is one of those books that you should not start at night as you will find it enormously difficult to put down. There were so many mind-boggling twists and turns. Our heroine Jessica Hayward is first introduced as a postulant, Sister Martha, in a convent. She has been in this convent for three years with no memory of what has transpired in her life before that time, but she has vivid images and a voice she hears in her head. Given the time period, which is not really defined but some years after the battle of Waterloo - approximately 1820's - it would have been hard to imagine someone with ESP and terrifying to a sane person to admit to it. Yet, the images did not terrify her as much as the 'Voice' of a cold-blooded killer who was planning another murder.A patient in the clinic that the convent runs recognizes Jessica. Along with a couple of nuns, she travels to Hawkshill Manor where she finds a small legacy that has been left to her by the death of her father. The more she questions the more mystery her former life becomes as it appears that no one wants to give her a straight answer. More importantly, the man she was told she was madly in love with, seems to have a distinct disgust and hatred of her. Evidently, the 'Perfect Nun' she had become was not a very nice person in her former life. How had this happened? This is just one of the many mysteries that Jessica had to solve. Even without the memory of her love for Lucas Wilde, now an Earl, her body seemed to recognize him, given the responses whenever he was near.Wow, is all I can say! This was a superb story that will again keep you on the edge of your seat and up all night. The love interest is probably secondary to the mystery to be solved but I found it to be a most satisfying read all together. Jessica's character is so very well developed and complex you can really feel for her frustration and have an acute awareness that she is a really 'good' person. Lucas' character is complex as well, but he is unraveled more so towards the end of the book. There is a profusion of secondary characters, who are dealt with quite well, along with a few small doses of humor thrown in. There are not a lot of love scenes here, as the mystery takes more of a precedence, but what passages there are, do get quite sensual without being minutely detailed. All in all this is a wonderfully robust and terrific story that I can highly recommend."},{"Title":"You Only Love Twice","review":"READ EDITORIAL REVIEWS...I am not particularly fond of heavy suspense, action and/or mystery in my romance books. I prefer internal conflicts with lots of heart soaring twists. I prefer goose bumps alerts and heart squeezer twist. However, despite that personal preferences, from time to time, I do give historical-romance-mystery or those kinds of book a try because I've read quite a few in the past that have stirred up my emotions and I have actually enjoyed the overall story. I am happy to say that LOVE ONLY TWICE is one of those few novels.This is my first novel of Elizabeth Thornton and I am much interested to read more of her works. I like the complexity of the plot. There were many twist... few internal and lots of external ones which were all intriguing. I specially liked the way Ms. Thornton describe and portrayed her characters. Each and every one of them, even those extra-passing-characters were properly executed. Jessica is my favorite overall. Her character was represented beautifully, I think. I read books with heroine who lost their memories but this is the only book that have actually made me ache and feel for the heroine. I understood her confusions. I admire her strength, her courage and her determination. Must be awful not knowing who you are, where you come from and what's enstore for your future. Lucas is likable but not my favorite in this book. He is straight-forward, sexy, loving, honorable and patient. Their love story was alright. Some excitement, some passion and desires, few heart soaring moments and a little laugh here and there... But I couldn't say their's is FULL of love. I think the action-mystery overshadowed a tiny bit of their relationship development or perhaps it's just me and my preferences? The minimal inconsistencies in this book such as their language didn't bother me at all. Yes, I noticed it but it's not overly much as to distract me.Once again, I didn't think it's fair for me to rate this book less than 4 stars mainly because of my self preferences... Afterall, Love Only Twice is an exciting and an enjoyable read. It really all goes down to a matter of taste and preferences. If you like heavy action-mystery-suspense in your romance reading, then this book if definitely the one for u. For those who are picky and prefer more lovey-dovey scenes... hmmm, I do urge you to try this book anyway, who knows you might like it just as I have or perhaps even more..."},{"Title":"You Only Love Twice","review":"This is by far my favorite of Elizabeth Thornton's. My friend had given me two other novels by her, I loved them both so I went out to search for more. She has the best story lines. Romance, intrigue, danger, and original plots. Kudos to Ms. Thornton once again."},{"Title":"You Only Love Twice","review":"This romance captivates you from start to finish. A definite page-turner!!! The characters were definite personalities, developed with great imagination and precision. The story was well structured and the plot was clear and understandable. This was made possible through Ms.Thornton's careful attention to detail. The flow and action of the novel had good sequence with a few added twists and unexpected events occurring along the way. I found myself engrossed with the friendship between Lucas and Jess... due primarily to the convincing nature of his love and concern for her. This book is definitely 5-star material!!!! You'll read it twice and love it both times."},{"Title":"You Only Love Twice","review":"I have been reading regency romances for the past 4 years and lately I'd begun to wonder if they weren't all the same story told a different way. I mean, they fall in love, something stops them from being happy, they overcome all and end happily ever after. I sound bored and truth is, I was. But I found this book again (I read it years ago but kept it on my shelf) and boy am I glad I did. This book was just what I needed. Now, don't get me wrong. It still follows the same basic romance plot, but it's so much more.It was suspenseful because you never have more information than the heroine does. Since Jess lost her memory and can't remember anyone or anything, it means we are seeing everything as she sees it. The characters and their feelings, the murder mystery, the townspeople; everything is unknown. Her feelings of confusion are our feelings of confusion. So many times you see the ending coming, and even though the murderer wasn't necessarily a shocker, this ending was better than most. I agree that the characters seemed confused about their feelings but the plot and the writing makes that seem normal. Thank you Ms. Thornton for writing a historical romance with suspense and that something different."},{"Title":"You Only Love Twice","review":"Another fabulously penned Elizabeth Thornton novel. I'm a fan of all of her work and must say that this is one of my favorites. Unlike some of the other reviewers who found the characters \\"inconsistent\\" I found them complex and interesting. A person is defined by his actions, not the other way around. The readers who did not understand the changeability of the characters didn't understand the circumstances that they found themselves within. Yes, Jessica was in love with Lucas and finds herself both equally drawn to him and terrified by him. She lost her memory-- so of course she still finds herself physically attracted to the man but devoid of the emotions that normally accompany such feelings. She's just confused. It's not odd that she knows that she implicitly trusts him-- she was in love with him before, so obviously he appeals to her in a basic way and always would.Regarding Lucas, the reader is SUPPOSED to be slightly confused by his hot and cold treatment of Jessica. It's called dramatic irony and is what builds the tension in the plot. When one reviewer suggested reading it twice, they had the right idea. I actually did just that and enjoyed it equally the second time. The reason is that the mystery of Lucas and his feelings and actions (and self-confessed participation in their final parting trist)doesn't fully unfold until the last chapters of the book, so the reader is left wondering exactly how he really does and DID feel toward Jessica just like she wonders. Again-- that's part of the fun. When you do find out, and everything falls into place, then his earlier actions and volatile manner make perfect sense-- you actually find yourself feeling sorry for him as he's had no one to share his pain with or no way to vent his frustrations- the girl lost her memory what can he or she do? Nothing- start over from square one and try not to be hurt by the fact that someone who adored you and hung on your every breath doesn't remember? Poor guy, he's crushed.Fantastic hero and heroine, both strong characters, not simpering or overbearing, but with the right amount of humor and angst. Very good plot. The mystery portion was not Thornton's best, it fell a little short compared to some of her other works, but lets be honest in romance your reading much more for the character development than mystery. The ESP was also better done in \\"The Scott and I\\" or \\"Bewitching Bride\\" but it was clearly and simply done here, not overworked or forced, it's also a minor element, played out more like an odd talent here than some sort of sci-fi twist.Overall, another great page turning read. Just when you think Thornton can't possibly find another unique and interesting way to bring to people together (or keep them apart!) she triumphs again!"},{"Title":"Big Book of American Trivia (Big Book of Series)","review":"While the info is interesting, the quiz format is not; you have to constantly turn the page to get any answers.

I was excited to discover this 360 page book of American History trivia.

Rather, the book is a series of 3,000 questions (and answers). Topics include -* National, Regional, and Local history* Well-known monuments (National, Regional, and Local)* American Personalities (Presidents, song writers, comedians, etc.)* Food* The arts* etc.1. In what year's World Series was \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\" played at a sports event for the first time? (The answer can be found on page 239)2. What major East Coast city has a Cherry Blossom Festival every April? (The answer can be found on page 145)3. What outdoorsy president was the first president to ride in an automobile?

Everything about Eyeshield is so darned perfect--the characters, the art, the story...I can't believe it. I can't see it deserving anything less than 5 stars. I can't imagine how ANYONE can hate Eyeshield 21, for Eyeshield 21 has got something for everyone.Story: The story for Eyeshield 21 is a little stereotypical; it's basically the same sports manga formula of underdog-team-strives-to-be-the-best--but it's carried out in a serviceable way that doesn't get too annoying. However, Eyeshield has got one thing going for it--it's about FOOTBALL. Not the black-and-white ball, but AMERICAN FOOTBALL. I'm surprised it's even so popular in Japan where American football isn't that popular. A neat thing about Eyeshield 21 is that you don't have to know squat about football to enjoy it.Characters: This is where Eyeshield 21 REALLY shines--the characters. Seriously, Riichiro Inagaki is a genius. All of the characters have distinct personalities while not being too stereotypical and cliched--Sena's the shy kid who can run really fast because he's spent most of his life running from bullies, Hiruma's the demonic quarterback for the Devil Bats, Kurita's the nice fat guy with a chestnut-shaped head, Monta is like a monkey, etc. etc. Even the \\"bad guys\\" are well-thought-out, funny, and original. Honestly, even if you hate football, just read Eyeshield 21 for the characters. What can I say? They're awesome.Art: Ah, more genius. Yusuke Murata is a genius artist and brings Inagaki's writing to life. I really love how Murata depicts things using visual metaphors--such as Sena visualizing the path he's going to take. The character designs, too, are all unique and distinct and you'd never mistake one character for the other. Eyeshield 21's art is detailed; perhaps a little too detailed, but it's still excellent.Overall: Like I said before, Eyeshield 21 has something for everyone. Don't like football? Read for the characters. Don't like manga? Read for the football. It's not sugary-sweet and \\"BELIEVE IN YOURSELF\\" like so many other sports manga nor is it chock full of bishounen *coughPrinceofTenniscough*, but Eyeshield 21 is still the de facto best sports manga, perhaps even best manga, I have ever read."},{"Title":"Eyeshield 21, Vol. 1","review":"i thought this story was gonna be pointless and stupid. oh, how wrong i was. my bro let me borrow the first 4 or so books, and i was addicted to it after the first 2 chapters! and the best part is? you don't have to know squat about football to enjay and laugh at it. about all that i knew about football before i read this was that you take the ball, and run for your life, or you will be doggie-piled. i didn't even know what a quarterback was. now i actually know some stuff. and it's sooo funny. as far as i'm concerned, the devil of a captain is the one who pulled the story together, and made it funny. heck, he recruted the main star by dangling him upside down and purpousfully missing him with a gun! i even got my other bro addicted to this series, and he doesn't even like manga/anime! point is, it is the best sparts manga ever, and is a must buy."},{"Title":"Eyeshield 21, Vol. 1","review":"It's the fourth quarter with nine seconds to go. While in the huddle, your team captain, who resembles the devil himself, tells you, \\"You better make it to the end zone or else I will kill you,\\" accentuating his point by cocking a handgun that seemed to come out of nowhere. What do you do? Risk getting crushed by the opponent's defensive line, or risk getting shot by your insane team captain? For freshman running back Sena Kobayakawa --known to the football league only by the codename \\"Eyeshield 21\\"--, there's only one thing to do. Run as fast as he can. Now, I don't really know much about football, much less football in Japan, but Eyeshield 21 offers an action-packed and often humorous crash course in one of the most popular Japanese high school sports. The entire story is presented in Manga (Japanese Graphic Novel) form.The story follows the trials and tribulations of Sena Kobayakawa, a freshman at Deimon High School. All of his life, Sena was the target of constant bullying by upperclassmen and even students in his own grade due to his size. The only person who could help him was his childhood friend, a female upperclassman by the name of Mamori Anezaki.Because he got into Deimon High School by passing the required entrance exam, Sena got the chance to start fresh and makes a vow to stop being a victim. The people he meets, however, have other things planned for him.The first person who takes interest in Sena's amazing speed and agility is the captain of the Deimon Devil Bats football team, sophomore student Yoichi Hiruma. Hiruma's most outstanding trait is his resemblance to a demon, with his wildly spiked hair, pointed ears, slitted eyes, and unusually sharp teeth. He is also rather manipulative, keeping a small black book chock full of blackmail so that he can force people to play for the Devil Bats whenever a game comes. His violent streak is rather evident whenever he pulls out a weapon with which to intimidate someone. Such occasions include \\"Recruiting\\" Sena to become their running back, when Hiruma dangles Sena helplessly from the ceiling while Hiruma opens fire with an assault rifle, intentionally making near misses. During one morning practice, Hiruma uses two rocket launchers as starting pistols for the 40-yard dash drill, where it is discovered that Sena can run the drill in 4.2 seconds, considered top speed even for the NFL. This is a timely discovery, as they have their first game the next day against a team called the Koigahama Cupids, where Eyeshield 21 makes his debut.Concerned for Sena's safety is his childhood friend Mamori. As a sophomore and a member of the Disciplinary Committee, she takes it upon herself to effectively shield Sena from the more hostile elements of Deimon High, especially Hiruma. However, this effort results in making her look like an absolute mother hen, constantly checking up on Sena, to say everything short of smothering him. Obviously, she is frustrated that Sena ends up getting involved with Hiruma despite her warnings, but is relieved that Sena is \\"Just the team manager.\\" (At least, that's all she's supposed to know.)As an Anime and Manga fan, I picked up Eyeshield 21 out of sheer curiosity. I usually never read sports-centric Manga, but Eyeshield 21 is a definite exception. With its wacky cast and absolutely ridiculous situations (Hiruma gets away with stuff that would get him thrown in a federal penitentiary in real life and would most assuredly get him expelled were he a student at any U.S. school), Eyeshield 21 is a page-turning, side-splitting read for anyone who is a Manga fan. Football players would enjoy this too, despite its lack of realism, as it has the basics of football relatively well understood. Taking these factors into account, I give Eyeshield 21 an \\"A\\" on the grading scale, and if you read it, I think you'll agree."},{"Title":"Eyeshield 21, Vol. 1","review":"it's a big funny and fun series that takes a look at something all Americans know in football and gives it a different perspective that makes it really exciting.the art and story is very good always because this manga has both a writer and a penciler. this means that the art is always top quality and and the story is always on the move.there is a huge cast of character for you to learn about and care about.Have Fun."},{"Title":"Eyeshield 21, Vol. 1","review":"Although it can be quite crude, or innapropiate for younger teens and children, it is very interesting and comical!

I'm Just Like This","review":"While the focus is on the thoughts and feelings of the elderly woman with the attitude that her age has earned her the right to be cranky, everyone else will understand and enjoy the humor. Using cartoons with captions, the developers capture the \\"humor\\" of growing old. Some example captions are:*) It's scary when you start making the same noises as your coffeemaker.*) I think I must be wearing a \\"wonder where they went\\" bra.*) Know how to prevent sagging? Just eat until the wrinkles fill out.*) Another birthday? Get ready to gru-u-u-umble!*) It's not the heat, it's the hormones.

It lends itself well to playing in the classroom, and discussion of the issues the play raises."},{"Title":"Wear and Tear: Stop the Pain and Put the Spring Back in your Body","review":"\\"Wear and Tear\\" is a gem that should be on the best seller list. This book has been a real eye-opener for me and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to help slow the damage we heap on our bodies as we age. But to be honest I've been a Dr. Arnot fan since he wrote \\"Guide to Turning Back the Clock\\", another excellent book (that needs to be updated).I bought and started reading \\"Wear and Tear\\" because he included a chapter called \\"Stiff Man Syndrome\\" which my orthopedic surgeon jokingly said contributed to my knee damage. In \\"Wear and Tear\\" there are excellent descriptions and examples of the damage you do to your joints, far beyond what my doctor told me. The \\"8-Ball\\" metaphore of a joint alone made me see what 'full range of motion' is all about. Dr. Arnot's discussion of \\"forceful walking\\" has given me better tips than my physical therapist has on how I was ginding away my joints by walking (like Godzilla in a hurry). One suggestion I would add, in addition of the examples given in the book, is imagine you're walking on rice paper. Remember \\"Grasshopper\\" from TV's \\"Kung-fu\\"? Now I notice how everyone else is pounding away as they walk, while I glide along feeling sorry for them.Because of \\"Wear and Tear\\" I'm in the pool working on range of motion (it feels great too, all day long), practicing walking so I don't pound my joints, doing light yoga and stretching (it is remarkably easy to get flexibility back), changed my vitamins and doing the remarkably good (and unique) exercises he illustrates.The Amazon Editorial Review gives you a good list of subjects in the book so I won't repeat them. I would just add they are covered in a clear and concise style. You don't waste any time reading the filler found in most other health books.If you compare what you can get out of this book to what you will spend on expensive Doctor and Physical Rehab sessions, not to mention the pain and loss of income, \\"Wear and Tear\\" is worth its weight in gold. I think Dr. Arnot has also saved me from a lot of future grief as well by cluing me in before more damage is done to my poor knees and hips. I plan on using many of the principles outlined in this book for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"Wear and Tear: Stop the Pain and Put the Spring Back in your Body","review":"This book is great for people who suffer from Arthritis, who are overweight, have reducecd flexibilty, or any other pain associated with their joints. Bob Arnot, one of the authors of this book believes strongly in yoga and stretching as exercises for people suffering with pain. In his practice, he does prescribe asprin and NSAIDS, but disourages the overuse of them. He believes more in exercise. Not strenuous exercise, just exercises like bicycling, walking, or swimming. Exercise is the key to strong muscles and joints. He also gives ideas for proper footwear, no high arched shoes. The book is jumpy as you read it, but overall, it would be of good use to those who suffer with joint pain."},{"Title":"Wear and Tear: Stop the Pain and Put the Spring Back in your Body","review":"This book provides specific information on how to preservethe joints in the body. For instance, the author cautionsagainst heal pounding while walking. He recommends walkingsuch that the outer perimeter of the foot absorbs yourweight. He describes the optimal gait which consists ofmaintaining hips at a level position and landing the feeteasily while walking. High tech knee braces may help inredistributing the load around the knee. Ibuprofen may behelpful in dealing with inflammation problems. Wearingcomfortable shoes is cited as an important step in reducingstress on the joints.

Although not as complete in terms of information as a full textbook, this book contains a blurb on nearly every topic one might encounter in the NICU. It is also surprisingly up to date for a textbook, containing the latest standards of care on controversial topics such as PPHN, use of ECMO and BPD, plus lots of other conditions.This is no longer a spiral-bound book, which has positives and negatives. On the positive side, it's probably more durable long-term - no more ripping of pages and holes out of the spiral. On the negative side, it's harder to keep your page open without bending the spine out of shape.This is by far the best on-call reference manual for neonatology.

I'm so mad at myself for having bought this book just from reading descriptions that I have to say something.I have quite a few photography technique books and this one was one book too many. It has some nice images along with brief explanations on how they were created. The problem I have with the book are the manipulated images, which make up about half of the book. I'm sorry, but I just don't see the point in adding water, clouds and birds to all those images, and often it's the same bird. I'd recommend looking through the book before purchasing, and if you can put up with the manipulated images, go for it, but I just don't see the point in them. Another thing-I haven't gone digital yet but I imagine that the manipulated images can be produced quicker on the computer nowadays."},{"Title":"Dramatic Black & White Photography: Shooting and Darkroom Techniques","review":"Photographer J.D. Hayward offers his own surrealistic Southern shadows in sharp black and white in an inspiring book that teaches camera work and darkroom techinques with an artist's eye and shutter-speed skill. In this beautiful book, featuring 50 portraits and dreamscapes, Hayward's sense of Southern landscapes and moods comes alive in in his blending of fascinating composites in the darkroom; he tells the story behind each photograph and gives instructions on how to reproduce the effect. Hayward is a photographic traditionist, keeping alive an artform reflective of Western landscapist Ansel Adams. Hayward prefers the delicate process of creating darkroom light and shadow in what many lament as a vanishing artform with the rise of faster and less expensive digital photography. Readers will be rewarded by Hayward's allegiance to the real artistic crafting of photography with lasting, enduring images. The award-winning Pensacola native, with prints known across the South, exposes his love of the Florida city's architecture and history in these images. This book will inspire all photographers, amateur and professional. I highly recommend this portrait of how to work in black and white with an artist's eye and steady hand."},{"Title":"Dramatic Black & White Photography: Shooting and Darkroom Techniques","review":"I purchased this book expecting to learn techniques for darkroom effects, but the book didn't teach me much. After the introduction, there were a few pages on techniques, but being a photo student, I already understood them. The rest of the book was mostly a showcase of the artist's photographs, which is fine because many were beautiful, but it was just not what I was looking for. I just wanted more specific examples of each technique instead of the thought process for each photograph."},{"Title":"Dramatic Black & White Photography: Shooting and Darkroom Techniques","review":"As an amateur photographer, I was intrigued by the review of J.D. Hayward's book in OUTDOOR PHOTOGRAPHER. I purchased the book on-line, and although I was looking for technical information (film and camera), I found his book to be more of an idea book, suggesting themes and concepts on the creative thought process of photography. I liked this. He does share information on cameras and film, but his powerful black and white images make you stop and think. It's a good photography book. But, even if you're not into photography, the Southern flavor of his anecdotal references to each photo is worth reading."},{"Title":"Dramatic Black & White Photography: Shooting and Darkroom Techniques","review":"I've been doing black &amp; white photography for a few years but have never tried combining photos and wasn't sure I could do it.

He stops to help the unconscious male who mumbles something about missing state representative Calvin Cahill wearing red. The police arrive to take charge of the scene so Nick takes the children home.Nick visits the homeless person learning that his name is Elijah Smith who insists that he angels told him that Cahill wore red. Though his spouse would have cardiac arrest if he began making inquiries, Nick cannot stop himself from sleuthing. Joining his old peer at the newspaper Ryan Lockridge, Nick begins to uncover a strange scenario involving gambling and corpses, but the tie back to Cahill remains nebulous. Now Nick and his family are targets of someone who wants him to stop his investigation.The second tale (see SECOND ADVENT) starring stay at home dad Nick Bertetto is an enjoyable journalistic investigative story. The mystery of Cahill is cleverly shrouded so that the audience wonders if Elijah is either crazy or truly hearing angels. Nick is a fantastic protagonist, but the key to the novel is the strong support cast especially his wife still mentally unstable from being abducted during his Indianapolis days, the \\"mystical\\" Elijah, and Ryan. Tony Perona provides a fine contemporary mystery starring a solid lead who hides his inquiries from his wife to protect her fragile mind.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"The Third Opinion: How Successful Leaders Use Outside Insight to Create Superior Results","review":"Dr. Joni has created a clear, logically compelling case for a new kind of leadership appropriate for the complex age we live in. Too many leaders (and leadership models) still believe that leading is all about making decisions in the splendid isolation of the corporate suite. Dr. Joni shows how to create teams of inside and outside advisors that will keep you from becoming the next Enron -- and avoid being blindsided by the competition you never saw coming from the corner office. More than that, there is profound advice here for leaders at all levels of their careers trying to navigate the tricky waters of corporate politics. A must-read for business people today."},{"Title":"The Third Opinion: How Successful Leaders Use Outside Insight to Create Superior Results","review":"Peter Senge said it best: \\"Today there are two types of leaders in business: those who don't know everything they need to and those who don't recognize it . . . The Third Opinion is for everyone who knows that they need help making critical decisions and for those whose friends may need to bring it to their attention.\\"Dr. Joni has provided the research that shows why we can benefit from the power of many. Her research showed a surprising level of isolation at the top of our organizations. \\"While some leaders find a way to build trusted leadership circles that integrate outside insight and have a few confidants, many are on the other end of the spectrum and only experience greater isolation with each move up the leadership ladder.\\" The background for this research is that the 21st century has drastically changed leadership requirements for our organization. This new paradigm requires new thinking - exponential thinking. It also requires three new habits: the habit of mind, the habit of relationships and the habit of focus.Exponential thinking comprises six steps: Understanding our own mental models that guide our thinking, Developing our ability to discern patterns, Check and Recheck our hidden assumptions, Create varied scenarios of the future, Look for ways to broaden our line of sight, and Invest in our ability to think in the gray spaces. \\"Exponential thinking allows you to see all sides of a complex issue; it's the process of examining context, looking for interrelationships, exploring assumptions, and asking questions that reveal the full truth and potential of a situation, like a prism revealing the full spectrum of color within white light.\\" Exponential thinking is best done with others.Dr. Joni logically explains how these keys - the three habits and exponential thinking - applies to emerging leaders, key leaders and senior leaders in our organizations. Using some tried and true tools to understand our management style, and that of others, we can place ourselves in the organization's structure. Then, armed with a tool she developed, the Star of Complexity Map, we can discover where our growing edges are and work to fill those gaps with trusted third opinions.This book has helped me explain the minor explosion of CEO groups forming. Independent thinkers, trusted colleagues join together to work on each others business and even personal issues. Vistage International (formerly The Executive Committee) is one such organization. Membership has grown from 11,000 CEOs worldwide to more than 12,000 members in 15 countries. Why do busy executives take time for such meetings? The answer is they have learned the power of exponential thinking, even if they call it something else.

One wonders if his words would have any sway today in the 21st century. Virtually every aspect of life has gotten more complex including abstract issues such as judgment, uncertainty and thinking itself. Additionally, the element of speed adds a completely new dimension that requires our attention as well. Whether you're managing a large organization or just trying to manage your personal life - things are much trickier than in Thoreau's day. In the book titled - \\" The Third Opinion\\" - author Dr. Saj-nicole A. Joni notes that the complexity, uncertainty and pressure that are currently built into even small decisions forces leaders into a quandary of where they can turn for advice and guidance. Soundview likes this book because it advises leaders at all levels to look outside their day-to-day sphere of influence. The author encourages ranking individuals to develop an external network of mentors, advisors and experts to offer advice when tough decisions are required - this panel embodies \\"The Third Opinion,\\" which may trigger provocative discussion and powerful solutions. Such outside insight is a simple solution that might have even appealed to Thoreau."},{"Title":"Tea and Green Ribbons: A Memoir","review":"'Of all nature's gifts to the human race, what is sweeter to a man than his child' from Marcus Tullius CiceroDublin 1953.

A local housepainter, Desmond Doyle has little money and no choice but to turn his kids over to Ireland's church-run industrial schools while he looks for work in England. But upon his return several months later, Desmond is unable to retrieve them from state custody.Evelyn Doyle is only seven when she arrives at the convent in High Park, where she will bask in the clean joys and lonely sorrows of life in the care of nuns.

A memoir, besides telling an interesting tale, has to be well-written - otherwise, an interview in a magazine will do for me, thanks. The whole book reads like this: &quot;Daddy said hello. I felt so happy. Daddy picked me up in his arms. I laughed. Then Daddy said he had to go. I cried&quot;.I was also disappointed that Ms. Doyle tells us virtually nothing about the lives of her brothers during her convent years. She tells a lot about her father, but her brothers, their feelings and ordeals, are almost completely passed over, and even after the end of the judicial proceedings (and the book) they are barely mentioned. The father's struggle seems much more concerned with Evelyn than with her remaining five siblings, and we wonder if it really happened that way.Being a lawyer, I was particularly interested in the judicial aspect of the story. Even though Ms. Doyle devotes many pages to it, I thought the whole issue could have been told in more detail and with a greater juridical accuracy - after all, as she says, hers became a leading case, so I should think it deserves a deeper analysis. Some readers might say that this is not the purpose of a memoir (which should be only concerned with what its author lived through and felt), to which I answer that, since Ms. Doyle chose to deal with the case in some detail, she ought to have engaged in a really serious analysis.All in all, a disappointing book, though it might do for light holiday reading."},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"Great one volume blah blah blah, just get it and read!

Asian parents still caution their children about the results of that war, and many older Asians feel that the United States missed the boat by hitting the Japaneese with only two Atomic Bombs.Make no mistake. The rise of Japan as a Economic power has scared everyone. The rise of them as a Military power is attractive to NO one in the region. And never will be. The Grandparents of the occupation and impact of the Japaneese military are still alive and their children have been raised to beware the boogyman.Reading this does put the entire element of the Political war in focus."},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"The Bok was in excellent shape and delivered promptly.

He shows that the dual advance across the Pacific by MacArthur and Nimitz was more a solution to bureaucratic and public relations problems facing the Army and the Navy. Spector discusses major battles, along with little-known campaigns (which I found boring and a bit long-winded) as well as unfamiliar events. I was expecting a book on the major battles through the Pacific Islands (Wake, Midway, the Gilberts, the Marianas, etc). He does cover these battles but not in the detail that I had expected. Spector offers more of a strategic look at the Pacific War. You may find this disappointing.Some of the more different chapters dealt with what the Marines had to live with during their island stays (what it was really like living on a day to day basis on these islands). There was also a chapter on code-breaking which I found interesting. The book digressed a bit into the Burma-India theater which I found a tad boring.The book is good for one read-through, but I wouldn't read it again."},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"This book is a pretty good read. I am writing at this moment to complain about the missing pages, 295-342 are missing. This would be a discussion of the Marianas campaign. This is the paperback version, purchased July of '08. Beware the missing pages! Otherwise it is a pretty good read, but for me I prefer a deeper look at each battle, rather than an overview."},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"I recommend Spector's book to anyone looking for an overview of the entire Asia-Pacific campaigns during World War II. The book examines not only fighting in the South Pacific at places like Guadalcanal, but also the China-India-Burma theater. However, don't expect a book in the Stephen Ambrose vein, with plenty of quotes from ordinary solders on the front lines. This is very much a traditional military history, focusing primarily on generals and admirals, more than privates and sergeants. It's definitely \\"history from the top down,\\" as they say. Spector does, however, throw in a quote from a \\"grunt\\" on occasion. The book actually gets off to a slow start with what is essentially a bureaucratic history of the U.S. military in the interwar period; but its pace picks up dramatically with the attack on Pearl Harbor and keeps up its momentum for the remainder of the text. As others have noted, Spector's work could have benefitted from more detailed maps. And quite often I found the litany of various admirals, generals, carrier groups, squadrons, corps, etc., to be confusing; but I believe war itself breeds confusion and as such the book merely reflects this reality. Overall, a solid work of exhaustive research by an author ideally suited to pen such an excellent history."},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"An extremely worthwhile survey of the war in the Pacific. Spector argues that America won the conflict against Japan using its industrial strength in a war of attrition. Spector notes that for the two years following the Battle of Midway the United States had no engagements with any major-sized Japanese fleet or field army. During this two year period, though, the Japanese were for all practical purposes defeated.Spector observes that Pearl Harbor and the use of the atomic bombs are the only two major aspects of the war in the Pacific theater that garnered much historical attention. His major area of focus is on the period in between these two events. He explains \\"that many other aspects of the war are worth close examination, even reexamination.\\" Such topics include the leadership of Douglas MacArthur, the often ignored topic of supply and logistics, the command relationship in the Pacific, and the ultimate factors that brought about victory.The most glaring problem with this excellent study are Spector's repeated errors of minor facts. For example, he describes the Emperor's uncle, Prince Higashikuni as the monarch's brother. These type of stupid, little mistakes happen over and over again throughout this book. The lack of detailed maps is frustrating, but that more than likely is the publisher's doing, or not doing. These shortcomings, however, are minor irritants in a book that anyone with an interest in this conflict should read."},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"Ronald Spector's \\"Eagle Against The Sun\\" was published as far back as 1985 but holds up extremely well as perhaps the best one-volume history of the U.S. war with Japan. Spector's sweep is broad, inclusive, and incisive, packing a tremendous amount of analysis into just 500 pages.Spector starts, not with Pearl Harbor, but with the political and military climates in the United States and Japan before the war, to make the point that decisions on aircraft, ship types and war plans would have an enormous impact on the opening phases of the war. Spector, a Vietnam veteran, was no worshiper of the brass; his caustic analysis of the U.S. command structure in the Pacific and the planning of each campaign suggests just how much was owed to political as well as to military considerations.Spector's concise narrative sketches each of the major campaigns in the Central and Southwest Pacific areas, while finding time to address U.S. efforts in the China-Burma-India theater as well. The reader is left with a stunning sense of the sheer scale of the war waged against Japan. Spector also imparts an appreciation for the ability of the U.S. Armed Forces to overcame surprise and a lack of preparation in 1941 to defeat the Japanese Empire by 1945.This book is highly recommended as a detailed popular history of the war in the Pacific that will appeal to both the general reader and the student of military history."},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"Mr. Laycock says it all.

I was aware of the reputation of Eagle Against the Sun for years before reading it because it appears on many reading lists I've seen for the Pacific war and is widely lauded as the best one-volume work on that topic. It definitely lived up to the hype with thorough coverage of almost every facet of the war with Japan.Spector starts off with examining the American and Japanese \\"states of mind\\" in the prewar years, and discussion of Plan Orange, the overall U.S. strategy in the event of war with Japan. The central narrative is that of the Pacific war starting at Pearl Harbor and ending in Tokyo Bay. Interspersed within that narrative are three contiguous chapters on the China-Burma-India theater and thematic chapters on intelligence, code-breaking, submarine warfare, strategic bombing, and the sociological impact of the war on servicemen. The author draws from a rich variety of primary and secondary sources and includes a bibliographical essay at the end of the book that serves as an excellent jumping-off point for further study.Macarthur does not fare well at the hands of Spector, nor do the American attempts at cohesion among their armed forces. Spector demonstrates how this lack of cohesion among different service branches, while shared by U.S. and Japan alike, was overcome on the U.S. side by superior administrative structure, industrial output and technology. Spector is also critical of U.S. decisions to split forces between southwest Pacific (Macarthur) and central Pacific (Nimitz), but also very capably gives us the big-picture reasons for these and all major decisions, including those reached at the big conferences among FDR, Churchill and other Allied leaders.Already knowledgeable about the Pacific war, I was able to follow Spector's narrative despite the absence of maps, save for the insufficient ones inside the cover of Eagle Against the Sun. Had I needed to refer to a map, I have S.E. Morison's volumes on the Pacific, as well as the West Point military atlases. However, if a first-time reader on the Pacific War were to start out with Spector, they would be lost without prior knowledge of Pacific geography. Therefore, as well written as Eagle Against the Sun is, it is NOT sufficient to serve as an introduction to the war with Japan without supporting maps from other sources."},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"Such an admirably boiled-down history of the U.S. campaign in the Pacific during World War II requires a single-word review: Wow!Of course, you can't just leave it there. For me, an amateur World War II student who like many focuses more on the European side of the conflict, reading Ronald H. Spector's 1985 book felt like making up for years of neglect. It's also straightforward and exciting, full of human drama and color tempered by logistical and strategic discussion that is sharp and clear. There's also some commentary on the various leaders of both sides, often cutting.\\"My own view of MacArthur is that, despite his undoubted qualities of leadership, he was unsuited by temperament, character, and judgment for the position of high command which he occupied throughout the war,\\" Spector writes in his introduction. \\"He demonstrated these failings in success as well as in adversity...\\"MacArthur's relative lack of adaptability might have been his greatest failing as presented here. Spector notes at the outset that flexibility to the requirements of winning was necessary to achieve victory. Both Japanese and American leaders began the war using as their model the World War I Battle of Jutland, where battleships formed lines and had at each other with cannon fire. Mastery of the Pacific Ocean required a different approach, and so did such innovations as radar, cryptanalysis, and especially the aircraft carrier, which the U.S. was forced to rely upon after their battleships got chewed up at Pearl Harbor.Spector lucidly captures the many moving parts of the subsequent conflict, largely chronological with detours to the less central but still critical theaters of Burma and China as well as a surprisingly powerful analysis of the sociological implications of the war on U.S. character. Before Pearl Harbor, the U.S. was adamantly against unrestricted submarine warfare; by the end of the war, they were so proficient at it that as Spector writes, 55% of Japanese sea losses were inflicted by just two percent of American naval personnel, those in submarines.Like other reviewers, I was disappointed by the lack of maps. You get only one in the original hardcover, showing the entire theater with key islands reduced to little more than pinpricks and only New Guinea and the Philippines singled out for slightly larger blowups. Given how much ground Spector covers, this is a significant shortcoming.Hardly anything else is, though. There's so much to chew on in this book. A blithe decision to ignore a coastwatcher's warning of \\"neap tides\\" led to the nastiest Marine landing of the war, at Tarawa. At Leyte Gulf, an apparent bid for glory by Admiral Halsey nearly allows a costly Japanese victory but for a doughty and desperate fleet of outgunned escort carriers. Not far away, an annoyed beachmaster's response to a command to land MacArthur on shore during his return to the Philippines - \\"Let 'em walk\\" - led to one of American history's singular images.Spector doesn't write to impress, but his marshalling of facts and his overall clarity and concision make for a kind of art. If you are interested in World War II, you want to read this. If you are not, this is the kind of book that may well change that."},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"I read this shortly after the first edition came out. I was taking a year off to travel around the world and I was going to spend a good six months in the South Pacific. Although I had read a lot of history on the war prior to this, I wanted a good general history to tie everything together. I wanted one as in-depth as I could get. From this volume I made again launched into a more detailed reading on individual battles and campaigns.This book was both admirable in its sweep and it is well written and researched, with a very good attention to detail that one does not often find in general overview books.The downfall of America and her island-hopping campaign is told with very good balance between the macro-polical objectives -- the machinations, intrigue, inter-service rivalry, and horsetrading -- is balanced nicely wiht the battles themselves and the individual sacrifice of the American soldiers.The carrier war is a point well described with Spector taking as much time to describe the Midway Battles as he does for the later Marianas \\"Turkey Shoot.\\" One area I was very pleased to read was the small bit on the American Black troops in the theatre.The book does not cover America's very limited contribution to the mainland war in Asia, but it does give a very good overview on the discussions and different visions the Americans and British had in the Pacific as a whole. With it being over 40 years since these horrible events unfolded it is worthy to note the Spector also deals with some of the unseemly side of the American war in the Pacific, how it migrated very quickly into a racial war with its concommitent valuation of the Japanese as less than human. From the Marine penchant for killing the few prisoners that were willing to surrender, to the wholesale destruction of Japanese cities by conventional and then Nuclear bombing. All of this said while not loosing sight of the very ugly aspects of Japanese Imperial tyrrany in Pacific and its treatment of other Asians as well as Allied Prisoners of War.A good meaty read from cover to cover and a very good jumping off point for the study of individual campaigns and battles."},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"An excellent fresh look 'behind the scenes' at the war in the Pacific.

I'm sure there are many readers who currently own a copy who would welcome it and like myself not hesitate to add it their library."},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"I purchased this book due to wanting a change of scenery from the Normandy Campaign and the European Theater as I am a WWII history buff, but mainly favor reading and learning about the European Theater. I searched on here and found this book by Spector and am pleasantly surprised by it and enjoyed it for the most part.Pros: A very well done account of the Pacific Theater of World War II. Spector covers all of the major battles, operations, the important players for Japanese and Allied forces, the locations, and some other interesting nuggets such as introducing the American military build up in all branches from WWI to WWII as well as Japanese military build up.Cons: At times the formatting is confusing. What I mean is...he talks about parts of the Pacific theater until page 300ish til 1944 or so and then jumps to the Chinese and Burma part of the war way back in 1941 and 1942, which could be confusing to casual readers. I am a history major so I handled it alright but even to me it was puzzling. Then, in the 400ish page ranges he started including random chapters on the negro, women, etc, in the war, and a chapter on what men did on leave in various locations in the war. Don't get me wrong, some of the more interesting chapters in the book, but perhaps he should have worked these into the book earlier as I was use to the various island operations and theaters of war discussed and then he goes to a chapter on leave just as the final build up is coming to end the war.I know the cons look longer than the pros but this is definitely a 4/5 star book. The info is great, the sources are awesome. This book focus's on the operational part of the Pacific Theater, not a narrative type of the war like some historians like Stephen Ambrose, Cornelius Ryan, and Antony Beevor have done so well over the years, and I love those types of history books the best, but this is still a fairly easy read of sorts, if you can stay focused on all the dozens of names and places. There is only one map at the beginning, which some might not like, but it does a good job of showing locales of major battles but just one map...so some might want a book with more maps. Overall, I recommend this book...if you enjoy World War II history or if you are someone who enjoys history and can handle a for the most part operational view on the war, not a narrative for the most part."},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"I was led to this book after reading the author's more recent \\"In the Ruins of Empire\\",which greatly clarified my understanding of modern Asia.

However that does not mean I share author's views. The book epitomizes standard American interpretation of Pacific war.On the positive side: author expatiates on woeful unpreparedness of US to wage war. American public did not wish to embroil any foreign conflicts. They were indifferent to outbreak of war in Europe. Majority of them anticipated a quick Allied victory. Military experts like George F. Elliot Hanson W. Baldwin in popular magazines continued to assure them Germans would exhaust themselves against fortifications of France and Belgium. However situation changed suddenly .France was knocked out in 40 days.BEF bolted from the continent. Western Europe now lay under the heel of Nazi jackboot.Americans were stunned.Spector furnishes wealth of information on US Japanese war doctrines, naval strategies. Coming of new weapons such airplanes, torpedoes revolutionized war at sea.Japanese were at the forefront in the creation of naval air power.Author explores conspiracy theories surrounding Pearl Harbor raid.He has presented different shades of opinion.This fruitful debate was an eye-opener for me, for it has managed to correct few of mine mistaken notions.Author examines the problem of command; he argues defeating Japan boiled down to allocating resources in sufficient quantities. Book features discussion on how Joint Chiefs of Staff in Washington tried to reconcile the demand for resources among different competing theaters of war.Apart from narrating Coral Sea, Midway, Guadalcanal campaigns, author has incorporated into his narrative operational details on hitherto ignored CBI(China-Burma-India)theatre of war.Discussion on code breaking signal intelligence, covert operations involving US Special Forces in Indo China definitely enlarges the scope of the book. Use of intelligence is recommended but comes with caveats. In author's view intelligence makes victory possible but does not ensure it. The biggest challenge is to use information without compromising its source. Finally, even the best intelligence is of no use if will is absent to act upon it.Book features an interesting discussion on defective torpedoes carried by US navy submarines.Americans belatedly realized the magnitude of the problem. However submarines did a good job in cutting off Japan from her newly-won empire.Author examines human costs of war. Americans lavished lot of care and attention to their wounded servicemen. Further he shows how US servicemen got accustomed to the life of boredom, loneliness, isolation in the tropics.Author has acknowledged racial discrimination practiced in the US armed forces where blacks were treated with abject contempt. Many people considered blacks as unfit for combat and capable of engaging only in manual labour. Such a racial stereotyping was unfortunate.Perhaps most striking comment is Spector's admission that Pacific war spelt the demise of western political dominance in east Asia. British Empire, in particular, faded away into the pages of history.Now some dissenting opinion: US took umbrage in the fact that Japan joined Axis powers. Japan, however, found herself surrounded by strong Anglo American military bloc. Tokyo was in need of powerful allies to check her isolation. Tripartite pact with Germany and Italy was signed keeping this goal in mind.Other disturbing aspect is whether Roosevelt's policies provoke war? Steps such as freezing Japanese funds in US banks ,halting exports of scrap iron, aviation gasoline, oil hurt Tokyo badly. Can these be construed as economic warfare? Author argues the above measures were necessary to restrain Japanese aggression. If so, Americans miscalculated. The policy backfired, for it incited Tokyo to act more aggressively. By initiating such measures, I feel, President and his advisers added fuel to the fire.Author condemns predatory nature of Japanese rule in South East Asia, Indo-China. However he is mute on terrible famine which engulfed the Indian province of Bengal where 1.5 million people perished. Irony was Europeans dined posh, swanky hotels of Calcutta; concurrently, people in the countryside died in scores. Sufficient documentation is available to show the famine was the outcome rapacious policies initiated by the British.Finally, book carries no maps. I don't know why? Personally, I'm appalled.Nonetheless, Spector has done a remarkable job in skillfully crafting in a single volume multidimensional nature of Pacific war. Book is neatly packed into 23 chapters. It also features an annotated bibliography; former is more useful than standard bibliography .For it contains more information on secondary sources.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"Anyone seeking a thorough, well-written and objective account of the U.S. war against Japan should add Ronald Spector's \\"Eagle Against the Sun'' to their reading list. Spector tackles with obvious verve a difficult task - compressing a four-year war that stretched from the Aleutians to India into 560 pages. You have to admire a historian who uses exclamation marks out of sheer enthusiasm. As someone who is more or less a novice on the Pacific War, several things struck me: I was surprised by the speed with which the allies put Japan on the defensive after Pearl Harbor and started taking back the territories she'd seized. And I was astounded by the extent to which both Japan and the allies were crippled by mistaken intelligence and assumptions - reconnaissance planes misreporting the number and type of enemy ships, Japanese commanders believing their own side's propaganda -- and by bureaucratic wrangling between the branches of their militaries (and, in the allied case, between countries with different priorities). Spector does a good job evaluating commanders' decisions, always taking into account what they knew and which of their assumptions were reasonable even if ultimately wrong.I came to the book with little knowledge of naval warfare. So I wished early on that Spector had told us how many seamen were lost whenever ships sank. I was stunned by sheer tonnage of shipping that fell victim to bombs, shells, torpedoes and kamikazes; but I didn't know whether to assume that all or most of the crews died when their ships went down. Only occasionally did Spector mention the human toll at sea. I suspect this omission was just designed to avoid cluttering the copy with repetitive information. Elsewhere in the book - describing the experiences of the average GI in the Pacific, for instance - he clearly shows empathy toward the human beings, military and civilian alike, who suffered and died. Another complaint: The version I read contained no maps - a serious handicap for a book covering so much unfamiliar geography.Upon finishing this book, I immediately started Spector's sort-of sequel, \\"In the Ruins of Empire.'' \\"Eagle Against the Sun'' was a not a fluke.

As such, it achieves its goal admirably. Because the focus is on the campaign, rather than individual battles, there is a sense of the scale of the Pacific War, as well as a strategic feeling for how the war was prosecuted by both sides. Thus, logistics, politics, and intellegence are given as much space as fleets and amphibious landings. The advantage is that the book breaks up the long slogging of the island-hopping battles with the extra information. The disadvantage is that, while seminal victories like Coral Sea and Tarawa are well described, other battles are given such brief notice that you might miss them (or rather, think that more detail might be forthcoming later, when it isn't). However, on the balance, the size of the book dictates the limits of what can be discussed, and within these limitations the book does exactly what it's supposed to do, and it's interesting and comprehensive from a strategic point of view.Although the title implies that the book focusses on the Japanese-US conflict, there is ample space devoted to other aspects of the Pacific War. Very little coverage of campaigns in China are covered, likewise the initial battles for Singapore and the Dutch East Indies, and Australians fighting in New Guinea. However, an entire chapter is devoted to the British-Japanese fight in Burma, as well as the airlift of supplies from India into China. But, of course, the vast bulk of the fighting was done by Americans so the focus is on them. Again, all aspects of the war are covered, and perhaps none more vividly than the internal organizational struggles amongst the U.S. services and the various Japanese political factions. From the buffer of 50 years, Spector is not shy about assigning blame or praise where due: he has little good to say about MacArthur, for example, and ridicules the command structure of the U.S. where interservice infighting took up as much energy as fighting the Japanese (as opposed to the British model where the separate services were all subordinated to the Imperial General Staff, which reported directly to Churchill and the War Cabinet).The Pacific focus leads to some some curious omissions, as if the Pacific part of WWII occurred in isolation from other parts. Naturally the tripartate meetings between Churchill, Stalin, and Roosevelt are discussed, but other seminal events are not. For example, no mention is made of the British raid on the Italian fleet anchorage at Taranto, where 20 obsolete Swordfish bombers and torpedo-bombers crippled three (half) of the Italian fleet's battleships. Like the Japanese at Pearl Harbor, the torpedoes needed to be modified for use in the shallow anchorage, and the planes flew off a carrier. The Taranto attack took place a month before Pearl, and was well noted by the Japanese (although, to be fair, planning and training for the Pearl attack would have been well underway by that time). Similarly, for all the discussion in the book on cryptanalysis in breaking the Japanese codes, no mention is made on how this was done, nor what system the Japanese used for cryptography. Did they have Enigma-style machines? Was it all by hand? Did they use one-time pads? Another incident that appears missing is the sinking of the USS Indianapolis - only one ship, but one that has become a legend (because it carried the Little Boy A-bomb parts to Tinian just before it sank, and because the Navy's command \\"lost\\" the boat so the survivors of the sinking were left to the mercy of the sharks for 3 days).Perhaps these are nit-picks and, as mentioned above, not everything can be included in a one-volume book. Perhaps more fatal to the overall effect of the book is the fact that a breezy rush through the events of the Pacific War will inevitably lead to a feeling of \\"same-old-same-old\\": one amphibious island assault becomes much the same as the next one, and the complete lack of maps (except for one poorly-labelled theatre map of the entire Pacific rim) leaves the reader floating around the vast Pacific with no navigational aids. It is this reason that I've dropped it to 4/5 stars.

Nice to see attention given the British/Indian/Burma theater as well as China which are often overlooked.I think the best thing about this book is that it covers everything, not in any great detail, but enough to wet your beak, so it can leave you wanting to follow through on particular battles or commanders of interest that you may not have known or overlooked before.This is one of those books that was so good, I had to lend it out to others, and its passed through so many hands now, I don't think I'll ever get it back. Be careful!"},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"I have long been fascinated with the WWII conflict in the Pacific. I have read many books explaining what happened, how it happened and why it happened in relation to individual battles, campaigns and atrocities. This book is one of the very best I have ever read concerning the Pacific Theater of WWII. The author does a good job of bringing in background material to set the stage and then explains what happened and follows on to explain the consequences of the action. I'm really enjoying the book."},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"Ronald Spector is a first rate historian and writer, plus he's a Marine. I got this book for a WWII USAAF(now USAF)veteran--a 90 year old Wyoming chap who served in many of the places Prof. Spector writes about. This is an easy read. Even though I've seen videos about the Pacific in WWII , this book keeps you on edge because Spector really did a lot of research. Today's youth ought to read it to understand why we call my friend and his fellow WWII men and women---The Greatest Generation. This Marine appreciated his work."},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"The book arrived promptly, in perfect condition, and well packaged.Also, it is a very good book, just what I wanted. There is so much less information available about the Pacific war when compared with the European that I wanted just such an overall view.I'd also highly recommendDownfall: The End of the Imperial Japanese Empirewhich concentrates on the ending of the war."},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"I do not understand how a history of a war spread over such a sprawling canvas could possibly be published without maps. Perhaps this is only true of the paperback version. This is a major barrier to understanding the strategy and even the thinking of the major characters in the narrative."},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"Good books devoting themselves to the overall scope and breadth of Pacific campaign against the Japanese during World War Two are hard to find, but this book solves the reader's problem nicely. It is a comprehensive, entertaining, and fair-minded book that careful details both Japanese and Allied perspectives before, during, and at the conclusion of the war. This book is truly a carefully constructed, exhaustively researched and quite well documented one-volume history that everyone should love. I first discovered it on the syllabus of a graduate-level Harvard history course, and have had it on my shelf ever since. Written in a very accessible style that allows the reader to stream through as though one is reading a novel, and it is filled with interesting anecdotes and new insights that keep the reader entertained and interested throughout the nearly 600 pages of the book. My own personal favorite was an actual complaint filed immediately after the attack at Pearl Harbor by a Hawaiian resident of a dog who was allegedly barking in Morse code to the Japanese ships offshore. It is also offers a number of new thought provoking and intriguing ideas about aspects of the war against Japan for the reader.The author engages in an active reinterpretation of the war based on declassified intelligence files, archival material, Japanese documents and an impressive collection of interviews with principals involved in the almost five year struggle to defeat the Japanese after the events at Pearl Harbor. It is interesting to learn that the U.S. planned to wage a wide-ranging campaign of submarine attacks against enemy shipping even before the start of the war, and also indicates that MacArthur was lucky not to be unceremoniously dumped after his bad bungling of the defense of the Philippines and also because of his active disregard for a number of important intercepts of Japanese messages that could have saved literally thousands of American and other lives. Spector also reveals that U.S. decisions were often more influenced by the nature of our stormy relationship with our British allies and our own inter-service rivalries than by strategic concerns.The author vividly conjures up accurate and spell-binding accounts of the major battles of the war, and provides a number of intriguing descriptions of lesser known aspects of the Pacific campaign, as well. He takes the reader on a fascinating whirlwind tour of the war, leaping from details of critical meetings between war planners in the Pentagon to social, economic, and political aspects of the engagement to excellent on-the-scene coverage of the battlegrounds. He shows us how the war against the Japanese was different from that being waged in Europe, and how this intensely naval type of conflict was in a number of ways much more risky and innovative on our part than its European counterpart. I was particularly fascinated by his interesting argument that the most critical Japanese mistake of the war was in allowing itself to be drawn into fighting the war of attrition we had always preferred to wage based on its defeat at Midway. This is an important, magisterial, and comprehensive book that is undoubtedly the single best one-volume treatment of the war against Japan and it belongs on every serious World War Two student's bookshelf. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"As a history of the Pacific War, Eagle Against the Sun is rivalled only by Samuel Eliot Morison's 15 volume classic. Ironically, however, Spector packs far more detail into this classic one volume narrative than Morison managed to include in 15. Where Morison slighted organization, logistics, and sociological issues in favor of action, Spector gives such issues the attention they deserve. The Pacific War was a war of logistics--moving massive volumes of men and material across thousands of miles of ocean. The Pacific War was also a fascinating study in race and gender relations, with early and problematic evolution towards the modern integrated force. Spector addresses all these issues, while still telling an exciting story of action and heroism.Spector is eminently well-qualified to write such a history. A Marine Corps veteran (Viet Nam), Spector is also a professional historian. He understands combat as few historians do. Spector is also a talented writer, whose prose flows quickly and powerfully.Spector's careful analysis of the controversial decision to use atomic weapons against Japan is especially well-done. He acknowledges that there are legitimate arguments--both moral and military--against their use. He notes that critics of the decision included not only left-leaning academics, but also army and navy leaders resisting air force officers who believed that SAC rendered the other branches obsolete. Yet, he persuasively argues that tha atomic bombs, coupled with Russia's invasion of Manchuria, were the exogenous shocks that finally destabilized Japan's militarist regime.In sum, very highly recommended."},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"Reading about the Pacific War in the new WWII novel, &quot;The Triumph and the Glory&quot;, spurred me into exploring the topic further, so I picked up a copy of &quot;Eagle Against the Sun&quot; and was very impressed. It is solidly researched, very readable, all in all one of the better history volumes about the great struggle in the Pacific between the United States and Imperial Japan."},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"This is a very good one-volume history of World War II in the Pacific. It is fast-paced, easy reading, and balanced. The author covers all aspects of the war with roughly the emphasis they deserve, shifting back and forth from the high councils of strategy to homely events on the front lines of this brutal, bitter conflict.&quot;Eagle against the Sun&quot; won't get my highest rating, however, because of its lack of maps. The inside cover has a general map of the Pacific -- and that's all folks. How can a publisher put out a book that contains hundreds of obscure place names and descriptions of complex military maneuvers without at least a dozen detailed maps to illustrate the text? The lack of maps diminishes what would otherwise be an outstanding book."},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"This is probably one of the BEST single volume works in the field. ANY student of the US Navy, or World war II who doesn't have this on their shelf isn't serious about the field. I CANNOT recommend it too highly, both for content and for readability. Buy it.... you WON'T regret it."},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"If you've read some of the other reviews this will come as no surprise - - this is a terrific book, but one that is completely lacking in maps to explain the strategic and tactical elements of the various Pacific campaigns that are exhaustively and effectively summarized and described throughout the book. Putting together a narrative that describes and explains the entire Pacific war in about 600 pages is no small task, but this book does the trick. And it's an entertaining read as well. It is a terrific overview of the entire Pacific war that covers every major offensive with appropriate emphasis on the problems of logistics, in-fighting among the allies and among service branches and competition among the various theatres for precious supplies, equipment, arms and manpower. However, the lack of any campaign maps was frustrating and irritating. About halfway through the book, I happened to find the West Point Atlas for the Pacific War at Borders (an absolutely fantastic collection of campaign maps) and scooped it up specifically to use with this book. With the atlas at the ready, Eagle Against The Sun became a much better read. Even if you're fully familiar with the imense geography of the Pacific war, you'll be driven batty by the lack of maps in Eagle Against The Sun. However, the lack of maps is really the book's only material flaw and, in the end, it was easily fixed by pulling out the atlas."},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"This is a superb analysis of the Pacific War between the USA and Japan. It is always very difficult for an author to strike a balance between sufficient detail on the one hand, and the risk of overwhelming the \\"big picture\\" with too much detail, on the other. Here, the author hits it just right. This is a detailed and thorough analysis of the Pacific War that focuses on the main trends of the war, while supplying sufficient detail to support the themes that the author presents to the reader.Spector's basic thesis is not new, but this is the best presentation of it that I have encountered. Essentially, the author notes that superior American industrial capacity, organizational skills, and technology overwhelmed a highly trained, well-armed and competent Japanese foe. The Japanese training regime was brutal, featuring tough night training in the icy waters south of the Kurils--Japanese skill at night naval engagements were to give the US Navy ugly moments for years. On the other hand, the author speculates that the savage discipline of the Japanese service tended to \\"burn out\\" its officers, often causing them to avoid \\"thinking outside the box.\\"Both sides had problems with inter-service rivalries. The Americans fought the war with divided commands, whereby MacArthur advanced through the South Pacific with most of the Army, while Nimitz advanced through the Central Pacific with the bulk of the Navy and the Marines. The author argues that this was an inefficient, sub-optimal strategy. The Japanese Army and Navy were even more riven with rivalries, and the Japanese Navy on numerous occasions concealed from the Army the scope of its defeats at the hands of the US Navy. (It was a long time before the Japanese Army learned of the disasterous defeat of the Navy at Midway; the Army believed that Japan had won, not lost, the Battle of Leyte Gulf).This is a fairly conventional analysis of the Pacific War, but the author sometimes does come to unorthodox conclusions that will challenge the reader's own opinions about command decisions made by the Pacific War's heavyweights. Frank Jack Fletcher merits heavy blame for lacking aggressiveness on several occasions, which is no surprise, but at times Admiral Spruance (a personal hero of mine) also comes in for criticisms that I did not expect. The author overall attempts to be fair, however, and generally does a pretty fair job of making his case.Overall, this is perhaps the best single volume analysis of the Pacific War written for the general public that I have come across, and it is highly recommended."},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"If you're looking for a book about battles and fighting, this isn't the book for you. If you want a look at generals and statesmen struggling to find a way to victory, you'll enjoy this book. It tells the tale of how victory in the Pacific was found and fashioned. The disagreements between the services, the personal chemistry, the problems with logistics, the balancing of needs versus the fight with Germany, all these important issues are explicated in 'Eagle against the Sun'. It's not exhaustive in its treament of the war and not exhausting in the reading.It's a very good book to start analyzing World War II in the Pacific theater."},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"A very readable, interesting history of the Pacific theater in World War II. Despite being a single volume Spector does a masterful job of covering all the key aspects of the Pacific war and does so in a very complete manner. The earlier reviewers comments about the lack of maps is true; you might want to have an atlas handy while reading this book. Definitely worth your investment several times over in both time and money."},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"This is a very well written and informative book, and it gives a good high level overview of the war in the Pacific. There is probably nothing new or particularly interesting in it for the expert, but for the interested layman it is a good read. There seem to be some inexplicable omissions here and there, such as the real risk of Halsey's sojourn at the Battle of Leyte Gulf. However, my biggest complaint is the lack of any maps in the book. There was a single, high-level map of the whole theater on the inside cover, and that was it!! How can you write a military history of WWII without a single map to depict the major battles?? This is a pet peeve of mine with many history books, but this book was especially egregious."},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"Truly the only single-volume Pacific theater history one needs. Spector is well documented in his history and historiography, presenting and evaluating differing schools of thought on the Allied campaigns on the Second World War. The primary focus is US grand strategy and the internal struggles that came with it, but the author never fails to hail the men at the pointy end of the spear. Most importantly, Spector is accessible, achieving an academic work that's a pleasure to read."},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"Based on the 19 reviews in Amazon I bought the book. The reviews are on target, even the comments about the paucity of maps which I found to be only a minor issue for me. Spector's writing style is a big factor in enjoying this book.

Spector does an outstanding job of pulling together a plethora of sources, and boiling them down to explain otherwise-complex battles and strategies. If he had included maps in his book it would've rated a 10, but because he didn't (probably to reduce the overall number of pages) the book is a little incomplete."},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"This book is awesome!

I will be re reading it for the rest of my life."},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"This book is an excellent overview of the war in the Pacific. Many other reviewers have criticized the lack of maps, but I think that most readers (like myself) have already read a lot about the battles, and already have maps, or have even pretty much already memorized the map of the Pacific theater.While maps are important for individual campaigns, that is not the purpose of this book. What this book does is tie together all the things going on in the different parts of the Pacific theater, such as how MacArthur and Nimitz each thought their own plan should get priority on limited shipping and supplies, just how limited those supplies were, and how Admiral King, by unexpectedly putting a division of Marines on Guadalcanal, caused the US to actually ship more troops and planes to the Pacific than to Europe at the same time that we were officially saying we had a \\"Europe First\\" policy.Individual battles are not talked about much, but when you get done with this book you will understand how they fit together into the large picture of the entire war in the Pacific. I already knew a lot about individual battles, but now I also know why they happened and what their effect was on the war as a whole."},{"Title":"Arka Tech index: 1945-1959","review":"Trying to squeeze into a single volume something such as the war in the Pacific is no simple task. There are any number of studies that go long: Morison or those that go single event--The Shattered Sword and At Dawn We Slept. The detail is provided in these works cannot be matched by a single volume work such as the Eagle Against the Sun.History is not detail, but ideas. The idea contained in this work while painted with a broader brush capture certain aspects of the war that were either not covered or covered differently.What Eagle Against the Sun (stupid title)provides is an intersting comparison of the many institutional conflicts which drove the action in the war. These are the conflicts between the Army and Navy, Civlian and Military, and factions within these services. These conflicts were present in both the American and Japanese camps. Many struggles were among the factions in these institutions, which in turn drove the allocation of resources and the military choices for both sides. The description of the battles are somewhat secordary (and there are better volumes available to describe these battles). These struggles, while strikingly similar in Japan and the US proved fatal for Japan but not the US. This book makes compelling reading.Four and one-half stars."},{"Title":"Greek New Testament (Spanish Version)","review":"Make no mistake that this is the United Bible Society &quot;Greek New Testament,&quot; 4th edition, and the only difference being that the prefaces are in Spanish and the dictionary in the back is not Greek-English, but Greek-Spanish. So, even if you don't speak/read Spanish, and want to save a lot of money on a 4th Edition UBS Greek New Testament, and already have a smaller Greek-English lexicon, this is a good way to go. This is especially true if you already have a 3rd edition UBS Greek New Testament since the preface to the 4th Edition doesn't say that much and the real &quot;meat' is in the 3rd Edition preface/introduction, which is given in this 4th edition also, only, of course, in Spanish here. If you do speak Spanish, either as a native speaker or as a second language, then, of course, you'll especially enjoy this edition, especially with the Greek-Spanish dictionary. As one who can get around in Spanish, I find looking up the Spanish translations of Greek words in the back a fun way to keep the cobwebs off my Spanish. The only cautions include that one should understand that &quot;leather&quot; doesn't mean the kind of limp, flexible binding one is used to for a take-to-church Bible, but is essentially a hardbound-type leather binding. (For the limper binding I understand the choice would be the &quot;Reader's Greek N.T.&quot;, which is also available from Amazon.) Also, the Greek font used in the 4th Edition of the UBS Greek N.T. is somewhat lighter than the print appearing in earlier editions of the UBS Greek N.T. which some may not like as well, depending on the age of their eyes.

L. Davis, most notably the novel Winds of Morning and the beautifully executed short story, \\"The Homestead Orchard.\\" It was with pleasurable anticipation that I obtained Davis's prizewinning magnum opus.But this monstrosity totally surprised me. The rendering of Oregon's history and geography is too far removed from the truth for a novel that is supposed to be a fanciful tapestry of Oregon's history and geography--it's so fanciful as to merely annoy. The characters are not well-developed and are cartoonish. I can stand fantasy sequences (loved Dickens's Little Dorrit), but this endless ramble exhausted my patience. I kept waiting to reach the good part. I should have given up after the first 100 pages.H. L. Davis is a little-known and under-appreciated author whose works are not of even quality.

This book did manage to do that for me though.Honey in the Horn takes place in the Pacific Northwest, when it was still half overrun by indigenous people and almost everyone in the area was transient.

Her father was a gambler and quite frequently that meant living in less than desirable neighbourhoods, going without enough food or coal -- in short living a life of shabby gentility. Now her brother has grown up to become a gambler as well, and it's beginning to look as if a life of never ending scrimping and scraping is looming in front of Amy when an unexpected piece of good fortune lands at her feet. Amy finds a lottery ticket. And not just any lottery ticket, but a winning one at that. At first Amy thinks that the ticket belongs to her brother, Richard. But when it turns out not to be Richard's ticket, Amy realises that she will have to shed her quiet ways and go into Society in order to find the ticket's rightful owner. But this is a move that fills her with both excitement and dread, for this will bring her all the more into contact with the dreadful Earl of Tallant, a sinfully good-looking gentleman who is a gambler and rake, and who, for some reason or the other, seems bent on pursuing an acquaintance! Can Amy keep her good sense while she searches for the rightful owner of the lottery ticket, or will the Earl turn her head completely and make her forget all propriety...&quot;The Earl's Prize&quot; is a rather typical Regency-era romance novel that revolves around an earl who is not as black as he's been painted, and a young lady who's not as straight-laced as she thought she was -- in other words nothing new under the sun. What makes this novel so very enjoyable then was the manner in which Nicola Cornick allowed for her story to unfold and the two main characters she created. Both Amy and the earl are characters that most readers will be able to take to their hearts and root for them to find their hapily-ever-after ending. As I noted at the very beginning, this is a very nice and unassuming novel that will (unwittingly) steal your heart. A good read."},{"Title":"The Earl's Prize","review":"Miss Amy Bainbridge had seen what gambling could do to a man and his family as she watched her father lose his money repeatedly, eventually taking his own life in desperation. Amy is determined to not follow his path, and abhors gambling and those who gamble. So when she meets the dashing Earl of Tallant, she is determined not to fan the flames of attraction because he is a gambler just like her father. Once Amy gets a fortune quite by accident, she finds herself being pursued by several eligible men. So why is that her mind keeps drifting to the Earl of Tallant?Joss, Earl of Tallant, had not had an easy life. He had watched his parents' marriage fail dismally, and he was determined to not fall in love or to marry. When he first sees Amy, he doesn't think she'll be any temptation to him at all - not only does she not inspire his amorous attentions, but she abhors him and his lifestyle. As he gets to know Amy better, however, he finds that his carefully constructed facade of polite detachment may just crumble after all!I really thought that I would like this book, and there were some good parts to it. The reason I am giving it only one star, however, is because I was left wondering where the romance was! The love story was crammed into the last 75 pages of the book, and it wasn't that good at any rate. Joss was still sleeping with his mistress with 100 pages left in the book, and he didn't dismiss his mistress until there was only 50 pages left to the book! That is just not what I find attractive in a romance novel at all. The hero should NOT be keeping a mistress for 5/6 of the book. Ick.I realize that it may be realistic to have Joss so portrayed, but honestly, I do not read romance novels for realism. If I wanted history, I would read a history book; and if I want to look at a man who is supposedly in love with one person but is sleeping with another, I can just look around my town and surely find many! I read a romance novel to ESCAPE from reality, and this offered no escape at all. If Joss and Amy were real characters, I would be warning Amy that Joss would most likely be putting up another mistress in less than a year, so be prepared to have her heart broken! It's a good thing that I have read other Nicola Cornick books before this, or I surely would have never read one of her books again."},{"Title":"The Earl's Prize","review":"Amy Bainbridge is a much tried heroine, her family ruined by her father's gambling is set even more firmly on the road to perdition by her brother following in his parent's footsteps. One evening, much to her disgust, he brings home a trio of friends to gamble. The next day Amy picks up a lottery ticket in the dishevilled room and decides to go along to the draw in a fit of curiosity. To her shock - the winning ticket is hers! Or rather she holds the winning ticket and has absolutely no idea who is its rightful owner. Wholly honest, she feels she must find the owner, very much over the horrified protests of her family who were delighted at the prospect of real money. She sets out to discover which gambler of the evening it could be.The rakish Earl of Tallant, Joss, was one of the aforementioned gamblers of that night and is in fact the true owner. She is both attracted to his person and repulsed by his character. He also finds himself attracted and very much interested against his inclinations (he is intent upon finding out what she will do with the ticket).The machinations of several shady characters and Tallant's own sister force the pair into an odd relationship wherein they both discover more than they bargained for.This is a completely charming tale, engaging hero and heroine. Neither are overly prone to theatrics and both in the end discover each other to be highly principled. The era was also believably created without modern mores irritatingly being slated home to the characters.A great read."},{"Title":"The Earl's Prize","review":"It didn't have as much sizzle as some of her other books, but I think I liked it the best because it was a more believable romance to me. Love to me starts out with attraction not sex."},{"Title":"Drawing Animals","review":"This is a great book that shows you how to draw many animals including elephants, bears, horses, cattle, deer, sheep, primates, cats, dogs, squirrels and rabbits.For each animal there is a complete sketch of the front, side and three-quarter view as well as close-up front and side head views. Next, sketches using basic shapes show the animals from several angles. Then, skeleton, musculature and surface anatomy are shown and discussed. A brief three-step demonstration of how to draw the animal follows.Complete drawings of the animals doing various activities such as drinking, touching, sitting, and resting are also shown along with sketches of the animals' young. Sometimes different species of animals are shown such as polar and black bears. Animals sharing a similar shape such as zebra, buffalo, hippopotamus and burro are shown sometimes as well. Drawings include brief commentary.Though I do like this book and did find it helpful, especially the anatomy/muscle diagrams, I wish the written instructions were a little more detailed. Overall, I would recommend it to any beginning to intermediate artist who wishes to improve their animal drawing technique."},{"Title":"Drawing Animals","review":"While giving charts of the skeleton and musculature, the emphasis is on the far more helpful method of breaking the animal and its extensions into simple shapes that can be used to quickly lay in a pose before getting on to texture and such. Plenty of action poses and the changes of the head when the jaw or trunk is moved. Covers elephants, bears, horses, cattle, deer, sheep, primates, cats, dogs, and \\"other small animals\\" -- mostly the squirrel and the rabbit, but one finished drawing each for the cavy, the prairie dog, the raccoon, and a hoary marmot.Obviously, if you are focusing on drawing animals in particular or particular animals, you will want more specific reference. Everything here is good, there just isn't enourmous depth."},{"Title":"Drawing Animals","review":"I checked this book out at my library mainly to try to get some ideas on how to draw animals more realistically (making the hair look more real). While I was amazed by the drawings in the book, I really didn't learn anything from it. The author should have gone into more depth with the demonstrations. They are each broken into three steps: the outline, the basic shading, and then it's done. So many steps are skipped, so you don't really get an idea of how the author did the drawing. Again, the author's drawings are incredible, I just wish he had gone into more detail on how he did them."},{"Title":"Drawing Animals","review":"This is an excellent book to use as a reference for experienced artists. As someone who is no longer a novice, I am often slightly annoyed at having to wade through repetitive chapters designed for beginners (what pencils to use, how to shade, etc, etc) just to find the nuggets of information or reference material that are new to me. Therefore, I was very pleased to find this book, which skips the information for beginners found in so many other books, and fills its pages entirely with a good variety of animals of all sorts of shapes and forms.For each animal, there are pencil rendered versions of:Front view, side view, three-quarter viewDifferent positions (resting, running, etc.)Close-ups of the head (front and three-quarter)Different breedsEach also has an illustration of its musculature and skeletal structure,And my personal favorite feature of this book:Each has a two-page spread of form sketches in many different positions, which helps a lot with solving foreshortening problems in one's work.The only drawback to this book is that not every animal is included! This is the most useful animal reference I've seen, and I only wish there were a second volume to include more species that are not covered in this one.In this book are:Elephants, bears, horses, cattle, deer, sheep, primates, cats, dogs, and \\"small animals\\" (mostly rabbits). Would have loved to see, for example, wolves, giraffes, etc. Still, for what it does have, this is a great book.Highly recommended for those who are well past the \\"how to draw\\" stage and just want some help including animals in their artwork."},{"Title":"Drawing Animals","review":"If your into drawing animals, this is the book for you! Tips on shading and bases are included. Clear pencil drawings or just outlines you can try to draw. It's the best drawing animal book ever!"},{"Title":"Drawing Animals","review":"At first glance I didn't care for the book that much because it was short on actual written directions. Just recently I decided to actually try and draw something from the book. I chose the rabbit on page 154 and 155.First he shows many different views of the animal, then some form sketches, skeleton and musculature and surface anatomy, then comes the part I find most helpful. In three steps he shows you how to do an animal from start to finish. He shows you the outline of the animal. Then the outline with some shading and then the final step of adding texture.I haven't been drawing very long but I can usually do the outline and shading, but have trouble getting texture that looks real. Even though he doesn't explain how to do the texture in words it was very helpful to me to SEE how to do it.I showed my husband my completed rabbit drawing and he was stunned! He couldn't believe that I had done it. I may be a dork but I am planning on framing it and hanging it in my daughter's room.I am working on a bear next. I plan on doing each animal in the book then going back and doing the animals in the different views that he showed. Practice makes perfect they say!"},{"Title":"Drawing Animals","review":"This is one of the better animal drawing books available today. I got this based on the rendering of elephants & wild cats here: they're really, really(!), beautifully done.In this book we get a limited range of animals depicted: elephants; bears; horses; cattle; dear; sheep; primates; wild cats; dogs; and small animals. Brief, yet large, examples of each- That's it. For a truly dizzying array of different types of animals depicted, try Jack Hamm'sHow to Draw Animals, one of my current favorite animal books. Hamm's effort is also better for people interested in drawing from memory; this Singer & Adams book specializes more in bringing a drawing to its finished state, with exceptional detail, in graphite pencil.It's often said we learn best by example. The examples here are great! Many drawings are broken into 3 basic steps: light construction; medium rendering; and then finished with all the details. Many books skip that middle step, and too many never reach the quality of finish found in the completed drawings here. The photo-realism is often extremely accurate, if you're into this style of rendering. I recommend getting this together with Hamm's book, or really any of the popular animal drawing books today. Combining different approaches is a great way to learn."},{"Title":"Drawing Animals","review":"I have looked at a lot!! of animal drawing books and this one is the best I've seen.The only thing that is missing is drawing small cats. But, it does have great instruction for a medium beginner."},{"Title":"Drawing Animals","review":"Great reference book to add to my studio collection. Very well described and a useful book to have for future work."},{"Title":"Ritual and Symbol in Peacebuilding","review":"Within the progressive movement, the term \\"worldview\\" is becoming increasingly recognized and valued, thanks to Lakoff's Don't Think of an Elephant and his focus on frames and perspectives. Lakoff identifies a weakness in fact-based movements: they fail to transform entrenched worldviews. Worldviews, Lakoff insists, are rooted in symbols and metaphors and prove intractable if approached by mere facts and figures.This is where Schirch comes in. In Ritual and Symbol, Schirch advances Lakoff's work by giving peacebuilders tools to understand and transform entrenched and intractable worldviews, identities and relationships--tools invaluable for a broad spectrum of peacebuilders, e.g. activists, artists, mediators, ADR lawyers, diplomats, etc.While this book is particularly helpful for arts-based peacebuilders, Ritual and Symbol is an essential prerequisite read for anyone poised to effect social change."},{"Title":"Ritual and Symbol in Peacebuilding","review":"As the peacebuilding field grows and professionalizes, there is an increasing body of literature on the subject. There is a great deal of research and writing exploring the material aspect of conflict, from delineating issue-based approaches to works aimed at developing concrete negotiation techniques. There is also a growing body of literature exploring the relational aspects of peacebuilding, focusing on processes of improving patterns of relating. Schirch's book, Ritual and Symbol in Peacebuilding, is one of the few resources for peacebuilders aimed at specificially exploring the symbolic aspects of conflict and peacebuilding.As such, it is an important addition to any peacebuilder's library. Schirch clearly details what she means by ritual and gives concrete examples of how ritual is used in everyday life- and more specifically, in attempts to transform and heal conflict.This book serves as a critical resource for those interested in consciously incorporating the symbolic into their concepts of what constitutes peacebuilding. As Schirch develops through specific examples, symbolic approaches to peacebuilding form a necessary component in transforming identities warped and distorted by conflict. I recommend this book highly!"},{"Title":"Ritual and Symbol in Peacebuilding","review":"Schirch highlights this oft missed element of peacebuilding. I found the book to be an excellent analysis and exploration of how we need to nurture the space for creative transformation. Very well written! A must read for anyone in the helping professions and relevant for everyone else as well."},{"Title":"Never a Greater Need","review":"I was first introduced to Benton when I stumbled upon a copy of &quot;This Is My Beloved&quot; I was blown away. When I again stumbled upon &quot;Never A Greater Need&quot; I just staggered. I was so happy to find Benton again. While I will have to say that &quot;This Is My Beloved&quot; is Benton's climax, &quot;Never A Greater Need&quot; follows along the same path of beautiful verse pulsing with emotion and depth. His words are intense and simple. Some of the best poetry written."},{"Title":"Never a Greater Need","review":"It's no wonder that this book of poetry has gone through so many printings; it's full of wisdom and is perhaps the greatest anti-war poetry ever written. \\"There are no good giants\\" is remarkable for its insight which remains more true today than ever."},{"Title":"Never a Greater Need","review":"Walter Benton has always been one of my favorites. His imagery and his use of words is non-pareil. This is the kind of poetry that one reads to a woman one loves, or has her read just for the pleasure of her voice. Highly recommended, and this book, together with \\"This Is My Beloved,\\" is romantic poetry at its best."},{"Title":"Never a Greater Need","review":"I stumbled upon this book years ago, and have read through it many times since (along with his other 'masterpiece,' \\"This Is My Beloved\\"). What I found so disarming was the fact that they were written in the 1940's! To think that a man can be so articulately erotic on love, and sensuality from that 'era' is astounding to me!One thing you come away knowing for sure (after reading these books) is that he loved his lady, and that she was probably the 'luckiest woman' around in those days! What a lover he must have been, and I feel sure that she was very 'grateful' to have known such love, and to be involved with such an aficionado of the subject!What beautiful words and descriptions in these pages! So much better than anything around these days! O, that it were 1943 and if I had read these books, I would go searching the world over for Walter Benton myself! I want to 'know' a man like this! Every woman wants to! If you haven't read these aforementioned books, make sure that you include them in your library -- especially if you're a 'romanticist\\"! They are not to be missed!"},{"Title":"Never a Greater Need","review":"Perhaps a poetic version of the movie, &quot;It's a wonderful life&quot;. Here, Walter Benton's poems juxtapose his memories of love with the hardships of war. The sensual nature of his observations remind the reader that love and beauty are present even in the midst of chaos, even if only in your mind; that perhaps one way to fully cope with a temporary insanity is to recall finer moments lived upon the same landscape."},{"Title":"Never a Greater Need","review":"This is the most emotional piece of work I have ever read. It comes from the soul and expresses such an unbelieveable loss and pain. It is something we have all experienced if there is any humanity inside. It is impopssible for me to read &quot;Each Season Of The Year&quot; without tearing.Read this book with the one you love. It will have a profound impact!"},{"Title":"Cook 1.0: A Fresh Approach to the Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"The cookbook is simple, the recipes are great, and the blog is wonderful!"},{"Title":"Cook 1.0: A Fresh Approach to the Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"This book is pretty, it's organized well, and, by the looks of it, a great cookbook for starter home cooks (especially vegetarian home cooks). But the food is terrible! Every time I've made a recipe from this book, I've been embarrassed to serve it to the people I made it for. I made a pasta that was almost inedibly bland and sticky, a tart that fell apart in its pan, biscuits that turned my fire alarm on three times during cooking because so much butter poured out (no warning from the author that these biscuits will bleed butter in the oven), and a black bean stew that was, at best, fine. I'm an every-night cookbook user and I finally gave this book away to charity. Someone bought this book for me as a gift when I was a very beginning cook with little confidence in the kitchen, to help me learn some basic skills and recipes. This book made my kitchen self confidence even lower! It wasn't until I started using a few other cookbooks--good ones--that I realized that it wasn't me, it was Heidi Swanson's Cook 1.0. (P.S. Those good cookbooks for starter cooks are Alice Waters' The Art of Simple Food and Martha Stewart's Great Food Fast--both are good, easy books that turn out consistently good food.)"},{"Title":"Cook 1.0: A Fresh Approach to the Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"This review is long overdue. I am an omnivore, with a mostly omnivorous family. Imagine my surprise when, two years ago, my teenager announced one evening (after a visit to a lovely farm with adorable baby cows) that she was going to stop eating any land animals. Turns out, there is a word for that:pescatarian. Back then, I didn't know that, and being faced with the prospect of trying to cook healthy vegetarian meals for a developing teenager made me want to pull my hair out. I worried that I would either end up with a malnourished girl, or that the food I cooked would be so unpalatable that she wouldn't eat it. I also didn't want to have to cook one meal for her, and another for the rest of the family. If she would make this journey, then so would we. I tried various vegetarian books, only to find tofu-pushing, bland recipes that I had a hard time tempting my whole family with. Then my sweet sister came to my rescue, telling me that her friend Heidi wrote a little book I might like...and she mailed me Heidi's guide.I call it a guide because that is what we used it for in the beginning. Heidi takes the time to explain the ingredients, the basics of how to cook them, and advises on the utensils and other things needed. She scatters useful advice throughout - it isn't a book that I just pull out when I need a recipe. I actually sit down and read it for the extra encouragement I need to keep our family on-track. I have two other children, 6 and 8. They loved their hot dogs and hamburgers. I don't know any other children their age who now rave about risotto and mushroom pot pie! My husband is a Food and Beverage Director for a luxury resort. Sometimes, after hearing about the menus he puts together for his hotel, I feel a little intimidated about what I offer him at home. This is a true sign of the success of Heidi's book: my carnivorous, German husband, Mr. Foodie, LOVES these dishes. Yes, he still likes sausages, schnitzel, etc. But he will dig into the corn, coconut, and curry soup like there is no tomorrow...Now, being more sensitive to the other vegetarians in the world, I always bring a dish from Heidi's book when I attend parties or potlucks. For our first vegetarian Thanksgiving, we were invited to a friend's home. The prospect of dining on Tofurkey didn't seem appetizing, so we made and contributed the mushroom medley fritatta and the roasted sweet potatoes to the Thanksgiving Feast. My kids had to wrestle to get some of the food we brought onto their plates! We ended up bringing home empty food containers, and I noticed there was ALOT of leftover turkey...everybody there just couldn't get enough of our vegetarian dishes.The best part is the ease with which I can prepare all this food. I enjoy cooking - I actually collect cookbooks. So I can say from experience that Heidi has a great formula with the format of this book. She gives you the basics for the core of the dish, then she offers a chart of various ingredients you can add in order to make different dishes out of that core recipe. It really simplifies things for the reader, and the various ideas for ingredients really make a difference in preventing food-boredom with my children.Again, thank-you, Heidi, for a well-written, well-planned guide to vegetarian cooking. We are two years into the game now (I thought it would last 6 months) and my well-worn copy of Cook 1.0 doesn't even make it back into my cookbook collection; I keep it out on my counter for quick reference. And my little vegetarian? Her new lifestyle has NOT turned her into the wraith I feared...she is 5'9\\" now, and a star on her school basketball and volleyball teams."},{"Title":"Cook 1.0: A Fresh Approach to the Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"As other reviewers have noted, I couldn't wait to try all of the recipes in this cookbook. I enjoy cooking, but lack any sort of invention in the kitchen; I'm awful at trying out new flavor combinations or \\"winging it\\" when it comes to expanding on a recipe. This is where Heidi's book excels: showing you how to build upon basic favorites to create new dishes. My favorite portion of this book is the \\"Flavor Combinations\\" page, which lists some tasty couplings that I, on my own, would not have had the foresight to pair (such as apples + fennel or strawberries + black pepper). I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys cooking but wishes they could be a bit more creative about it!"},{"Title":"Cook 1.0: A Fresh Approach to the Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"This is the cook book for everyone. I am by no means a vegetarian, but every recipe I have tried has just danced on my taste buds. I highly recomend the Mushroom Pie. Just plain awesome! Also, the photography is very creative and unlike anything I have seen in a cookbook. LOVE IT!!!"},{"Title":"Cook 1.0: A Fresh Approach to the Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"I took a big gamble on this cookbook - I had a dinner party this weekend and decided to cook recipes out of Cook 1.0 without ever trying them out before. THE GAMBLE PAID OFF! So much so that I ended up having to fax my friends recipes out of the book since they enjoyed the food so much. I am not the savviest of cooks but the table format made things so easy for me. This is truly a book for a new generation of cooks! I am looking forward to trying out new recipes this weekend on my family; Drop Biscuits, Smoothies, Pot Pies - My family will love this!"},{"Title":"Cook 1.0: A Fresh Approach to the Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"First of all I must disclose that it has been said that I don't/can't/shouldn't cook, and that the only thing I have consisently made with any success are 'reservations'. I was referred to Heidi's website and was happy to order Cook 1.0 on the principle of not giving up. I found myself reading it simply because it was a fun read and Heidi's unpretentious writing and presentation makes preparation exciting and not intimidating. I have since been preparing broken lasagna with cherry tomatoes, red pepper and lemon kabobs and roasting pine nuts with uncanny success! The unique format of Cook 1.0 is so easy to follow that I think Heidi has set a new standard for cookbooks. The conversion charts, suggested menu's for special occasions and tips are so helpful that it inspires you to try! The colors and photography in the book are nothing short of delightful and photos are not about table settings, dishware or center pieces but get this... about the food.

My favorites are the Broken Lasagna with Cherry Tomatoes, the Chipotle Potatoe Pot Pie, and the Raspberry Tart. Making you hungry?

I've cooked a bunch of things out of this book and, as somebody who doesn't have time to attempt huge and complex recipes and never wants to fail, this book is perfect for me.The recipes are very diverse, from pancakes to stir fry. Most are quick (under 45 minutes certainly). They are straight-forward to prepare and yet have a creative twist that gives them personality. You'll most certainly find some favorites in Cook 1.0.

The pizzas were a big hit in our family because they could relate and the ingredients were easy! I like that I know what goes into the dough and its super light. Portion sizes are great especially since we live in a \\"super sized\\" world. I am a totally worshipper of Heidi Swanson now and am converting all my friends too!

The recipes are straightforward and all the pratical information like what can be frozen and what can be done in advance is so helpful. My boyfriend is a meateater and there are lots of recipes that are substantial enough to satisfy him as well.The recipes are also really healthy, with a balanced but not overwhelming use of tofu and legumes.

I am new to cooking and this gave me great new ideas on what to prepare for my friends and family."},{"Title":"Cook 1.0: A Fresh Approach to the Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"I first discovered Heidi on her website 101cookbooks when I was looking for gluten free recipes. From there I discovered she published two books: this one and Super Natural Cooking. I bought both.This book is, simply put: BRILLIANT. She takes the book and breaks it up into sections such as main dishes, side dishes, desserts, beverages. But that is as traditional as she gets. In each section she covers one type of food and gives you several ways of preparing it. For example, she does a section on panini sandwiches. She will introduce what the panini is, tips for cooking (such as what type of bread to use), then she will have two or more pages of different panini sandwiches such as brie/apple/ cranberry/\\"fake\\" bacon. The recipes are read left to right instead of the standard up and down, in an excel-like format. And all of her recipes only take a handful of ingredients and are made in usually 3 steps or less.Some other foods covered are pizzas, risottos, pot pies, salads, pocket sandwiches, soups, pastas, stir-frys, dressings, flavored butters, ice cream, sorbets, sherberts, beverages...and the list goes on.Simple, concise, fun to read, and the recipes themselves taste phenomenial! Highly recommended!Gluten-free note: as I am vegetarian and my kids are gluten free I found this cookbook appealing on many levels. For me, I can follow the recipes directly, for the kids I can substitute bread and pasta for the gluten free type and make a similar dinner so the kids don't feel left out. And they love the food!"},{"Title":"Cook 1.0: A Fresh Approach to the Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"I absolutely love this cookbook for its functional, well-designed layout and its variety of recipes, ranging from simple to sophisticated. Each recipe is presented in a grid format, broken down into simple steps, making for a nice and clean organization. The minimalist, uncluttered design makes it easy and fun to read. Basic instructions make each recipe attainable. The quality of the book is very solid, with thick pages.The actual recipes are great too, organized into sections such as \\"rice bowls\\" and \\"one-dish pot pies\\" and \\"roasted vegetables\\". Each recipe incorporates Heidi's emphasis on healthy, fresh cooking that takes advantage of seasonal greens and great cheeses and herbs. I refer on a regular basis to her basic recipes such as pesto and bright red tomato sauce. I haven't tried any of the fruit juice spritzers yet, but they look delicious.I highly recommend this cookbook for anyone who loves to cook, regardless of whether you're a vegetarian or meat-eater!"},{"Title":"Cook 1.0: A Fresh Approach to the Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"I don't cook too often but have always been interested.

Many of them break outside the typically bland and boring vegetarian recipes we've tried from other sources. The recipes in this book helped us add a nice variety of dinners and lunches to our diets. They are simple and most of them contain few ingredients, which makes for less grocery shopping. My biggest complaint, however, would be that there is absolutely no indication of portion/serving sizes of the recipes. I guess you should get a pretty good idea based on the amount of ingredients you use, but sometimes it can be difficult to judge. Many of the recipes make HUGE amounts, enough to feed several people. Only cooking for two, we tend to get tons of leftovers from most recipes in this book. At least it's tasty leftovers, though!"},{"Title":"Cook 1.0: A Fresh Approach to the Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"This cookbook is my current favorite. It's like music; in each section, the author creates a theme and variations upon it. There is a core recipe with at least four different versions that taste completely different. In doing this, it manages to give you great ideas for what ingredients you can swap to make something new without having to learn a new skill set for each recipe. I have made the parmesan & basil drop biscuits, broken lasagna with cherry tomatoes, salsa verde and two smoothie recipes, and each has been easy to make with simple 3-step instructions and delicious every time. This book hasn't left my kitchen counter since I got it last week! I plan to make just about everything in here.The best part is that I'm not a vegetarian and there's not a single recipe in here that turns me off. The author isn't pretentious about being vegetarian the way many vegetarian cookbooks are (you know what I mean, \\"2 organic tomatoes, free range eggs, etc\\"). It just happens to be food without meat or meat-replacements, which is great because I am not a fan of tofu either."},{"Title":"Cook 1.0: A Fresh Approach to the Vegetarian Kitchen","review":"I know she does in fact have one other book that I also own. This book is great for basics - you're encouraged to be creative.

You'll find great biscut recipies, pot pies, etc., and dialogue for each recipe grouping.

Its very technical in detail yet it is reasonably understandable to anyone with average intelligence. Dr. Kervran tells how the life processes is maintained by the living organism's ability to create minerals that it needs from other elemental forms by altering their atomic structures. He mentions osteoporosis, among many other conditions, that develops because the body cannot assimilate calcium directly from foods and supplements which explains why persons with the disease are not helped by taking calcium supplements. He explains that manganese and organic silica will transmutate into an absorbable form of calcium that can reverse the disease. Many other life processes are explained as well. A very fine scientific work that is truly prize worthy."},{"Title":"Biological Transmutations","review":"Essentially, Kervran has postulated that biological organisms can transmute elements as needed, to some extent, and he proves it.

The potential implications are huge, but they have to be deduced, as they are not laid out in plain language.

However, it is fairly out of date and does not include more contemporary works which merit inclusion in such a compendium. Contemporary gurus such as Robert Kyosaki, Tony Robbins, Stephen Hawkings, John Grey, and Clint Arthur are not included due to their relative youth and modern messages. Highly advised would be going directly to the source, experiencing first hand the groundbreaking works &quot;Rich Dad, Poor Dad&quot; or &quot;Men are from Mars,&quot; or Clint's &quot;9 Free Secrets of New Sensual Power&quot; which are all life-changing and life-affirming books.

I laughed a lot at the dated profundity but the list was not quite as funny as Letterman's top 10."},{"Title":"The Greatest Minds and Ideas of All Time","review":"I appreciated the compilation of these essays, even though Will Durant has been dead for quite some time. A classic education and classical literature is still classic even when it is 25 years older.Durant's concise lists and helpful bibliographies were helpful (although open to much debate!). If you entitle anything \\"the Greatest...\\" there will be a fight.I disagree with Durant's foundation - the evolution of the goodness of men. Surprising! He would have had to remembered WW2.I found it amusing that he so easily dismisses David as the Psalmist because of his sinful life but does not even hint at the possibility that perhaps Shakespeare was written by a commoner like Shakespeare.I disagree with his refusal to include founders and renewers of religion in his greatest minds list. He claims that \\"it was not thought or reason, but feeling and noble passion, a mystic vision and an incorrigible faith that made them, from their little foot of earth, move the world.\\" It was exactly that faith which allowed them to see more clearly and think more deeply.His book list was interesting and I am planning on reading much from it. His evolutionary mindset comes out in the books he recommends.The \\"ten greatest Poets\\" was helpful because I am so pathetically inept in this category.The \\"Ten peaks of human history\\" was shallow. Taking a literal reading of Genesis places 1. Speech; 2. Fire; 3. Conquest of Animals; 4. Agriculture; 5. Social Organization; 6. Morality; 7. Tools all in the first few chapters (Adam spoke to God, Abel offered a sacrifice = probably with fire; Adam named the animals and Abel shepherded; Cain worked the ground; Adam and Eve were married and Cain built a city; Noah walked with God; Noah built a huge ark).I would like to reread his essay on the 12 vital dates in world history. Very insightful."},{"Title":"The Greatest Minds and Ideas of All Time","review":"Will Durant was an immensely learned thinker, and I've grown to greatly appreciate his work over the years. He does express his opinions with an enthusiastic flair which may throw readers expecting dry scholarly detachment, but I personally find his vigor to be a nice refreshing change. Moreover, he offers many deep insights to consider, and he does it with humility befitting a genuinely wise person.In this book, Durant specifically lists and describes what he considers the \\"greatest minds and ideas of all time,\\" and I think his choices are generally good. Of course, readers may disagree with some of his choices, but it's pointless to get hung up on that, since such lists are necessarily somewhat subjective. If you recognize that his choices are only meant to be \\"among\\" the greatest, you shouldn't have any problems.The only real criticism I can offer is that Durant perhaps makes the process of becoming educated sound easier than it really is. He spent decades climbing to his lofty height, and I've logged in plenty of hours myself. Describing greatest books, minds, historical events, etc. is certainly interesting, useful, and even inspiring, but such lists don't really enable much of a shortcut. Also, as a fairly minor point, I think his pre-1900 choices of greatest books are good, but his 20th-century choices warrant updating, especially with regard to the sciences.Overall, I highly recommend this book to anyone who seriously wrestles with the big questions and values growth of human understanding. People who are themselves relatively well read will particularly enjoy comparing notes with Durant. Also, this book works very well in audiobook format, so don't hesitate to give that a try."},{"Title":"The Greatest Minds and Ideas of All Time","review":"This collection of articles and writing from Durant is his opinion of the greatest thinkers, poets and books of all of humanity. Clearly an almost impossible task and one filled with biases. I won't go through the list and critique each selection, as that is up to the reader to decide, but I will point out some interesting facets of his thoughts on the matters.In thinkers he states that it \\"breaks his heart\\" to have to include St. Thomas Aquinas in the list.Durant unashamedly loves the French Renaissance and thinks of it as the height of human culture.In a possibly shocking narrative Durant dreams of having a library, which could be considered a shrine, which he lavishly details as a place of worship for himself and friends. He specifically calls the great philosophers, thinkers, and scientists \\"gods\\", and speaks of lighting candles to their images. Durant waxes wistfully for the lost faith of his youth, and replacing it with reverence and worship, towards great men. His critics are right to point out this sort of unapologetic hero worship taints scholarship.Those criticisms aside, this book is still worth reading for one man's learned opinion about what is great in humanity. To Durant's credit he does expose and admit his hero worship and biases in this book, and realizes his focus on Western culture and general dislike of religion, particularly Christianity, shapes his recommendations."},{"Title":"The Greatest Minds and Ideas of All Time","review":"This book needs to be updated to include modern greats, such as Einstein etc. Otherwise, an interesting and informative experience, although the poetry part was a bit dull."},{"Title":"The Greatest Minds and Ideas of All Time","review":"This was my first introduction to Will Durant and it did not dissapoint. It was a very quick and easy read as well as being both a great historical refresher and a great insight into the mind of this legendary figure. The book includes top ten lists of the greatest thinkers, poets, and peaks of human progress among others. Durant's commentary is very insightful and his selection methodology is well reasoned. This has inspired me to read more of his works and texts from his Top 100 Best Books for Education."},{"Title":"The Greatest Minds and Ideas of All Time","review":"Will Durant, who died in 1981, has been a guiding light in education since he published \\"The Story of Philosophy: The lives and opinions of the world's greatest philosophers from Plato to John Dewey\\" in 1926, and thereby introduced philosophy to America. He is a learned man with a charming, witty, easy to read and human style that is both endearing and inspirational.This book contains five articles previously published long ago in un-named magazines. Surprisingly (and unforgivably) John Little, founder and director of The Will Durant Foundation, who compiled and edited this delightful little book, does not bother to disclose the date and original place of publication. This is a great pity for many reasons. It is also not clear how much editing Mr. Little has done to the original essays. I have been able to track Durant's first essay to \\"The Rotarian\\" magazine of February 1955. That version is somewhat different from what appears in the book. It is ironic that such a scholar as Durant would be reproduced in such an unscholarly way.Durant's list of ten \\"greatest\\" thinkers is the least idiosyncratic, a list that most educated people will probably agree. He defines his criteria and then briefly introduces Confucius, Plato (who subsumes Socrates in a cute twofer), Aristotle, Aquinas (OK, OK, so the Western bias is clear already), Copernicus, Bacon, Newton, Voltaire (!), Kant, Darwin, He is generous in his description of other great thinkers who do not make his list and the reasons why. Buddha and Christ were teachers not thinkers, Spinoza's thinking was too esoteric to have influenced any but the most intellectual. Democritus, Epicurus, Marcus Aurelius, and others - even Mary Wollstonecraft and Susan Anthony, get a passing nod. Personally, I was disappointed that Heraclitus, Franklin, Jefferson and Einstein failed to merit even such \\"honorable mention\\".Durant admits that his list of ten \\"greatest\\" poets is quite personal. Fair enough; there are no objective criteria that would support another approach. His favorites: Homer, David, Euripides, Lucretius, Li Tai Po, Dante, Shakespeare, Keats, Shelly and Whitman. This section is nicely embellished with some of his favorite passages by these great writers. In his defense of nominating tragic Keats, Durant also produces a credible list of other great poets but strangely omits Cervantes. Elsewhere in the book poor Emerson is trashed for being \\"a trifle thin today\\". Ouch.Next are presented Durant's 100 \\"best\\" books for an education, in which he provocatively promises a first class education to anyone who will devote seven hours a week for four years to his proposed reading program. Wonderful, thrilling idea. His approach mixes original material with survey texts. While Herodotus, Solomon and Homer are timeless, old texts on science are not likely to be useful. The reader might benefit from his own efforts to find more modern publications to fill these parts in Durant's program. As bad, Durant's approach is shamelessly parochial. Asia and Africa are grouped together in one of his 12 sections. The Middle East (including Persia and the terrific contributions of Islam) seem ignored altogether. One could probably find a more recent outline to achieve the excellent goal that Durant proposes. Still, Durant's perspective that education is a lifelong process that begins when college finishes is wonderfully refreshing, especially today when college is seen as a stepping stone for career, like a trade school.Durant's ten \\"peaks\\" of human progress is also excellent and thought provoking. These include: speech, fire, animal domestication, agriculture, social order, morality, tools, science, education and writing/printing. A critic could nit-pick that agriculture, horticulture and tool development are part of science or that social order and morality are overlapping. A more legitimate comment would be that his list mixes actual peak events (discovery of fire, urbanization, even plant and animal domestication) with processes that span the full timeframe of humanity (tool development, education, science). Still, the list is, as intended, thought provoking and useful.The final chapter presents 12 vital dates in world history, and is intellectually the most muddled part of the book, as it mixes up personalities and dates. Many of the dates are placeholders for Great Teachers, Buddha, Confucius, Socrates, Christ, Mohammed, even Sir Francis Bacon and might have been more usefully approached in a different way. Certainly the first three of these (and others such as Moses, Zoroaster, Patanjali and indeed the development of the Vedas) might have better been combined as one date in a thoughtful essay on the Axial Age. Only the invention of the Egyptian calendar in 4241 BC, the printing press in 1554, steam in 1769, and the discovery of the New World in 1492 seem to fit the topic well. Oddly, Durant adds the failed French Revolution to this list, but ignores the successful American Revolution. Hammurabi is ignored, as is Marathon. Personally, it seems that the Magna Carta and the Bill or Rights deserve some mention too.This book makes for easy reading and would make a delightful gift to any student or educated person. It also provides an excellent template for discussion, in which you and your friends each prepare your own lists first, compare them with each other and with Durant's. The light style and breezy manner of this work contrasts dramatically from the book that made him famous, \\"The Story of Philosophy\\", which is dense, profound and very slow reading. Greatest Minds and Ideas will be enjoyed by all educated people. By contrast \\"The Story of Philosophy\\" is suited to dedicated philosophers looking for a good sample of some of the deepest thinkers of our culture."},{"Title":"The Greatest Minds and Ideas of All Time","review":"Durant is one of the most respected historians, and this modest-sized book is a gem. One can read the chapters in any sequence he wishes to gain nuggets of info on favorite historical characters or ideas. Or you can go to the back of the book and embark on the reading journey outlined by Durant to gain a true education (estimated reading time is seven years.) This book is such a treasure I was prompted to donate a copy to each of the young people from a local prep school who participated in a Brain Game. The team was impressive in their accomplishments and plans for higher education. No matter what your current level of formal education, this book will be a treasured addition to your library and a valuable gift to youngsters."},{"Title":"The Greatest Minds and Ideas of All Time","review":"Will Durant and his wife Ariel devoted over 50 years to the study of history and philosophy; creating 11 sage volumes of \\"The Story of Civilization.\\"His dedication and hard work ultimately earned him a Pulitzer Prize in literature, followed by the highest award granted by the United States government to civilians, the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Ford in 1977.Durant endeavored to make history more than just dates committed to memory and to bring our human heritage richly alive in the men and women who've walked before us and influenced our lives.Often called THE GENTLE PHILOSOPHER, his words are laced with warmth and humor as he brings these great thinkers to life!His lists include the best books for an education, the ten greatest thinkers, the ten greatest poets, twelve vital dates in human history, and the ten peaks of human progress.I have listened to this in the car and have learned that I have many books and authors with which I have yet to acquaint myself!It's read with wit, warmth, and wisdom.Highly recommended!\\"The most interesting thing in the world is another human being who wonders, suffers and raises the questions that have bothered him to the last day of his life, knowing he will never get the answers.\\"Will Durant"},{"Title":"The Greatest Minds and Ideas of All Time","review":"I've been working my way through The Story of Civilization, and loving it.

But it is full of &quot;insights&quot; that are obvious (Plato was one of the greatest philosophers), and odd (Whistler's paintings are faddish), with lots of fluff in between (long paragraphs about why people might object to Aquinas being called one of the world's greatest philosophers, with very little time left to explain what Aquinas' contribution was).Skip it unless someone gives you a copy for free."},{"Title":"The Greatest Minds and Ideas of All Time","review":"This title is misleading.

It is a series of papers written by a man of the people for the people, and the passion that Durant has for the material (and the love of knowledge) shines through.This book is a wonderful and concise lesson in history, arts, and sciences, and will help start any one's pursuit of knowledge and wisdom."},{"Title":"The Greatest Minds and Ideas of All Time","review":"I just read this book and it is a quick, easy, read. I think this book is an excellent way to develop perspective, either as a high school or college student, or for someone older who wants to more rigorously develop his or her world-view. The model of this book is a \\"classical education\\", along the lines of the recently re-released Harvard 5-foot bookshelf. Most of the people critical of this publication completely missed the point. Many times in the essays Will Durant specifically says that these are merely his opinions, and there are many other educated people out there with different opinions. These essays are intended as a STARTING place to educate yourself and he specifically suggests that you should read further and along your specific lines of interest. (The author also suggests on page 65 that as a college graduate, you might be ready to BEGIN your education with his suggested reading.) Anyone who complains that such-and-such was \\"rated\\" ahead of someone else [that they like], or that someone they revere was left off the \\"top 10\\" (because most likely they were not left out of the book completely, the author drops a lot of names of people who should be highly considered) just completely didn't understand this book.However, there is one huge problem with this book. I didn't realize it when I started the book (I am not really aware of who Will Durant was) but even though the publication date is 2002, nothing in this book is recent. Actually, Mr. Durant died 25 years ago and I suspect that most or all these essays were written long before then. Unfortunately Mr. Little, the compiler, does not tell us when these essays were written. This becomes painfully obvious when you get to the list of suggested reading. To start off there are a lot of general overview books on history, science (physics, chemistry, astronomy, biology, etc.), art, music, psychology and health. I looked most of these books up on Amazon and all the ones I saw were close to 75 years old (some had been re-released). I find it completely shocking that a publisher would print such an out-of-date book under the guise of a new publication. I mean, A LOT HAS CHANGED IN 75 YEARS, especially in the sciences.I know that in the last few years specifically there have been some very highly regarded books on the history of Art and on World War I (a glowing but out-of-date suggestion was specifically mentioned on page 80) and Karen Armstrong published several good books on the western religions. One of his suggested readings, \\"Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\\" by Gibbon; might still be relevant even though it is quite old, but I am very suspicious of the rest of the suggested overview readings. There are quite a number of translated works, and for most of them I am sure there are more recent translations. Sometimes he suggests a specific translation, it would be up to you to decide if a more recent translation would be better. That said, presented is an excellent system for \\"Since we wish to have orderly minds, and avoid the chaos of desultory reading, we shall want to begin at the beginning...we want it in such an order that the knowledge we win may fall into logical sequence in our memories, and give us at last that full perspective which is the source and summit of understanding.\\"Additionally, almost exclusively this books focuses on pre-20th century. I think this is completely understandable and acceptable, but if you are only interested in the 20th century then this book is not for you. I took two stars off for these out-of-date suggestions, no reference to the acutal dates the essays were written and no revised (alternative) suggested reading list. Now it is up to you, the reader, to substitute the suggested readings for modern, up-to-date, versions and start reading."},{"Title":"The Greatest Minds and Ideas of All Time","review":"It's said that good things come in small packages. Sometimes great things do, too. This book may be only 118 pages long, but between these covers you will find reasoned and inspired discussion of some of the people and works who have truly ennobled mankind.Will Durant, in partnership with his wife Ariel, spent his lifetime celebrating our highest and best achievements as a people. His essays on the greatest thinkers, greatest poets, best books, peaks of human progress and vital dates in world history should not only serve as a compact education, it should also fill you with a sense that for all of humanity's folly and waste, we have actually accomplished much that is worthwhile these past few thousand years. It's also very likely this book will spark within you a desire to know and to learn more about our rich heritage.My only wish for this book is that compiler John Little had included the dates these works were originally written. The chapter on the best books for an education, for example, while including many timeless classics, also includes some volumes which have been surpassed by later works--including the Durant's own magisterial lifework, the \\"Story of Civilization.\\" But this a minor quibble over what is on the whole an exceptional work.--William C.

Unfortunately, this is a pathological symptom of democracy, where mediocrity must be exalted at all costs, to maintain the notion of equality. Men and women must be viewed as equal under the eyes of the law and society, for this is justice. But we are not equal in health, wealth, intelligence and talent. What Will Durant has shown us unashamedly is \\"...that at the beginning and summit of every age some heroic genius stands, the voice and index of his time...the guide and pioneer into the future.\\" (10)This necessary little book presents six essays on the greatest thoughts, minds and books of all time. The reader may disagree occasiionally with his choices, though Durant compellingly argues his choices from his informed view as a recognized historian, philosopher and teacher.The text is a snap shot of history; an opportunity to see the past and its great historical figures through the eyes of a man who made it his life mission to celebrate what it means to be human. Durant's humanism and enthusiasm is highly infectious - one comes away from his texts with a renewed hope that civilization was once great and can be great again. We have been submerged into the pessimistic, fragmented and distilled perspectives of Modernism far too long. Durant's optimism slices like Excaliber through our fashionable cynicism about the world; he is the intellectual white knight, celebrating the miracle of existence and the endless potential of humanity.At the moment the world is filled with uncertainty and pessimism, therefore this text is highly recommended, for it might cast a glimmer of hope, and a renewed optimism about the world, the future and us."},{"Title":"The Greatest Minds and Ideas of All Time","review":"Like many many readers I have long been a fan of Will Durant. As a child I remember being excited, moved, uplifted by his 'Story of the Great Philosophers'. In my mind to this day is his remark about Spinoza, \\" The only great philosopher who lived as he wrote.\\"But this small work, divided into six sections \\"A Shameless Worship of Heroes\\" \\"The Ten Greatest Thinkers\\" \\"The Ten Greatest Poets\\", \\"The One hundred best books for Education\\" \\"The Ten Peaks of Human Progress \\"TwelveVitalDatesin World History\\" disappoints. It does not really go movingly into the stories and thought of any of the great people selected. It does not develop their ideas in an illuminating way.I do question a large number of the selections. Keats Shelley Whitman are included but Wordsworth Coleridge Chaucer Hopkins Wallace Stevens Emily Dickinson(just to mention nineteenth and twentieth century poets) are not. The lists that is at a certain point ( Not at all points. No one would quarrel with Shakespeare) not very convincing.But all said and done I would still recommend this book, and above all other books of Will Durant. Durant's great love of learning, respect for the life of the mind, enthusiasm for the life of creation teach Values our world sorely needs."},{"Title":"The Greatest Minds and Ideas of All Time","review":"I confess to be a huge fan of Will and Ariel Durant's work and confess to being fastinated with \\"lists.\\" That being said, it is obvious that I liked this work. It is short and pretty much to the point. The author clearly states that these are his selections and states \\"I let the reader, then, to make his own lists, helping himself to what he likes in mine. Let him try to build for himself another perspective and unity that shall clarify human development for him.\\" I note that much of the negative comments, here in these reviews, centered on the fact that the particular reviewer did not agree with all of Dr. Durant's choices. These reviewers need to read the last paragraph in the book. Anyway, I, like most, did not agree with all the choices, but I suspect that if you picked 1,000 individuals and invited them to create their own list of the categories Durant chose, we would have before us 1,000 different lists. Durant's writing is as always, wonderful, has a almost musical quality and is quite spellbinding. This is the type of work which should lead the reader to continue exploring history, art, poetry and philosophy on his or her own. It is a work that should stimulate further reading and study. As one reviewer pointed out, they were disappointed that the author did not delve deeper into his subjects and subject matter. Hey folks, this is a short work of short essays. If you want more delving, then do like the rest of us....go to the library or book store and go for it! I highly recommend this one!"},{"Title":"The Greatest Minds and Ideas of All Time","review":"After having read Durant's \`The story of Philosophy' I was hooked. This author had made the main ideas that had troubled philosophers accessible to the non-Philosopher; to the average Joe that wanted to know what Philosophy was all about. So when I found out he had written a book about \\"The greatest minds and ideas of all times\\" I knew I had to get it.This book is really short, so you know straight away that he wont be going into too much detail and that the book will have to be really selective about who it discusses. It was unfortunate, to me at least, that Durant had to spend so many pages justifying his selection and thus making the actual discussion of the people and ideas much shorter. Some people received only 2 pages which was a disappointment. It would have been better had Durant instead of justifying himself, written more about those people and ideas which would have justified themselves to the reader.As he admits readily, many of the greatest poets are his favorites, so I think it would be fair to say that his choice of greatest peoples and ideas are not as objective as one might like them to be, but can such a \`top 10' or 'top 12' list ever be wholly objective?That said, I would still recommend this book to those wanting to know what Durant thought was important to human civilization over its thousands of years of history.The selection of book Durant gives is quite good, although personally I prefer Mortimer Adler's, which you can get from the Internet or his book \\"How to read a book: - Appendix A\\"."},{"Title":"The Greatest Minds and Ideas of All Time","review":"As the Durant himself acknowledges, all lists have their limitations. This is no exception; it isn't perfect and never claims to be. That said, it's an excellent starting point for anyone looking to educate themselves on the history of philosophy and culture. It has an unquestionable bent on western authors, but within that bent, he made his choices based on solid reasoning.Bottom line: you will have begun to give yourself an invaluable education if you read any of the books or authors that Durant suggests. Therefore, this slim volume is worth more than whatever you're about to pay for it."},{"Title":"The Greatest Minds and Ideas of All Time","review":"Some will obviously quibble over Will Durant's selections, but I will not. I got hooked on Durant after reading his 1916 doctoral disseration (a full thirty years after I acquired the multi-volume History of Civilization), and have been working my way through various \\"short books\\" in the past six months.Here are my fly-leaf notes.Slams H. G. Wells early on. Durant seems to be the anti-thesis to Marx.He opens by pointing out that the greatest minds of history were those of philosphy and science, not captains of war, priests, or artists.As is my tendency, I praise the book by summarizing it.

Definately not for the layperson in terms of analysis but an interesting read for new scholars and specialists alike."},{"Title":"The Homeric Hymn to Demeter: Translation, Commentary, and Interpretative Essays","review":"First, a word must be said about the translation of the hymn itself. It is readable, accessible, even captivating, and is presented in facing page format so advanced students can read the original Greek for themselves. Excellent.This book is far more than the translation of the hymn, however. It includes commentary by Foley and others with the intent that this be used as a centerpiece for women's studies regarding the ancient world. Because my interest was largely the hymn as such, I have not deducted any points for the criticisms I am offering on this part.I found the commentary to be less impressive than the translation per se. There were useful points, but more often they involved discussions of word plays which really should have been framed in terms of poetics rather than simple plays on words, and I found myself asking several times why given works were included in the third section. In particular Chodorow's essay \\"Family Structure and Feminine Personality\\" seemed to have little relevance to the hymn itself. I could only conclude that the goal was to present a larger work of women's studies rather than an essay primarily focusing on this particularly important work.The quality and clarity of translation of the hymn itself, however, makes up for these shortcomings and more. I'd still highly recommend the work."},{"Title":"Speaking of Liberty","review":"Ludwig von Mises and Murray Rothbard were not only great theoretical economists, but also excellent popularizers. In particular, von Mises hasn't received the credit he deserves for his outstanding popular presentations of the case for individual freedom. Their work is continued today by Llewellyn Rockwell, the founder of the Ludwig von Mises Institute.The Institute has published this collection of Rockwell's speeches in which Rockwell brilliantly makes the case for free enterprise and individual freedom. Rockwell has a knack for taking an insight of Mises's or Rothbard's and applying it to current events. For example, why is the Federal Reserve only criticized when it raises interest rates? If politicians were truly concerned about the economy, they would worry about the Fed lowering interest rates and creating artificial booms. There is a particularly powerful chapter concerning the negative effects of &quot;civil rights&quot; (anti-discrimination) laws and how such laws impede individual freedom and probably don't do much to help their intended beneficiaries (although they always increase the power of the state). Rockwell is prescient as well. He pointed out in the 90s that the &quot;new era&quot; boom couldn't continue, and when I was reading his 1998 article on Iraq I almost forgot that he was writing about Clinton and not George W. Bush. One of the best chapters concerns the presidency. Rockwell shows that both the left and the neocon &quot;right&quot; embrace the imperial presidency with almost equal enthusiasm.SPEAKING OF LIBERTY also contains two interviews with Rockwell. He explains the rise of the modern libertarian movement and its relationship to conservatism (although I don't think he is completely fair to Russell Kirk). The bibliography, which contains a list of recommended books on liberty (not a few of which I've reviewed), is also excellent."},{"Title":"Speaking of Liberty","review":"Too many good people get tired of what's happening and they run full-force to the Republican party.

Lew Rockwell understands liberty.This is not a book you should buy yourself... no, this is a book you should buy yourself AND your neighbors AND your relatives AND and every congressman who lies to you at every election. If &quot;Speaking of Liberty&quot; sounds like some policy-wonk book, you have been jaded by all the other policy-wonk books out there (and there are far too many).

Rockwell was my introduction to classical liberal or libertarian philosophy. I have to agree this is the book to pass along to friends or family who have yet to discover the beauty and importance of economic and human liberty."},{"Title":"Speaking of Liberty","review":"This book deserves a wide audience. It is lucidly written and cogently communicates a political and economic message which contains the solution to so many of today's problems.Lew Rockwell understands that true conservatism embraces the civilizing influences of the family, the market and the church, but rejects, as treacherous and corrosive, the phony patriotism and warmongering of so-called conservatives in politics and the media. Indeed one of the most important passages in the book reads, \\"Big government abroad is incompatible with small government at home. To the extent we cheer war, we are cheering domestic socialism and our own eventual destruction as a civilization.\\"The author points out that the answer doesn't lie in electing the correct candidate to office, but rather it lies in de-sanctifying the office itself. He also makes the important point that libertarianism and cultural conservatism are symbiotic, not antagonistic. On economic matters, Mr Rockwell explains that it is a gold standard, not Greenspan, that free-marketeers should cherish.The author refers many times to the courage of Ludwig von Mises, who held uncompromisingly to laissez faire at a time when the world was turning towards collectivism, and Murray Rothbard, who faced the opposition of \\"beltway\\" libertarians and conservatives. The steadfastness which these two men demonstrated should be an inspiration to all friends of liberty.Theirs may have been a lonely path, but it is certainly the brightest path; the path that holds the greatest promise."},{"Title":"Speaking of Liberty","review":"*** UpdateI guess I am out of kilter here as my review is a book review of a book I have actually read. I suppose it is fashionable to use the review section to offer commentary about something the writer is admittedly ignorant of. I find that is also true that some anonymous \\"readers\\" also like to use this space to review other reviewers from the same position of ignorance.I'm not sure what about my review led said anonymous \\"reader\\" to make assumptions and this reader would probably be surprised to learn that this reviewer happens to have combat experience and is not likely to rejoice is the death or injury of anyone much less one of my grandchildren.In fact those soldiers are not statists, just brave young people who volunteered to defend this country as I did, and were duped as I was. I cry for every one who doesn't come home. I have to, I have know way too many of them.In fact this reviewer was pubic educated but at a time before the schools engaged in wholesale brainwashing. These were more innocent times I suppose.I guess I have little patience with REMF's and chickenhawks willing to send others to die for politics yet not willing to do the same themselves. This assesement includes the current comander in chief ( who hid out in Texas - safely far away from the Ho Chi Minh trail ), the defense secretary and assorted flunkies, the vice commander and just about everyone else in the adminstration.I stand by my opinion that anyone who thinks this book and Lew Rockwell are in any way anti American and that one who thinks so is either ignorant from the non-exposure to real history versus PC nonsense or has drank the Kool Aid.Again, this book celebrates the REAL America. It is sad commentary that too few people recognize it.Anyone who says that this book \\"rejoices in Amercias defeat\\" or that it anti-American either has not read the book or is so hopelessly infected with statism that he or she is incapable of any independant thought.Possibly they are all the poor unfortunate victims of government education so we can't be too hard on them - it's not their fault.This the most pro-American book I have ever read. It rejoices in America's virtues and what this country is supposed to stand for.Freedom and liberty were the principles this nation was founded on. This book tells us of the REAL America and the REAL America is just not about more efficiently bombing the wogs halfway around the world. No intelligent patriot one could look at what the Bushies atre doing to Iraq and say that is what America is all about.This book is about real patriotism not the phony flag-waving and oppression of the Bush Administration or more correctly the Cheney-Rove-Rumsfeld adminstration of which dear old shrub is the point man on strings.I would recommend this book for anyone. If you read it with an open mind you will be enlightened. Enlightened not brainwashed.Far from rejoicing ion Americas defeat, this book celebrates America. My America. The one I want back."},{"Title":"Speaking of Liberty","review":"Speaking of Liberty is a fascinating look at at an emerging philosophical/political framework, of which Llewellyn Rockwell is this generation's standard-bearer. Through discussions on economics and war, he illustrates a view of the world that is both appreciative of traditional values and unabashedly radical.Those unfamiliar with the libertarian intellectual movement may be delighted to discover this alternative to the American left-wing/right-wing paradigm. Rockwell's ideas can be as appealing to liberal college students as they can be to conservative Christians.Those already familiar with Rockwell will be happy to see him in top form, as he exposes and condemns the Warfare/Welfare State, recounts the development of libertarianism via Ludwig von Mises and Murray Rothbard, and describes the current state of the movement.Unlike the gurus of the left and right (Ann Coulter, Bill O'Reilly, Michael Moore etc.), Rockwell's ideas are supported by powerful economic and historical arguments, rather than impassioned fear-mongering about the &quot;other side&quot; trying to &quot;subvert America&quot;. He makes it clear that the danger is not other people, but the harmful policies of the central State.Lew's writing style is thoroughly enjoyable. He is always controversial, never disrespectful. He can simultaneously shake up and attack certain political preconceptions, and inspire a new-found respect for others. If you're curious about libertarianism, Austrian economics, or just alternative political thought, this is a great place to start."},{"Title":"Speaking of Liberty","review":"What comes through above all else in the speeches collected in this book is that Lew Rockwell has a deep love for the unfettered free market because he understands its unique ability to foster human well being.The speeches address a wide range of events from recent history, from the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act under the first President Bush, to September 11, to the second President Bush's unprecedented expansion of government and the warfare state, among many others.More importantly, the speeches provide applications of the eternal moral and economic principles of the freedom philosophy, and they discuss the essential contributions that Ludwig von Mises and Murray N. Rothbard made to our understanding of these principles. For these reasons, the book will remain useful to students of liberty long after some of the specific events have faded from memory.So many public speakers have just a few basic speeches that they give, with little or no variation. Each item in this 471 page book, however, is distinct. While there certainly are consistent themes throughout, there is no redundancy.Lew Rockwell plainly states the truth as few others in the libertarian movement have the guts to do and with clarity of presentation that few others have the talent to match.I highly recommend _Speaking of Liberty_ to anyone who cares about the future of freedom."},{"Title":"Speaking of Liberty","review":"These days its easy for a lover of liberty to be frustrated.

After reading this book, one has to really wonder why. There is nothing in this book that wouldn't bring a rousing round of applause from our founding fathers if Mr. Rockwell had been there to deliver these fine speeches to the likes of Washington and Jefferson. There's not one crumb of evidence in this book that points to anything but Lew Rockwell and the Libertarian movement being anything but a true patriotic and pure American school of political thought.This former card-carrying Republican hangs his head in shame at what has happened to the party of Jefferson today; and, in turn, how that party has greatly helped in wrecking this once great land.Thank God that there are still those few left who understand what America is supposed to stand for and will, regardless of how unpopular the ideas may seem to the befuddled masses, will stand up and fight for them. Lew Rockwell is one of those people.I bought four of these books for Christmas and gave them to my university educated relatives. These are thoughtful, intelligent, professional people. I'm sure they'll be sorely missed by the Republican party as after reading Speaking of Liberty, they now understand why I am proud to say that I am, indeed, an ex-Republican.

His points about the Gold Standard, Business Cycles, and - what I see as extreme - Capitalism are debatable and I disagree with some of his findings.

As a returned veteran of Iraq I was offended by his call for America's defeat. Now the book is not a great seller, yet the the review has received almost two dozen negative votes. Something's suspicuos of course. Hmmm.In case you are curious, here's a sample quote from Lew's anti-American tirade:&quot;We mourn for the hundreds dead and thousands wounded, and grieve for their families. We can only rejoice as the administration concedes defeat and pulls out of this country, and rejoice even more if this serves to teach a lasting lesson. A defeat of Bush's war in Iraq is a victory for freedom and for American patriotism. After all, the essential American idea is that society functions best when people govern themselves in liberty, and that &quot;when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.&quot;Wow.Notice Mr. Rockwell's crocidile tears at the daily blood, sweat, tears and sometimes pain suffered by my comrades; soldiers, Marines, airmen and sailors still in Iraq. The final irony of course is that they fight to allow our citizens the freedom to express their opinions, even- as with Llewllyn Rockwell- when they pray for America's defeat.

It's chock full of scholarly articles on theories concerning these matters, as well as how genocide should be defined, and other such intellectual material. If you're more interested in learning the details of individual genocides: how they were carried out, in-depth histories and case studies, then this is book will provide nothing for you to sink your teeth into. The articles within it frequently reference statistics from actual genocides and compare various aspects of different genocidal regimes, but never make any attempt to go beneath the surface. You'll learn nothing new from this book about any genocide that you couldn't have learned from just doing a Google search. Even the articles that are about specific events, like the killings in Guatemala, are mostly just full of heady social theory with statistics and facts concerning Guatemala as a backdrop. They never go into the specifics of how the killings were carried out, or specific incidents, or anything that might breathe just a little bit of life and humanity into the stuffy academic monologue.

It tries to also examine how indigenous people have been subject to genocide, such as the Herrero in Southern Africa and how cultures that turned genocide had a history of such exclusion in their past, for instance in Japan.THis is interesting and the essays show many statistics. But in this one has to wonder how exactly the authors are judging what a genocide is. For instance the casualties in East Timor were high over the years but not in any one year and in Yugoslavia the number of victims in Albania was very small and the number of victims in the conflict was equal on both sides.This is always the problem books on genocide have: they don't know what to include. Why does this book call what has happaned in Ethiopia a genocide and compare it to Cambodia. In Cambodia, which was a genocide, there was not merely a genocide of minorities such as the Chinese, Vietnamese and Chams, but the majority of victims were actually Cambodian. Thus it is a very problematic subject and this doesn't provide a solution.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"The Specter of Genocide: Mass Murder in Historical Perspective","review":"It was a disaster.

I think it's geared more to professional educators, but anyone interested in the future of education should read the book. Basically, the author observes some things that seem to work in private schools--that justify the expense, that make them different. This is very helpful and informative, but then he goes on to suggest how they can be utilized in the public sector, for everyone. It's a shame more schools and parents don't read this book."},{"Title":"Lessons from Privilege: The American Prep School Tradition","review":"Arthur Powell has once again made an excellent contribution to the analysis of independent education. Deftly weaving the history of the &quot;prep&quot; school, he gives insight into the current attitudes and tremendous evolution of independent schools. Both the parent of future prep student as well as educators in the system benefit tremendously from this book. Powell does not paint an entirely rosy picture; he confronts issues of institutions unwilling to change, sometimes mediocre teaching, and the hairy issues surrounding the college application process. This insight is balanced by utterly devoted teachers and institutions, the benefits of the independent school environment (little to no violence, personal attention that public schools can often not afford, and teache rs and staff highly motivated to know students and expand their horizons). Powell nevertheless provides tremendous insight into the independent school system and paints a picture of hope for a system willing and able to change with people who wish to create the best environment for children."},{"Title":"Lessons from Privilege: The American Prep School Tradition","review":"The subject matter and content are good, but the writing style is a bit exhausting.

It is equal parts a love story, a personal memoir, and aching commentary on the fears Hrabal felt during the Communist regime as both a writer suppressed by the regime and fueled by it. Hrabal, a man of afterthoughts, writes his letters much as he does in his other works, in streams of consciousness. He moves from one topic to the next and then beautifully intertwines them. Though this book does not follow a traditional plot, it is traditional Hrabal, and moves the reader to see the extraordinary in history, love, and the conflict every one of us faces inside. I was truly moved by the book. While I do not consider it to be at the level of Too Loud A Solitude, perhaps Hrabal's most successful work, it is one of the warmest books I have read in quite some time. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Total Fears Letters to Dubenka","review":"With these letters to Dubenka(or, himself) Hrabal shows us his total self: the alcoholism, the past dreams and memories, the day to day facade, the total fear in seeing his sad visage in the mirror every day; poetic prose, rambling ?Yes, but of a man who can tell a story and wrap it all together, all the threads into one coherent, beautiful tapestry. One of the scariest and beautiful books ever written."},{"Title":"Total Fears Letters to Dubenka","review":"... and a Great Human Being! Only a great human being could be so honest about himself, so openly ashamed and humiliated by a life of fear, proudly apologetic for a life of carousing, honestly diffident about his worth as a writer! Honest enough also to acknowledge that even these apparently candid memoirs have been retouched to meet his literary self-image! This book -- Total Fears: Letters to Dubenka -- is not rightfully a \\"whole\\". It's a small selection from three volumes published by Hrabal AFTER the Velvet Revolution, the displacement of Soviet Communism in Czechoslovakia: November Hurricane (1990), Subterranean Streams (1991), and The Rosenkavalier (1991). Those three books were in turn collected as Volume 13 - Letters to Dubenka - the the Czech edition of Harabal's complete writings. I now wait with bated breath for a full translation of that Volume, but meanwhile this 'sampler' is something rich and fine.\\"Dubenka\\" was Hrabal's nickname for April Gifford, a young American woman who came to Prague as a student of Slavic literature and who became Hrabal's \\"late life muse\\". Her identity is subsumed in this book into the epistolary essays Hrabal addressed to her by way of extending his memoirs past the three autobiographical 'novels' he'd already written -- In-House Weddings, Vita Nuova, & Vacant Lots -- assigning the role of narrator to his own wife, Pipsi, whose death Hrabal mourns poignantly again and again to 'Miss April'. Born in 1914, Hrabal would have been 24 in 1938, 34 in 1948, and 74 in 1988, around the time when he met April Gifford. If these years don't ring any bells in your mind, as markers on a road of life through the nastiest century in human history, then you will certainly struggle with Hrabal's allusions in this book.Hrabal did survive, one has to register, the nastiest century in history, and one of his major themes in this set of essays is his \\"survivor's guilt\\". In fact, as he reveals, there were people in his intellectual/literary milieu who criticized him for surviving - for 'cooperating' too subserviently and submitting too easily to censorship. Hrabal's sheepish apology for not getting himself silenced or gulag imprisoned is a masterpiece of human self-revelation. But he had already survived the round-up of his fellow radical university students in '38. And the German occupation of WW2. And the Communist takeover in '48, and all the years of semi-clandestine literary renown in Czechoslovakia, and the brief wonder of the Prague Spring with the utter despair accompanying the Russian tanks after so few months of exuberance, and then, when no longer even dreamed, and what a shock it must have been, the End of Communism! These letter/essays were all written after the 1989, when Hrabal had been dourly unproductive for some years. They are therefore a late flowering of the most fragrant and flagrant beauty.Death, old age, and suicide are also themes in this book, especially in the first essay, The Magic Flute, which was originally published separately. Hrabal had written about suicide before, of course. One might say that he'd survived that, also, i.e. his own suicidal impulses. Most Hrabal scholars do presume that his \\"fall from a fifth floor hospital window, while feeding pigeons\\" was the almost-inevitable realization of his lifelong expectancy of suicide.The funniest, most enjoyable pages of this sampler are Hrabl's accounts of his visits to \\"The Delighted States\\" for lectures arranged by April Gifford at universities including Stanford, where she was teaching, as well as to England on a reading tour, once his post-Communist world reputation had begun to burgeon. It's both touching and hilarious to see Hrabal, one of the greatest writers of the century, star-struck at sitting in the booth once occupied by Dylan Thomas at the White Horse Tavern -- I had precisely the same 'rush' myself, guzzling in that booth in 1963! -- and trotting around various streets of English and American cities in groupy-like imitation of Jack Kerouac, TS Eliot, Walt Whitman! Hrabal tosses off his candid and sometimes snarky evaluations of nearly every Czech and Russian writer of the century, in the course of recounting his own roisterous boozing sessions at home and abroad. Often Hrabal reminds me of the comic \\"wild and crazy guy\\" of American TV. He really was the loopy \\"palaverer\\" that he so skillfully portrayed in his novels. I would suggest reading a couple of his novels before these memoirs, by the way, beginning with \\"The Little Town Where Time Stood Still\\" and \\"I Served the King of England\\"."},{"Title":"Total Fears Letters to Dubenka","review":"i stumbeled over this book in spring this year and i m still reading it (10 months!) though its not a very thick book. i read it very slowly that i can enjoy it for another while. its a wondrous book, very real very poetic far from kitch. i barely use the word beautiful, but in that case i may. besides, the cover is great art. i warmly recommend it."},{"Title":"Total Fears Letters to Dubenka","review":"Both men loved cats and drank \\"too much.\\" Enough said?

It is easy for some, more than 75 years after its discovery to fault Carter for his handling of many of the objects from the tomb. Here you can read of some of the problems and his solutions first hand. Included are the photos Burton took during the clearance. Some of these are to be found nowhere else. The step by step emptying of the famous &quot;Painted chest&quot; is fascinating. You can actually see the condition of the objects deteriorate as the bottom of the box is reached."},{"Title":"The Discovery of the Tomb of Tutankhamen","review":"This book is not simply a description of the tomb or complicated archeological jargon, but was written to inform the curious while the tomb was being cleared. It still contains a sense of currency that captures a rare event in recovering the past. Starting with a biography of Lord Carnarvon who financed the expedition, then goes on to describe in subsequent chapters what they knew of King Tut at the time, and the background of the Valley of the Kings and a discussion on the theft of antiquities. Then about half way through begins the story of Carter's involvement. With a combination of the words and pictures it is possible to get a glimmer of what events were like for them. Even to his irksome view of people who interrupted the work by insisting upon a tour of the tomb, or his peevish rebuttal against those who consider an archeologists work akin to a day at the beach. Anyway, through it all it is an engaging book. Includes 105 photographs, however in black and white. It should be known that this account is not of the complete find and primarily concerns finds in the Antechamber, and not the Annex or Shrine. Still, the book is titled the &quot;Discovery&quot; so this should not come as a surprise."},{"Title":"The Discovery of the Tomb of Tutankhamen","review":"If you love Epyptology, you'll love this book.

What I found inside was a completely different man than what I had expected. His love for his work, his humility in the face of great celebrity, his reverence for the dead boy king are touching and uplifting. How fortunate is history that two men such as Howard Cater and Lord Carnarvon were entrusted with this amazing discovery and how generous of the Metropolitan Museum of Art to send a photographer of Harry Burton's abilities to record all of this for us.

Please read this book!!"},{"Title":"The Discovery of the Tomb of Tutankhamen","review":"This is a very interesting book. Who could do a better job then Carter at writing a book on King Tutankhamen.

History class. I was hooked and had to learn more. I've read that the first edition was actually two volumes but I haven't ever come across any copies yet."},{"Title":"The Discovery of the Tomb of Tutankhamen","review":"There are two things that make this book special: Mr. Carter's description of not only what he sees as he enters the tomb, but his emotions as well. The other special feature is that the book's pictures have been interjected within his story in close proximity to what Carter is describing at the time.Carter also makes it extremely easy to understand what he is describing by referencing specific plate numbers. This is useful when the reader is not familiar with the name of an item because it never existed in modern times.For a person who enjoys reading stories of true events, Mr. Carter has given us a gem of a book. My only wish is that Mr. Carter had available to him at the time the technology of color film. His descriptions of what he sees and the stiking colors he witnessed in the tomb leave one yearning for color prints."},{"Title":"The Discovery of the Tomb of Tutankhamen","review":"This review refers to the hardcover edition.Imagine what it would be like to peer into a small opening and seeing wonderful treasures that no one has seen for thousands of centries. This book gives you the first hand account of the most famous Egyptian archeological discovery of all time. The description of the treasures will send chills down your spine. Read about the evidence discovered that indicates ancient grave robbers were caught in the act of plundering Tut's tomb. The book gives an excellent account of opening the sarcophogus and examining Tut's mummy. I recommend this book to anyone interested in Egyptian archeology. The color plates in the book are beautiful."},{"Title":"The Discovery of the Tomb of Tutankhamen","review":"Nice walk through of what was done in the the greatest archaeological find of last century.I plan to read the next two volumes (of 1927 & 1933) as well. The tomb entrance was discovered Nov. 4, 1922. By mid-Feb. the Antechamber was cleared and the door to the Sepulchral Hall was penetrated. (Vols. 2 & 3 address the clearing of the Annexe, S.H., and store chamber.)"},{"Title":"The Discovery of the Tomb of Tutankhamen","review":"I remember in the 1960's reading the original books (2 volumes) that were published by Howard Carter not long after he had finished cataloguing the extraordinary finds from the tomb. Although all the photographs were in black and white they showed beautiful objects. Objects that increased my love of the Ancient Egyptians. It also aroused an interest in hieroglyphics.One can get a feel from the book, about what it must have been like to gaze into the confines of a space made by other human beings many centuries ago. To see objects and to wonder about the skill and patience of the people who had made them, sometimes with the most rudimentary equipment and yet we are unable to replicate them in this modern scientific world.Everything that was in the tomb was there for a purpose, either to assist Tutanhamun to get to the next world, or to be of use to him when he arrived there. It is impossible to envisage what it must have been like to discover the tomb. In fact it was only Carter's determination, some would say bloody mindedness that uncovered a tomb that many eminent Egyptologist's of his day said did not exist. His backer Lord Caernarvon had been ready to give up the franchise months before, but agreed to give Howard Carter one last try.There have been several documentaries in recent years that seem to go out of there way to discredit Howard Carter. Some allege that he had entered the tomb a long time before the official opening and had removed some of the wonderful objects for himself. It seems to me to be too easy to make accusations against someone who can no longer defend himself. Carter was a well respected Egyptologist and why he should do anything to jeopardise his reputation is beyond my belief.This book is a must for the avid enthusiast of all things Egyptian. Even for those with only a passing interest in the Egyptian Pharaoh's and Tutankhamun in particular, the book is still worth a place on the bookshelf."},{"Title":"The Discovery of the Tomb of Tutankhamen","review":"This book was really good.If you have researched on the pharoh Tutankhamen you already know the man who first discovered his tomb was Mr.Howard Carter.Since this book was published before Carter died some time ago you can understand how he himself wrote this book.this book is very informative Carter explains what happened from the begining of the discoverey to the end.this book even tells some of the untold curses of King Tutankhamens tomb.This was a great book I would recomend it to anyone who has ever wonderd what it is really like"},{"Title":"The Discovery of the Tomb of Tutankhamen","review":"I did now wish for this book at all. Even though it was written by the man who discovered the tomb, I don't believe it. There must be another Howard Carter out there who wrote the book. It seemed like a kindergarten schoolboy could write this book. The pictures (which aren't even good) take up most of the book because the author probably didn't know what to right. Take my advice and put this book back on the shelf where you got it. It doesn't even deserve a &quot;1&quot; rating, if there were negative ratings, then I would give it a -13. Horrible is the only word to describe it."},{"Title":"The Hardest 30 Days of Your Life","review":"This is especially for those just starting out in their walk with God.

This book is amazing and great for Christians of all \\"spiritual ages\\" to undertake.

Servanthood, the true value of material possessions, and real commitment are three of the topics that have stuck with me from this devotion. I'm about to undertake this devotion again, just because I feel I could get something different from it now than I could then. Highly recommend."},{"Title":"The Hardest 30 Days of Your Life","review":"I bought this book for my daughter so we could address some issues and give her a basis for growing in her faith. What I found as a \\"mature\\" Christian is how many of the things we learned at the beginning of our faith we have forgotten. It also reinforced how much influence media has in our lives and how non God honoring it can be. It allowed us to discuss things that might have gone unsaid and we both would have missed out. I recommend it to parents with teens as long as you are willing to make the commitment too - it is harder than you think!"},{"Title":"The Hardest 30 Days of Your Life","review":"I think this is an excellent book and would suggest it to many people. Unfortunately, i found it to be lacking in anything that would be help me becasue alot of it is challenging you to do things that many christians more mature in their walk of faith have already done. It would not apply to all teens, but it would apply to most teens. If it did apply to you, it would be a life-changing book I guarantee.Amy"},{"Title":"Marilyn Monroe","review":"Great book!

Both books were great, but this one talks alot about her beginning. I couldn't put it down. It was very interesting. Some of her books written about her say some demeaning things about her past, but this one seems very true to her life. I think because some of it was written when she was still alive and the author actually new her.I also would like to give you a compliment on Amazon.com customer service.

Because it was published before she died, it isn't colored by that knowledge. The author sees her as a real person, a highly skilled actress, and a movie star.He attributes her lateness to hostility that she couldn't express otherwise. He talks about her acting talent and her quest to be respected. He shows her narcissism, like that of other stars. He demonstrates that early in her career she wasn't satisfied to be perceived only as a blonde bombshell.It is circumspect in some ways, downplaying the drugs, mental illness and rages. Published in 1960, it was amended to include her divorce from Miller. Well worth reading."},{"Title":"Short Stories","review":"Oscar Wilde was a man before his time, and a genius that burned out too young. He died at the age of 44, but he has written some of the best literature that we are privileged to possess. \\"The Portrait of Dorian Gray\\" is one of my favourite stories, so I thought I should read his short stories too. Well, his genius is apparent in these stories too. Some of his stories seem to be social commentaries that he uses like sword to poke fun at what is sacred in his society, but they are truly funny as well. He explores all forms of love, hate, greed and goodness in these stories. My own particular favourite was \\"The Canterville Ghost\\". Wilde's interpretation of American savoir faire is hilariously funny. His fairy tales are truly beautiful, and each one has a special message to impart. I heartily recommend reading these stories. Wilde is unsurpassable."},{"Title":"Themes, Dreams, and Schemes Banquet Menu Ideas, Concepts, and Thematic Experiences","review":"This book is applicable to anyone with tons of cash to spare on a party hosted in 1954.

It was interesting to read about her life - but even more interesting was how well she described the asanas. I have a new approach to some of them (remembering her giggles at the cat and dog poses - and that some yoga is FUN), and will concentrate on moving into a pose with her words in my mind. I learned more about yoga from the book than expected, and it was a joy to read."},{"Title":"Finding My Balance: A Memoir","review":"In this touching, informative, truthful story about Mariel's own life is a compelling story I couldn't put down.

Well worth the price. Give it to friends as gift."},{"Title":"Finding My Balance: A Memoir","review":"I read this book because I was looking for more information about how Mariel Hemingway used diet and exercise to combat the same family health issue that I am dealing with. It provided me with the information I was looking for, and beyond that, the book was a very good read. I found it unique in the way that it was conceived and organized, and authentic in its message. Mariel delved into the past, often revealing painful and difficult memories in order to better understand what she would later combat. Childhood and young adult memories were quite sad, and her family members complex, but as she notes, childhood struggles sometimes give us the power to be stronger adults, as would be true in her case. This is a positive message, and the book is meant to be helpful. While one may read a yoga book and understand the physical and spiritual components of asanas, this book provides added insight into how the various poses can help a person heal psychologically, as well as spiritually. This is an engaging, honest, and intelligently written memoir."},{"Title":"Finding My Balance: A Memoir","review":"I admire mariel for writing her memoir. I couldn't wait to read it because I too come from a background very similar to hers, although I have never lived in the public eye.

Occult texts are full of warnings of what could happen with unguided practices. Usually, one had to seek a teacher who could guide one through the dangers of occult excercises. However, according to the author, our best teachers are our own inner guides. He shows how to contact ones inner guide through visualization and gives advice on all aspects of working with inner guides. This book is not about channeling, but the only book I ever found on hermetism. Hermetism is the practice of magick using imagination alone without the need of drawing circles on the ground to control spiritual forces that are summoned forth. The author provides an invaluable service to all students of spirituality by writing this book. He proves that students here in the west, have a rich tradition they can use without having to travel to the east in search of a guru. You can be your own teacher and this book shows how to do it."},{"Title":"Inner Guide Meditation","review":"I was first introduced to this book back in 1992. It changed my life. Having been raised Catholic, but being fortunate enough to have had exposure to the tenants of Buddhism, I was no stranger to the basic principles of prayer and meditation. The question was always what to do with this 'time alone with one self'. The Inner Guide Meditation was the answer I was looking for. It's a very powerful tool that, regardless of what your religious beliefs are, gives you access to the energies that make us who we are. If you read and follow the guidelines within, you will be able to ask questions of, and get answers from, the energies that drive our behavior, and you can resolve the tensions that naturally reside within all of us. It's a simple practice that once you get the hang of it will serve you very well.The author is, sadly, now deceased, and the center he founded no longer exist. The recommendation of having a chart done to help you identify your trouble spots is not essential to successful meditation. Once you begin your practice, simply meet each of the energies and take notes on what positive thing they need from you in your everyday life. Check back regularly with them and your Guide and make adjustments as necessary until a harmony is developed between you and that energy. It's a lot of fun, although difficult at times, but very rewarding. The positive changes in your life will astound you.If you approach this method with an open mind, and take the time to read the 1st 50 pages about 2 or three times, and actually try it, you will be pleasantly suprised at how much spiritual homework you'll be able to complete, and at the positive changes in your life. Please note that once you get into this, there will be times when it gets VERY difficult to get through a particular issue. It's as if you've been climbing a flight of stairs and with every step towards the next plateau, a 10 pound weight is added to your shoulders. Those last few steps can seem impossible to make. That weight is the resistance your ego presents to the challenge of change. Just stick to it. You will make it to that next plateau.There really is nothing else out there like it (although someone recently wrote a VERY similar book but calls it something else and makes no reference to this piece of work). The beauty of this method is that it really transcends religion and, regardless of whether or not you can relate to the imagery or spiritual references, is a great tool for inner work.Enjoy the book and good luck with your spritual growth."},{"Title":"Inner Guide Meditation","review":"This book provides a journey into the self that can truly provide the kind of self knowledge that can set you free. The author is an astrologer. I have had my chart done many times and I always came away depressed about aspects in my chart that seemed to doom my life to struggles that I could not win. The author has worked out ways to deal effectively with the things that are a challenge to the individual. I had a marvelous experience with one of the meditation exercises when only a few pages into the book. This solved a health problem that I had for some time. This book has techniques that work for a person such as myself who have been into metaphysics for years and years, or people that are relatively new to meditation. The people I gave the book to said that it was the first book that worked for them right away. This is not a book just to read, it has techniques than, when practiced, are life changing."},{"Title":"Inner Guide Meditation","review":"I would recommend this book to all who are not in a position to interact directly with meditating groups and teachers. Especially the first section of the book is loaded with many important technical details on how to meditate, which usually are available only by interactions with live teachers (as opposed to purely book knowledge). The only weakness of the text is that the second part of it (questions and answers) strives at addressing too many different topics at the cost of loosing the instructive qualities of the first part."},{"Title":"Inner Guide Meditation","review":"OK - I'll admit it - even though I wouldn't use everything from this book verbatim and for my own personal use and in my hypnotherapy practice I have adapted some of the techniques from this book - I still find the book a worthwhile reading.The following exerpt may give you an idea - a gist of this book:\\"The following is a lovely example of transforming outer experiences by working with inner archetypes. The process engages \\"active imagination\\" and its purpose is to transform one's negative unconscious projections.The example involves the assistance of an Inner Guide (you may as well just ask the unconscious/superconscious to bring up the appropriate image or just let it surface into your awareness).Say, for instance, that your neighbor is trying to poison your dog. Ask your Guide to take you to or bring you the image of that neighbor as you know him to be in the outer world. Then give that image permission to take its true form as it lives in you. Say that it turns into Dracula. The Dracula image is a picture of the energy in your that projects out from you onto your neighbor and gets him to try to poison your dog.Call on the Transformational Energies (these may be energies represented just as Light and Love, or angels, planetary forces, Tarot cards, etc.). If you are familiar with the Tarot cards, you can pick the images/energies of Sun, Fool and High Priestess.Ask them to send their love into the figure (Dracula) to heal and transform it so that it reaches its highest possible form in you at this time. After they do this, say that the Dracula figure has turned into a King. Dracula and the King are the same energy, the King being its higher, more conscious form.Ask the King what you have to do new in thought, action or behavior (having nothing to do with your neighbor), so that the energy the King represents in you will remain constant and not sink back into unconsciousness and its Dracula form.When you have received this information, give the King energy form permission to enter your body. Feel what part of your body this energy lives in and where it radiates from. If the transformation is successful and you have really changed this part of yourself, the neighbor will either change dramatically or go out of your life immediately. Because you have changed your role needs and no longer need a dog poisoner in your reality, the neighbor's choices are to change as a role player for you or leave your reality.Never work with images of known people from the outer world in the inner world. It tends to sustain rather than release negative unconscious projections. Always ask the image of the known outer world person that your Inner Guided brings you to take its true form AS IT LIVES AS AN ENERGY WITHIN YOU. This insures that you are, in fact, working on an aspect of yourself.You can go to images of everyone you know and ask each of these outer world figures to take its true form as it lives in you. Here you will get the images of what you are projecting on each of them. It's both fascinating and revealing to do this and to discover just what we are projecting on those people we love best or least.\\""},{"Title":"Inner Guide Meditation","review":"I have been talking with my own \\"inner guide\\" for about 8 years now. My guide has all of the \\"True Guide\\" qualities that the author describes. My first experience with my guide was very intense and it literally changed my life. This guide continued to be with me off in the corner of every single one of my meditations always there if I ever needed anything. My guide never offers any opinions and will never tell me what to do even if I ask directly. My guide is never judgemental and is the most peaceful being I've ever encountered.My problem with this book, although it has some really great ideas, was that it says that your true guide can not be female. Nor can it have wings or appear angel like. The author also says that a true guide will always appear to you if you are open. I have found these things to be untrue in my own experience. My guide has always had a feminine presence and she rarely shows herself to me. Enstead she is more like a guiding voice, an energy that I very clearly feel in the top right side of my meditations. The time that she showed herself to me 8 years ago (this wasn't the only time but it was the most vivid and intense) I told her that I wanted to see her and she asked me to turn my palms up. As soon as i did she came right up to me. She was floating, almost fluttering in front of me. She appeared to be made of bright, white, glowing energy. She had the shape of a human face but she wasn't human. She smiled and she kissed my face and held my hands and I started crying uncontrolably. For this book to say that your guide can not be anything but a man was rather offensive to me. Perhaps becasue I am a woman but also simply because my guide is female. My mother's guide is a male so I do know that females can have male guides but I met my inner guide before I even knew that OTHER people had guides too. For awhile I thought I was insane!Another problem I had with this book is that the author spent about one third of the book answering questions of people who wanted to know more about the Inner Guide Meditation. If you already have a guide and have been working with him/her then this whole section might be a little redundant. The author also gives alot of \\"have to's.\\" For example, if you don't do it this one way then it won't work. In my personal experience there are so many ways to communicate with your guide. If you're confused just ask your guide. I can't imagine one man's way of working with his guide being the ONLY right way."},{"Title":"Inner Guide Meditation","review":"I was taught the IG med 20 years ago by a mentor. I was a left-brain skeptic hypnotist then, and I had a terrible time with it. \\"It's just my imagination!\\" \\"Of course it's your imagination. That is the tool. It's a two-way function. Your subconscious uses it to talk back to you.\\" I made a commitment to doing it twice a day for 30 days to see if I could become capable of not feeling like it was a waste of my time. It took far less than that to get a clue to the power of it.If you do these altered state (theta brainwave dominance is where this sort of thing normally happens after all), that helps for most people. This can be so powerful, and the inner world so \\"autonomous,\\" it can kick your a**, make you bawl, change your entire perspective on something, and when done right and a few on different aspects of the same topic, can cause such radical changes in your \\"reality\\" it can freak you out. Eventually, the only hard thing is doing it, because your psychology figures out the power of it (change=death and all) and then \\"getting around to it\\" can be damn difficult.I began this without astrology or tarot, except for a few 'planets'. (Sun rocks, and if developed over time is like a local and decently talkative god, little-g.) I didn't take tarot or astrology seriously so although I was introduced to it, I avoided that. I learned to make anything(s) you can conceptualize into an archetype and work with that, instead. I think that was good, as I came to redefine whatever it is we're working with, as being infinite and essentially, an 'identity' as 'an arbitrary collection of consciousness assigned a title', totally creative and flexible. I've learned that the result of dividing the universe up into 78 or 12 or (...) pieces, in astro and tarot, is something incredibly powerful. I was biased against those models. I regret that it took me over 15 years to begin getting a clue about that. There are other systems (the table of elements, the body skeletal structure or organs, etc.) for those interested.I am on my 4th IG, the first female. I find it bizarre that Steinbrecher saw this gender pattern in IGs, which I didn't realize until after I had her. I thought my IGs were male until then because that's what I was comfortable with is all. She is also the first angelic, or perhaps I am just finally to the point of truly being able to perceive the 'holy'; my sense is this is a capacity which often has to be developed. I loved the 3rd IG so much it required inner intervention to get me to let go of him and quit crying about it. This IG is creative in ways that blow my mind. The complexity and depth of what often goes on is often the max my brain cells are capable of dealing with. It has required so much radical restructuring of how I think just to wrap my brain around stuff, let alone acquire mental fluency with attention/process in new ways. Much of this has ended up being profoundly shamanic in nature, or perhaps it is cabalic. I don't follow anybody else's systems, so I don't really know those (I have a saying that \\"the only tenets of truth I hold are based on personal experience\\") except the surface symbols, but much experience seems to correspond with those archetypes. In the end it's all cosmology (spirituality, psychology, physicality, etc. is just another perspective on cosmology, like wave/particle or ice/water or something) which I am still working to wrap my tiny little brain around.IG current gave me a glimpse through her of the true potential we had together, and I realized with incredulity that the process model, and a ton of related belief systems, was about 1% of 1% of what was possible. So I just have a regular date with IG to have her do with me whatever she thinks is best. This has left most of the ES IGM model behind now. That is a good model though, and a great place to start. But it is a doorway. Steinbrecher opened a door and described how to walk through it. There is a whole world to explore beyond that. Do it consistently and with an open mind and eventually, who's behind the door will take you forward from there.My teachers are inside me now, not outside. A good thing, since years of searching and blogging haven't found me anybody else really seriously doing this for the long term and recording it. Which is confusing, since it's pretty fascinating, so you'd think there'd be IG-Journey sorts of blogs all over. (See palyne.com click 'psiche' choose 'archetype meditation' category, for some of mine, probably best to go back in time a ways in that category to get past tarot to other stuff.) I long for decent community that shares experience like this, but so far it feels like a path I walk alone.I've enjoyed reading Jung and Steinbrecher (particularly Jung's Red Book) as they so clearly were on this important road long before. Although I disagreed with ES about Seth and Jane Roberts, and although thinking he was brilliant doesn't mean I think he had the final word on anything, still, this book is a total classic and is the benchmark of the genre. I wish I knew what 'else' ES thought or knew about this work, I'd have been so interested to hear what else or more he learned over time. I recommend that the introduction by Israel Regardie of all people give a clue to the nature of this kind of work--it is not merely fun, but has depths that can change your self and your world. This book is a good intro for anybody."},{"Title":"Inner Guide Meditation","review":"I think this book has very useful information for connecting to Holy Guardian Angel.and this is related with hypnosis. but anyway this book is not bad. Thanks very much.Have a good day."},{"Title":"James M. Cain (Twayne's United States authors series, 171)","review":"Madden, a leading scholar and novelist (The Suicide's Wife), with the help of Mecholsky, melds together two previously published critical works on the late novelist James M. Cain, whose seminal style helped define noir. Rife with comparisons to literary contemporaries Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett, this book deeply analyzes intricacies of individual plots as well as the formulaic approach Cain used in creating his realist storylines and ruthless characters. A study on form and technique demonstrates Cain's ability to balance existentialism with compact prose in crafting the \\"pure\\" novel. Camus was understandably a fan, while Cain's narrative technique has influenced cinema from European neo-noir to perhaps most notably the Coen Brothers. In revealing psychoanalytical aspects ingrained in the novels, their very nature is astutely addressed. Prevalence of the American Dream draws parallels with Nietzsche as power struggles permeate Cain's rhythmic prose. Where Madden and Mecholsky together explore sexual conflict, a decidedly Freudian contrast emerges. This successful collaboration has produced a fascinating new study of an arguably under-appreciated American author. ([...])Chapter Four totally blew me away! This book will put James Cain on the same household-word shelf as Conan Doyle. Mecholsky is one to watch...."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"When I first got the book, I was really hooked.

Its that good."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"I purchased the book because of it's title, but found it took me in a direction I didn't expect.

Hell yes!I enjoyed the book needless to say; but if you've read one \\"Fatal Attraction\\" type of story, you've read them all.

I think this story had lots of potential but it left me wanting more. It was not a difficult read but I found it to be too predictable. Crazy is as crazy does. I figured the ending before I got to it. I was a bit disappointed though. I expected more out of Julian Payne and at times he seemed a bit nave to be a player. This book will keep you turning the pages until the end."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"This the best book he ever written better than his others. I read in less than 2 days.

To me that's all that really matters. I agree with some of the other reviewers he should have had a better proofreader. Also, I think he could have done a better job with developing the chracters. I can't believe Julian was so simple when it came to Oliva, I mean come on after the first encounter you best believe I would have caught on much quicker as to what a crazy and deranged person Oliva truly was. Aside from this the book will keep you turning the pages."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"Michael Baisden wrote an exceptionally interesting story about, Fatal attraction to the full extreme.My question is, why doesn't a brother stop,think;think,stop and do not ever return to the scene!

Well, you can tell by the cover of the book how this is gonna play out.Typical book of this genre. Nothing special here. Dialogue heavy and a thin plot. Easy read, though. Would work on the beach, on a plane, or in a waiting room."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"I'm sorry but this was crap. Firstly, the main character Julian Wayne is SUPPOSED to be this intelligent man who's giving the lovelorn advice but he can't see what's obvious in his face with this psycho chick? He does EVERYTHING wrong when it comes to her and he deserves what he gets IMO.Secondly, this so-called love story between him and Terri wasn't believable in the least bit. He meets her and in two seconds, he decides she's the woman for him? And even throws a tantrum when she initially ignores his advances. It sounds to me like maybe HE has some stalker in him. And when they do finally get together, it never feels anymore than just a bootycall to me. I never felt like they were in a relationship.Thirdly, the relationship with his daughter annoyed me too. Let's see, her mom has been dead for two years and for the most part she has never seen her dad with another woman. And then when she finally does, it's at a very inopportune moment. Without going into too much detail, let's just say, not only does it embarrass his daughter but it disrespects the memory of his dead wife. And instead of choosing to deal with the problem and his daughter, he ignores her. When he DOES find the time to deal with his daughter, I feel he deals with it in an inappropriate way that completely lacks sensitivity. I feel that he punishes his daughter for HIS screwups.I could probably go on but I'll stop here. I feel like Michael Baisden has the writing style of someone in high school. I was quite dissapointed in reading this book. Don't waste your time or money."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"Baisden must've liked the radio personality/stalker Clint Eastwood movie so much that he re-wrote it almost scene for scene.

AND I can't believe he referred to another of his books (The Maintenance Man) in the storyline of this book over and over! I think Blaisden is a lot like Julian, both are just too much in love with themselves!"},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"This book was an excellent read, from the beginning to the end. It took me less than a 36hr time period to read this book. I was so hooked on this book that I took it to work, snuck it in, and almost got caught from making outbursts. Yes I said outbursts! This author will bring you into his world. At times, I could close my eyes and picture Crazy Olivia standing in front of me. Yes she was beautiful, but craziness outweighs any type of beauty.What I like the most about this book was the fact that I had the ending in my head, and Michael Baisden flipped the script on me. You won't figure out the end, until the end. And you will want more.Even though this is fiction, the book is so real that it made me start thinking about events in my life. Don't always judge people by looks, whether you plan on having a one-night stand or you're really interested. And if you don't believe this statement then purchase this book tomorrow. You will re-evaulate what you see as beauty. And I guarantee you won't be able to put it down."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"I was very disappointed. The book read as if the author was speaking---which apparently wasn't at much higher than a high school level.

Julian makes it big with the female audience with good old smooth talk and old school tunes to back him up. However one woman in particular (Olivia) can't get enough of him, and after a one-night-stand, she refused to let him go.After a promotion and move which was best for him and his daughter. Olivia packed up and did the same thing--she was determined to make him hers. Julian had other interest when it came to his perfect women however. And just like Olivia chased him, he chased behind the head strong Dr. Terri Ross. Not only was Dr. Ross smart, but to Julian very beautiful.Once Julian won over Ms. Ross heart, Olivia was just not having it! As a man, Julian made continuous mistakes. He should have been more cautious when dealing with the psychotic Oliva Brown, who was also smart and clever in plotting to have him irregardless to anyone getting in her way. Be it his best friend Eddie, or his daughter, or the beautiful Dr. Terri Ross, Somebody is going to die if she doesn't get the man she loved soon! But who?Michael Baisden's God's Gift to Women was a page-turner. I was very angry with Julian for his constant mistakes. That is just how men are...they tend to think below waist level. I thought the book was entertaining, and I could barely put it down. I read other reviews on this book, and their criticism about errors and grammar. That part I will not comment on. Because today, Editors have too much on their hands, and there are not to many books out there that I haven't read that didn't have a few flaws. It's the story and plot that I'm interested in, not where the Author went to school to get his ed-u-ma-cation. (And that is spelled how I intended it to be.)"},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"Very exciting story, well told. I won't be spoiling anything by telling you how the story begins. It begins with a great hook, and it will hook you.Michael Baisden's altar ego Julian Payne is a talk show host doing a show called Love Lust and Lies. Hmm, sounds familiar. Michael is a very popular talk show host right now in New York City, doing a show called Love Lust and Lies, very similar to Julian's. In fact I was surprised to learn that Michael started out as an author, not a talk show host. Michael IS Julian, except that I hope he was never shot by a stalker. Real person, made-up story. I hope.The book opens with Michael being shot by a female stalker named Olivia Brown. He's being rushed to a hospital, his life in the balance. He's conscious, on a stretcher, and he is asking the emergency medical people if his daughter and his girlfriend are all right. He's not getting any answers from them. Nor is he getting any reassurance from them that he will live.Well, we've all heard that the best way to begin a book is to start with something dramatic. It works here.We are then taken on a long flashback that lasts until the book is nearly over, since the opening scene isn't completed for us until the end of the book. The entire book is taking us through the events leading to the attack.These are some of the characters you will meet in this story. Julian's ten year old daughter Samantha (who is exposed to Olivia Brown as well), his girlfriend Terri (also at risk), his loyal co-worker Mitch, his best bud Eddie the womanizer, and of course the villain of the piece, pretty Olivia. She's pretty for sure, pretty crazy.This is a self published book. I like the new cover, Olivia seen from behind with a gun in her left hand. The book that I have is an older version with a different cover. I wonder if the new version was edited. The one I have really could have used some editing, for misspelled words, left-out words, secretarial stuff. It's not a question of urban language, it's a question of flat out mistakes in a lot of places. It doesn't detract from the story. Who really cares after all. But if I was doing a self published book I'd fix all that.I agree with one of the reviewers on this site who said that Michael is one hell of a self promoter, talking about his previous book The Maintenance Man several times in this book. I guess you don't get where Michael is by hiding your light under a lampshade. Hey world - here I am, pay attention! Check out my other book while you're at it!I like Michael Baisden. He does a good radio show. Too bad I can't listen to it at work anymore. I like the way he teases the women in the radio audience and builds up the men, when he has his War of the Sexes call-in quiz shows."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"This book takes that old clich&eacute; \\"...no fury like a woman scorned\\" literally!! The story starts out in Chicago then moves its characters to Houston, TX. The main character is a man named Julian Payne. He is described as a handsome man with a lot going for him. He's got a great job as a radio personality. Good friends. Julian's attempts at having a love life are complicated by his ten-year-old daughter, Samantha, who believes that no woman is good enough to take the place of her deceased mother. His luck improves as he is offered a job at a prominent radio station in Houston. Julian's character for the most part is made out to be a \\"good guy\\", but he definitely ain't no angel!All of his trouble begins when his friend's fianc&eacute; decides to play matchmaker with someone she met and thought would be perfect for Julian, Ms. Olivia Brown. They meet at his going away party and spend a passionate evening togehter. Julian knew he was about to move, so he let Olivia know he was not looking for a relationship at this point in his life. Unfortunately, Olivia had other plans. Guess the brother really put it on her because, from this point on...his life is made a living hell! Think Fatal Attraction meets Waiting to Exhale!Although the subject matter was pretty serious, the book was still a good read. The characters were well depicted. The dialog was a bit corny at times, but it didn't take away from my enjoying the story as a whole.Peace"},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"As far as the topic, it seemed very familiar however, that wasn't the problem. The problem was the ending and the child's reaction to the events taking place. I know we sometimes want a snappy ending, cool dialog after a climatic scene--TV does that to us, however, in this case the child's reaction was not realistic and hit me wrong. I won't remember much else about the book except the vision of a child speaking as if her heart was as cold as steal. Perhaps if this was Mr. Baisden's point, I'd be okay...I saw the BAD SEED, that child was evil to the BONE! However, I didn't think that was the point being made in this story, however, in the end, the child turns out to be no less a maniac than the femme-fatale."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"I was interested in the Fatal Attraction angle of this book, and found my interest held throughout. However, the ending, which I won't give away, really upset me!The person who wrote this book is NOT the same one who wrote Men Cry in the Dark! Will the REAL Michael Baisden please stand up???!!!!On a scale of 1 - 10, the lack of realism in this ending is a 25,007! THAT is what made me so angry!!I'll only say this much about the ending: after a child has been traumatized on so many levels as Julian's daughter, she would not have the presence of mind to say what she did as the villan got her comeuppence/met her fate.THAT is when I got mad and set the book down for a few days.Michael Baisden is often creative, choosing to foray off the beaten path of most authors who choose the \\"boy meets girl and somebody dogs out somebody else, but every got some by the end of the book so it's all good\\" formula. However, this book could have been much better. Maybe next time."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"I'm glad my book club choose to read this book as it is the first novel I've read of Michael Baisden's. God's Gift to Women was a very good easy read. I couldn't put it down! I agree that it's like Fatal Attraction but unlike the movie the fatal attraction isn't the only thing going on in the novel. This novel goes into dealing with relationships and how to move on from past hurts and put your self out on a limb for a relationship. Again this was a very good novel, I laughed and got angry. I will be reading more of Baisden's work."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"WOW!! Is all I could say after I finished this book. Are there really woman out there that crazy. This book starts with the end and then takes over the last year of Julian's life in Houston. He has a one night stand with a friend of a friend who turns out to be the craziest chick on the planet but I have to admit she went to all extremes to get her man. Even though the ground rules of the &quot;relationship&quot; are set out from the beginning Olivia has no plans on letting Julian get away and will do ANYTHING she has to to keep him. She believes in the old saying, If I can't have you, no one can. It's definetly any interesting turn of events. I love the way he drops little clues on you that make you want to go back and read the book again to see how you missed the little clues of what would come next. Once again Michael Baisden has found a way to keep my interst throughout the whole book."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"Move over Glen Close, from &quot;Fatal Attraction.&quot; There's a new psychotic witch in town and she goes by the name of Olivia Randall Brown. Olivia could teach Glen Close a few lessons. Julian Payne is a man whose career in radio talk show is about to blow up and he and his daughter are making the move to Houston. But before Julian leaves Chicago he makes one major mistake -- a one night stand with a woman who has deeeeeeeep rooted, unresolved mental issues about men, women and relationships in general. Olivia stalks Julian from Chicago to Houston inflicting pain on not only Julian but the people close to him. It becomes a deadly affair for playa &quot;Fast Eddie,&quot; who just can't seem to keep his pants on when a pretty face shows up. Baisden does a wonderful job with this book. You'll read it in a matter of hours because while you may be familiar with the plot, you'll get caught up in the story details. You'll meet Doctor Teri Ross, a beautiful, smart, professional woman who turns out to be Ms. Right for Julian. But be warned!! This book is graphic. If you don't care for somewhat explicit detail descriptions you may want to pass this one by -- but you'll miss a thrilling book. I can't wait to see this one up on the big screen. Olivia gets what's due her in the end, and Julian is an even better man after having come through the ordeal."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"Men Cry in the Dark and The Maintenance Man commandeered me into the rapture of Baisedeville; Never Satisfied was not one story it was the testimonies offered by different folks. Bad boy Michael Baisden has done it again, with God's Gift to Women. This novel is Baiseden's gift to the readers just like those of the past. He certainly knows how to get your emotions in a hubbub.Julian Payne is a radio personality at a Chicago station. His dream of becoming the host of a syndicated show falls into his lap and he moves from Chicago to Houston with his 10-year-old daughter Samantha.The sun is certainly shining bright for Julian, he has a new job, a beautiful home with a pool out back for Samantha and he lucks up on a babysitter close to home. Then a storm threatens to rock his world. That storm carries the name of Olivia Brown, with whom he had a passionate night of sex. Julian informed Olivia in the beginning that he was not looking for a serious relationship and he told her his career was a priority. Once he entered her body, in her deranged mind he owed her a lifetime of commitments. After their one night stand his life spirals totally out of control.God's Gift to Women is a fast-paced, exciting read and sure to be a bestselling novel if it is not already. One of my favorite quotes from the book is as follows; \\"It is ok to be a woman in love, but it is more important to be a woman who loves herself.\\" Ladies do not sell yourself short, if he isnot the one move on, it ain't that serious. Do not miss out on this wonderfully written piece of entertainment.MissyAPOOO Bookclub"},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"I've been a fan of Michael Baisden's work since \\"Never Satisfied.\\" I even have a signed first printing copy of \\"Men Cry In The Dark.\\" What I like about Michael's books is that not only does he tell entertaining stories but he explores relevant issues.In \\"God's Gift To Women\\" Michael explores the consequences of a one night stand. Julian experiences what many men go through. Many people think it's all gravy for succssful men but the reality is that there are many unstable women out there. Men have issues in the dating world as well.I highly recommend \\"God's Gift to Women.\\""},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"Thanks to Hurricane Frances I was marooned in the house for four days without anything else to read, else I would never have made it to the end. Forget the editing problems, the story itself is unoriginal but if the writing was fresher it could still have been interesting. This book is basically a black version of the movie \\"Fatal Attraction\\" minus the rabbit boiling on the stove. The most promising thing about it was the first chapter, which opens with Julian being shot. Too bad it goes downhill from there. The more I read, the more I disliked him and hoped he would get his comeuppance."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"This book like other books by Baisden is nothing more than gangsta rap in amateur book form. Any reader would come out a lot cheaper buying a CD by Snoop Dog than this poorly written excuse of a book.This book is nothing more than movie plagarism, a poorly crafted rip-off of the movie Fatal Attraction starring Michael Douglas &amp; Glenn Close. In fact, the author should be sued for every penny he made off this book.A good friend recommended this boring, predictable, over-priced book to me. I struggled just to get mid-ways through, then I quit reading. I didn't care at all about Julian, his daughter, or the stalker characters.I felt like a purchased a lemon car by reading this book. I kept the book and returned it for a refund. My explanation was that due to the author's mispellings, laziness in character development, etc., this is a fault product. The store manager agreed.All the $$$, that Baisden makes off this book, videos, tv appearances, etc. he should now spend on refining his talent in writing. I am STUNNED at this middle-aged man writing such an immature and illiterate novel. He is like a lot of &quot;A-Americans&quot; who are born and raised in the U.S. and can barely read or write. Obviously, Mr. Baisden graduated from one of the least academic public school systems in the U.S. The BIGGEST tragedy is that he has found enough &quot;mentally challenged&quot; readers to spend time and $$$ on this.The good news is that if bad writing like this sells, I am becoming a writer too so I can make money off the mental patients (aka readers), as well."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"i loved this book. i was skeptical at first to read a book from a new author, but once i started reading it, i enojoyed all of it. it captures you from beginning to end and he is a force to be reckoned with. he has a talent for writing and i highly recommend anyone to get this book."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"i purchased this book and completed in two days.. \\"THANK U Michael. the suspense was better than fatel attraction. this book totally kept you wanting to read more and more, this was a well written book NEVER A DULL moment. and you kept it real, once again keeping writting those novels"},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"I couldn't put the book down.

I also thought that julian was wrong for spanking his daughter she's right to be mad i would ......think about it Tracy was in her mother's shirt and her father was doing something inappropiate to a woman she didn't know."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"Although the plot of &quot;God's Gift to Women&quot; has been recyled more times than the cast of &quot;ER&quot;, I found it to be completely refreshing and insightful! If you are a thorough reader you were able to pick up on the advice that was being given to women and men. This book speaks to male dogs and their female counter--parts lacking the self-esteem to pull themselves out of the trenches. I have finally learned the painful lesson--MEN CAN ONLY DO TO US THAT WHICH WE ALLOW THEM TO DO!! The part of the book that touched me the most was when Julian gave Lil' Sis the advice about marriage. I wholeheartedly believe what he said was Gospel! I only wish more of us would believe it and step out on faith. When a man is for us--we won't have to beg him to stick around because his purpose will be to add to our happiness. In closing, I leave this quote, &quot;The man who makes you cry is not worth your tears and the one who is won't make you cry.&quot;"},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"This was a good, fast read, quite engaging. This read like Fatal Attraction with Flava! I liked Julian's character. He knows how to love and to commit to raise his daughter. You get a feel that he and Carmen really loved each other. With the exception of Terri, the women were a little shallow, but likeable. I found Olivia's character is way over the top though. She seemed to turn into the Incredible HULK whenever she went off. That two relatively well built men could not have overpowered her seems a bit much to believe (Julian/Eddie). Mitch, on the other hand was probably no match for her.Mitch seemed right out of central casting for the MARTIN show. The tension between Julian and Mitch was just right. Janet Jackson was likeable. Not exactly \\"corporate,\\" she seems to get her job done. She and Terri are closer than I would think the receptionist and the doctor would be, so that relationship seemed contrived. Sam was a perfect pseudo-bratty little 11 year old Daddy's girl. Li'l Sis's character does work as one of those sisters who try to hook you up no matter what. We all know Eddie.The sex was quite erotic. Unfortunately the author does not realize that there are some differences in the male/female climax, no matter how similar. Two hours around the pool in the rain, yeah Julian, dream on. Seems like the standard of beauty is still the white woman's model -- hazel eyes and long flowing hair. I was amazed that nobody's wig or weave acted up.There were a few sections where I just had laught out loud for a few minutes. The pink panties section and the scene under the table on all fours.I think Michael Baisden borrowed a lot from Fatal Attraction, Martin, Jamie Fox, Stephen King, the parent trap, etc. Greatentertainment. I felt about Julian the way I felt about Michael Douglas - he won't stray again ever again. There is a moral there."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"Very good book. I didnt want to put it down. The characters are very well developed. And the erotic love scenes were hot. It was nice to see a strong black man doing the right thing and striving to take the high road. Michael Baisden is the king of giving black men a new more profound face in literature."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"I loved reading this book. It seemed so real. I started reading it slow and one day at thr hair salon I read about 50 pages and for the next 3 days there after. I read it until I could not put the book down. Al the characters were great. .......Now I am reading Maintance Man."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"I passed by this book so many times in the bookstore. My best friend kept asking me have you bought that book, God's Gift To Women? I would tell her...I will. I was doing a little browsing on Amazon.com and decided to go ahead and order the book.When I received the book in the mail and started reading it, I said to myself, \\"WHY DID I WAIT SO LONG TO GET THIS BOOK?!\\" This book held my attention from the first page to the last. I read in two days.GGTW is about a guy name Julian who is a single parent and radio personality. He has a daughter, Samantha who makes it hard for him to date. She is still grieving over her mother that passed away two years from cancer. Julian's best friend's girlfriend, Denise plays matchmaker one night and hooks him up with one of her friends-Olivia.When Julian sees Olivia he is in awe. Olivia is very intelligent and beautiful. They end up going back to her place after only a few hours and have the best sex he ever had. Julian makes it clear to her that he does not want a commitment or relationship. She agrees to this. But after he moves to Houston to host a late night talk show at the top radio station, that's when all HELL breaks loose! One night of a passion just may cost him and his family and friends their LIFE!All I gotta say is buckle your seat belts, lock the doors and get ready for the ride of your life! Michael Baisden did an excellent job with this one. GGTW gets FIVE stars no doubt!"},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"I read \\"GOD'S GIFT\\" and I must say I was unimpressed. I expected more development with certain characters and subplots. The fact that Julian encountered a woman who was mentally unstable was quite believable. What was however unbelievable was the fact that he took so much of her mess never seeking assistance from law enforcement. Overall the book was somewhat interesting yet predictable at times. In my opinion, this was not Michael Baisden's best work, but a decent read none-the-less.Bottom line, the message in this book is very clear. Be careful who you take home. When emotions begin to run high, it can be a recipe for disaster."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"God's Gift to Women was an easy read for those of you who think reading is a challenge. It kept my attention the entire time even though it was a bit predictable. I was up half the night trying to get through the book. I woke up the next morning with the book on my mind.I enjoyed the different characters and the parts they played in the novel. Olivia was a bit much for me. Especially the way she purposely tricked Sam into trusting her. I was glad that Sam was able to accept Terri for who she was even though they didn't meet on good terms.

If Julian knew that the beautiful, seductress Olivia would cause this many problems he would not have given her a second glance.

Olivia relocates to the same place Julian moves, and puts his life in danger. Olivia is unstable, and crazy!!!"},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"God's Gift to Women is the tale of what happens when a man thinks with the wrong head & pays a serious price for it. I've read all of Mr. Baisden's books and seen his video seminars and I kept asking myself \\"now how much of this is based on him\\"? Like the character, he is well-known in the world of radio & like the character, he proclaims to know ALL about women and relationships. You can tell in certain statements \\"Julian\\" makes that he is breaking down what men want in women. Not hatin' on the brotha at all. He's writing about what he has experienced or seen, I'm sure.GGTW is a true page-turner and will have you on the edge of your seat (especially the final confrontation) This woman Oliva was truly sick & just goes to show you that looks can cover up so much. There were some parts of the story that I couldn't quite understand though. Like how his daughter could so willingly trust Ms. Randall, or like another reviewer pointed out, how Denise could stay with Eddie for THREE YEARS. Ok. Its only fiction, but still...There were ALOT of typos in this novel & that can be very distracting for readers. I hope the next book is edited closer. GGTW would be a huge blockbuster if put on the big screen and Mr. Baisden should consider putting it out there. I can see Ving Raimes or Vivica Fox in the lead roles with lets see...Robin Givens as the \\"psycho b---\\" Olivia. lol. Or how about Vanessa Williams? Ok. Let me close. Overall, GGTW is an engaging story filled with high drama and an incredible climax."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"I thought the book was gripping by the page as the story unfold with surprising but chilling actions by Olivia; the humor was interesting with insightful relationship dialogue from Julian's character especially about the bug a boo and how a caller phoned in and said how her stalker fell off her roof. The author took you through an episode of one night of hot steamy sex and how Julian paid the consequences of a deranged crazy lunatic who wanted him all to herself. Sadly, Eddie paid the price. It was a cut above the movie \\"Fatal Attraction\\". My only regret is that the book fell short of 5 stars due to many typos and grammatical errors through out the book. It displays a bad reflection on Mr. Basiden that his publishing company would distribute such an excellent book with so many mistakes. I still enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"Here is a novel which proves that not only can you not judge a book by the cover, maybe it's better if you just left it on the shelf. Meet Julian, a widowed father trying to live his life and take care of his daughter, when he receives a job promotion which will require him to leave the state. Accepting and celebrating, at the club is where he meets the beautiful Olivia, who offers him a night of passion. He accepts, adding on that it can't lead anywhere because he's moving on to his new life. She understands and agrees. BIG MISTAKE! What Michael Baisden has done is taken the formula for one night stands and turned it on it's ear. Being a fan of the movie FATAL ATTRACTION, this book was even more pleasing because it involved african-americans and the dangers involved with the \\"wham, bam, thank you, 'mam\\" formula. Olivia was a true nemesis for our hero, both unstable, yet very intelligent in her methods, and anyone reading this novel will get caught up in the feel of the chase, and the torment when caught. Remember, all nets aren't made of fiber. Excellent, Mr. Baisden!"},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"WEAK POINTS: The plot was very predictable. The parts about Terri went from being realistic to flat-out corny and read more like a romance novel would. I was surprised they didn't run to each other with the wind blowing (but they were in Texas, I guess Chicago would've worked better for that scene). The poetry was pitiful.STRONG POINTS: I think Michael Baisden would be a fun person to hang around with because the sometimes-cynical humor mixed with most-of-the-time laugh out loud humor would keep me entertained. A few characters were edgy, some bold, and some were just enjoyable to meet (I liked Eddie and Sam &quot;West-siiiiiide&quot;). The theme of the story is strong and I really do appreciate it. I hope a lot of brothas read this. The dialogue made the story fun and the knowledge of scenery made him look experienced.Overall, a pretty good read."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"I've read Men Cry in the Dark, saw the play of it and read Maintenance Man (which was shamelessly plugged in this book) and I must say this book does not even come close to Mr. Baisden's previous works. The characters were not developed, the plot was not developed and the editing was horrible. It was a quick read and it gave me something to do on my lunch hour but I was not impressed. Were exclamation points at the end of every other sentence really necessary? I wish Julian's relationship with his daughter was explored more. I wish Eddie and Denise's relationship was explained more so that we would have an inkling as to why she stayed with his trifling (back side) for 3 years. I wish that Olivia's life was explored more so we could've seen why she was such a psycho. The climax of the book, (no I won't reveal it here)ok how unreal was that?? And why did Julian never go to the police once he found out Olivia was stalking him? I know, I know it's just fiction. All in all, I think the idea of the book was good, but the execution of it was horrible."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"This book was filled with drama. Lots of twists to the plot! The book has real love, lust, sex, murder, suspense...every element of a good book is in this one! Glenn Close in movie Fatal Attraction had nothing on Olivia (the stalker in this book). I read this book in 24 hours. I could not put it down. I gave this book 4 stars because of the endless number of typographical errors in this book.

Lynn Harris, Dickey and Majors (just to name a few) keep up the good work and I look forward to reading your next book."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"I loved this book. It was so easy to read. I read it in 2 days. The suspense was killing me. I tried to figure out who was after Julian.I recommend this book to anyone. It is one of the best novels that I have read in a long, long, long time. I just don't understand why Michaels show .... He understands relationships so well! He is a wonderful writer.I am not one for telling the story. But I can almost guarentee that anyone who reads this novel will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"In the order of The Maintenance Man, this is a fast-paced, action-packed novel. Meet Julian, a successful single Black father who is raising his 10-year-old daughter alone following the death of his wife. I loved Julian for the love that he expresses throughout the book that he had for his wife, and currently has for his daughter Samantha. But Julian is only human, and when he meets the captivating Olivia Brown, the sexual chemistry is palpable. So they do what comes natural--with catastrophic results.The storyline is reminiscent of \\"Fatal Attraction,\\" with an African-American flavor. I couldn't help but wonder how much of the story was modeled after the author's own life.Great job Mr. Baisden.....what's next?!?"},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"I agree with some of the other viewers that said that this story line was predictable.Once I started reading the book I couldn't put it down until I found out what the end result would be and I wasn't surprised. I would really give the book 4 1/2 stars.One thing that did concern me was the unsafe sex that Julian was indulging in. Overall it was a good book and I would recommend it to friends."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"All I have to say about this book is that it is &quot;OFF DA HOOK&quot;!I read it in 2 days. It was real good. I have tried all his other books and they were good as well.Go out and buy it today. It's worth the money!"},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"I read this book on the plane and could not put it down. It is incredible. Michael Baisden has a way with words that grabs the reader and pulls them in as if they were a character within the story. You may have seen Fatal Attraction, but this story is deep, and seemingly believable. Highest Reccomendation!"},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"Another best seller by Michael Baisden. This book comes highly recommended. It was so good I took my time reading it, not wanting it to end. Good from start to finish."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"this book was very very good.

I read this book in a day that's good for me. I'm a student at Dillard in New Orleans, La. I have a full load and managed to read this book. I could not put this book down. You kept my attention all through the book. I was like a hungry wolf looking for more. The characters fit well with the story line and Ms. Brown, what can I say but CRAZY. I laugh, I was scared and also cried because I just didn't want anyone to die. When one can put themselves into a book like they are really there; what can I say but excellence. I'm a History and English major and if all of my books were like this one I'll be a real 6.0 student. Thanks Micheal for the words. I also have all my friends going to buy the book."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"I did not like this book. It started off slow and gets even slower in the middle. It was a good story line though. Just was not written well."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"I must say this is the second Micheal Baisden book I have read, however this one kept me wanting more and left me haunted by thoughts of the deranged Olivia Brown for days after I had finished the book. I have already done so, but would recommend this to anyone who wants a quick read and thrilling ride. Hasn't everyone known someone as crazy as Olivia? I truly thought so, but this character shook me to the core. The thought that someone could be that obsessive was truly scarey!Hey, why are we still waiting for another Baisden novel?"},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"I thought this book was a page turner. Michael Baisden is hilarious! Definietly an easy read."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"God's Gift To Woman by Michael Baisden is the book that has captured a nation of book lovers from beginning to end. I read all of the reviews here, and can't see any of this gifted writer's works getting anything less than 5 stars. I loved the drama of this book, have supported it umpteenth covers ago before the Michael Baisden craze, and held my breath upon checking to see if my prior predictions were right after all. I can't wait to see this book made into a movie. Hope this talented writer doesn't give up his writing for the celebrity life. Never has the nation been so intrigued with an author who has brought back excitement to the world of literature in the fashion as Michael has, and I am sure it hasn't been easy for the most part. Olivia is in every woman when the man with the wrong kind of personality brings out this kind of behavior. Folks, Julian Payne is that kind of man. I wonder who may play his role on the big screen or if anyone is seriously thinking of taking this book to the big screen. If so, Hollywood has a winner if it is still open to films based on Black literature and culture. We will wait and see. Updated refelctions: Wow! It was just yesterday that I featured this review, and I had to update it to let it be known that not only did I present Michael Baisden at his own \\"Love, Lust & Lies Panel at The Harlem Hospital in New York during Harlem Book Fair 2004, but he came out to my production of The 1st YOUnity Reviewers Guild Awards and shouted out my magazine on his number one rated show on KissFM.

The book was something that most people can relate to. Either they know a man who has been in this type of situation; they are the man; or they know some women who are just like the characters in this book. I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to all true fiction readers."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"This was just like the movie Play Misty For Me with Clint Eastwood. I loved it, and I loved the book. Great job Michael"},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"God's Gift is a page-turner. I found the authors raw, reality-based characters to be entertaining and personable. I really enjoyed the inserts of poetry - \\"Moving On\\" is an anthem for those that are perplexed about ending an unsalvageable relationship. I purchased the Poetry CD \\"The Sista Factor\\" (Live) - it was advertised in the back of the book - I can only describe it in one word INCREDIBLE. The CD plays like a live stage play and brings all the words to life - b.r.burns is truly a talent. Michael has found a gem. I highly recommend both - its a package deal, they both compliment each other so well."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"This book was off the chain!!

His books just keep me turning the page, and I can never put his books down. This one just threw me off guard, because the title wasn't what I expected from the book. But I loved the book regardless. Makes you just hate some females, and feel bad for some dudes. YOU HAVE TO READ THIS!!"},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"The book was definitely a page turner. It only took me 1 day to get through it. That was due to some interruptions or I would have completed it ni a couple of hours.Olivia was really off the chain. Eddie was definitely a playa.But as it turned out a playa can be played.Julian should have never had a personal encounter with Olivia an hour after meeting her. This was dangerous for himself, his daughter, and his new love. It also compromised his place of employment.Thanks for keeping to the point and not making this a hardcore novel."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"I have seen alot of fatal attraction-themed movies and I've read some books. This is by far the best,most entertaining and insightful story that I have ever encountered. Olivia Brown is a woman who will do anything and stop at nothing to have the man that she craves. This book is wildly entertaining and at times chilling. It is a recommended read for the playa in your life. Men beware! A woman's smile doesn't always mean it's all good."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"This book Was the bomb!!. A real page turner, I have read every one of Michael Baisden books, and he gets better and better, with each book. I read this book in 3 days.

I knew it was a matter of time, the story seemed to go very slow and then quickly and dramatically climaxed at the end. The ending of the book was off-da-hook. I just felt nothing until it got to that point. I still give him 2 thumbs up for the effort and an outstanding ending! Will read more of his other books."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"God's Gift to Women was a mediocre book with used story lines and content, much of it borrowed from Fatal Attraction starring Michael Douglas and Glenn Close. ...There were too many typos, grammatical errors and misspelled names, Yolanda Adams, Hugh Hefner, Steve Francis and Dr. Seuss to name a few.

I bet Jillian learned a lesson from sleeping with one of the prettiest women he barely even knew who turned out to be a pyscho.

I give him the utmost respect."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"I'm not going to give a synopsis of the book, because other people have done that already. What I will say is that this brother has done it again, and I must say that every book he writes I go buy. That's saying enough. Go purchase it and enjoy!"},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"I've read plenty of books in my 48 years, and maybe that is why I'm attuned to fine writing that flows evenly. I did not find this one to be so smooth. Toward the end, I found the writing to be quite...well, choppy and juvenile. Doesn't Simon and Schuster employ editors anymore to review a book before it goes to print? If so, why were so many punctuation and sentence errors allowed to pass muster? I am not a Language Arts teacher, but for heaven's sake, any student could spot the many careless mistakes someone allowed to slip by, starting with the prologue on page 5 in the second to last paragraph. The entire book is written in the 'first person' except for chapter 33. What's up with that? As I was reading, I had to pause and consider who 'Julian' WAS, because up to that point, JULIAN WAS TELLING THE STORY and was referred to as 'I'. I can't believe many other intelligent readers didn't catch that! Shame on you publishers for not seeing that the final product was proofread and properly critiqued. This book was lent to me and I doubt that I would ever purchase a novel by Michael Baisden. I might read another one, but my money won't leave my hands."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"I just finished reading the book--it was fast paced and a quick read. I agree with most of the reviews i.e. lack of character development, unrealistic behavior of the characters and a predictable story line. It reminded me of the movie, Thin Line Between Love and Hate. I could not believe how stupid he made Eddie, his best friend in the story. I still think that his first book, Why Men Cheat, was his best."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"GOD'S GIFT TO WOMEN was a book well written. It had a FATAL ATTRACTION kind of feel to it. The main character, Julian, has finally come up in the world. He has a ten-year-old daughter named Sam and a brand new job in Houston. The night before he leaves for his brand new life, he has a one night stand with Olivia Brown, a women with hazel eyes and and a whole lot of problems. He leaves with no hard feelings about it because they were upfront with it from the jump. Olivia was the one with the problems.

I think that this is Michael's best novel yet!Julian is taken totally by surprise! He learned a great lesson in having a one night stand. Is it really worth it in the end?? You really do not know who you are dealing with! God's gift is a serious page turner that will have your heart racing and your emotions taken for a serious roller coaster ride!You have to read this book...you will want to read it in one sitting because you have to know what is going to happen next!Kudos to Mr. Baisden, I believe this is his best work to date.Go On with your Bad Boy Self!!!"},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"I just finished reading Gods Gift to Women by Michael Baisden. It is basically an African-American Fatal Attraction. The book is very predictable and has many spelling and grammatical errors. Michael Baisden is a rising star and he should make sure that another book of his NEVER again goes out to print with such sloppy editing. Having said that, I did enjoy the book very much. I read it in two days and it did scare me. I think that from beginning to end this book gives a very clear message. You really have to be careful of how you treat people when you are dating. I think that men need to remember that women are the daughter, sister or mother of someone. More care should be taken in how we are treated. We are human beings with emotion and deep feelings. Being a playa is not funny or cute and hurts many.The character of Eddie was very arrogant and lower than a dog. He also had no respect for women or himself. I was still sorry for him though for what Olivia did to him. I also couldn't for the life of me understand why Denice stayed with him for 3 years.It was interesting reading scenes of the sex act from a male point of view. I know that a lot of people found those scene descriptions erotic, but I didn't. Not in the least.All in all I'm glad I bought this book and read it."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"Ok, I have read all of Michael Baisden's books and they have all been &quot;good&quot;. It seens as though in each of his books the main character is Mr. Baisden's altered ego. Which is sometimes not a good thing.Julian character was a good depiction of a man who is hard-working, responsible man who is trying to raise a daughter on his own, unfortunately, I did not like how Julian took very little interest in his daughter, he seemed more focused on his career than his daughters activities. Which ultimately lead to the **Psycho Babe** ruining their lives.There were many typos in this book, and unfortunately, it makes the reading a little rough.I will recommend this book because he did provide a storyline with suspense.-Prosperity"},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"This is one of the best books I've read about relationships. I thoroughly enjoyed every page. It was a page turner. Michael Baisden I salute you. Your books keep getting better. The book took me to Texas and words were so alive and down to earth. I could feel exactly what Julian was feeling every time he turned around Olivia was somewhere lurking. It was like a itch that you were afraid to scratch, because it was leave a scar that would remain permanently on you. Thanks so much Michael for sharing and letting me explore a part of your world. Also for enlightening me with the talent that God has bless you with."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"I read &quot;GOD'S GIFT&quot; and I must say I was unimpressed. I expected more development of certain characters and subplots. The fact that Julian encountered a woman who was mentally unstable was quite believable. What was however unbelievable was the fact that he took so much of her mess never seeking assistance from law enforcement. Overall the book was somewhat interesting yet predictable at times. In my opinion, this was not Michael Baisden's best work, but a decent read none-the-less.Bottom line, the message in this book is very clear. Be careful who you take home. When emotions begin to run high, it can be a recipe for disaster."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"This was a very good book. It was similar to the movie Fatal Attraction. However, there were entirely too many grammatical errors in this book!! Michael Baisden, if you're reading this, please, please, please read over your final draft before sending it to the printers to make copies for distribution. I hate to say this, but you need a new editor!!"},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"I just couldn't get into this book. Not as good as his other two. The antics of the woman stalking him just didn't draw you in. I wasn't impressed."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"God's Gift To Women explores the familiar theme of a scorned woman's wrath. Trouble is, Olivia Brown, bearer of a serious fatal attraction, hasn't been scorned, she's just plain crazy. Baisden cleverly juxtaposes two situations: nice guy/dog and good girl/lunatic witch. The main character, Julian Payne is honorable, but like most men, if you hand it to him on a silver platter, he's going to have the feast of a lifetime. Olivia claims that she's a big girl who wants and can handle a steamy one night stand. Right.Dog and good girl traits are put on display by Julian's best friend, Eddie and Dr. Terri Ross. Eddie's problem is he's not a harmless lovable dog, say a cocker spaniel; he's good looking, but he'll hurt you before you know what's happened, sort of like a chow. The way that he breaks his engagement is too cruel. Eddie's character cries out for someone to stop him before he hurts again. Terri is everywoman after a love affair gone bad, she's afraid to give herself again. Her character is cool, but she's a bit too ghettofied in the workplace. (See page 77).This book ought to be recommended reading for single men. It's an entertaining, creepy reminder that if you dance, you've got to pay."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"I thought God's Gift To Women was the perfect book to snuggle up with at night.

Even though he was leaving Chicago the next day after they slept together that didn't matter to him, he told her it was just physical. Well, that was cool with her, because she was going to nut up on him anyway.Olivia was a piece of work. I was embarrassed at how she reacted over Julian. She did any and everything to get his attention. She stooped so low as to get a job at his daughter's school to be close to her, so his daughter Sam can lead her right to his father, which definitely happened.This book was a very fast read. It kept me right on my toes, very enjoyable. I just took a star away for the typos.

It will leave you asking yourself how much is one night of passion really worth?Reviewed By Nakea Murray Of AsThePageTurns Book Clubwww.asthepageturns.com"},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"The book is a definite must have. I loved the plot and storyline and the characters are the bomb. I would recommend this novel to all book lovers...men and women."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"This book was totally predictable, you could just read the book cover, and not bother with the rest. I had such high hopes for an exciting end, but no.. nothing surprising or interesting about it.Not only did the main character not learn his lesson (he had unprotected sex with his next partner) but he failed to even alert the authorities. None of the characters were well developed except for maybe Julian, but neither the \`crazed' stalker nor his Houston love interest had any depth as characters. Since this book was not written in first person this is inexcusable.This was a fast read, but without the twists and turns or any oohs and ahhs, not really worth the time."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"Been there! Read this before...Mr. Baisden has such great potential; I have followed him from book one. This book has all the makings to be a great story but it is just too quick! I keep visualizing Angela Bassett and Martin Lawrence in a movie similar to this story...This story was just too predictable. I am praying that Mr. Baisden's 'broadening' does NOT affect his writing skills so that he becomes another commercialized-money-generating writer that we already have too many of!

I don't know how anyone was able to tolerate it. It could have been written by a grade schooler. The poor use of language is surprising. Why didn't Mr. Baisden hire a decent editor? The errors were too much of a distraction to even concentrate on the characters, or so called plot. I'll pass on his future work."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"THIS BOOK WAS ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE. I HAD TO FORCE MYSELF TO FINISH IT AND ONLY BECAUSE I SPENT MY OWN MONEY FOR IT.

UGH!"},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"This book is a ghetto combination of 2 good movies, Michael Douglas' Fatal Attraction and Clint Eastwood's Play Misty for Me. What kept nagging me was the arrest/fight scene between the obsessed female and the police. I read it over and over, trying to remember where else I had heard or read this confrontation. Again, I figured it out!! It is the article which appeared in a certain prominent African-American (small-sized) magazine when Lionel Ritchie's first wife (Brenda, I think) first found out he was cheating on her.Mr. Baisden, you should be ashamed of yourself!! You need to improve your writing skills and research your subject matter before you ever write another book!"},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"This book was very predictable from page to page. Too much drama! The victim (Julian Payne) could have put a stop to this madness after the 2nd page. The probablity of all these events occuring and this crazy lady not being apprehended are 1000:1. Do not waste your time reading this book. Mantianance Man was written much better."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"I have read all of Baisden books but this one was too predictable. It may be a great read for some people, but this book should have had some kind of suspense. As soon as he met Olivia it was obvious what was going to happen. I read the book in a day, but only because I am a fast reader. This would have been better as a short story for teenagers without such explicit parts."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"When I read Men Cry in the Dark, my first thoughts were \\"Who is Michael Basiden?\\" But he has shown me that he is a wonderful writer with the abilty to captivate readers with his words.

I finished the book in fours days and I tried to take it slow but I just wanted to know what was going to happen next. I hope you have already started on your next one...I am expecting great things from you, Mr, Baisden...nothing less. Keep the Standard HIGH.

From the moment I opened the book and read the prologue, I was hooked. If you enjoyed THE MAINTENANCE MAN you will love GOD'S GIFT TO WOMEN. I would call it Fatal Attraction to the 25th power. Expect the unexpected.GGTW is a story every dating individual should read, before going on that blind date, or out with that person picked up at a club. What looks good to you may not be good for you.In the book Julian Payne had to find that out the hard way. After having a one night stand with a beautiful woman (Olivia), that just happens to be a psycho, the night before he moves from Chicago to Houston. Julian leaves himself open for trouble, and at the same time unknowingly put those that he love, his daughter(Samantha) best friend(Eddie), and his new lady (Terri) in danger when Olivia follows him to Houston and makes his life a living hell.This book was too good to put down.

Julian has just received the job of a lifetime and has to move Houston. On his last night he meets, Olivia a beautiful women who seems to have it all together. He is instantly drawn to her, sexually and decides to have one last fling before leaving Chicago.All is going well (both personally and professionally) for Julian until he realizes that his last night of passion in Chicago has turned into a seriously \\"fatal attraction\\".What happens from this point is something you have to read because you will be well entertained. The story is intense and funny at the same time. It's face paced and don't blink too hard or you might miss an interesting little twist.This is one I think all men and women should read, it makes you really wonder if a one night stand is worth the thrill it provides. For all of us who might think that what happened in this book will never happen to us, think again because you truly never know."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"Julian Payne is trying to make a new start in life. He and his 10-year-old daughter Samantha move from Chicago to Houston so he can begin a job as a big time radio talk show host. But one tiny thing happens before he moves that spills itself over into his new life: He makes the mistake of meeting Olivia Brown, beautiful on the outside, deranged on the inside. After one night of unforgettable sex, Olivia can't get Julian out of her mind; especially after he makes his intentions clear. He had fun, but now it's time to go on. She should accept and understand that, but even when there's a supposed understanding between a man and woman, things can still become murky and out of control.God's Gift to Women is a fast, lightweight, and funny read that may remind some of The Maintenance Man. The action is swift, with a little bit of behind-the-scenes insight of urban talk radio in America. The most emotional part comes from the appearance of Samantha, Julian's spunky daughter who seems a lot older than her age. On the constructive side, the book has numerous typos which hopefully can be corrected when the book goes into a second printing. But more importantly, the book does show how frightening it can be for a man who is stalked, and how emotional women can become if they have a different understanding when it comes to their relationship with a man that they feel they love."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"Since Baisden's first book, I've been a fan. Baisden's latest book, \\"God's Gift to Women\\" is an action-packed book. Though the plot is predictable from Olivia R Brown's first encounter with Julian Payne, it deals with the bigger and more complex issues of how men and women misinterpret sex for love and the ramifications of a one-night stand.I believe Baisden set up the story to be a typical \\"Fatal Attraction\\" because the book's introduction tells the whole story. The rest of the book tells how Olivia and Julian met, Olivia's mental state and actions, Julian's failure to respond to Olivia's action (hindsight), Olivia and Julian's final meeting, and a repeat of the introduction. I felt either the intro or the final chapter could have been omitted since I read the same details twice - this may have been a way to recap, tie up loose ends, and bring everything to a close.Julian Payne, the main character, is a windowed single father of a pre-teen daughter. Julian is a relationship expert hosting radio talk show, \\"Love, Lies, and Lust\\" - what an ironic title!Samantha (Sam) Payne, Julian's daughter, is protective of her father getting involved in a relationship after the death of her father. Part of the plot uses Sam's musical talent and youthfulness to show the extremes that people will go through to get what they want.Olivia R. Brown, Julian's one-night stand stalker, is a woman that initially appears to have \\"it\\" all together, but has been emotionally scarred by men from her past. The R has significance in the plot.Terry Ross, Julian's girlfriend, is a psychologist dealing with her personal struggle to love and trust again.Mitch, Julian's co-worker, serves as Julian's source of wisdom and stabilityEddie, Julian's buddy, is in a long uncommitted (on his part) relationship - truly the opposite of Mitch.Janet, whom Terry mentors, a lot of times seem to mentor Terry on how to deal with men.Overall, the book is well organized with the exception of several revealed \\"clues\\" in the plot that I had to scan back through the book to see if they were actually given - one or two I couldn't find. It's a quick read - I finished in about two days. I will definitely recommend \\"God's Gift to Women\\" along with \\"Maintenance Man\\"."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"Talk about your fatal attraction...oh, my goodness!

It may have been better if we hadn't found out what happens to him in the beginning of the book and then have to read through all of the drama, and poor decisions he makes to get there.I do think it's good to get a male perspective in fiction, however it's scary that his protaganist Dr. Terri seems to have almost as many issues as his antagonist Olivia.I'd like to see him use his style on more developed characters and stories and less on stereotypical drama.I only read this one for a book club."},{"Title":"God's Gift to Women: A Novel","review":"A member of my bk club chose this book for us to read. I read it so reluctantly because I had read WHY MEN CRY IN THE DARK. That book was real garbage. I read a couple of reviews on here from people who said that this was probably Baisden's best effort so far & felt encouraged. I finished it today. It too was awful. This man cannot write. He hasn't matured any from WHY MEN CRY... It's as though Baisden went to his local bk store asked for the top 5 black authored books, read each in 1 night, then put his own story, borrowing off each of those 5 books together. Baisden makes it diffucult for authors who REALLY have something to say in their writing be heard. His writing style makes me not want to give other black authors a chance, but I will continue to read our books. His writing style makes other races not take black authors seriously. Did anyone else notice how Baisden switches from telling the story of Julian in 1st person to 3rd person around page 219? Total confusing the reader! Who is his proof-reader? His mom? Any kid with a 3rd grade education would catch the 1st to 3rd person switch. I will put a stop to this madness. I won't read another thing from Michael Baisden!

Not so anymore. Prof. Daniell's edition is thorough, smart, concise, eminently readable and often highly provocative. His introductory material not only sums up four hundred years of thinking about the play both in the study and on the stage, but it also adds new insights and dimensions. Tiny criticisms: some of the explicatory material in the notes is a little to British for an American reader to comprehend, and one or two editorial choices (&quot;Is tomorrow, boy, the first of March?&quot;) are simply wrongheaded. But these never seriously mar what is, and will remain, the best scholarly edition of JC for years to come."},{"Title":"The tragedy of Julius Caesar (Bobbs-Merrill Shakespeare series, 5)","review":"Once again, Shakespeare writes another masterpiece!!!

I recommend this play for the light reader, or even for the hardcore Skakespeare fan!"},{"Title":"The tragedy of Julius Caesar (Bobbs-Merrill Shakespeare series, 5)","review":"Like du Maurier's Rebecca or Tolkien's Sauron, Julius Caesar is to the play which bears his name less a focal presence than a force largely off-stage which provokes the choices and actions of the more evident characters. Caesar does put in several brief appearances during the first three acts, but it is Marcus Brutus whose nobility, naivete, seduction, treachery, rationalization, and ultimate downfall make up the overarching plot. Shakespeare here avoids taking sides, however, and so provides us with a shrewd study in the diverse motives and attitudes that always precede insurrection, and in the chaos that inevitably follows.As with most of the Arden series, this critical edition represents superior scholarship and valuable reader assistance. Its extensive footnotes should illumine most instances of unfamiliar language or allusion, and an Appendix provides relevant excerpts from Plutarch's LIVES, which Shakespeare consulted for many of his details. Those new to JULIUS CAESAR, however, are best advised to begin with the text of the play itself (in the volume's central section), saving the so-called 'Introduction' until afterwards; for Daniell's excellent discussion relies heavily on citations of the play's content, and his insights are apt to be lost on the reader who has, as yet, little or no frame of reference.It should be noted, too, that the Arden Shakespeare editions are best suited to serious students and amateurs already acquainted with the Bard and aspiring to more advanced appreciation. Having come late to the field myself, I mean no condescension in suggesting that someone just setting out may find the wealth of material here a bit overwhelming. The potential rewards of Shakespearean discovery are incalculable, and it is always tragic when worthy ambition burns itself out, for want of patience, by attempting too much too soon. I began with more modest editions, such as the Signet Classics or Pelican, which I found very accessible and sufficiently annotated to provide the help I then needed. Arden, which has been issuing and revising its series since 1899, will still be around when one is ready for it."},{"Title":"The tragedy of Julius Caesar (Bobbs-Merrill Shakespeare series, 5)","review":"Julius Caesar was a play of epic proportions. Even though much of it was drawn out and needed more action, other parts were emotionally inspirational and uplifting. The portrayal of the character's visages was very acurate, and almost made me wonder if these were the true emotions of the people who's story was told.I was a bit confused with the self sacrifice made by Portia to convince Brutus to confess to her his inner feelings, and was disgusted with every single one of the conspiratorsI suggest that you should read this book. yes. YOU SHOULD. Even if you are familiar with the muder and slaughter of Caeasr, this book gives you an inside look at the inspirations of the conspirators."},{"Title":"The tragedy of Julius Caesar (Bobbs-Merrill Shakespeare series, 5)","review":"This is certainly one of Shakespeare's greatest works. Every individual character has been perfectly planned before the play was written, and each has his/her own unique characteristics.

And let slip the dogs of war.\\"With this call to arms following Caesar's death (act III, scene 1 line 276) Mark Antony signals that he will give no quarter to Caesar's murderers. Antony is weaker than they and without an army, but he will rally all the people, and hunt them all down.After a civil war, Julius Caesar imposed order and returned Rome to prosperity. He was transforming an overstretched republic into a well managed empire. Caesar instituted a correct astronomical calendar, one that we sill use today virtually unchanged. We've named a month after him: July. He reformed agriculture, commerce, the courts. He worked tirelessly, directing myriad reconstruction projects. Though he was dictator for life, he packed the senate with his own men to bypass the reactionary old guard and yet maintain a constitutional legislative body.They never forgave him for it. Accusing him of royal ambitions, a group of them led by Cassius and Brutus murdered him. Caesar's moment of death is surreal. When he recognizes Brutus coming at him with his dagger, Shakespeare abandons English and switches Caesar's line to Latin: \\"Et tu, Brut&egrave;? Then fall Caesar.\\" The switch signals that the world has just changed.Throughout the play, Brutus seems to agonize over the decision to join the conspiracy. He finally does. Vanity was holding him back. How would it look if he betrayed Caesar, his close personal friend? He spares Antony, whom he hated, and only aimed at tyranny, only at Caesar. That would appear noble. But Brutus is not noble.A storm has been unleashed. Civil war resumes. Chaos returns to Rome. Caesar's work will have to wait until every last opponent has been brought down with the full might of the energy powering Antony's revenge.At the end of the play, Antony stands victorious over Brutus's body.This was the noblest Roman of them all.All the conspirators save only heDid that they did in envy of great Caesar.He only in a general honest thoughtAnd common good to all made one of them.(act V scene v lines 67~71)This presents a bit of a problem. If Brutus is not noble, why would Antony praise him? Perhaps as the victor he is showing magnanimity. Or perhaps, as I prefer to think, he is being ironic. After all, his famous eulogy to Caesar (\\"Friends Romans countrymen, lend me your ears...\\") drips with irony aimed at Brutus. Why shouldn't he be just as ironic when eulogizing Brutus himself?Vincent Poirier, TokyoNote: Marlon Brando offers an excellent performance as Mark Antony in Joseph Mankiewicz's 1953 film version ofJulius Caesar. Especially moving is his \\"Cry havoc...\\" line.VP"},{"Title":"The tragedy of Julius Caesar (Bobbs-Merrill Shakespeare series, 5)","review":"Gaius Julius Csar is the Caesar we think of when we hear the word \\"Caesar\\" -- he conquered Gaul, bedded Cleopatra, and died a pretty dramatic death. And while he only appears in a few scenes of \\"Julius Caesar,\\" he's the nucleus that William Shakespeare's taut conspiracy play revolves around -- his murder, his legacy, and the bitter jealousy he inspired.Julius Caesar is returning to Rome in triumph, only to be stopped by a strange old soothsayer who warns him, \\"Beware the ides of March.\\" Caesar brushes off the warning, but he has no idea that a conspiracy is brewing under his nose. In a nutshell, a group of senators led by the creepy Cassius are plotting against Caesar because of his wild popularity, suspecting that he wants to become KING.And Cassius' latest target: Brutus, one of Caesar's best buddies. Brutus is slowly swayed over to the conspiracy's side, beginning to believe that Caesar as a great man corrupted by power. Everything comes to a a devastating assassination on... guess when... the ides of March, which will elevate some men to greatness and destroy others.Though the story is supposedly about Julius Caesar, Caesar himself only has a few scenes -- but his charismatic, dominating presence hangs over the play like a heavy tapestry. What he does, what he plans, what he thinks and who he is are constantly on people's minds, and even after his death he is a powerful presence in the memories of the living.And Shakespeare cooks up a dialogue-heavy play that is a bit on the slow side, but whose speeches are so powerful and intense that you don't quite notice. There's a lot of those speeches here -- not only Antony's famous speech to the Roman people (\\"The evil that men do lives after them; The good is oft interred with their bones\\"), but Brutus' impassioned argument with Portia (\\"You have some sick offence within your mind\\") and Cassius' oily slanted editorials about Caesar.Shakespeare's depiction of Brutus is also a beautifully nuanced one -- Antony calls him the \\"noblest Roman of them all\\" at the very end, despite the fact that Brutus calmly murdered his friend and leader. He's basically a gullible guy who follows his passions rather than his brain, and bounces into the conspiracy rather than trying to find out the truth about Caesar. You feel sorry for him, and at the same time you want the much smarter Antony to kick him like a soccer ball.\\"Julius Caesar\\" is rather slow-moving, but Shakespeare's powerful writing and nuanced depiction of Brutus more than make up for that. Friends, Romans, countrymen..."},{"Title":"The tragedy of Julius Caesar (Bobbs-Merrill Shakespeare series, 5)","review":"Shakespeare wrote Julius Caesar in about 1599. The play was the first of three Roman plays. Shakespeare based the source material for the play on a translation of a work by the Greek philosopher and biographer Plutarch, called \\"The lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans\\". Shakespeare, like Plutarch, praises and criticises the actions of the main characters in the assassination of Julius Caesar. However, the historical events in the play are fairly accurate, although the playwright sometimes changed the sequence and timing of events and added his limitless imagination to produce a timeless play that has been enacted and enjoyed by millions of people worldwide over the centuries.The play is set in a period of political instability in Rome. The people of Rome celebrate Caesar victory over Pompey, their former leader. However, there are officials that are concerned about Caesar's growing power. The Romans were then aware that absolute power is open to abuse (there are people today who still do not know this simple fact). Among those concerned about the growing power of Caesar are Cassius and Brutus, who are both followers of Caesar.Cassius persuades Brutus that something needs to be done to thwart Caesar's growing ambitions. Brutus has a problem with his conscience but ultimately decides that it is in the best interests of Rome that Caesar is eliminated.Caesar receives warnings about the impending danger. During a festival that Caesar attends, he is warned \\"Beware the Ides of March\\". Caesar, however, dismisses the Soothsayer's warnings. When the Ides of March arrive and while Caesar is due to go to be crowned, warnings in the form of storms, bad omens and his wife's horrible dreams initially persuade Caesar to stay at home. However, Caesar decides to go after being advised that if he did not show up, Senators might change their minds about crowning him emperor. On entering the capitol, the conspirators stab Caesar to death.Mark Anthony, a very close ally of Caesar, initially pretends to go along with the conspirators but he is determined to avenge his death. When Brutus addresses the confused crowd to drum up support for the assassination, Mark Anthony cleverly and expertly manages to turn the crowd against the conspirators and incites them to riot. With popular support in Rome, the triumvirs Anthony, Octavious and Lepidus plan to fight Brutus and Cassius. Brutus's conscience still troubles him and he sees Caesars ghost. Fighting takes place and Cassius and Brutus are defeated and both commit suicide to save their honour. The triumvirs then seize power after avenging Caesar."},{"Title":"The tragedy of Julius Caesar (Bobbs-Merrill Shakespeare series, 5)","review":"When I first read JULIUS CAESAR as a sophomore in high school, I found it to be a decent play, but other than some really cool lines, didn't think it was that great. After having re-read the play and now having taught it to my own classes of sophomore English students, I have a much greater appreciation for the play. Granted, JULIUS CAESAR is not one of Shakespeare's greatest plays nor is it even one of his best histories. And despite much of it being written in the classic Shakespearean iambic pentameter, it really isn't all that poetic. There are moments when the language is extremely vivid and moving, e.g. Mark Antony's speech to the citizens of Rome or some of Brutus' personal soliloquies. However, compared to HAMLET or KING LEAR or HENRY V, the play seems juvenile by comparison. However, it is that very unpolished, amatuerism that makes the play so relevant and easy to connect with younger audiences.Though Julius Caesar is the title character, the play isn't really about Caesar. Instead, the play is about Caesar's closest friend, Marcus Brutus. Through Brutus, the play examines exactly what it means to be noble, what is honor, and the nature of friendship. In the course of the play, Brutus is led to believe and becomes convinced that in doing a most dishonorable act, he is doing the most honorable thing he possibly can to save Rome and all the ideals he has staked his life upon. Yet, his decision brings him to kill his best friend and ultimately brings about the end of the republic which he had tried to save.Contrary to what I had been led to believe before I began teaching this play, students really enjoy JULIUS CAESAR. It is full of murder and betrayal. They enjoy the violence and the theme of betrayal is something they are all able to relate to. I have also found that student seem to sympathize much more with Caesar than with Brutus. They can't understand why Brutus would kill his best friend. The concept of caring more about a group of people (family, country, etc.) than one single person seems beyond them. I've tried to use Stephen King's THE DEAD ZONE to help them understand this better (in that story the question is \\"If you were able to stop Hitler before he became Hitler, even if he was your closest friend, would you?\\").Overall, though JULIUS CAESAR is not one of Shakespeare's greatest plays, it is a great play to introduce people both to the brilliance of Shakespeare and to one of history's most pivotal moments; the time when Rome became an Empire."},{"Title":"The tragedy of Julius Caesar (Bobbs-Merrill Shakespeare series, 5)","review":"Shakespeare gives a whole new face to history, transforming Caesar's assassination into a conspiracy, in which the conspirators have some reluctancy to join in. Brutus, for example, is deeply tormented, as Caesar is his friend and trusts him, but he is manipulated by Cassius, who makes Brutus believe that his duty to the people of Rome should be greater than friendship, and that the Romans want Caesar dead. The book is an exploration into the human psyche, and changing characters. I find it interesting that, though the play is called \\"Julius Caesar\\", its central character is Brutus, who has to deal with the guilt of betrayal versus what he feels is a duty to the people versus his love of Caesar. Intense, breathtaking, dramatic."},{"Title":"The tragedy of Julius Caesar (Bobbs-Merrill Shakespeare series, 5)","review":"Julius Caesar is probably one of the better plays written by Shakespeare. This play if full of intrigue, action, betrayal, and emotion. This play is not very long (5 acts), which makes it a quick and exciting read. The characters are built nicely, and what is nice about this version of the book, is that it is easy to read, and any words that may be unfamiliar are defined on the opposite page, making it easy to look them up, and understand Shakespeare's difficult writing style.

My only note of caution is for a casual reader who may find the extensive footnoting more of an interruption than a help. Love this book, love them all."},{"Title":"The tragedy of Julius Caesar (Bobbs-Merrill Shakespeare series, 5)","review":"I think is one of Skakespheare's best plays because it contains some of the best monologues in it. Who can forget Mark Antony's speech to the mob as he deftly manipulates them into rioting and turning against Brutus? Or Brutus' soul searching monologue as he decides to kill Caesar saying that he has civil war inside himself. Or Cassius's effeminate whining about how Brutus does not trust him anymore? Or Caesar's mentioning that Cassius is too skinny and reads too much and therefore he does not trust him.The characters also stand out colorfully. We get the pompous Caesar referring to himself in the 3rd person all the time. We have the conniving and corrupt Cassius who overthrows Caesar for all the wrong reasons, mainly envy. We have the honorable Brutus who kills Caesar because he can't stand tyrants. We have the smooth-talking Mark Antony who slyly plots against the rebels. These characters interplay well with one another, giving a lot of life and energy to the play.And then there's the almost politically nihilistic theme in which people plot and scheme for power or for idealistic reasons, but in the end this scheming benefits no one--civil war starts and lot of blood is shed. One gets the impression that Skakespheare does not like tyrannical autocracy but neither does he like the mob rule of democracy. He likes an noble aristocracy that looks after the common good, not just themselves. But Brutus is the only noble comes close to being noble and he ends up dead. Caesar is tyrannical and pompous, Cassius is mere conniver, and Mark Antony is just a playboy that is upset that his friend Caesar is dead."},{"Title":"The tragedy of Julius Caesar (Bobbs-Merrill Shakespeare series, 5)","review":"I recently read this book in my 9th grade english class and to tell you the truth I was amazed by this piece of littiture that William Shakespear has written.

Although the language was hard to understand in the beginning, you end up getting used to it and the book basically flows. I liked this book because it was very historical and interesting. One reason I did not like this book is because it did not give enough detail as to what was going on at a particular time in the book. When Shakespeare wrote this book it really captured the language that he was trying to use. It was a well written play and you could tell. This play was like no other play that Shakespeare had written in his career; it is very original. All of the characters in this play have an important role in the play also. Such as Brutus and Cassius; the play would not be such a work of art without the characters in Julius Caesar. The betrayal and determination in this play is extensive making it a wonderful book. I recommend this book to all people who love to read a good book. It takes time to read and understand, but in the end you end up reading something that is a big part of Shakespeare's career. This is a book that is to be read with time to properly understand and value what is being said and to take into count the hardship and time put into the book."},{"Title":"The tragedy of Julius Caesar (Bobbs-Merrill Shakespeare series, 5)","review":"I loved \\"Romeo and Juliet\\", \\"Hamlet\\" and other Shakespeare novels, so I thought that I might try a history Shakespeare had written for my advanced English class. However, I wasn't very impressed. I had thought that Shakespeare's beautiful poetry would add much needed excitement to the book, but, alas, it prevailed. However, if one does not try to interpret what Shakespeare is saying and just reads the words aloud in rhythm, it sounds so eloquent and put together. Thus, I give it three stars."},{"Title":"The tragedy of Julius Caesar (Bobbs-Merrill Shakespeare series, 5)","review":"Having read much historically about the the Roman emperors, I was very excited to be reading JULIUS CAESAR. It was interesting at first to compare the characters of the play to the same names we read about in history books. I felt that this is one of Shakespeare's most difficult books to interpret in today's language. Even though this edition does have extensive foot (or in this book, side) notes, the reading process was confusing having to look back in forth. If you are just reading this play to read some Shakespeare, try another less difficult Shakespeare work, like A COMEDY OF ERRORS. Thsi is much easier to understand, and for beginners, you will probably enjoy it more. But if you are a beginner looking for a tragedy, try ROMEO and JULIET.

I was required to read this play for school and I found that it was best when it was read aloud than when I read it too myself. It has been debated on whether Brutus or Caesar was the main character of the play and having read it i can see why. Julius Caesar is an essential role in the play as the dictator of Rome but Brutus is also a very important character. It is Brutus' internal conflict on whether or not he should betray his friend for the good of Rome that is the main subject of the beginning of the play. Also, many of Brutus' flaws like his bad judgement of character fuels the plot of the play. The lanuage is a little difficult to read but it enhances the play and the story. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in history or wants to read a compelling classic."},{"Title":"The tragedy of Julius Caesar (Bobbs-Merrill Shakespeare series, 5)","review":"We've all heard how great Shakespeare is, how the \`experts' say he is the undisputed King of English Literature. Many books have been written about his plays and sonnets, explaining the intricacies of his verse and the subtlety in the lines. His command of the English language is phenomenal and his works have been rightfully showered with praise. To me, however it is not Shakespeare's technical genius that draws people, rather it is his keen insight into human nature. This makes his plays still relevant in our modern age.Some would argue about with the need to read plays that have outdated words and a style of speaking that is so foreign to our day and age. Now, I am definitely not an English scholar, but I'm pretty sure that the majority of the people that attended Shakespeare's play did not speak in the way that Shakespeare's characters do, but they still loved it not so much for the style of speaking but for the way Shakespeare was able to speak what many people had trouble grasping in their own mind. This is what made Shakespeare a genius in my opinion.I read this play some years back and loved it then, but just recently I decided to read the play aloud with my girlfriend. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and I think this is the way the play was meant to be \`absorbed'; by listening to the characters speak. Find someone with whom you can read the play aloud, failing that try reading it aloud rather than in your mind, (although this is not as much fun).Julius Ceasar, as you have no doubt divined from the other reviews is about (you guessed it) Julius Ceasar and his triumph over Pompey, and about the band of conspirators who would remove him from power. There are a lot of memorable lines in the play, which you must have heard elsewhere such as \\"Cowards day many times before their deaths\\" or the excellent passage about seizing the opportunity \\"There is a tide in the affairs of men, which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune...\\" Read the play to find these and many more other gems.Julius Ceasar is a very short play; only a few pages and shouldn't take long to read. The joy from reading it outweighs whatever difficulties there may be in comprehension due to the language. I recommend this book to everyone wanting to find out why Shakespeare is the greatest playwright ever."},{"Title":"The tragedy of Julius Caesar (Bobbs-Merrill Shakespeare series, 5)","review":"Next to &quot;Macbeth,&quot; this is Shakespeare's most violent and brutal play.

So is it with Julius Caesar .For Ceasar is a most political play in which dear Brutus and his conspirators do find a way on the Ides of March of doing away with great Caesar. But Brutus who as you know is Ceasar's dear friend and in the name of friendship and love of Rome did do great Ceasar away , is taken to task by Ceasar's other mignon dear Anthony who in his mindful farewell speech does set a standard for political rhetoric all mankind may have its eyes upon .For dear Anthony does let the Roman rabble know how much their Ceasar loved them , and does show how the ambition attributed to him by Brutus is nought but their imagining. And how great Caeasar loves them all. And so he makes not only the good works of Caeasar live after him but turns the general public against those very conspirators. And in this action and in what ensues the war which follows great Brutus too does come to his bitter end defeated by that Antony who allied with Ceasar's true heir makes a general reparation of the wrong . Oh what a wondrous play and what great speeches and immortal words .Think only of this , think only of such words as Antony's ' His life was gentle and the elements so mixed in him that Nature might stand up and say to all the world / This was a man.Oh great great play for all who would study the intrigues of Man and hear in great Shakespeare's declaiming the vanity and folly of all ambition's greatness while making their play immortal through his words."},{"Title":"The tragedy of Julius Caesar (Bobbs-Merrill Shakespeare series, 5)","review":"A while back, a friend of mine and I decided to pick a Shakespeare play every couple months, read it, then get together and discuss it.It worked with pretty good results for ROMEO AND JULIET, but then we ran out of gas somewhere in the middle of our next selection, JULIUS CAESAR.Now that I've finally finished reading the play long after our allotted \\"couple months,\\" I have to say that the fault (the mutual disinterest that effectively brought our little Shakespeare club to a halt) doesn't lie in the play itself, but rather in my preconceptions of what the play was about.I can't speak for my friend, but since I took the Cliff Notes route in high school when we were supposed to be reading about Caesar and Brutus and the rest of the treacherous Roman senate (and didn't do a very thorough job at that) I always assumed the play's action revolved around the plot to kill Caesar and culminated with his death scene. I wasn't prepared to find Caesar dead halfway through the play, with two-plus acts remaining. I think I just lost interest once Caesar blurted, \\"Et tu, Brute?\\" and slouched over lifeless on the cold marble.But thankfully I eventually kept going, and discovered what the play is really about: the manipulation of the public that goes on after Caesar's death. The speeches in JULIUS CAESAR, given by those who would take his place, are full of the damage-control, image-making spin that happens everday on our \\"all news\\" channels. It's an interesting play, maybe not Shakespeare's best, but one that has certainly has some modern relevance and is worth examining.Now if my friend and I can just get our club back on its feet.

For that reason alone, this play deserves special attention. But the characters, the language, and this interesting situation represent Shakespeare's finest efforts. Cassius is ruthless with a malicious attitude. But he honestly fears what Caesar will do if he is crowned. Brutus is a good and honest man. He contemplates joining Cassius to kill Caesar despite the fact that Caesar loves him as a friend. (In history as well, Caesar was notably kind to Brutus.) But yet he too fears that if Caesar is crowned, Rome will bleed. Mark Antony is convincing as Caesar's loyal aid who SEEMS insignificant at first. But after Caesar is killed, he emerges as the most powerful and intelligent character in the play. What makes this play so phenomenal is that we can easily understand and sympathize with any of these major characters. (Even though they are on opposite sides.) What's left? Only chilling omens like the Soothsayer, the storm, the ghost of Caesar, etc. Only memorable passages like Mark Antony's famous 'honorable' speech. If you like this play, I suggest the B &amp; W version where James Mason does Brutus, John Gielgud does Cassius, and Marlon Brando does Mark Antony."},{"Title":"The tragedy of Julius Caesar (Bobbs-Merrill Shakespeare series, 5)","review":"This series is great for students.

All in all it was a great for teaching the works of Shakespeare."},{"Title":"The tragedy of Julius Caesar (Bobbs-Merrill Shakespeare series, 5)","review":"Not much is more sensational than the assassination of a major public figure; reading Act 3, Scene 1 of Shakespeare's &quot;Julius Caesar,&quot; in which the title character is stabbed and hacked to death by half a dozen conspirators, I feel like I'm depriving myself of a thrilling theatrical spectacle that must be seen to be appreciated. It is not necessary to know much about Caesar to sense the power of the drama; the play provides just enough background and information about Caesar's personality to suggest the reason for his murder and its consequences.In historical actuality, Caesar's murder was in some ways the pivot around which Rome transformed from a republic into an empire, and the play, which Shakespeare bases faithfully on Plutarch's histories, is ultimately about the political struggle that drives this transformation. The main conspirator against Caesar, and the one to deal him the final blow, is Brutus, who foresees nothing but tyranny if Caesar is made a king. There is something atavistic about his attitude, for he is descended from the family that was instrumental in turning the kingdom of Rome into a republic five centuries earlier.The scenes leading up to Caesar's murder build with forceful tension. We see Brutus discussing with his co-conspirator Cassius the dangers of Caesar's ascension and Cassius's sympathetic response, the conspirators meeting at night to plan their attack on Caesar in the Capitol, Caesar's disregard of a soothsayer's prophecies of doom, and then the bloody climax, even after which the drama loses not a bit of momentum: Brutus appeals to the people (the Plebeians) that the assassination of Caesar, whom they loved and did not at all consider a potential tyrant, was only for their own good; while Mark Antony, one of Caesar's triumvirate and an eloquent orator, cajoles the people with demagogic irony into suspecting the murder happened for no reason other than malice.Shakespeare fashions Caesar and Brutus more or less as two sides of the same denarius. Caesar is physically frail and deaf in one ear, but that doesn't preclude his triumphant success as a general and a military strategist. He is also pompous and fatuously vain -- there is nothing he fears more than to appear cowardly to his peers. Brutus is cut out of the same stock of hubris, but his motivations are purely altruistic. He loves Rome -- as a republic -- and will do anything to save it from a dictator, even kill a man he considers a friend and attempt to ally himself with foreign nations to wage a civil war against the armies of the now-empowered Roman triumvirate. Shakespeare brings all of this to light in a humanistic portrait of one of the most fascinating figures from history and his idealistic destroyer."},{"Title":"The tragedy of Julius Caesar (Bobbs-Merrill Shakespeare series, 5)","review":"When it comes to Shakespeare, there really isn't a discussion about how good the play is...they are all fantastic and are all worth devoting time to read.

The valiant never taste of death but once.\\" - CaesarJust one of the many brilliant quotes from this powerful and enduring tragedy, which happens to be amongst my very favorite Shakespeare. How could anyone not enjoy Marc Antony swaying the weak-minded and feeble-minded plebians with his vibrant and rousing speech? Julius Caesar is unquestionably quintessential Shakespeare, a monumental work that perhaps is surpassed only by Hamlet and rivaled by Othello, Macbeth, Romeo & Juliet, & King Lear.Julius Caesar teaches us about the dangers and pitfalls of ambition, jealousy, power, as well as the sacrifice for the greater good - even if it is another's life. Amongst the bood-thirsty traiotors, only Brutus genuinely believes in the assassination of Caesar for the greater good of the Republic. Julius Caesar galvanizes the brain and awakens the spirit from within with scenes such as when Marc Antony proclaims, \\"Cry Havoc and let slip the dogs of war.\\"Countless amounts of quotes and passages throughout the play rank among my favorite Shakespeare. Needless to say, this book should be on the bookshelf of any and all with any semblance of intellect and enough cultivation to appreciate such superb literature.The modern perspective following the text enlightens and should be read by anyone seeking more knowledge about this amazing tragedy and time in history.

This play is an excellent account of the immediately previous and subsequent days of Julius Caesar's assasination by Brutus, his best friend, and other conspirators. Brutus is persuaded by the resentful Cassius that Caesar has betrayed Rome by abandoning the Republic and turning to Dictatorship. Brutus gets to be convinced that, in order to save the Republic, Caesar must be killed. This puts him in a great dilemma, for he loves Caesar and he's his closest friend. Here we see in an acute form the way in which political power gets in conflict with morality and feelings. Friendship, power and betrayal are the basic subjects of this excellent piece of work."},{"Title":"The tragedy of Julius Caesar (Bobbs-Merrill Shakespeare series, 5)","review":"&quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, as a play, breathes the altogether purer air of antique virtues. The action centres around the ambitions and loyalties, both personal and political, of Shakespeare's supermen, Brutus, Caesar, Cassius and Mark Antony. The ending sees the suicide of Brutus, properly the play's dramatic hero. Sincere but blind, Brutus, is motivated by the greater good of restoring the Republic to such an extent that he is willing to sacrifice even his dearest friend, Caesar, to this design. Swayed by the spiteful malcontent Cassius, he unwisely underestimates Mark Antony, who emerges as a formidable adversary of Brutus's. Haunted by Caesar's spirit, which indicates that his influence will also prove to be posthumous, Brutus realises his error and submits to his fate. The notion of Brutus's \\"noble suicide\\", which is repugnant to Christian doctrine, is introduced in the end by Shakespeare, fully evoking Brutus's greatness of soul in avenging the friend he killed, Caesar, by killing himself: \\"Caesar now be still./I killed not thee with half so good a will.\\" As a worthy character, he devises a grand plan but fails and so submits to his own code. He punishes Caesar for his ambition and then punishes himself for his own. Unlike &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; is more compact, less complex. The action and psychological characterisation are simpler and the language is more hard-trimmed. The tragic elements of error and chance are present throughout the play and the ending neatly combines an address of the tragic hero's principal flaw and a meting out of justice."},{"Title":"The tragedy of Julius Caesar (Bobbs-Merrill Shakespeare series, 5)","review":"For all you who take Shakespeare, or even if you don't, this is a pretty entertaining play, and not so difficult to understand. Plus, its short. I probably wouldn't have read this if it hadn't been assigned, but it is a cool play. If you have to read it for school, don't worry, you may enjoy it and even if you dont understand Shakespearean writing, there's tons of notes to help."},{"Title":"The tragedy of Julius Caesar (Bobbs-Merrill Shakespeare series, 5)","review":"I've read the play several times, studied it in school, and seen it produced, but never have I been so struck by the contrast between word and deed as when I listened to this audiocassette. At every point the Romans speak beautifully of honor, virtue, courage, and other noble qualities. If we listened only to their words, we might think them noble, but when we see their deeds, we find the play thick with irony. The speakers must either be hypocrits or have no self-objectivity. Portia, Brutus' wife, emerges as the only admirable character, but the play still commands our full attention. Mighty words are match by mighty deeds, but noble thoughts are checked by ignoble actions. When Antony pronounces Brutus &quot;the noblest Roman of them all&quot;, he merely recognizes Brutus as the best of a bad lot. Regardless of the villainy of the characters, the play is superb, and audio may well be the best medium for fully enjoying it."},{"Title":"The tragedy of Julius Caesar (Bobbs-Merrill Shakespeare series, 5)","review":"I was glad at how quickly the product was delivered, two days total, and I loved the price compared to the college book store.

This classic play is based on the true, factual account of the assassination of Julius Caesar as it truly took place in 44 B.C. Of course, Shakespeare has completely made the story his own through the use of comic relief, characterization, and wonderful original composition. Julius Caesar, the ambitious and prideful dictator of Rome, has returned home from a victorious battle against his fellow Triumvirate, Pompey. As he celebrates and relishes his absolute power, little does he suspect the growing opposition of conspirators, some of whom he would never expect. This read is certainly worthwhile if one has a good taste for tragedy and does not mind a challenge."},{"Title":"The tragedy of Julius Caesar (Bobbs-Merrill Shakespeare series, 5)","review":"A further proof of the dumbing down of our society are this entire series. It is a shame and a disgrace that ever such as these were needed. For those who can't follow the text I suggest you get the Folger series. The only real problem with understanding Shakespeare would be the ancronistic words. The Folger series, in fact most editions of Shakespeare, provide notes explaining those words. Shakespeare is poetry. Changing the words to \\"modern\\" english is as futile as rewriting Robert Frost. It is pathetic."},{"Title":"Instructor's Manual for Critical Thinking","review":"Instructor's Manual for Critical Thinking by Richard L Epstein, 1999. Wadsworth Publishing Co. Comes with a disc.

The only thing that's missing are the rhymes!&quot;Here is Ziggy Zozzfozzel with his sister Zizzy.&quot;&quot;They got every question wrong.Are YOU smarter than a Zozzfozzel?&quot;Aw, if school had only been full of challenges like that, everyone would have focused on learning instead of grades. Some may object that by setting the standard low, accomplishment is stilted. I think it is enhanced, because children will want to get as many more right as they can versus the Zozzfozzels.By the way, although this is a book of quiz questions (nicely feeding into the mania of shows like Who Wants To Be a Millionaire?), this is the teacher's edition. The answers can be found on pages 58-62.Let me begin by praising this book as a beginning reader. Each item is well illustrated so that a child can associate the words with the images. There is a lot of variety in short words (only a few words are long, like the nonsensical name, Zozzfozzel). So a youngster can learn more words from this book than from 2 or 3 of most beginning readers. That makes the book more valuable. Also, the context of asking questions makes the words and images more vivid and memorable, which should speed memorization and learning. Your child can clearly grow into this book over a period of time. The book has mostly pre-school words, but it also has words up to about 2nd grade level.What just bowls me over about this book is the discipline in the quiz questions. First, there are lots of them. So for most children, you will take just a few at one sitting. You could probably work on this book for a week or more the first time you go through it, doing a little bit every day. By the time you pick any page up again, it will seem fresh.Second, the questions test a variety of thinking methods. Mostly the quizzes fall into these categories:Common sense -- Are freckles catching?Spatial puzzles -- gears, ropes, and mazes to studyObserving -- Do eyebrows or mustaches grow faster?Word meaning -- How many kings are women?Nature facts -- Which ends of a bee does the stinging?Games -- On a tic tac toe board, who will win?What If? -- Imagine that you jump up in the air and don't come down. What should you do?As you can see, these kinds of questions are perfect for using a few Socratic questions to help guide the youngster down a thinking path that can lead to a correct answer. This means you have a chance to help your child with problem-solving strategies. You can also introduce learning resources (like pictures of a bee in a book) as ways to locate a correct answer.Further, you will get a sense of where your child takes to things like a duck to water . . . and where it is harder for her or him. Then you can spend more time on those trickier areas to boost skill and confidence.Although the questions hardly make the book into a Mensa qualifying test (for high IQ people), many of them are interesting enough to keep the adults alert. Also, there is a lot of potential for more than one correct answer (especially with the &quot;what if&quot; questions). This provides a chance to exercise imagination and to expose ambiguity.After you have exhausted and worn out this quiz, you can go on to create new quiz questions for one another. I suggest that you keep it a competition against getting them all wrong, rather than indirectly setting up any other kind of comparison.Now, where do pineapples come from (besides the grocery store)?"},{"Title":"THE CAT'S QUIZZER","review":"One of my earliest memories is going to the library and checking this book out, My older sister and I would sit and look at this book for hours and hours and although the quizzes were easy enough to solve they were so amusing that you didn't mind repeating them time after time.

It was recommended to me and we love Suess, however I thought there would be a bit of a story to it, which there isn't.

Aside from Dr. Susan Love's Breat Book, this was the singularly most helpful book I read, even though I read it after I was through with breast cancer, if ever one is. It was direct, personal, spoke concretely from experience, and rang true, even though each person's experience differs. These women offer a great gift amidst the large selection of cancer books.Cannot recommend highly enough, and friends, I read a heck a of a lot of cancer books this year!"},{"Title":"Speak the Language of Healing: Living With Breast Cancer Without Going to War","review":"It addresses a question central to all of us: When faced with our mortality, how do we respond? Each of these women has a gift for sharing her own response in an extremely articulate and thought-provoking way.Unfortunately, I think the book's cover is misleading because it is geared so specifically toward women who have breast cancer. I do not have cancer. Yet once I started reading, I had trouble putting it down. The book is filled with hard-earned lessons that are germane to me and would be to any reader. Substitute \\"cancer\\" for any profound adversity or loss, and you will learn from it. The book is really about four women who have extraordinarily resilient spirits and a gift for expressing their journey.

I'm still healing - but this book helped me so much on my journey - I love it. Ordered three for my friends and I'm just about to order another two -'cause I gave my one away and another friend of mine has just been diagnosed with breast cancer.If you are faced with this challenge - please don't miss this book! I was overwhelmed with all the information I had to wade through - including all the books I read - I really wanted to understand what was happening to me and the significance of it in my life.Actually I thought my journey was over.. but sitting with the women in this book, I've come to understand there really is a healing power in the universe that loves and sustains us - no matter what happens in our lives.This book should be in EVERY hospital and clinic library but I've never seen it there. Gotta go and order some more!With blessings for your healing journey. :-))"},{"Title":"Speak the Language of Healing: Living With Breast Cancer Without Going to War","review":"Susan Kuner, et al. have managed to craft the quintessential cancer guide by women for women. I wish I'd had this book at hand when my best friend was diagnosed in 1995. So many of the hard questions she asked were thoughtfully and brilliantly answered by the four women who shared their personal experiences and the answers they found in this marvelous book.Women approach illness and the possibility of death with a completely different mindset than their male counterparts. Going to war against a disease does not come naturally for most women, and the gentle, philosophical thoughts offered by Kuner, et al should be required reading with any woman facing a diagnosis of breast cancer.Bravo!

Thank you for creating such a worthwhile project."},{"Title":"Speak the Language of Healing: Living With Breast Cancer Without Going to War","review":"When your daughter is one of the authors, it is difficult to read such a book, especially when their writing is so compelling. However, our relationship is our most important reason for recommending that families read the book. The insights the authors have obtained through their experience can be invaluable to families who have a loved one with cancer. It will help you better understand and communicate with the ones you love. Besides the value of the advice they offer, the book is extremely well-written and the authors' styles blend seamlessly into a harmonious presentation and experience for readers."},{"Title":"Speak the Language of Healing: Living With Breast Cancer Without Going to War","review":"Speak the Language of Healing will be helpful not only to women with breast cancer, but to anyone who is facing a life-threatening illness. The authors manage to draw upon their own experience without being either sentimental or self-centered. The thesis of the book is that there is more to be gained from recognizing and dealing honestly with illness than from &quot;going to war&quot; against it. This is partly because in a war there must be a winner and a loser, but human life is, from the moment of birth, a journey toward death and it is possible to live successfully even if one finally dies as a result of cancer. The insights from psychology, from theology, and from personal experience honestly related are all helpful and encouraging.

Reading it helped me understand the subtle emotions and transformations that these four women have gone through (and are still going through.)On one hand, breast cancer is undeniably the focus of the book. But beyond that, there are amazing stories of personal understanding and growth. By using their circumstances for transformation rather than tragedy, the authors are an inspiration to everyone."},{"Title":"Xenosaga Official Strategy Guide","review":"I have remarked elsewhere that Zenosaga is a game where the devil is in the details - all the myriad details. The plot marches cheerfully onward from (lengthy) cut scene to (even longer) cut scenes. But the action is complicated by countless possibilities for character development and weapons/equipment strategies. Not to mention puzzles, special quests and side quests. It is simply too much to keep in your mind if you hope to touch most of the games bases.Take characters, for instance. You can build basic traits (strength, etc.), spell casting, technical attacks, and personal skills. You can don mechs, upgrade weapons, and tune your engines. To, while maps are important to finding everything, the real test of a guide is how well it brings all the rest of the confusion together.I have to hand it to Birlew and Parkinson for managing to present all this material in a manner that makes good, usable sense. This is a 224-page guide, and you will wind up reading most of it. For the most part it is clearly written, well illustrated, and contains only a few glaring errors. None of the latter are disastrous, just irritating when you are trying to figure something out.I have no qualms about using guides. Especially in a case like Xenosaga, where the designers obviously were planning an all out war with the players. Games like this scream out for maps and lists and charts, and here they are. One of my measures of the quality of a walk-thru if it extends enjoyable game play, and this effort meets that criterion head on. Well worth the cost."},{"Title":"Xenosaga Official Strategy Guide","review":"As far as strategy guides go, I'm more concerned with how its going to get me through the game, and also if it can get me through the game with ease. That's the MAIN point of a guide is to get you through the game. The Xenosaga Official Strategy Guide does this with ease. There are a couple of gripes present but otherwise very nice.The first thing I noticed about the guide were the first about 60 pages of the guide are dedicated to a few of the miscellaneous things. The game basics and such. This may not seem like much but the guide explains the basics of the game a lot more clearly than the instruction booklet does.Character profiles are great. They tell you when characters learn techs in an easy to use chart and they also give a small bio for them without spoiling what their main role is in the quest!An weapon/armor/item list is availible. Easy to use table that tells you what you should buy and what you probably shouldn't. We all know that in Xenosaga you could spend quite a bit of money and you don't get much. This guide will help you save your money.A.G.W.S data for them all. This also suggest what you should and shouldn't buy for them, as well as who should pilot them and what attacks you should focus on using.The walkthrough was perhaps the most helpful part of this guide. This is where a couple of my small gripes come in but believe me they're very small. The walkthrough is easy to use and here's a nice thing to do in using this guide, while a movie scene from the game is playing take the time to read the guide. You'll notice that a lot of the info is extremely helpful.Most noticeable are the boss strategies. These are VERY helpful strategies but this is where my first gripe with the guide comes in. The boss strategies are extremely helpful on offense. It's great to know what you can do to the boss but it would also be nice if they told me what the boss could do to me in return. Other than that these strategies are unbeatable.Before you begin each section you'll see a list of enemies, maps with a very handy key, and a step-by-step objective and items list. VERY helpful walkthrough.My second gripe is minor depending on how you use the guide. The screenshots aren't always clear. Some are rather fuzzy (the smaller ones). It's also nice that with each new area you come to there are mini-bios for the characters who you'll meet there. So the guide is very imformative. The best part? The guide has NO spoilers to the amazing story that unfolds!Now for those mini-games, side-quests and secrets. The guide will help you to understand the mini-games and play them to success. If you're like me you don't play mini-games much. The guide also covers just about every secret and sidequests there is, again it doesn't spoil the plot.Clearly this is an extremely helpful guide. You'll love the guide. It's great to use for the game. Just remember that you won't know what to expect from EVERY boss (there's one that can kill you in one hit and the guide WON'T point it out)."},{"Title":"Xenosaga Official Strategy Guide","review":"Ok,I love this game,and if you love this game too I reccomend you get the this.It tells you everything about the characters,their ether,their weapons,their tech attacks,and the A.W.G.S.It will tell you all the enenmies you'll fight,where they appear,how much hp they have,and their weakness'.This guide will also tell you some secrets of the characters and if they have special things you can find for them too.This book will also tell you how to play the mini games and what you need to play them.They have made maps that make sense and help you find your way around easily.This book pretty much covers everything you would want to know.Keep in mind that some times the guide will tell you how to fight.Everything is pretty much upgraded and a lot of times things don't work out.If something like this happens then do it your own way that makes in easier for you to win.I give this guide 4 stars because the pics in the book aren't that great and are blurred,and they didn't explain how many things worked.But I do reccomend this guide for the xenosaga game to get a better understanding of how it works."},{"Title":"Xenosaga Official Strategy Guide","review":"I am glad to say that this time round, Bradygames didn't screw up this guide.The maps layout of enemy positions and item locations are right on the spot.

I had no problems completing the game my first walkthrough as this guide told me of the creatures' weakness, what skills/techs to equip and where to find the less obvious items on the maps.There are a couple of things I would like to see if they ever are going to reprint this guide:1. The Casino section. Poker can only help you to a small extent with G. Slots is truly the way to being a millionaire. Check out gamefaqs for more information.2. The tech levels are there, but the effects (how much damage does it do per level?) are not shown.

It is true that you can beat the game without a guide. However, the game has plenty of side quests and important (but optional) items to collect that the chances of you finding them all is very unlikely without some sort of guide.Also, the characters in the game are highly customizable. Meaning, you can manipulate their attributes to your preference. The problem is that the process for doing that is not readily obvious. And there are many ways to go about doing so. Some &quot;bonus&quot; items will be impossible to obtain accidentally, and some require that you make certain decisions, in the right order, in the right place, at the proper time. This strategy guide will help you get the most out of the game.My only minor complaint is that the quality of the paper used in the cover could have been better. And that criticism also apply to most of the newer game guides out there. I prefer the covers to be made of heavier weight material, for example. I am picky, perhaps, because I collect these guides."},{"Title":"Xenosaga Official Strategy Guide","review":"Very good guide with little flaws!

This guide explains the basics of the game very thoroughly also so it is useful in that sense and if you bought the game used like I did or if you rent games, in which my copy did not have the instruction manual, you can get all the necessary info from this guide!

Not only is she beautiful but she drives a nice car, wears expensive clothes, attends the best school, has the perfect boyfriend and gets everything she wants because her parents spoil her abundantly. Storm believes her beauty is the key to success, and even though her best friend tries to tell her beauty is only skin deep, it falls on deaf ears. She is so caught up in glamour and materialism she ends up in a situation that is not only detrimental to her well-being, but is sure to affect those she loves in a disastrous way.REIGN STORM is a wonderfully written book that touches on innocence, heartbreak and revenge. It teaches young girls a lesson that there is more to life than looks and money. There is also a lesson for parents to not spoil their children with whatever their heart desires, or the person they become in their adult life will be unhappy, selfish and shallow. The characters were very well-developed so much so that you could not only visualize Storm, but also her parents. I could almost contemplate their moves.

It explains why America is despised by our foreign neighbors and purported friends and why there is so much graft and corruption at home. I rate it A+. It's hard to imagine that a documentary can be a page turner but this one certainly is.Murray brushes the sands of history and reveals the coming fate and continued destruction of personal liberties in the American Empire. A must read for the individual feeling ever more pressures for simply being accomplished.I'm impressed with the breadth and depth of this man's penetration of our national situation. &quot;I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore!&quot; Doesn't mean anything. Everybody squawks and nobody does anything to turn away from our headlong rush to destruction. If Murray ran for president he'd have my vote. But as he points out, &quot;The juggernaut has a life of it's own and the best and brightest of us cannot apply even the flimsy brakes.&quot; The shame is that nothing seems able to save us.Each shenanigan that this book reveals about American politics is so obvious and yet so well concealed that it shocks me to realize how deeply I was trapped in my own tailor-made politically correct haze. His syllogism of the ancient Roman Praetorians and the modern American Lobbyists hits right to the mark. I wouldn't be surprised to find he's high on the CIA's hit list because of it. It was my unexpected pleasure and exceptional delight to breathlessly tear through the pages. Then to find that this source book on political skullduggery was also an interesting novel cinched the deal. I sent a copy to each of my smug politically correct colleagues for Christmas. The howling hasn't stopped yet. Read this book. It will definitively alter your perspective on what's in store for us here in America. Attaboy Dr. Murray! Keep writing."},{"Title":"The Decline and Fall of the American Empire","review":"Robert Murray almost gets it. He proceeds along the correct path but then he stops one concept too soon. Give Robert Murray a chance. Buy the publication and go directly to page 222 and begin reading \\"a potential solution to the dilemma.\\" He almost nails it. Previously in his book, he identifies one of the major problems with America's political system, the lobbyists. Then, beginning with page 222, he presents a brilliant solution to them but, as I say, he stops one concept too soon. Murray recommends that Americans vote online for their qualified, obliged (to the voter in writing) political candidates. But, Murray, please don't stop there, go all the way. Excuse our representatives with an amendment to the Constitution. Let the people vote directly on the bills since they are already doing so now, only we call it polls. If polls are good enough to cite public opinion, there likeness is good enough to vote on bills. Yes, yes, we need software and hardware security and informed voters - reason and devotion to ethics and truth, as well. Yes, we need professionals to make the bills palatable to the busy, troubled minds of the voters but at least with this method we render the lobbyists to the unemployment line. I call this new, real democracy \\"Direct Digital Democracy.\\" As for the executive office, forget this stale and unintelligent notion of one person making profound decisions for all. How utterly ridiculous to think that one man possesses the wisdom to properly guide America. Take a page from the Supreme Court and put nine in the executive office. No more egoist committing our great country to acts of stupidity. Rotate the nine like grocery stock, FIFO, first-in, first-out. And only two political parties in the great land of freedom of choice? What an absurd and humiliating contradiction? If we are to claim a democracy, then at least let's make it look the part.

Highly recomended!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes","review":"Jerry Lawler serves up his life story in a standard autobiography for a wrestler. That is not meant in any negative way. While this book fails to reach the 5 star rating, it is a very entertaining look at Lawler's life in and out of the ring.Lawler is a long-time wrestler who is a legend in the South, especially Memphis. He was never as popular as Hulk Hogan, nor as accomplished as Ric Flair, but Lawler has a secured place in the history of wrestling.This book is loaded with great pictures and commentary from his private and public life. The pictures alone make this book a worthwhile read. Lawler has wrestled virtually everyone, including Andy Kaufman in their much-publicized feud. Lawler uncovers a lot of info on that situation.Lawler also uncovers a lot about his personal life. Perhaps he uncovers a bit too much, as a lot of the end of the book deals with the breakup of his last relationship. This part was a bit uncomfortable to read, mostly because of how he handled it, but Lawler makes no excuses. He is what he is.In the end, it is probably what Lawler included, rather than excluded that prevented this book from truly becoming King. Still, it is an entertaining book."},{"Title":"It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes","review":"this book is a great book if u want to fin out how a wrestlers life is.

Memphis is where it all comes from. If you are fimilar with Memphis wrestling then take a look into the past with wrestlers being mention that are legends in the wrestling world but are not really known world wide....even though they might be since Memphis wrestling was known world wide at one time. This is a good read for any wrestling fan. Sit back and take a look on how wrestling was when there wasn't one big buisness running it all."},{"Title":"It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes","review":"I loved this book from start to finish! The book went into depth about how Lawler got into wrestling (from drawing?, to start) and spent a good portion on when and how he made his mark in the Mid-South Coliseum. I thoroughly enjoyed when the book covered when wrestling was &quot;territorial&quot; and what that meant in the business sense and how Lawler and other bookers drew in crowds and got their product on local television.You also get the truth about Andy Kaufman! Did Lawler REALLY put him in the hospital??? Find out! (if you already didn't know). If you also wanted to know about how and what happened to his marriage to Stacy Carter, Lawler writes about it in heartbreaking fashion.Anyway, if you are an &quot;older&quot; wrestling fan, this book should be a great read. From his start in the business to the Mid-South Coliseum days to stories from the road to wrestlers pulling ribs on each other to his marriages(plurl) to his unceremonial exit from the WWE and his later return, etc, etc, etc. Upon completion, I was left VERY satisfied with this book!"},{"Title":"It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes","review":"I am a fan of Jerry Lawler and a fan of wrestling in general, so I was very excited when I first learned of this book. A biography by one of wrestling's most colorful personalities? That's a sure-fire \\"must read\\" as far as I'm concerned... and this book was quite good, just not as good as I expected.The good points...Lawler's very candid about everything he talks about in this book. From his early days in the business to getting fired from the WWE, he pulls no punches whatsoever. Even when talking about current boss Vince McMahon, he is VERY blunt. No namby-pambiness here, folks! He also doesn't pull an Arn Anderson here and write completely in-character (or in \\"kayfabe mode\\" as it's known in industry circles), either.I also enjoyed hearing Lawler's road stories. His recollection of how he helped create the character of Kamala is especially entertaining. The man is a master story-teller so every remembrance in this book is told in vivid detail.As for the bad, well, there's only one thing that bugged me about this book and it's the same thing that irked me in Terry Funk's book \\"More Than Hardcore\\". Lawler jumps all over the place, never really sticking to any sort of chronological law. That is very jarring to me and it's the one thing that kept me from giving \\"It's Good to Be the King... Sometimes\\" a perfect review."},{"Title":"It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes","review":"To some outsiders, you might think that the World of Pro Wrestling is filled with money, glamour, easy women, and much more. But, to those on the inside, being in the wrestling business is a choice they make even though it is not easy. In Jerry Lawler's book, he gives the fans exactly what they want, an in-depth look at life as a pro wrestler.Jerry \\"The King\\" Lawler is a name fitting for this man. Lawler is basically a king in the city of Memphis, and the state of Tennessee for that matter. He is one of the men responsible for making wrestling what it is today. His past success in Memphis spread throughout the entire country, with promoters hoping to live up to that bill one day. On the long road Lawler took in Memphis, there were bumps and bruises, problems and more problems, but he still managed to be a very successful promoter and wrestler.One of Lawler's key attributes is his charisma. He knows how to entertain the fans when he is wrestling, and he sure knew how to entertain in this book. He tells of locker room stories (which are some of the best I've heard of), the infamous battles with Andy Kaufman, and the fight that almost was with Memphis' other King, Elvis Presley. He also includes the personal stories which can hit right at home for some people. In the book, he tells of the struggles with his marriages and being able to see his kids on a limited basis. He really goes all out to make this book a great one, and he delivers.Another interesting fact in the book, is a statement made by Lawler concerning drugs and alcohol. He states he has never in his lifetime had an alcoholic beverage, smoked a cigarette, or done any type of drug. And for that statement alone, you have to respect this man. Through all the pressure in the wrestling business, to have a feat like that is unbelievable.He also tells of his stories with women, his childhood, and other entertaining stories. If you are a wrestling fan, this a must-read. If you are not a wrestling fan, you will love this book anyways. Jerry Lawler is a fantastic person, and his journey hasn't been the best. But, Lawler always knows how to entertain a crowd."},{"Title":"It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes","review":"Listening to the audio tape version of Lawler's book is wonderful. He discusses how he learned to draw, and how he got into wrestling in the first place, than told how he started with Jerry Jarrett in creating the CWA (later USWA). His discussion of Andy Kaufman was very well done.It is important to note that, except for the divorce from Stacy \\"The Kat\\" Carter and a brief aside of knowing his son better as Brian Christopher than Brian Lawler, this tape is kept upbeat, abridged out any of the lower moments of his life, like when the USWA went under.Also, at 2 hours, it is drastically short. It should have been at least as long as Foley's audiobook, as the King has been around for at least twice as long.It's a good deal at Amazon.com's price, but I would not buy it at MSRP by any means."},{"Title":"It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes","review":"Although I have not read the entire book, from what I have read I LOVE THIS BOOK! I own Mick Foley's 1st book, The Rock's book, Chyna's book, and Hulk Hogan's book. I have paritally read Chyna's book, but nothing compares to Jerry's book. I have been a fan in the wrestling world for almost 15 years and I love finding out about my favorite wrestlers lives. Jerry's book is very informative and I guess I just don't know enough words to describe how much I like his book. He really goes in depth with everything he talks about. I highly recomend this book to any wrestling fan!"},{"Title":"It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes","review":"I am a big fan of the WWE and of The King. I've been following him since he was in Memphis, though only through magazines since I grew up in California. I thought this book was going to be a fun read, which it was. But I didn't know how out there The King was going to put himself emotionally. Bad father. Bad Husband. BAD divorces. I couldn't put this book down, it was a great read. This isn't some ghost written, egotistical book about some wrestler. This is a real inside look at wrestling and at the life of a really interesting performer. Wrestling may be phony, but The King is REAL."},{"Title":"It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes","review":"I want to completely disagree with the Publishers Weekly review of this book by wrestling legend Jerry \\"The King\\" Lawler. In my opinion, this is the most well-written book of all the WWE biographies.Lawler is amusing with his stories and gives us great insight on how wrestling territories used to be ran. Lawler is a legend and this book is a good education for anyone that doesn't realize what an impatc he has made on wrestling.My only beef is with some of his sexual exploits. He admittedly lusted after other women when he was married and basically cheated on his first two wives. When the roles got reveresed with the Kat, I can't help but feel he got what he deserved in some regards.However, this book is a great read and I highly recommend it to everyone."},{"Title":"It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes","review":"\\"It's Good To Be The King...Sometimes\\" is the autobiography of legendary wrestling personality Jerry \\"The King\\" Lawler. For fans of wrestling or biographies Lawler's got a lot of stories to share and does not disappoint.For longtime wrestling fans Lawler takes a sweeping view back across his life and gives you the lowdown on just about everything from his childhood, his multiple marriages, his family, his hobbies and interests and - of course, his life in wrestling. Among the things he shares with the reader are:1. His interest in art and how it kept him out of Vietnam2. His time spent as a radio DJ3. How he broke into the wrestling business with in the Tennessee territory4. How he met each of his wives5. His connection to \\"The King\\" Elvis Presley6. TONS of road stories with guys like Jackie Fargo, Jerry Jarrett and Sam Bass7. The REAL story of his infamous feud with Andy Kauffman and his later filming of \\"Man on the Moon\\"8. A few stories about his time in the WWE9. The Story Behind the firing of the \\"Kat\\" and his divorce from Stacy Carter10. His running for Memphis Mayor11. Some of his \\"Ring Rat\\" stories (oh boy...)THE COOL STUFFIf you're a Lawler fan you'll definitely love the stories King has to share (he's got a lot of them). The book reads very much like a sit down chat with a friend as Lawler doesn't hold much back. For old school wrestling fans his stories of the old Memphis territory are the real gems in this book. For WWE fans Lawler really doesn't share too much about his WWE experiences (he does cover his Bret feud and that's about it really) that most long-time WWE fans already know about. A comic at heart Lawler does spice the book out with a bunch of his one-liners he'll use of commentary which was pretty funny.THE VERDICTIf you love bios Lawler's a good one for you. You come away from the book knowing the guy's poured his heart out to you (kudos to him for being able to open up his heart about all his failed marriages). You get some nice stories about art, music, wrestling, life on the road, a bunch of good one liners and some pretty nasty tales about all the ladies he's met over the years. Yup, this one's got it all.Highly RecommendedTotal Pages: 384Total Read Time: About 9 hours over 6 nights"},{"Title":"It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes","review":"&quot;It's good to be king...Somtimes&quot; is a must for wrestling fans. I personally disagree with the Editorial Reviews. I don't think it was slackly written. In order to appreciate Lawler's book, I believe you must have some knowledge of the business or have watched wrestling to enjoy his book in any sence.I personally enjoy reading stories about how wrestlers made it into the business. The wrestling business makes the wrestlers seem larger than life, but the trust is they are just like everyone else, human! Everyone makes mistakes in their life, no ones perfect, so as far as the Editorial Reviews go Lawler may have &quot;cheated&quot; on his first two wives, but like I said everyone makes mistakes, right or wrong?I think that Lawler did a good job of writting his book, and I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys wrestling.

I was pleasantly surprised, though.Lawler gives us his take on an amazing career, without overly taking credit for inventing the entire business the way others did (coughcoughHogancoughPiper). If you were a fan of some of his wild Memphis angles, you'll love the description he gives here, not to mention the backstory of how Jimmy Hart, Kamala, Andy Kaufman and others got their starts.The sad part of it comes towards the end where he talks about losing Stacy and how he tries to find a woman, any woman to replace her, albeit just for outward appearances. He comes across as a real person, and not the Memphis superhero some may expect, and that's true throughout the book.Not required reading the way Mick Foley's books are, but definitely not a bad choice."},{"Title":"It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes","review":"I grew up just up the river from The King(100 miles).And saw many of his small indepent shows in the earley 80;s.And no matter if it was a small card in Union City Tenn.or a medium size card in Jackson Tnn.or Saturday morning television.Lawler and his boys never failed to entertain me.

You have to look very hard to find a brutally honest one. This one such as many are fluff pieces. Jerry Lawler conveniently leaves out many controversial times of his life. If you are going to write an autobiography; it is a complete joke to dance around any turmoil or bad experience in your life.If you can't come clean in an autobiography what is the point of releasing it. The book should be called the Half Truth. There is nothing impressive with a book where a man tries to hide portions of his life. This book much like Hulk Hogan's book, is nothing more then a silly fluff piece. Unlike Fred Blassie, Roddy Piper and Dynamite Kid, there is nothing gripping or interesting about this book. Jerry Lawler is one heck of a politician dancing around certain things in this literary joke.This biographical sham is the perfect model of what autobiography not to buy. I was extremely disappointed in Lawler for his lack of honesty because this book was pointless the way in which it was written. It is competely pathetic!"},{"Title":"It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes","review":"For the average reader, please note the Publisher's Weekly Review. It is on target for a reader who is not familiar with Lawler or Memphis Wrestling.But if you ever tuned into Mid-South or Championship Wrestling in the 1970s or 1980s and enjoyed Lawler and his schtick, you'll find this book and interesting and fun stroll down memoryI would not consider myself a wrestling fan today, but growing up around Memphis, it's hard to avoid the exploits of &quot;The King.&quot;Lawler is shamless, and the book is not for kids, but he comes off much more humble than one might believe from watching his exploits."},{"Title":"It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes","review":"The artistic world has not been graced with a presence such as this since Joe Don Baker donned a plaid sportcoat and took on evil under the moniker of \\"Mitchell\\". This book is the tale of a struggling farm boy in 1830's England, who, upon finding his prize calf 'Winky' tortured to death by a Samurai warlord, goes undercover in the New York disco scene in order to truly find love. He has both the bravado of a young Eddie Deezen and the pathos of Marvin Hagler.The character brings all emotions to the table. Some noted scholars have described him as peaceful, some as vengeful. This incredible conflict comes to a crescendo when he and his girlfriend, an Indonesian woman named Svetlana, visit the Superdome in New Orleans under the guise of Svetlana following her dream of being a cheerleader for the Seahawks.Bravo to the author! The most dreary of days have been enlightened by the presence of this magnificent tome. My copy of \\"Real Men Don't Eat Quiche\\" is now off my bedstand, and this book takes its place there, and is sure to be a constant inspiration in the remaining days of my life."},{"Title":"It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes","review":"I have to say i was very much looking forward to this book, but was very disappointed with the end result. To start with, the narrative is all over the place, jumping back and forwards in time and mentioning people who are not explained till much later in the book! Also, I would have expected a lot more anecdotes form someone with Lawler's time and experience in the world of wrestling - what do we get instead? What we get is several silly stories regarding his sexual experiences and then three whole chapters devoted to his breakup with Stacey and his subsequent (rather sad and embarassing) search for a replacement! His years in USWA and it's closure are glossed over,his involvement the Memphis Pro Power barely mentioned and his huge rape trail incedent (in which he was totally exonorated) is given one sentence. He plugs local eateries unmercyfully and...kises Vince throughout. Added to this, his one-liners become tiresome by page 30. Did this book pass by an editor at any stage? Jerry i expected so much more from you!If you are looking for some great anecdotes and a bit of honesty check out the Hardy Boyz book!"},{"Title":"It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes","review":"I enjoy Jerry Lawler as a tv commentator on wrestling... his sophomoric character can add to the circus atmosphere. But not hundreds of pages of it. Too many references to his high school buddies. Cornball humor is one thing, but this is cheeseball. What you won't find is much depth on the history of Memphis wrestling. A few &quot;early days&quot; anecdotes and the Andy Kaufman rehash. Sorry, Jerry, even that's not fresh. And the chapters that go on and on about his last wife are simply an embarrassment. It's written on a 15 year-old level because, frankly, he hasn't grown up at all. I hoped for a lot more."},{"Title":"It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes","review":"I didn't read his book, I didn't even buy it or ever open a page of it, I just figured this is the perfect place for viewers to hear my opinion out on what I think of him on RAW.He seriously annoys me nowadays, ever since I really, fully noticed he is extremely biased and constantly favors the guy booed and never shuts up about it. It's not that I find his voice annoying, it's that I hate hearing him constantly cheer for those Evolution members and then put down all those who oppose them.For example, when Goldberg had an extremely unfair 3 on 1 handicap match with Evolution with Ric Rlair being at ringside, Jerry started blabing how it was wrong for Goldberg to go after Flair after Flair slammed Goldberg's injured ankle into the steel ring post. Isn't it bad enough Goldberg has Batista, Randy Orton, and Triple H to worry about? Ric Flair had no business out there. Goldberg should've hospitalized him.Also, the way Jerry 'The King' Lawler puts down Edge, Shelton Benjamin, Shawn Micheals, (and the list goes on and on) and how he severely verbally abuses Chris Jericho. Just listening to him makes it torture for my ears when he does that.And of course, he also picks on Chris Benoit. Chris Benoit had 3 or 4 members of Evolution in that ring all around him, and when Benoit had a steel chair to slightly improve his odds, Jerry is all like 'he can't do that,'. Isn't bad enough they'd beat him as bad as they want?I am so tired of his prejudice. He's got a big mouth. Because of him, I hit the mute button whenever Evolution or Christian face off in a match against their opponents. At least on Smackdown, the ring announcers Micheal Cole and Tazz are much more fair to the wrestlers. If anything, they'll always agree that the booed guys are out of line.Why don't Jerry 'The King' Lawler just join Evolution and be the fifth member if he likes them so much?"},{"Title":"It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes","review":"As someone that grew up watching Memphis wrestling, I enjoyed this book quite a bit. Is it an in-depth history with lots of information on dates, ratings, attendance records...no? At the same time, Lawler buries nobody (he mentions \\"ego\\" issues between him and Bill Dundee but doesn't state who is at fault; never criticizes Austin Idol - who blackmailed the Memphis promotion on the pay-off of the famous cage hair versus hair match and had a frequent no-show problem). Lawler does come across as sexist and as a bad husband/father, the latter two he owns up too.Lawler does a good job of explaining how he got into the wrestling business, the importance of \\"selling,\\" (I hope every active wrestler reads that section), and talks about some of the stars/gimmicks created in Memphis (Fabulous Ones, Kimala, Rock and Roll Express). Not a lot of in-depth discussion about many of the wrestlers (very little about people like Tommy Rich, Eddie Gilbert, Dutch Mantell, Jim Cornette, etc.). He does give high praise to Handsome Jimmy Valient and talks at length about working with Andy Kaufman - which sounded like it was much better than working with Jim Carrey or Roddy Piper.If you didn't see Memphis wrestling during the late '70s/early '80s, it's probably impossible to understand how huge wrestling was and what a star Jerry Lawler was in the community. This book, while probably not providing a lot of new information to wrestling historians, is an easy read/enjoyable trip through memory lane.Thanks for all the great memories, Jerry."},{"Title":"It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes","review":"I have held up Mick Foley&#65533;s book &#65533;Have a Nice Day: A Tale of Blood, Guts, and Sweatsocks&#65533; as the pinnacle of wrestling autobiography. Since I have read that book, nothing has come close to being nearly as good or as honest. I was skeptical about reading Jerry Lawler&#65533;s autobiography because all I knew of him was the joke he has become as a WWF/E announcer. I was aware that he was a legend in Memphis wrestling and that he had the famous angle with Andy Kaufman (I learned about this from the film &#65533;Man on the Moon&#65533;). That was all I knew of Jerry Lawler. I decided to read the book anyway and I&#65533;m glad that I did. While Mick Foley is a more sympathetic person and it is easier to care for Foley, Jerry Lawler has written (with a co-writer) one of the best wrestling biographies on the market.Even though the narrative jumps around a little bit, this is a straightforward and mostly chronological account of Jerry &#65533;The King&#65533; Lawler&#65533;s life and career in professional wrestling. We are introduced to a young Jerry Lawler going to local wrestling events with his father, but having no interest in being a wrestler himself. It was only through his art (he originally wanted to be an artist) that he even had any contact with the world of professional wrestling and the men outside the ring. It was only later, as a radio DJ that Lawler ended up with the exposure and interest to try to be a professional wrestler. Since then, Lawler has led a charmed career in the ring. We learn about the scope of his career in Memphis and finally his entry into the WWF (later WWE).If Lawler&#65533;s professional life has been charmed, his personal life has not been. While Jerry Lawler reveals that he has never drank alcohol or done any drugs, he does admit that his one vice has always been women and sex. Lawler freely admits that he has been a horrible husband and father and that he has not been able to stay faithful to his wives. The pattern has been that near the end of a marriage, Lawler meets a very young woman (early 20&#65533;s) and ends up leaving his wife for the other woman. The only exception to this is his last wife, Stacy Carter. Stacy (former WWF Diva, the Kat) married Lawler when she was 19 and she ended up leaving him. Lawler has continued his interest in young women. Lawler makes no excuses for his lifestyle and he does not attempt to wallow in pity (nor does he try to incite others to pity him).This is a very honest book and revealing of many aspects of the culture of professional wrestling. Jerry Lawler does throw in a bit too many jokes and references that one would expect from Jerry Lawler the announcer, but as a whole, this is one of the best wrestling biographies that I have read. In terms of quality, I would place this one second behind Foley&#65533;s first autobiography."},{"Title":"It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes","review":"It's Good to be King sometimes is a great read. Jerry Lawler talks about why Jim Carrey is a crazy ..... while Andy Kaufman is just a normal guy. Lawler also tells a good story about how Elvis Presley would have became a pro wrestler in the Memphis area if it wasn't for his tragic death. Learn why the Kat(Lawler's ex-wife) is not a very nice person! I can't believe Lawler still wants the Kat back after all those stories he tells about her. Also, learn the true story according to the King on his first constrovial departure from the WWE. Some great Jerry Lawler artwork is include in the book as a extra bonus! My only negative feedback on the book is Lawler does not mention his classic feud with Saved by the Bell's Dustin Dimond(Screetch Powers) in the Memphis area and doesn't even mention Brandon Baxter's name in the entire book. Brandon and the King had a classic feud in the USWA were Brandon told the King and the other USWA legends they were to old to wrestle and it was really funny stuff. Jerry Lawler also fails to mention the sex scandel he had with a teenage girl in the 1990's. This book would have been a good chance to clear his name once and for all! The book is still a great read even though it has it's flaws. I hope this book review has been helpfully!"},{"Title":"It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes","review":"I enjoyed this book immensely, but Jerry Lawler's description of his early years in the business, coupled with the detailed look at Southern Pro Wrestling in the 1970s, absolutely stole the show for me. This book is invaluable for fans of the pro wrestling regional territories of days past, and Lawler recounts his experiences on both the mainstream and independent circuits of that era.This book has great accounts of Southern Wrestling personalities like legendary heel Sam Oliver Bass, successful ---albeit eccentric, cheap and often irrational--- promoter Nick Gulas, and wrestler/promoter Jerry Jarrett. The book also has a look at the local promotional wars throughout the years, which is one of my favorite features in the book; with pro wrestling being a big-money corporate player these days, it is fascinating to see how profitable but homegrown promotions competed.Jerry Lawler talks in detail about his problems with fidelity, the toll his fooling around had on the women in his life, and the confession that it is his only vice. While he places most of the blame on himself, and is very complimentary to most of the women in his life, it is interesting to read his comments on vices. He does not drink or drug, and claims sex as his only vice. At one point he says something to the effect that this particular addiction has no repercussions; well, maybe not on the brain cells or the liver, but he seems to be overlooking the emotional toll it took on his relationships.When finishing this book, Jerry Lawler comes off overall as a good guy, who you would love to hang out with. About the only thing that did not click with me were the numerous bad one-liners. It's true that the bad jokes are part of his character and work well on WWE TV, but somehow the \\"joke within a joke\\" does not translate well into print.If you love pro wrestling history as much as I do, this is a great and timeless read. The descriptions of old small town shows and Tennessee pop-culture are so tangible I found myself wishing I could be there. Pick this book up!"},{"Title":"It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes","review":"This was a great book, perhaps one of the better wrestling books that have come out lately. Jerry Lawler goes into his personal life with great detail as well his great career. This is a book that will have you laughing and shaking your head at some of the stories. Learn about all the ribs (pranks) that he played on people and even the ribs played on him. He goes into great detail about why he left the WWF when his wife Stacy Carter AKA The Kat was released for no reason. He talks about his painful ongoing divorce.This was a great read and I would highly recomend it."},{"Title":"It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes","review":"Jerry \\"The King\\" Lawler joins the ever-growing list of wrestlers who have decided to write an autobiography on their life in and out of the ring. \\"It's Good To Be The King... Sometimes\\" chronicles Lawler's life from his days as the self-proclaimed \\"King\\" of the Memphis territories to his current career as a commentator on the WWE's Monday Night RAW broadcasts. While I didn't find this book to be in the same leauge as some of the others (particulary those written by Mick Foley), it is a good read and covers some interesting topics like Lawler's departure from the WWF due to his wife's release, his many problems with females including his most recent wife, Stacy leaving him, and many other intruiging stories. If nothing else, \\"Good To Be King\\" makes for an entertaining read."},{"Title":"It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes","review":"It's good to be king sometimes is so far the best wrestling autobiography out there. Jerry Lawler is truly The King, and with this book he takes you all the way through from when he was a struggling DJ to his first stay with the WWE to his nasty divorce from wife Stacy \\"KAT\\" Carter, to his long awaited return to the announce booth beside Good Ol' JR. In this book you will certainly laugh, with and at the King, as well as cry with the King. This book truly takes you through the ups and downs of the biggest kid in wrestling life. I recommend it and stand by my 5 star rating of this incredibly awesome book."},{"Title":"It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes","review":"... definitely not for kids. \\"The King\\" comes across as a sex addict, especially in a certain chapter. Otherwise, it is a very well-written book.The saddest part in the story was the way Stacy left him and how it tore him to pieces emotionally. I still do recommend this book (it was better-written, in my honest opinion, than Roddy Piper's book), but not for anyone under 17 or 18 because of Jerry's extensive details about his sexual escapades."},{"Title":"It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes","review":"There are some readers out there who claim that Mick Foley's first book, Have A Nice Day, stands as the best Wrestling tell all biography. Whereas Mick Foley gives some quality insight into today's stars, I tend to rate Jerry Lawler's Its Good To Be The King....Sometimes a bit higher as it deals with more aspects of the business from someone who is a bit more level headed. Heck Jerry even criticizes himself soemtimes which is refreshing since so many Sports Entertainment Stars hae such big egos.I was very entertained by the way the book opened up with The King and good Old JR giving a modern day commentary of Jerry Lawler's first match. Its refreshing to see that Mr. Lawler can truly laugh at himself.A good account is given of Jerry's growing up years and how he got his breaks into the Wrestling business. One certainly learns that Jerry Lawler was a budding young artist but also lacked some discipline and focus in his teenage/young adult life. Its very interesting to learn that Mr. Lawler did not partake in drugs or alcohol. Sex was a totally different story and I enjoyed his candor when discussing his sons particularly wrestler Brian Christopher.Mr. Lawler gives good accounts of his role as an owner, wrestler, and announcer in the world of sports entertainment. He gives a clear perspective of the issues without delving into a countless number of matches. Whereas I would have liked to read more about his relationship with more of today's WWE stars, you at least get a clear persepctive from someone who has not as masochistical as Mick Foley.Most interesting are the stories of Lawler's three wives and countless groupies. The Stacey Carter saga was drawn out quite a bit. Was it necessary to spell out every agonizing moment? However, it was quite poignant to note that Lawler was really at his breaking point for a long long time after Stacey had left him. It shows you that even Wrestlers have feelings.Overall Jerry Lawler does an excellent job in discussing his life in and out of the wrestling ring. Certainly a portrayal of a man with strenghts, weaknesses, vices, and feelings like anyone else. Quite refreshing indeed."},{"Title":"It's Good to Be the King...Sometimes","review":"Jerry Lawler is truly the King of Memphis pro wrestling, but he is also one of the biggest fans of the Cleveland Browns and has an extensive Coca-Cola collection. I guess it's good to also be the King in collectibles!In a pretty straight-forward story of his life, Lawler sometimes delivers great insider information that is truly historical in nature. Other times the King falls flat trying to deliver bad yuks best saved for TV, or the circular file.The book ended any lasting speculation on whether the David Letterman appearance in the early-1980s with Andy Kaufman was a work, which it was. But from the high-spots of some of the early matches with the comic, Lawler equally covers how he had to tell Kaufman that the feud had run its course in the territory.Later, Lawler tells of his appearance in a film on Kaufman's life and the rude and bizarre behavior of Jim Carrey - who portrayed Kaufman. Carrey tried to bait Lawler into actually punching him out, seemingly to take Kaufman's stunt to reality.There are plenty of anecdotes from early in his life to his career as a promoter and wrestler to keep even the most casual fan amused; including the time when Lawler was close to having Elvis Presley in the squared-circle.Lawler does not mince words when he talks about the pitfalls of life on the road, his marital infidelity and not being a good father. It is ironic or poetic justice that his career with WWE was almost undone when he actually tried to save the marriage to his third wife, Stacy \\"The Kat\\" Carter, by leaving the company when her contract wasn't renewed.The high points - like in the ring - are important in the history of territorial promotions and the bridge it set for Vince McMahon's vision for the worldwide promotion that is the WWE. Lawler is a true survivor."},{"Title":"African Adventures","review":"This book was written by Frederick B. Patterson, son of NCR founder John Henry Patterson (not the J.H.

In NEW WAYS OF WAR, he gives some information about fighting and fortification that would be of use to British resistance fighters.Unfortunately, because Wintringham was a commie, he spent far more time bashing Britain for the sin of being capitalist than in outlining how to resist invaders.

The first half of the book is a series of vignettes on various moments and characters in the city's history. Forster immersed himself in the literature of ancient Alexandria and Greece, and it is this intimate acquaintance with the thought of the old city that gives the historical section its depth. Using a style that, though terse, always has time for a story or interesting quote, he covers the ancient library and mouseion, the Alexandrian contributions to science, the Christian and Arab periods. In the celebrated section \\"The Spiritual City,\\" he outlines the religious heritage of Alexandria, demonstrating how Christianity as we know it today was largely formed in this city. Durrell drew heavily on this section for the gnostic theme that runs through the Quartet. The historical section concludes with a translation of Cavafy's \\"The God Abandons Antony,\\" the first Cavafy poem to appear in print in English, and Forster considered the primary achievement of his guidebook to be the introduction of Cavafy to the English-speaking world.Each historical section is linked to sections in the guide, and Forster claimed that \\"the 'sights' of Alexandria are in themselves not interesting, but they fascinate when we approach them through the past.\\" Forster spent much time on trams in Alexandria, and the great love of his life, Mohammed el Adl, was a tram conductor on the Bacos route. It is fitting, then, that the tramlines should provide the web holding the guidebook together. Forster takes us through the city by tram, pointing out interesting buildings and sites to left and right. The guide also contains maps of the ancient and modern city, and plans of the Greco-Roman Museum and the Wadi Natrun monasteries.The book had a difficult birth: Forster's Alexandrian publisher suffered a fire in which they thought the books had been burned. After recouping insurance compensation, they discovered that they had in fact survived. They then decided to burn the books deliberately. In 1935, members of the Royal Archaeological Society of Alexandria decided to reprint the book. Forster put some work into revisions, but this second edition did not sell well, and it was only after the book was published in the US that it achieved moderate sales.More than any other guidebook, Forster's comes across as a labor of love. Lawrence Durrell wrote of the guidebook that Forster \\"must have been deeply happy, perhaps deeply in love . . . Paradoxically, if that is the word, the book is also saturated with the feeling of loneliness, that of a cultivated man talking to himself, walking by himself.\\""},{"Title":"Alexandria: a history and a guide,","review":"Marvelously written, carefully researched, this is an outstanding book for anyone interested in Foster or Alexandria. And just about anyone can learn much: an interesting example is what Foster says about Hypatia [the women philospher brutally killed by monks]: she was not young and probably not much of a philosopher; yes, Foster offers new perspectives on various currents in Alexandria."},{"Title":"Alexandria: a history and a guide,","review":"Recently read and used this book while in Alexandria. There is essential information, beautifully organized, presented and written that should be available. Introduction by Lawrence Durrell is wonderful too."},{"Title":"Alexandria: a history and a guide,","review":"This final volume of the Abinger Edition for the first time ever brings together two books written by E. M. Forster during the four years he spent in Alexandria. The first of them is a history and a guide to the city - a book which justly enjoyed a reputation for rarity as its first edition was largely destroyed (well, you have to look into the book to know the whole story) and which has since its publication (more likely since its republication in 1938) enjoyed the reputation of one of the more authoritative histories of Alexandria. The second of them is a collection of literary and historical essays which elaborate on various Alexandrian subjects - from Alexander the Great and the Ptolemys to Cavafy.The first book is serious work of scholarship although the personal touch of EMF is hard to miss anyway. The second is much lighter in tone, much more fanciful but serves as a perfect addition to the first one. Together they combine to offer a marvelous introduction to the fascinating city of Alexandria. If you happen to be heading in this direction you can ask for no better guide that E. M.

These Hokans possess an unparalleled imagination, and they evolve their culture around what they observe and learn.For example, this book is actually a collection of short stories, and each story revolves around a cultural theme: In one, the Hokas act like American cowboys in the Old West, after reading Western paperbacks left by previous human visitors. In another, they create an English culture, complete with a Hokan Sherlock Holmes.Our intrepid spaceman, Alexander Jones, becomes enamored with these creatures (although quite exasperated at times) and takes the highly regarded position of plenipotentiary to the Hokan race, where has to overcome the challenges of a race that can completely change it's culture and lifestyle at a whim.All in all, an engaging and heartwarming scifi book."},{"Title":"Earthmans Burden","review":"\\"Earthman's Burden\\" includes a fun series of stories by Poul Anderson & Gordon R. Dickson. The stories included introduce the Hokas, a race which resembles teddy bears and which likes to mimic the behavior they see in Earth entertainment and history. Included in this collection are the first five Hoka stories, and a sixth story written for this book which takes place chronologically between the events of the original first two stories.\\"The Sheriff of Canyon Gulch\\" is a short story which was originally published in \\"Other Worlds\\" in May of 1951 under the title of \\"Heroes Are Made\\". In this story, Alexander Jones meets the Hokas after crash landing on Toka, a world shared by the Hokas, and the reptilian Slissii who prey on the Hokas. At this point, the Hokas have already adopted the Wild West lifestyle which they got from earlier contact with humans. The easy going Hokas are fighting a losing battle with the Slissii, who they have taken to calling Indians, and Alex is desperately trying to get them to help him get back to the main ship. This story is a good start to the series.\\"Don Jones\\" is a novelette which was written for this collection, and in this story we find Alexander Jones on Earth with the job of entertaining the Hoka delegation. Unfortunately, they have discovered Italian Opera, and specifically Don Giovanni. With a jealous and insecure girlfriend, a beautiful coworker, and a boss who has it in for him, Alexander has his work cut out for him in trying to contain the playful Hokas. Probably the weakest story in the book, but still a fun read.\\"In Hoka Signo Vinces\\" is a short story which was first published in \\"Other Worlds\\" in June of 1953. In this story, Alexander Jones is worried about the Pornians, an alien race who has started to build militarily while the rest of the civilized races have disarmed. Meanwhile, the Hokas have taken to playing Space Patrol, using Jones' courier ship, and he finds himself swept away in their role playing. Unfortunately, their game has them headed right towards the Pornians' new dreadnaught. This story is another fun episode in the series.\\"The Adventure of the Misplaced Hound\\" is a novelette which was first published in \\"Universe\\" in December of 1953. In this story, Earth is concerned with a smuggler who is hiding on Toka, in an area where the Hokas have mimicked a Victorian lifestyle. Alexander Jones search for the smuggler leads him quite naturally to the Hokan Sherlock Holmes, to which he plays Watson. This story was nominated for the 2004 Retro Hugo for novelettes written in the year 1953, and for good reason.\\"Yo Ho Hoka!\\" is a novelette which was first published in \\"The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction\\" in March of 1955. In this story, Alexander Jones is concerned that the Hokas imitations of Earth history will result in his dismissal as plenipotentiary if Earth hears about their imitating pirates. He sets out to lead the navy against the pirates and put an end to their mischief, but instead finds himself pressed into service. Once again, events seem to spiral out of control, and he finds himself with the name of Greenbeard and acting as the Admiral of the pirate fleet. This story ranks right up there with the previous one.\\"The Tiddlywink Warriors\\" is a novelette which was first published in \\"The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction\\" in August of 1955. In this story, Alexander Jones finds himself under the watchful eye of Jorkins Brassard, who is the Cultural Development Inspector, and who prevents Alexander from taking action when his wife crash lands on Telko, the planet closer to the Tokan sun, which is inhabited by a very violent tribal race who holds her prisoner. Brassard forbids the use of advanced technology to rescue her, so Alexander is forced to seek out the Hoka version of the French Foreign Legion to help him. As usual, things don't go exactly as plannedThis is an easy to read series of stories, and very suitable for light entertainment. The stories are linked together by messages being sent to and from Earth, but those aren't really needed and don't add much to the book. The collection was originally published in 1957, and worth seeking out if you have not read the stories. There is a second collection of Hoka stories titled simply \\"Hoka!\\", which was published in October of 1983."},{"Title":"Earthmans Burden","review":"It makes you laugh when you are alone in your room to read it.

When Ensign Alexander Braithwaite Jones crash landed on the planet Toka, 500 light years from earth, he encountered the Hokas, a cuddly race of aliens that (would you believe it?) resembled oversized, overstuffed teddy bears. The Hokas had the ability to absorb any trace of Earth culture they encountered, whether it be film, radio, television, music or books and reproduce it with devastatingly unpredictable and laugh-out-loud funny results. You'll see an entire world converted into the rootin', tootin' wild west, boffo grand opera in the Italian style starring Don Giovanni, a gaslit, atmospheric Victorian England featuring Sherlock Holmes stalking Grimpen Mire on the lookout for the Baskerville teddy bear, space patrollers, pirates and French legionnaires.As I read the opening chapters, my initial reaction was to shake my head, blink twice and ponder whether Poul Anderson and Gordon Dickson had taken leave of their senses. Surely, this couldn't be serious science fiction! But sure enough, there it was ... the pearl - that serious message of biting satire buried under the flesh of a mountainous oyster of vaudeville and slapstick! Jones was appointed ambassador plenipotentiary to Toka and saddled with what an arrogant government top heavy with self indulgent bureaucratic stuffed shirts labeled \\"Earthman's Burden\\" - the responsibility \\"to raise the primitive\\". Earth's Chief Cultural Commissioner, referring to himself with the ever pompous royal \\"we\\", advised Jones:\\"to be patient with the innocent sub-civilized being. We shall often find his attitude uncosmic, his mind naively fumbling in its attempts to grasp the nuances of that which we teach him. He gazes at us with clear, unknowing eyes that plead with us to show him the right way - the civilized way.\\"How delicious - a double-barreled satire! Two targets for the price of one. Anderson and Dickson impales the arrogance of humanity in its estimation of our importance in the universe while, at the same time, lustily lampooning the idiocies of government bureaucracy. Enjoy!

It seems noteworthy for its early positive recognition of Alfred Korzybski's work. Bachelard wrote: &quot;Those of us who are trying to find new ways of thinking, must direct ourselves towards the most complicated structures. We must take advantage of all the lessons of science, however special they may be, to determine new mental structures. We must realize that the possession of a form of thought is automatically a reform of the mind. We must therefore direct our researches towards a new pedagogy. In this direction, which has attracted us personally for a number of years, we shall take as our guide the very important work of the non-Aristotelian school, founded in America by Korzybski, which is so little known in France&quot; (108). I also found noteworthy, from a general-semantics perspective, Bachelard's discussion of his &quot;epistemological profile.&quot; The epistemological profile provides a standard for evaluating the underlying assumptions of scientific discussions. This was reworked by general-semantics writer J. Samuel Bois and provides the basis for a scheme of viewing personal and cultural development. Bachelard's writing style, dense and metaphorical, lacks sufficient clarity for me at times. Nonetheless, I found the book stimulating enough to recommend to other explorers of thought. The philosophy of no is definitely not out of date."},{"Title":"Trains of Discovery: Western Railroads and the National Parks","review":"Trains of Discovery does well what few books seem to do today -- it looks into the texture of American's past for hidden lessons important for our future. The author has done a masterful job educating readers about how and why America's railroads contributed to the development of the National Park system, a unique story about an industry electing to connect itself with America's spectacular natural landscapes. It examines the railroads' commercial objectives, their sponsorship of unique artwork that captured the spirit of the age, the mobility and development issues at the time, and how all of this affected our national cultural identity. This book, with its clear writing and rich illustrations, also makes learning about all this fun. The author looks to the future and passionately and effectively conveys the need to restore passenger rail service to natural areas as an alternative to auto congestion and pollution. He concludes, &quot;Trains and the national parks just naturally go together.&quot; He has me convinced, and as an author and public speaker I've found myself quoting Mr. Runte's book many times."},{"Title":"Trains of Discovery: Western Railroads and the National Parks","review":"In the era when railroads were the primary method of arriving to a national park, railroad companies encouraged the designation of national parks and were the allies of preservationists, though their motives were not altruistic. The railroads sought more passengers and in turn, more profit. National parks proved the ticket to achieve their aims. Though not driven by preservationist aims, railroads had a hand in raising ecological awareness among their passengers and even magazine readers, with striking, sometimes full-color advertisements in periodicals nationwide. In Trains of Discovery: Western Railroads and the National Parks Alfred Runte looks not only at history, but shows the price the nation has paid, both socially and environmentally, for its love affair with the automobile.Runte details the crucial role railroads played in the establishment, protection and improvement of national parks. The Northern Pacific was at the forefront of efforts to designate Yellowstone a national park. Other rail lines played similar roles, such as the Great Northern's vociferous campaign to designate Glacier National Park. Railroads unwaveringly supported the National Park Service legislation, looking forward to working with one government agency committed to promoting national parks (49). Stephen Mather, the first director of the Park Service, teamed with railroads to promote the national parks. The railroads rarely portrayed environmental consciousness in their guidebooks, but dependence on unspoiled scenery to sell national parks as a destination restrained more extractive aims, such as logging and mining (24). Railroad support of Yellowstone as a breeding ground for big game heightened awareness that the West was a refuge for wildlife (29).In the 1960s, rail transportation to national parks and the NPS alliance with the railroads dimmed. As early as 1916, automobile passengers exceeded train passengers in Yosemite National Park (66). Opponents of the Yosemite Valley Railroad were misguided into thinking the line would have a negative impact on the valley. By 1945 the Yosemite Valley Railroad ceased operations and the NPS was given no choice but to accommodate more automobiles to please the surmounting hoard of tourists. At first, preservationists sided with auto accommodation, thinking it would be better than alternatives such as reservoirs and power lines. It is clear the automobile has degraded the environment more than any rail line ever could. The National Parks have intensely suffered from Americans' desire for greater independence behind the wheels of their cars.Runte advocates public transportation as the only way to serve both access and preservation (7). He details how the shuttle service instituted in Yosemite in 1970 became popular once tourists realized the convenience and lack of auto congestion. The mandatory shuttle service in Zion National Park has seen similar positive reception.Though the narrative is engaging and informative, Runte's treatment is light. He leaves the reader wanting more. The volume lacks thorough detail, such as the perceptions of the national park railroad experience from its early passengers. The narrative clearly utilizes a \\"top-down\\" approach. The book's main strength is its reprints of period railroad advertisements and photographs. The reader can actually decipher the text of each advertisement and get a feel for the romanticism of the age - a romanticism Runte hopes will resurge so national parks will be better preserved for future generations."},{"Title":"Trains of Discovery: Western Railroads and the National Parks","review":"This book is simply great.

Prior to this book, the version of events promoted by the Comintern had been widely prevalent. This book was a real turning point on this issue in the historiography. It may be be best to simply cite what A.J.P. Taylor said in the introduction to the English edition of this book, alongside of other comments made by more recent historians.-----The case against the Nazis rested on two arguments or rather assumptions: the first that van der Lubbe was a physical degenerate who was incapable of starting the fires alone; the second that it was impossible, in any case, for the fires to have been started by a single man. Herr Tobias has shaken both these assumptions. He shows that van der Lubbe was quick-witted, ingenious, and physically active. His defective eyesight was balanced, as often happens, by sensitivity in other ways. He described precisely how he had set fire to the Reichstag; and his description tallied with the evidence. The police took him through the Reichstag with a stop-watch. He covered the ground at exactly the right times...The strongest point in Herr Tobias's book is perhaps the firm and final demonstration that neither the Nazis nor anyone else could have come through the famous 'tunnel' from Goering's house. Use of this tunnel by the Nazis was an ingenious Communist speculation, plausible only to those who knew nothing of the physical obstacles which the tunnel and its many locked doors provided. We are thus left with two conclusions. There is no firm evidence that the Nazis had anything to do with the fire. There is much evidence that van der Lubbe did it alone, as he claimed.------- From the introduction to the English edition by A.J.P. Taylor to Fritz Tobias, THE REICHSTAG FIRE, pp. 14-5.-----But the most likely fact is that van der Lubbe acted alone and was exactly what he seemed: a confused insignificant man, desperate for a place, any place, in a politics, indeed a world, from which he felt himself forever excluded... The whole case for a larger conspiracy responsible for torching the Reichstag rests on one dubious assumption: That it was a physical impossibility for one person alone to have set so many fires so quickly in such a very large building. This assumption dominated the claims of both Goebbels and Muenzenberg. Tobias refutes it decisively. The boy had stuffed his pockets with cheap phosphorous and paraffin fuses, very easily lit and long-lasting--the kind used every morning by Berlin housewives to start the coal in their kitchen stoves. He had dashed through the empty building tossing one after another of these at anything that looked like it would burn. Much would burn. The vast Sessions Chamber was lined with tinder-dry wood and dusty curtains, and the snaking fire took only minutes to suck them up into an inferno.------- Stephen Koch, DOUBLE LIVES: SPIES AND WRITERS IN THE SECRET SOVIET WAR OF IDEAS AGAINST THE WEST, pp. 102-3.-----Subsequently, the Communists attempted to prove that the Nazis had been behind the arson attempt, but the authenticity of van der Lubbe's statements and associated documentation seems beyond doubt. Moreover, numerous forgeries and falsifications have been found among the documentary evidence purporting to prove Nazi involvement... So far, the conclusion of Tobias and Mommsen that van der Lubbe acted alone has not been shaken.------- Richard Evans, THE COMING OF THE THIRD REICH, pp. 518-9.-----The fire had been intended as a protest against the new German government by the Dutch loner Marinus van der Lubbe, a former Communist.------- Nikolaus Wachsmann, HITLER'S PRISONS: LEGAL TERROR IN NAZI GERMANY, p. 72.-----It is by no means clear that the Nazis, as most of Hitler's contemporaries and and historians presumed for decades, were behind the fire...... neither Nazis nor Communists were able to produce a shred of credible evidence linking Lubbe with conspirators from the other party. Fifty years later, another \\"International Commission of Inquiry\\" unearthed \\"new\\" evidence and concluded that a Nazi team led by Reinhard Heydrich was probably behind the blaze--but this evidence turned out to have been just as flimsily constructed as that provided in the BROWN BOOK...The BROWN BOOK took pains to \\"prove\\" with Regler's photos of Wallot's 1889 plans that there was a secret underground passage leading from the Reichstag to the official residence of Hermann Goering as Reichstag president. In fact the \\"underground passage\\" was a narrow 450-foot long tunnel filled with steam pipes from the boiler room, which had been constructed at a distance from the Reichstag \\"in order that there should be no source of fire within Parliament itself.\\" The Speaker's residence, built after Wallot drew his plans, was then also connected to the boiler room, through its own steampipe tunnel. The entrance to this underground pipe network from the Reichstag was then further protected by an almost impenetrable \\"maze of corridors and [locked] doors,\\" in which a court investigator, sent to test the thesis of a team of incendiaries entering through the speaker's house, got lost and had to be rescued by a search team...------ Sean McMeekin, THE RED MILIONAIRE: A POLTICAL BIOGRAPHY OF WILLI MUENZENBERG, pp. 258, 268, 361.OK, I think that illustrates the point. Tobias reliably establishes that the most likely sequence of events was that Marinus van der Lubbe set the fire on his own initiative without any help from either the Nazis or Communists. Goering already had plans to begin arresting Left-wing political opponents and didn't need the fire for anything. Once the fire had been set, both the Nazis and Communists rushed to hurriedly accuse each other. The Nazis did such a bad job before the western public that many people subsequently assumed that the Comintern's version of events with the Nazis as culprits in the fire must be correct. In fact, there's no real evidence that anyone other than a lone individual ever planned the fire.In the last few years I've seen some (in my opinion) well-meaning people make the charge that \\"Bush needed a Reichstag fire!\\" What this book highlights very well is the need to be careful with accusations of this type, even when you may be hostile to the politician being accused. So many people at the time simply accepted the Comintern's distorted version of the Reichstag fire merely out of distaste for Hitler. Yet from Tobias we realize that this was not a historically reliable methodology. There are some worthwhile lessons in this book for a serious reader."},{"Title":"Wonders of the Sea (Wonders of Nature: Natural Phenomena in Science and Myth)","review":"I should love this book - I'm an oceanographer, science educator and storyteller, and I uses stories to teach the science of the ocean.

Miguel Asturias' Mr. President deals with a backwater banana republic where the president for life's presence itself is minor. What occurs instead is the lethal working out of a hideously unjust system which crushes and destroys all who resist and those who are caught in its clutches. Then there is Gabriel Garcia Marquez's The Autumn of the Patriarch, an example of high modernism at its most brilliant. In sentences of increasingly serpentine length (in the end consisting of the final chapter of forty-five pages) Garcia Marquez deals with an aged dictator who has ruled for centuries and is capable of every iniquity (such as serving up a cabinet minister for his treacherous colleagues to eat) while living in a world of pretend power and real submission (he has to sell his country's sea to pay off the Americans). This book is also high modernist, but is very different. Instead of the fantastic elements of the Autumn of the Patriarch we have here the story of the founder of Paraguay, Dr. Francia. Dr. Francia consolidated his country's independence by creating a regime of isolation and absolute power. He expelled the Jesuits and set up his own Catholic Church so it would not be beholden to Rome. He was utterly ruthless and the result, according to E. Bradford Burns was an autarky that probably benefited the masses more in terms of literacy and nutrition than any other Latin American country of the time. Its fate, however, was to be crushed by the surrounding countries in the great war of 1870-73 where the male population was almost literally devastated.No venal tinpot hack, Dr. Francia appears as a man of frightening sincerity, in an account that is of direct revelance to the fate of Castro's Cuba. I, the Supreme begins with a proclamation in which the dicators calls for the decapitation of his corpse and the lynching of all his ministers. It continues with tales of prisoners forced to live in boats travelling down the rivers of Paraguay without ever stopping. We read of Francia's dialogue with a sycophantic Vicar General (&quot;How long did the trial of the infamous traitors to the Fatherland last? As long as it was necessary in order not to rush to judgement. They were granted every right to defend themselves. In the end every recourse was exhausted. It might be said that the case was never closed. It is still open. Not all the guilty parties were sentenced to death and executed.&quot;), who then goes on to condemn his priests for siring dozens and hundreds of illegitimate children. Like Lenin and indeed Stalin he rants against the jungle of bureaucracy that he himself has created, he outsmarts the greedy surrounding oligarchies who wish to absorb Paraguay, he reminds his civil servants not to express and exploit the Indian population. We read reports of how school children are indoctrinated to see their great leader (&quot;The Supreme Government is very old. Older than the Lord God, that our schoolmaster...tells us about in a low voice.) The book is a masterpiece of polyphony, filled with many voices and viewpoints, combined with a richness of metaphor and incident and a complexity of moral vision that have few competitors this century. Writing for a country that has possessed only brief and shadowy vestiges of liberty, Roa Bastos deals with its pain in a way that should be required reading for all who care about democracy."},{"Title":"I the Supreme","review":"This is a wonderful book, by a great writer. The catch is that very often it will be misunderstood, and associated with the group of fantastic south american writers, like Garcia Marquez. Instead the story is basically for real (the story of the last years of Paraguay dictator Gaspar Francia, who ruled the country from 1813 to 1840), and most of the mentioned documents are authentic, or at least plausible. Roa Bastos has played on the borderline between history and fiction, but most readers will not know this, and take for fiction what are very important and interesting historical facts, that would deserve a different approach and attention. This is the only (but rather painful) fault I find in an otherwise beautiful work."},{"Title":"I the Supreme","review":"In what has to be a fictional note at the end of the book, the author claims that he is not such, indicating that he merely copied parts of historical documents, writings and tales, thus the real &quot;author&quot; of this book is history itself and not him, who he says is merely the &quot;compiler.&quot; The work is indeed true to history; the history about Jos&eacute; Gaspar Rodr&iacute;guez de Francia, the controversial Dictator of Paraguay between 1814-1840 who used to sign his official decrees not with his name but the sentence that is the title of this book. This is a wonderfully complex book; not easy to read. Sometimes fascinating paragraphs are unexpectedly cut with some note form the \\"compiler\\" indicating that the rest is illegible because the page is partly burned, which lets you to think that it was indeed copied from an old document; while at other times you read fascinating dialogs and monologues which you would think had to be fictional; but it is not as simple: You cannot tell truth from fiction because the truth seems fictional and the fiction tells truth. Truth that comes to you in the form of insights about the state of mind of a dictator, about absolute power, and about the soul of a country that owns its independent existence to its first dictator's determination to be its supreme ruler. It is an utterly fascinating book."},{"Title":"I the Supreme","review":"A sublime book with fabulous ideas and use of language. Very much worth buying."},{"Title":"I the Supreme","review":"The reader might wonder who on earth would want to know what goes on in the mind of a really horrible person, but everyone from police detectives to your average citizen ought to know how a dictator thinks, because--here's the surprise--there's a little bit of the Supreme One in all of us. For each of us, we are Supreme in our own lives; we would like our orders to be followed, or we would like to control everyone. The difference is that this dictator was given the power (by those at the top) and then used his power to either execute or imprison anyone who disagreed with him--and relatives were no exception. But, even after 25 years, the Supreme Dictator of Paraguay could not escape death; surely you'd think that the experience of one's own aging and mortality would humble some people, but not if you've made a deal with the devil, I suppose.The artistry of this novel is that it's way beyond what Irish exile James Joyce or any other writer of a monumental tome could accomplish, and now I see why: the author Augusto Roa Bastos was a native-born Paraguayan who fled to Argentina from another of those dictators. As a man in exile, Roa Bastos had the knowledge to write as he did, basing his \\"character\\" of the dictator on actual historical documents. And now that I think of it, Stendhal was also fleeing from the Austrian occupation of northern Italy which threatened to arrest him. It seems that if you live in fear of a totalitarian regime, and you are literate, you can crank out a dynamic novel--even if a somewhat difficult one, as in Yo, El Supremo.To quote at all from this novel would be to take words out of context since every phrase, every image, every sentence is connected to the one before and after--and the tone of voice binds the entire novel. The astonishing thing is that this dictator kind of snuck up on me; in the middle of a paragraph, I would suddenly think that this dictator makes sense, in fact, it would seem that for Dr. Francia, the real man on whom the novel is based, is quite rational. El Supremo makes it seem that some nations, while in their formative state, need dictatorship. Democracy would be bad for your people, if you think of your people as children, and they might be attacked by Argentina or Bolivia, for example. But it's still a mystery to me why, in certain periods of history, in certain places in the world, some nations have tyranny but others do not--or their leaders think that everything is going fine. But this novel is the most thorough, imaginative exploration of this topic that anyone is likely ever to read, and it puts a whole new spin on the topic of national security. I didn't think it possible, but because of this novel I am more aware of the use of language, the effects that a wide vocabulary can have on a person's ability to think--and, for the first time, I'm deeply aware of Paraguay.This is not an easy summer read, but I guess the past two months it have been winter in the southern hemisphere."},{"Title":"I the Supreme","review":"When a novel is described as \`richly textured' or \`multilayered' it is sure to be difficult and I The Supreme is indeed very dense and complex. Founder of the Republic, perpetual dictator, enlightened despot, cruel tyrant, the first leader of the newly independent Paraguay in 1814 known as El Supremo stirred different emotions in different people depending on their personal experiences. He continues to do so even today and Roa Bastos's colossal imaginative reconstruction of his career written in 1974 must surely be one of the definitive meditations on the nature of power, its uses and abuses and inevitable corrosive effects on both wielder(s) and recipient(s) alike. El Supremo, inflated by hubris and consumed by paranoia, rambles and rants about his benevolence and tolerance up to his final breath.

The book begins with an excellent introduction to the two institutions (BCEAO and BEAC) and an historical economic outline of the fourteen members of the CFA Franc Zone. Then it mentions a body of economic theory predicting the pre-commitment to a fixed exchange rate reducing the inflation, and presents an empirical model that allows investigating whether the exchange rate pegs is helpful in reducing the inflation (Chapter 2 CFA memberships, exchange rate pegs and inflation). Next, David Fielding compares the short run monetary adjustments in the Zone to the Anglophone Africa ones (Kenya and Tanzania). The fourth chapter deals with public debt and the strategic interaction of monetary and fiscal policies. In this chapter, by using a game-theoretic model, it is shown that CFA membership engenders greater monetary prudence in average than one can expect from countries with their own currency and central bank, and the free riding problem represents a potential inefficiency. The Fifth chapter addresses the asset demand and the monetary transmission mechanism by taking Cote d'Ivoire's cases. Chapter six tests capital market integration between CFA countries and France, whereas Chapter 7 introduces the problem of savings, investment and CFA membership and provides with time-series evidence from a comparison of Cote d'Ivoire with Kenya. Finally this book deals with CFA Franc membership and the role of relative price stability in investment performance.I highly recommend this book to graduate students and scholars in economics willing to have different empirical macroeconomic evidences of the monetary union including the former French sub-saharan colonies. This manuscript can be an excellent complement to Masson and Patillo, Semedo and Villieu, and Guillaumont's books on CFA zone. Nevertheless in his conclusion and perspectives, Fielding did not consistently mention the peg to euro and the actual appreciation of CFA Franc via Euro, and some interesting scenarios such as an independent African currency around the CFA, the development of ECOWAS and the potential separation of the two CFAs, and the possibility to move toward a less rigid peg (e.g. Target Zone and Crawling bands for CFA Franc).Leopold Engozogo Mba, Washington DC"},{"Title":"Don't Pardon My French Knowledge Cards: Understanding the French Phrases That Pop Up in English Conversation","review":"\\"Add Gallic grace notes to your vocabulary with these witty, informative Knowledge Cards!

This time she takes on fats and has written a splendidly researched, extremely thorough and highly-readable book on the virtues of good fats and the evils of hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated fats.This book is sure to ruffle a lot of feathers because is turns the so called \\"Food Pyramid\\" into rubble. This book is a top notch overview of the history of fat and how it got such a bum rap.I highly recommend this book to readers who are interested in the science of nutrition. I do wish though that there were more recipes in the book but the information presented in it more than makes up for that!"},{"Title":"The Good Fat Cookbook","review":"As much diet discussion guide as cookbook, McCullough's (\\"The Low-Carb Cookbook\\") newest presents the latest scientific thinking on fats - processed hydrogenated, versus natural animal and vegetable, saturated and unsaturated, trans fats and butter and lard and vegetable oils. And not only does she make it comprehensible, she's even witty. She talks about why Americans are fatter than ever, why it's good for us to eat things we like (as long as they're not \\"reduced-fat anything,\\" frozen dinners and processed foods). There's advice on supplements, discussions of pollution contaminants, like mercury in fish, reviews of ingredients from canned fish to dairy products and oils from avocado to safflower.Recipes - the second part of the book - offer 100 dishes, breakfast through dessert, from Coconut Waffles to Moroccan Red Pepper Soup, Smoked Trout Salad with Grapefruit and Avocado, Smoothies, Tuna Burgers and Buffalo Chili. A clear, concise, accessible and in-depth introduction to low-carb, good-fat nutrition thinking."},{"Title":"The Good Fat Cookbook","review":"As an an avid devotee of food information I wasn't sure when I received this book as a gift. But it came from a respected source, so I sat down to read in earnest. I read it with Udo's book on fats and oils next to me and checked all her claims. Wow! I threw away my canola oil and bought some coconut oil. I bought some bacon for my husband who couldn't believe it this morning when I served it to him. For a couple of years I have been narrowing down my &quot;food wisdom&quot; to two words, &quot;Pure Food&quot;. She verified my thinking.

I've always thought that there was more to it than just eating &quot;low-fat.&quot; A nutritionist at my college's health center simply handed me a copy of the old food pyramid. I was frusterated that I'd never learn the real details for myself. But I finally FOUND IT! THANK YOU Fran McCullough for knowing that not all of us are just mindless cattle!! Thank you for realizing that some of us are interested in more than just being told to &quot;eat your veggies&quot; or given a bunch of low-fat recipes! After reading this book, I feel EMPOWERED to make healthy food decisions for myself, with or without a recipe! I UNDERSTAND now what I should be putting into my body, specifically. There aren't a LOT of recipes in this book, but there are just enough to get me started. Now I have the knowledge to create my own recipes as well as the ability to decide whether the recipes in other cookbooks are really good for me or not!! There are a lot of diet cookbooks out there that have recipes that aren't really good for you, but just prey on people who want to lose weight and just want to be told what to do. Now I won't be duped ever again. This book is a MUST for every human being on earth. It's not just about being thin...it's about being HEALTHY!"},{"Title":"The Good Fat Cookbook","review":"_The Low-Carb Cookbook_ and _Living Low Carb_ are two of the most consulted works on my cookbook shelf, but _The Good Fat Cookbook_ is comparatively thin in content, and conspicuously packed with plugs for specialty health food supplements. (Yes, you could pay $70 a gallon for \\"virgin\\" coconut oil - or maybe pick it up from a warehouse club, Asian market or restaurant supply house?) The book also strays considerably from Low Carb dietary principles - which may cause some confusion for some LC'ers who have come to equate the author's nutritional works with a Low Carb philosophy. From a strictly subjective viewpoint, it's disheartening to see the author \\"move on\\" or tweak her nutritional philosophy in this direction - hight carb plus high fat reads an awful lot like \\"have your cake and eat it, too.\\" Gone or nearly gone from the author's latest here is beef, pork, and an elegant array of menus with an emphasis on a variety of popular flavors - \\"in\\" are canned, salted and smoked fishes galore (despite the mercury-in-fish issue, Omega-3 rich seafood dominates the non-vegan entrees), breakfasts that would use up a month of atkins allowances and, I'd argue, a fair number of dishes that just seem like quirky, minimalist experiments in fusion cusine. Watermelon sandwitches with goat cheese? Brocolli in Peanut Butter (sans Asian spices, even)?Also, the Usenet acronym \\"post proof or retract\\" (PPOR) was my gut response to some of the authors' health claims, especially those about irradiation. McCullough claims that since embarking on a massive national food irradiation program, that 10% of its population (yes, 10%!) now dies of liver cancer. These kind of claims demand painstaking citation, especially in the context of a book that prominently advocates a plethora of commercial health food products. (I'm just as skeptical of big health food/Peta/vegan/whatever claims as big agricorp claims, and you should be, too!)The ever shortening half-life of dietary fads and taboos make for strange bedfellows - pp 155-156 warns ominously of the potential ill effects of most soy products, and yet this book is forwraded by the same Dr. Barry Sears who made a big hit with his book _The Soy Zone_ not two years ago.In short this book veers into faddishness and product touting to a degree that just wasn't the case with the author's previous works, which I believe *remain* some of the very best nutrition-minded cookbooks out there, for those who have \\"failed on low fat\\"."},{"Title":"The Good Fat Cookbook","review":"This book is a favorite of mine.

If you look at all the mainstream paleo books today, and the Gary Taubes clones out there, they all say that lard is good and vegetable oils are bad. It's a fact that lard is better to use for fries.

It is not really a cookbook - it is more of a fact book. The recipes do not include any nutritional information - something I consider a must for anyone on a low-carb diet. The serious dieter needs to know the amount of carbs, fiber, fat, etc., for a low-carb diet to be effective. I wanted to buy her Low-Carb Cookbook, but I am hesitant to do so after reading this book."},{"Title":"The Good Fat Cookbook","review":"Never really ever dieting before in my life and wanting to lose a few pounds after my first baby, I turned to a diet program which relied on eating low carb and low fat without it being explained why these were the things that I was no longer eating except for this is what makes you fat. I constantly felt deprived from foods even if I did not want it and it was because I knew I could not have it and I ended up eating completly non-satisfying, low-fat,processed foods(with a list of ingredients twice as long asthe nutrition facts full of 10 syllable words).I think everything needs to be read with a weary eye and taken in moderation, and I say this becasue I do not believe now that I know butter is a good fat I will go out and eat it on my steak, but I will use a small amount of butter or olive oil in my cooking instead of cooking spray or Canola oil. I am not going to be a nut on absolutely cutting out everything processed (I am a working mom of a toddler on a budget), but I will significantly cut down on processed, pre-packaged, and low-fat foods and just focus on eating more 'whole' foods and incorperating healthier and more organic foods into my family's diet. I feel this book educates one about fats in general and about our low-fat obssesed dieting in this nation that is not working; the book makes you think, but I don't feel it is a guide, it is too opinionated."},{"Title":"The Good Fat Cookbook","review":"This appears to be a way for the author to justify eating the fatty foods that she likes and to ignore dietary advice provided by the American Heart Association and other medical groups. If she followed a low-fat diet and still didn't lose weight, I submit that perhaps she didn't count calories carefully enough! By the looks of the photo of her in this book, however, it doesn't look like she lost weight even after changing her eating habits. Hmmmm... Could it be that she takes in more calories than she burns, and is consequently overweight?Also, I think any diet as restrictive as the one outlined in this book is flawed and potentially dangerous, particularly when not backed up with decades of well-documented scientific evidence. I prefer to follow a sensible and moderate, medically sound approach to eating."},{"Title":"Chevrolet SS (Musclecar Color History)","review":"Excellent book with a lot of details on evolution of Chevy SS.

It presumes the reader to have mastered rudimentary composition theory and practices.It is most informative and clear to follow."},{"Title":"Poker Essays, Volume III","review":"I got this book two days ago, and have already read it twice. It came highly recommended by a winning player in my ...10/20 stud game, and I haven't been disappointed.The essays are taken from Malmuth's writings in Poker Digest and other magazines over the past few years, as with the first two volumes. I thought the first volume was excellent, and the second was very good. This is by far the best.Poker Essays III, in my opinion, now joins \\"The Theory of Poker\\", \\"Super System\\", and the \\"for Advanced Players\\" series on the list of the most important poker books.As usual, Malmuth succeeds admirably in forcing the reader to think about many aspects of their game most players are usually unaware of. He discusses, for example, specific flaws in many average players who overrate their own abilities. And the last two sections are wonderful additions to this volume: \\"Hands to Talk About\\", and then quizzes. The \\"Hands\\" section discusses specific hands/situations in depth, to try to bring together all poker ideas into making a decision. The quizzes section includes two of his own, one hold'em and one stud, and one previously published by Bob Ciaffone (whose book \\"Improve Your Poker\\" is also on my short list of great poker books). There are 50+ essays in the book, and I found all of them interesting, thought-provoking and relevant. One of the things I like best about Malmuth is that he finds topics to write about that are completely ignored or forgotten by most players but that are either directly or indirectly relevant to winning play.As with Poker Essays I and II, I'm sure I'll be rereading this book several times over the years."},{"Title":"Poker Essays, Volume III","review":"There are so many situations that arise during a session of poker that \\"It depends\\" comes up often in most poker instruction. Mason Malmuth, like all good teachers, tries to get you to think and analyze. He gives you many hands to ponder with his thoughts on each one. He admits that there are many ways to \\"skin a cat\\" and leaves himself open to the microscope but in the end he is teaching you how to look at all your options to get the most out of your play. I am an advanced player so I appreciate a little deeper thought and introspection. Learning to think and pay attention is not easy but this book will take a good player a couple of more rungs up the ladder."},{"Title":"Poker Essays, Volume III","review":"This is the third collection of Malmuth's poker essays, and like the other two is interesting to read and full of valuable information. It is also more recent that the other two volumes (see my reviews) with a copyright date of 2001. Much is the same with the quizzes on hands played, discussions of the differences between hold'em and stud, and strategy considerations in various games, and Malmuth's signature section, \\"In the Cardrooms\\" in which he writes about cardroom problems, gives suggestions, etc. Here he delves into possible collusion in the games and gives some advice on how to keep the games honest.In this respect I recently read Dirty Poker (2006) in which cheating in poker is examined at length, although by a writer (Richard Marcus) who is not a regular player. Here Malmuth with an assist from David Sklansky makes it clear that collusion in the cardrooms he plays in is unlikely and certainly couldn't last long. A good point he and Sklansky make is that it is not all that easy for two players to successfully scam a game, and more players working together would be fairly obvious to the regulars. I believe they are correct, and my experience over the years has been about the same as Malmuth's who says he has never encountered collusion in the clubs. I believe I did once, in the early nineties at a ten and twenty game at a club in the Los Angeles area. The betting pattern was not just obvious, but glaringly obvious. I got up, and before leaving and never returning, said something to the floorman. I don't know what the result was. Possible collusion on the Internet is another matter, however.Which brings me to the weakness of this book for the contemporary player, which is the dearth of writing about Internet games. I hope Malmuth is currently playing on the Internet and is writing some essays about that experience that will appear in his next collection.One of the more interesting essays is \\"Which Is Bigger?\\" (stud or hold'em). Malmuth and \\"an associate\\" compared records at the $20/$40 level and discovered to their surprise that they had a larger variance at stud. Malmuth's explanation is a bit convoluted but seems essentially right. However, his statement \\"the bigger the standard deviation, the bigger the game\\" is true only if the games are the same size. The fact that they had an hourly standard deviation of $280 for the hold'em game and $350 for the stud game is not a reflection of more action at the stud game but is a direct result of the fact that stud and hold'em games with the same betting limits are not equal in size. Because there is an extra betting round (a Big Bet betting round) the stud game is bigger. Malmuth dances around this most salient point when he should make it clear that that extra double bet round is the real difference and not because he and his associate as expert stud players have learned to play looser. (Their relatively small S.D. suggests otherwise!)The way to figure the standard deviations for comparison purposes is to adjust for the absolute size of the games, which would lower their higher figure for the stud game. If that is done, I believe it will be seen that hold'em is relatively speaking both a bigger and a chancier game.Personally I believe the expert player has more control at stud, despite the hidden river card than he does at hold'em in games with mixed talent. Quite simply seven card stud requires more skill because in addition to all the skills required at hold'em (which also exist at stud), there are the exposed cards to watch and evaluate. Malmuth has previously argued about which is tougher, stud or hold'em, and if memory serves has come to the conclusion that stud is indeed tougher.Malmuth might ask himself if he had to play against the best stud players in the world or the best hold'em players, who would he prefer to play against? For myself, even though I am probably a better stud player, I would definitely try to get lucky against the hold'em experts rather than the stud experts.One other thing. I know Malmuth was a math major but there is no excuse for a sentence like this: \\"That is only the person for whom they are intended for should have knowledge of them.\\" (p. 161) The second \\"for\\" should be \\"that,\\" I presume, but it's still ugly. Also on page 159 there is this, \\"You must be able to work successfully with your fellow dealers...and the players to whom you deal the cards to.\\" (Cut \\"the cards to\\" or at least the dangling \\"to\\" on the end.) Additionally, Malmuth habitually uses the word \\"less\\" in such constructions as \\"This not only slows down the game...but it reduces the house drop since less hands are dealt.\\" (p. 163) \\"Fewer\\" is the correct word when you're talking about things that can be counted rather than, say, weighed or measured.But these are small matters. What really counts here is the value of the book to the serious poker player, and that is considerable because Malmuth is an accomplished professional who has a deep and abiding love for the game. For many readers, because of the increase in the number of quizzes and the thorough hand discussions, this collection may be his best."},{"Title":"Seventy Faces Articles of Faith Volume 1","review":"Rabbi Lamm is one of the most profound thinkers of modern Orthodoxy .

What it does give are explanations and insights into the thinking of brain impaired persons, explanations for their behaviors, and advice on how to manage and cope with being their caregiver.These are exactly the answers I have been searching for. So many of my father's actions, reactions and behaviors are profiled in this book, and it's becoming clear that his decline had started many years ago with smaller incidents that we as his family had dismissed. The path of progression can be tracked, and even predicted. It will be helpful to know what's coming next and be prepared. But most important to me is the understanding of why. Being able to understand the why of his behavior helps me a great deal in being able to let go of the anger and to cope better with the situation that has recently escalated to horrific.In trying to manage the situation I have started taking anti-anxiety meds, as well as antidepressants and high blood pressure med. I have done all that I can to make changes within myself, yet things have gotten progressively worse.

Morse: Inventor and Code Creator (Spirit of America: Our People)","review":"The story of Samuel Finley Breese Morse explains how a promising tramp painter, who did portraits of John Adams, James Monroe, and the Marquis de Lafayette, became the inventor of the telegraph. Young readers will learn from this juvenile biography by Judy Alter for the Our People series that the catalyst for this unusual transformation was a combination of tragedy and fortune. The former was the death of Morse's wife, which led him to live in Europe for several years, and the later was a conversation he overheard on the boat returning to the United States about electricity traveling in an instant over electric wire of any length. From that idea Morse eventually created the code that bears his name and the invention that made him immortal.What is most fascinating about this juvenile biography is that Alter gives a view of both Morse the struggling artist and Morse the struggling inventor. Think about it: besides Leonard Da Vinci, how many people have ever achieved some modicum of success in both the arts and sciences? The books in this series usually have informative sidebars in each chapter, and Alter provides one that tells the story of how the great American painte Benjamin West taught the young Morse how to draw. This contrasts nicely with the last two chapters of the book, which covers not only the series of steps by which the telegraph was invented but also what Morse had to go through to sell his invention to the government and the public.Clearly Thomas Alva Edison is the most important inventor in American history, and while you can certainly come up with other scientist who created more important things than the telegraph (unless you consider Morse is the father of electronic mass communication), you will be hard pressed to come up with an more interesting biography than that of Samuel F. B. Morse. The volume is illustrated with several of Morse's paintings, although neither the &quot;Dying Hercules&quot; or &quot;The House of Representatives&quot; are depicted (the first represents the art lesson alluded to above and the second is probably his most famous work). There are also some photographs of some early electromagnetic devices. Alter makes it clear that Morse was not the only one to work on the telegraph, but he was the first to get it to work and the telegraphic code that bears his name was clearly his own invention."},{"Title":"Tiny the Bee","review":"This darling story just thrills my pre-schoolers every time we read it!

Van de Ven and his co-authors, quite an innovative crew, have crafted a thorough academic model of the corporate innovation process. The authors use a river rafting trip analogy for the innovation journey, where uncharted, challenging territory demands leadership and cooperation. The river metaphor is good to keep in mind here, because the subject matter gets a little dry. The team found that common factors exist in every quest for innovation, and constructed a cohesive model for innovators. The material - resulting from 17 years of research at the University of Minnesota's Minnesota Innovation Research Foundation (MIRP) - is truly exhaustive, detailed and academic. Because of this, a reader with no background in innovation theory might find it somewhat arcane. We [...] recommend this book to anyone who wants to understand the complex process of corporate innovation."},{"Title":"The Innovation Journey","review":"Andrew H. Van de Ven and his co-authors published probably the best book out there on the Innovation 'process'. It has been based on real business cases that have been 'generalized' with thorough academic rigour (which most of the books on the subject lack of). To top it off, it is written with great simplicity which just shows the level of understanding the authors have on the subject.

Since I'm blessed with the gift of forgetting plots, stories, characters and such, I could read those books featuring Arsene Lupin as many times as I wanted, and I always enjoyed them as if I was reading them for the first time.Leblanc was able to create the most spectacular character of all time. Better than Sherlock Holmes, better than Hercule Poirot, Auguste Dupin, better than anything I have ever read till today (I'm 25 now).Lupin is, to say little, complex. He is capable of loving and hating with the same passion. He can hate a friend and he can love an enemy with all his heart. Leblanc thought him as a Robin Hood of his time. Possessing a fine eye for art, books, women and deciphering secrets, Lupin has lived many lifes as different people, each one better than the other. In his bboks, Leblanc created the plots using parts of french history, including treasures, landscape, hidden tunnels, immortal characters, wars, etc.This collection of short stories is just an introduction to the wonderful world of Arsene Lupin and to his world. There are many books featuring Lupin, and in my opinion the best are, in order:813; The hollow needle; Crystal Stopper; Teeth of the tiger; The Comtesse de Cagliostro; The eight strokes of the clock; The Eunerville Secret. All these books are wonderful adventures, and should be re-edited in english as soon as possible.Grade 9.5/10"},{"Title":"Arsene Lupin","review":"Arsene Lupin, for those of you who don't know him, is a Gentleman Burgler. He robs from only the extremely wealthy, and usually, the most corrupt people who deserve it. His methods are playfull, and he will often send a letter to the police, the victims, and newspapers before he committs a crime to give them forwarning, which in turn makes his robberies even more daring and unique. Lupin has it all!This book deals with a tale about a Duke who is just returning from an Antartica Adventure only to find that his best friends house is about to be robbed by Lupin (and has in the past). Once the ball gets rolling, every new fact and clue twists the plot and changes the motives. How does Lupin do it? You'll Just have to find out.This is a great series by Maurice Leblanc. I would recomend reading \\"Homelock Shears vs Arsene Lupin\\" and \\"The Crystal Stopper\\" before this, just to get to know Lupin better."},{"Title":"Arsene Lupin","review":"Having read both Chinese and English versions of this book, I'd first establish that the English translation has a much better woven plot and greater tension between the characters. No doubt, we all know that Arsene Lupin is one extremely charming gentleman burglar, with a soft spot for women (esp. beautiful women). What made this reading so enjoyable (perhaps it's because I'm overtly sentimental and like romantic novels) is partly because of the romantic 'subplot' involving Sonia and Arsene Lupin.Of course, I personally think that this is not really typical of Maurice Leblanc himself to write such a mushy lovey-dovey subplot and I wonder if Edgar Jepson co-wrote this book with him, or only after Leblanc had passed away. (Then again, it doesn't matter, since I did like the mushy bits anyway. They were absolutely hilarious!) Other Lupin books that I've read were certainly more capable of creating essential suspense, for e.g. The Extraordinary Adventures of Arsene Lupin, Gentleman Burglar (N.B. This book might have been revised and edited from Arsene Lupin, Gentleman Burglar. I'm not too sure, because this was written by the mystery writing team, Boileau-Narcejac.)I do agree that the pace of the novel is a little slow, but perhaps it feels slow because it requires length to be able to reveal the full implications of certain details which is necessary to create suspense and tension. Characters might have been made to look diabolically extreme, in that Arsene Lupin always seems to be the good guy, and poor Guerchard takes on the baddie's role. However, one has to read the other Lupin works to understand how intelligent our dear Lupin is, and certainly much cleverer than the average detective.I did thoroughly enjoy this book, but I have to give it only 4 out of 5 stars because I found it rather fairy-tale like, not quite characteristic of other Leblanc works which I truly adore and would rank them above Dolye's Sherlock Holmes."},{"Title":"Arsene Lupin","review":"When French entrepreneur M. Gournay-Martin receives a note from master thief, Arsene Lupin, stating Lupin's intent to rob Gournay-Martin blind, Gournay-Martin's future son-in-law, the Duke of Charmerace, gladly swings into action. But as the police are called in, and one detective grows more and more obsessed with Lupin, it soon becomes clear that there is a collision on the horizon, all orchestrated by the unseen \\"Arsene Lupin\\".Maurice LeBlanc's Arsene Lupin is a French opposite of Sherlock Holmes, a brilliant, resourceful thief who delights in outwitting everyone. Unlike other gentleman thieves, e.g. A.J. Raffles, Lupin seems a little more sinister, even evil, at times.This is the first Lupin book I have read. It is, in fact, the novelization of a play by Edgar Jepson, hence the fairly generic title. It also explains the rather turgid plot structure of the novel, as the story begins in Gournay-Martin's country estate, shifts to his Paris house for about 80% of the novel, and finishes in Lupin's hideout. Consequently, there isn't much action, beyond the various police investigations and clue finding by master detective Guerchard. Events that would have livened up the book's tone, including a foot-chase through the streets of Paris, are described by the characters after they have occurred. Thus, the book is carried by some spritely, if not always brilliant, dialogue, eccentricities of the characters, and a certain mystery: which of the characters is really Lupin, master of disguise? (It's pretty obvious, but I won't spoil it.) So, all in all, this is really not the best place to start reading Lupin, as I did. I do want to read more, but I'm not in any hurry.On the more technical matters, the translation does seem pretty good given Wildside Press is not an A-list publishing house. LeBlanc seems to have a feel for use of language, and the translation here brings that out quite nicely. Certainly setting and character descriptions are lush (again, rather like a play). I know that Wildside has been taken to task for excessive typos, and there are a few of those, though not any more than you might find from any other publisher.Another \\"drawback\\" from this small publishing house is the lack of any sort of editorial material. There is no intoduction setting the context for this book, nor are there any footnotes, etc. I think books like this benefit tremendously by such material, and it was rather missed.All in all, this is a likable book, if not terribly gripping. My interest in Lupin is whetted, but not so much that I need to read the rest of the series right this instant."},{"Title":"Arsene Lupin","review":"I first found out about the Lupin stories from the anime, Rupan Sansei (Lupin the third). After obtaining one of the books from my local library I can see how they inspired Monkey Punch's manga.Arsene Lupin is a dashing character indeed. Though a burglar, he is a gentlemen with great cunning and a suave personality. I laughed at how he outsmarts Inspector Ganimard in the stories (in a way it reminds of of Lupin III and Inspector Zenigata). Lupin is a gentlemen and master of diguise with many aliases and appearances. He could be an architect, a begger, a fisherman, etc. Some people have even dubbed Arsene Lupin the 'Sherlock Holmes' of thieves.If you love Lupin the Third or detective stories you are in for a treat.

It starts at the collector's house where his very unlikable daughter is tormenting her secretary, Sonia. We also meet the daughter's fiancee, a famous Duke.I will agree with others that the pacing is slow, but this isn't an adventure story, it's a psychological mystery as Lupin is slowly revealed to the reader. Lupin is an interesting character, but I do agree that I'm not possessed to go out immediately and grab all of the stories. A nice character, but the greatest ever, I don't see. I do like Sonia quite a bit, and hope she shows up again.I find it interesting that the author had to have his Sherlock Holmes rip off character. Seems to imply he wasn't too comfortable with the strength of Lupin. Nice writing style. The humor of the Duke is very good."},{"Title":"Arsene Lupin","review":"I'd heard of Arsene Lupin in a few places: the anime, mentioned in other books.

I wasnt prepared for how hilarious the characters were going to be! Highly recommend to fans of Holmes, Poirot, and Marple. Now I am off to read the next in the series!"},{"Title":"Forensic Casebook of Crime (True Crime Library)","review":"No one has the knack of explaining forensic pathology cases quite like the Brits, and John Sanders is no exception. One of the things I particularly enjoyed about the \\"Forensic Casebook of Crime\\" was his inclusion of cases by other favorite authors, Sir Sidney Smith (\\"Mostly Murder\\") and Dr. Keith Simpson (\\"Forty Years of Murder\\") who themselves were highly respected forensic pathologists in early and mid-20th century Britain. I highly recommend their books, as Sir Sidney and Dr. Simpson were the original investigators for many of Great Britain's most shocking crimes.The first edition of \\"Forensic Casebook of Crime\\" was published in 2000, so John Sanders not only had the advantage of being able to pick and choose among Sir Sidney and Dr. Simpson's cases, he is also able to write about many of the great advances in forensic technology toward the end of the 20th Century, including what he calls \\"DNA--The New Wonder Detection Kit.\\"DNA testing was first used to convict a criminal was a 1987 burglary/rape, but the most famous use of DNA was its starring role in the capture of serial murderer-rapist, Colin Pitchfork. Not only did the new technology convict the killer of Linda Mann and Dawn Ashworth, it also freed the suspect who had already been arrested by the police.Sanders doesn't spend much print on each of the various crimes that he has chosen to illustrate different forensic techniques, but he highlights the essential details. His book is a good mix of the famous and obscure successes of forensic pathologists, including a few stories where no crime was even involved. His lead story, \\"The Corpse That Cried\\" recounts the story of the woman who was certified as dead by the police doctor, but when the pathologist, Dr. Benstead arrived on the scene (a cold stretch of beach) an hour later, he was definitely puzzled. \\"Of the three cardinal signs of death, algor (cooling), rigor (stiffening) and livor (staining) he could see only algor.\\" Nevertheless he had her taken to the morgue, and as he was examining the corpse, he saw \\"a tiny tear trickle out of one of its eyes and roll down its cheek.\\"The woman was rushed to the hospital and revived from her deep hypothermia and the overdose of barbiturates that she had taken, and thus became one of the very few 'patients' seen by a pathologist who lived to tell her tale.\\"Forensic Casebook of Crime\\" is pithy and interesting, and I would definitely recommend it as a supplement to the classics, \\"Forty Years of Murder\\" and \\"Mostly Murder.\\""},{"Title":"Espaa: Ida y Vuelta","review":"Si quieres aprender a espanol, este libro es bueno.

I think this book will appeal to readers interested in historical Chinatown and to anyone who has ever wondered what was behind the doors next to the souvenir shops. For some this book will be a trip down memory lane, for others it will give them a glimpse of life in an ethnic ghetto, a look at life behind the tourist area. This book is a fascinating memoir, told from personal experience. Few books about Chinatown have been written by the people who actually lived there.

Yet, even if you hate having to step from your rangerover to Starbucks on rainy days, I guarantee you'll find this book a pleasure. Each chapter is preceeded by truly wise, often obscure, quotes that'll get our ancestors whispering in our ears excitedly... the atavistic knife edged call for consideration is impossible to miss; I stumbled upon the fact that this book goes very well with almost any archeological reading; try reading about Scythian tombs, or Acadian farming techniques at the same time as this....there is something about the way the nearings write that inspires appreciation of the obscure- and important things in life.

I cannot even begin to describe the author's inability to grasp even basic mechanisms of the English language. It's like someone just barfed words onto a page.I initially picked up this book because the publishers were sponsoring an essay competition. In ordinary circumstances, I would not have bet on an independently published book without recommendation because they usually turn out to be a waste of time. This book further reinforced that stereotype for me.First, the premise. Everything in this book is rip off from either Thoreau or a [spoiler alert] Slavic fable about a woman dying in childbirth. And it's not even a decent rip off, like Eragon. Despite what other reviewers have said, the book is not based on Roddy's wife, because Roddy's wife is not dead.Apparently, she's a horrible editor, though, because you can expect to find at least one typo on every single page. By page 5, I was pretty iffy about Roddy's purported graduation from grade school and English fluency, but, if you're a horrible writer, at least get decent editors. Who are at the very least expected to correct your gross fallacies in both spelling and grammar.Thematically, I am unsure this book even has a point. After suffering through 80-ish pages of pointless emo ranting that would put Holden Caulfield to shame (clearly had nothing better to do with my life at the time), I can only confirm my initial suspicions that the entire thing is simply self-absorbed garbage and murder of trees for no reason whatsoever.

For those unfortunate few who ended up on this page, trust me when I say you probably don't want to read this book."},{"Title":"The Bloodied Ivy: A Nero Wolfe Mystery","review":"Hale Markham, a 73-year-old right-wing conservative in a left-leaning political science department, was a big fish in the pond of Prescott University - a small school with Ivy League pretensions. Upon hearing of Markham's fatal fall into a ravine, and having read his book _Bleeding Hearts Can Kill_, Wolfe observes, \\"The man was a political Neanderthal. He would have been supremely happy in the court of Louis XIV.\\" The professor's name would never have been uttered in the brownstone again, except that Markham's executor and colleague, Walter Willis Cortland, manages to talk Archie into granting an audience - he believes Markham was murdered. (He has enough family money to afford the fee, although his wages as a professor wouldn't cover it.)Markham, despite his age, was very sure-footed; he'd even climbed in the Alps. He was widowed, after a happy marriage Cortland envied, and a thorn in the flesh of many. His celebrity eclipsed that of the university's president, Keith Potter, let alone Orville Schmidt, his department chair. Worse - Leander Bach wouldn't donate any of his fortune to the university while Markham was there. Satirizing Schmidt's last book in one of his own papers didn't help either. Markham also had a reputation as a ladies' man, although digging out suspects in that area takes more work. Motive is cheap - including Cortland's, although his is to smear academic rivals with suspicion, rather than murder itself. He has no proof that the death wasn't an accident.Cortland's inaugural visit to the brownstone soaks up 3 of 24 chapters. He speaks to show off his vocabulary rather than to communicate, in a *very* unrealistic manner, and fidgets far too much. (The character has been designed to annoy, giving Wolfe an opportunity for wit at his expense later on, and succeeds all too well.) Archie persuades Wolfe to meet with Cortland, and even goes so far as to drive to Prescott on his own time to check whether Cortland's on the level. (It's out of Cramer's jurisdiction, and isn't even in Westchester, so the police characters involved are new.)Archie's first visit isn't a total loss. Gretchen Frazier, shining star of the political science graduate students, is very easy on the eyes - and was a devotee of Markham. (In real life, Cortland wouldn't be so casual about implying that she flirted with her thesis advisor as he is herein.) Archie's attempt at a low-profile reconnaissance isn't entirely successful. Elena Moreau, history professor and possible inamorata of the deceased, knows him by sight; she says the deceased was subject to occasional fainting spells. But Archie's examination of the scene leads him to confirm Cortland's suspicions - see if you can figure out why, before Archie reports back to Wolfe. Wolfe holds back from committing himself, however - until the Prescott cops arrest Archie during his search of Markham's house. :)As always, the brownstone is in the world contemporary with the time of its writing, although not completely of it. Archie has persuaded Wolfe to replace the old typewriter with a PC and dot matrix printer, which from this point on in Goldsborough's books receives some play as another tool in Archie's kit. (Wolfe won't touch it, of course).In sum: an entertaining story, if one can stay the course past the initial interview with Wolfe's client."},{"Title":"The Bloodied Ivy: A Nero Wolfe Mystery","review":"The characterizations in this novel are rather good. The plot is not as strong as those in the Rex Stout Archie Goodwin books, but it is better than the average mystery. If you find one, buy it, but don't take extraordinary measures."},{"Title":"The Bloodied Ivy: A Nero Wolfe Mystery","review":"A professor from a prestigious university asks Nero and Archie to invesitgate the death of his colleague and friend. The offical verdict of death by accident did not satisfy him. Archie, if not Nero, agrees with him and agrees to look into the matter. The investigation leads Archie to the picturesque campus, the in fighting of the faculty lounge, and the local jail. Wolfe is goaded into leaving the brownstone and undertaking the perils of the open road - without Archie at the wheel! Ultimately the truth comes out and order returns to Wolfe's life.While this is a Nero Wolfe mystery it was not written by Rex Stout but rather by Robert Goldsborough who was authorized by the Stout estate to continue the series. Goldsborough does an excellent job of carrying on the legacy. The basic premises are all respected, the order life at the brownstone, the banter between Archie and Wolfe, the relationships between the series regulars all are consistent with the earlier works, as the practice of keeping the duo contemporary - in this case the late 1980's. The mystery is challenging, the clues fairly laid out and the interplay among Wolfe, Archie and the suspects is entertaining.All in all this is a worthy addition to the canon of Stout's works."},{"Title":"The Bloodied Ivy: A Nero Wolfe Mystery","review":"A rather simplistic mystery from Goldsborough, who attempted to continue the Nero Wolfe series.

Rebecca tells about her home life in Brewster NY. Her father insisted on honesty and paying his bills on time. He loved writing his \\"Nero Wolfe\\" novels. Robert Goldsborough is a longtime fan and executive editor of a magazine. He continues to write \\"Nero Wolfe\\" novels while living in Chicago.Chapter 1 begins with the discussion of the accidental death of Professor Hale Markham, a reactionary author. Weeks later Walter Cortland says Markham was murdered! But he local police weren't interested due to a lack of evidence. Cortland can pay for Nero Wolfe's services. Cortland tells Wolfe about the politics and personalities at Prescott University. Jealousy over book sales was a factor (Chapter 3). Archie Goodwin volunteered to investigate on his own (Chapter 4). Archie visits Prescott University (Chapters 5, 6). One professor recognizes him and deduces his mission (Chapter 7). Archie gives his report (Chapter 8). A luxury automobile in an upstate village draws unwanted attention (Chapter 9). Wolfe visits Prescott too (Chapter 10). Was Markham in perfect health (Chapter 11)? Wolfe meets with three professors and discusses Markham's accident (Chapter 12).The next morning Wolfe talks to President Potter of Prescott University (Chapter 13). Markham's death was followed by a large donation to the school. There was a possible conflict with another professor over a book. Wolfe and Archie returned home (Chapter 16). Leander Bach and his assistant will visit Wolfe's home. [The description of Markham's computer dates this story.] Archie searches the files on Markham's floppy disks. Bach and Wolfe converse (Chapter 17). There is news of another body found where Markham's was found! Does the list of borrowed books hold a clue (Chapter 18)? Wolfe invites all the people to a meeting, including Inspector Cramer (Chapter 19). The guests arrive for the big meeting (Chapter 20). Wolfe discusses the events and tells who killed Miss Frazier (Chapter 21)! He then who killed Markham (Chapter 22). Is there any written proof? The last chapters have the rest of the story.The grand finale where the suspects meet in a group so the detective can solve the crime is an old-fashioned technique, but still used at times. Rex Stout's detective who lives to eat and avoids normal exercise is not a recipe for a healthy life. Stout experienced the various economic depressions since the 1890s and war-time rationing. His emphasis on food and eating is comparable to James Bond's romantic adventures in another era. The location of \\"Prescott University\\" on the west bank of the Hudson River 75 miles north of New York city suggests New Paltz. Did Rebecca attend that university?

Many of these poems have appeared in Arabic in a book with the same title (In Arabic, *Al-harb taamal bijidd*) published by Al-Mada P.C., Damascus, Syria. The translation into English by Elizabeth Winslow is excellent and conveys a lot of the simplicity and force of the original poems.What I admire most in Dunya Mikhail's poetry is her ability to take simple words and turn them into beautiful poems that, alternately, delight, move, surprise, and even baffle her readers. This simplicity of words is more apparent in Arabic than in English. Typical of her poetry and its unexpected effect on the reader is \\"The Jewel,\\" a poem in which she compares the collapse of a bridge during the 1991 American bombing of Baghdad to the dropping of a jewel by the lady on the Titanic. \\"It no longer stretches across the river. / It is not in the city, / not on the map. / The bridge that was . . . / The bridge that we were . . . /The Pontoon bridge / we crossed every day . . . / Dropped by the war into the river / just like the blue jewel / that lady dropped / off the side of the Titanic.\\"In another poem she writes, \\"Yesterday I lost a country. / I was in a hurry, / and didn't notice when it fell from me / like a broken branch from a forgetful tree. / Please, if anyone passes by / and stumbles across it, / perhaps in a suitcase / open to the sky, / or engraved on a rock / like a gaping wound, / ... / If anyone stumbles across it, / return it to me please. / Please return it, sir. / Please return it, madam. / It is my country . . . / I was in a hurry / when I lost it yesterday.\\"Professor Pierre Joris described Mikhail's work as \\"a poetry of urgency that has no time for the traditional (in Arab[ic] poetry) flowers of rhetoric; ... [Her] lines move at the speed of events--be it war or love.\\"No matter what the subject is, Dunya Mikhail's poetry is always authentic and moving.Fawzi M. YaqubFredonia, NY"},{"Title":"The War Works Hard","review":"Regardless of your politics, these poetics are just outstanding. As a fairly macho guy not given to over emotionalism, I can say that one piece in this collection nearly brought me to tears.

Buy copies for your friends."},{"Title":"The War Works Hard","review":"Mikhail's books in an incredible collection of poetry. Her focus is mainly on the ideas of love and war and she addresses each wonderfully. The scope covers poetry written in and about her native Iraq as well as poems written here in the United States.The title poem, 'The War Works Hard' is one of the most moving and poignant poems ever written about war."},{"Title":"The War Works Hard","review":"The war works hardby Robert Philbin[ bookreviews ]\\"We'd all be human, if we could.\\" Bertolt BrechtA journalist covering the Iraq war commented on a late night talk show last night that America's situation in Iraq is hopeless because by now, he said, he doesn't know of a single Iraqi family who has not suffered some tragedy or horror as a result of the US invasion. We have lost something, he commented, in that transition from being \\"liberators\\" to becoming \\"occupiers\\", and we may never get it back. I don't doubt his insight about the widespread misery, just look at the Iraqi civilian casualty estimates - many as high as hundreds of thousands - but I question that more than a few of us understand what the reporter means by the mass personification of war, or the blame the Iraqi people harbor toward the US government as a result.Very few of us know anything about what war does to perfectly innocent people trapped in its awful geometry. Civilians are always innocent bystanders, and always the most meaningful targets. They are all hearts and minds. The purpose of the bombing of the village of Guernica in northern Spain in 1937 was to undermine the morale of the Basque civilians and their insurgency against Franco. The purpose of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the summer of 1945 was to \\"break the will of the Japanese people\\" and to \\"save American lives\\".In Vietnam \\"pacification\\" meant winning hearts and minds by bulldozing villages and moving populations into distant refugee camps. (Abraham Lincoln understood the impact of a burning cornfield on the civilian populace in the South during the American Civil War.) We experienced what it feels like to suffer war on the home front on September 11, 2001. But many of us still remain immune to government propaganda and a visual history of war, against the daily photographs and reports that bring news of more innocent deaths in Iraq. We may have been safely inoculated against the pain of the innocent by the weight of decades the US has spent at war in our lifetime, and always, it seems, among the poorest and weakest peoples on the earth.Since Homer first mythologized the fall of Troy, thirty centuries ago, poetry and war have been fused in an unholy alliance producing both the propaganda of heroics, and the chilling reality of mass murder. Poets sometimes make the best journalists because only they can approximate a special kind of truth that shapes a state of mind a reader can absorb viscerally, as soon as he or she encounters it:What good luck!She has found his bones.The skull is also in the bagthe bag in her handlike all other bagsin all other trembling hands.His bones, like thousands of bonesin the mass graveyard,his skull, not like any other skull.Two eyes or holeswith which he saw too much. [1]I read these lines knowing nothing of the language or traditions of Iraqi poetry, but, after all, what does one need to know? Where else but Iraq could this bleak discovery have occurred? How could anyone rejoice at the good luck of finding a brother, husband or father's remains in a bag of bones?Iraqi poet Dunya Mikhail connects any reader to the love of that lucky Iraqi woman clinging to her bag of bones. And when she does, all the propaganda of politics and lies disappear. Poetry raises questions as well as it raises the dead: How monstrous was that dictatorship? Why did we ever support it? Why did we not take it down in Desert Storm? Why did we not support the uprising later? Why do we still make war among a people exhausted by killing, adding only to their bone yards? What are we doing in Iraq?Poetry translated from another culture has the magical power of carrying the reader to the human heart of that culture. This is possible because the artist, the poet, is an alien in any culture, both apart of, and apart from its mores. In another Mikhail poem:The war continues working, day and night.It inspires tyrantsto deliver long speechesawards medals to generalsand themes to poetsit contributes to the industryof artificial limbsprovides food for fliesadds pages to the history booksachieves equalitybetween killer and killed.In the world where The War Works Hard, death is the great equalizer in a landscape of artificial limbs. The poet is the outsider and her poetry brings down the flimsy barriers of time, space, and circumstance. What remains is the human being, no different than any other human being. Foreign poetry makes the foreign universal, and this is the unique power of Ms. Mikhail. Unlike the returning combat veteran poet, she documents and laments the loss of human love in a culture so brutalized that humanity itself may become only a memory:Graves were scattered with mandrake seeds.A bleating sound entered the assembly.Gardens remained hanging.Straw was scattered with the words.No fruit is left.Born in Iraq in 1965, \\"her imagination saturated with uprootedness and endless war,\\" Ms Mikhail worked as Literary Editor of The Baghdad Observer until threats and harassment from Bath authorities forced her to flee Iraq in the late 1990s. In 2001 she was awarded the UN Human Rights Award for Freedom of Writing and has published four collections of poetry in Arabic (an Iraqi Christian, she speaks and writes in Arabic, Aramaic and English).Mikhail, whose work has been compared to the reclusive and brilliant Emily Dickinson, currently lives and teaches in Michigan. The War Works Hard, her latest book was shortlisted for the Griffin Poetry Prize last year, and includes earlier works written before her exile. She says \\"most of my writings serve as documents of witness; they document what I saw. \\" As in a few lines from her poem, 'The Jewel', about the bombing of the main bridge in Baghdad,It no longer overlooks the riverNo longer is in the cityNo longer on the mapThe bridge that wasThe bridge that we used to cross every dayThe bridgeThe war tossed it into the riverJust as that lady aboard the TitanicTossed her blue diamondIn a recent interview, Mikhail discussed the liberating experience of adjusting to thinking and writing in a culture that respects free speech above propaganda:\\"In Iraq, there are no editors because they have censors. They don't care about the quality, they care about the ideology, and that is how they use their editing scissors. There, they are watching every work and they can put you in prison--they care that much! Here, you can write whatever you want but no one cares? It is very ironic. I noticed a change in my writing when I came here: I didn't need to use symbols anymore. My language and my poems became more direct. I do not know if not using symbols has made my writing more powerful or less powerful but I wanted to peel away some of those masks and shields that burdened me.\\" [2]She writes about memory and war and healing directly in the poem 'America':Please don't ask me, AmericaI don't rememberon which streetwith whomor under which starDon't ask meI don't rememberthe colours of the peopleor their signaturesI don't remember if they hadour facesand our dreamsif they were singingor notwriting from the left or rightor not writing at allsleeping in houseson sidewalksor in airportsmaking love or not making lovePlease don't ask me, AmericaI don't remember their names.The War Works Hard is an important and informative document because it communicates the experiences of war directly from the perspective of its most silent victims.Notes1 All poetry by Dunya Mikhail, translated by Elizabeth Winslow, from The War Works Hard.

I just finished reading SWAN PLACE, which I also enjoyed, but this third novel I had a little trouble liking as much. In RIVER JORDAN, there are several stories going on at once, with various central characters. The focus therefore isn't on one main plot line, but on several.The book opens in jail, with Pansy, a black woman, waiting for her parole hearing when she sees a vision of Jesus coming to her. After this experience, she embraces Jesus as her savior.In the meantime, Peony, Pansy's sister, is employed by Miss Alice and Mr. Franklin, who are trying to figure out how to deal with an elderly mother that needs to find a home. White Columns, the home where Miss Amy Lee is currently residing, is about to be closed down permanently. Peony thinks that a good idea is to have her sister Pansy, who may be getting out of jail soon, help take care of the elderly woman, Mr. Franklin's mother. Peony thinks that if Pansy can get out of jail, she would be the perfect person to help care for the elderly Mrs. Franklin (Miss Amy Lee).Jordan, Miss Alice's daughter from a previous marriage, is very unhappy with her mother's new marriage. Mr. Franklin shows no patience for this young shy girl, and Jordan is miserable. She can't seem to do anything right where he's concerned, so she often spends her time away from home. The only person besides her mother she feels she loves is Miss Amy Lee, who she knows is coming home soon.When Pansy gets out of jail, a lot of lives are impacted by her arrival at her new home. She immediately bonds with her new employer, Miss Amy Lee, who in turn \\"wakes up\\" and becomes her lively old self again, the person that Jordan grew to love before she was sent to White Columns. The three of them end up on a great adventure, involving yet another character, Gertie, who is a teenager with such a horrible disposition that I hated this character after getting to know her! Gertie has run off with a new beau, and Pansy takes Miss Amy Lee and Jordan with her to find the missing girl.There are other various characters in the book that readers will enjoy reading about, including a simpleton named Honey Boy, who is beloved by all in the town and thinks that every day is Christmas Eve.While I'm not giving this book an enthusiastic recommendation, I still found it enjoyable for its story lines and the interesting characters introduced by Trobaugh. Those who enjoy Southern Lit may enjoy this book, but fans of Trobaugh may agree that this is not her best effort. Still, it is worth reading, and I'm giving this book a 3 star rating."},{"Title":"River Jordan","review":"There is a richness about this plot and the people who inhabit it.

Folks, the novel is not only juicy but also gives light in what a United States senator's private duties are. This novel is not just fun to read but she actually injects the hideaways in the Capitol for the senators and the cool inside stuff about the dilemmas that senators go through. There is corruption, there are some politics in this novel but remember this was fun! This is a rare gem that was years in the making and probably close to this senator's heart!I met her at the book signing and she was gracious enough to sign the book to me, take pictures with me and also leave a special friend of mine a personal message from my cell phone. This woman has a lot of courage, is ambitious, is clearly a genius and deserves excellent recognition for fer effort!I say bravo, Ms. Boxer! Not only are you a fine writer but a fine woman in general.[...]"},{"Title":"A Time to Run: A Novel","review":"I'm a big fan of Senator Barbara Boxer: the woman doesn't hold back, whether she's scolding energy corporations for bilking California out of millions of dollars, or relentlessly confronting candidates to the Supreme Court. So it was with great curiosity that I opened up her novel, A TIME TO RUN.At first I stumbled a bit over the awkward writing, but after some fifty pages or so the story becomes so compelling that the lack of literary polish fades into the background. In this sense A TIME TO RUN reminded me a bit of Marge Piercy's earlier work: no matter how clumsy the prose, it's the subject matter, the STUFF,that makes every word, every page, worth reading. I know of no other book that, like this one, so vividly portratys the real lives of our representatives in Washington.Boxer approaches the subject of fictionalizing Washington politics with the same no-holds-barred attitude she employs as a conscious and moral representative of her constituents. She paints a realistic picture of what it's like to be a Senator, particularly of the female gender, and lets her readers in on the back-room deals and media machinations that contribute to the sleaze of today's governmental processes.How much of this novel's heroine, Ellen Fischer, is Boxer's alter ego? It's impossible to know for sure, but Fischer consistently rises above the sleaze, and if just a smidgeon of Ellen Fischer's character is drawn from Ms. Boxer, we've got a friend indeed in Washington. Kudos for the Senator from California."},{"Title":"A Time to Run: A Novel","review":"This is a fun book. It is not fact, but a play on the reality of the senate.

I imagine that it was, in part, autobiographical. I admit that I read the book over a 3 day period and it was hard to put down. But, in all honesty, it was populist-liberal-feminist melodrama. You've heard of \\"chick-flics\\"? This was \\"chic-lit\\" for progressive feminist intellectuals. All of the male characters were weak, (though one was ok) and all of the &lt;strong>male &lt;/strong>conservatives were unethical, heartless people of low moral character. The conservative &lt;strong>females&lt;/strong> had redeeming traits.Nevertheless, I found it interesting that the National Review (conservative magazine) \\"review\\" of the book focused mostly on the sex scenes. I have to admit that I found some of these to be amusing. The horse sex scene was an obvious metaphor for rape and for the oppression and objectification of women. The \\"knee cap\\" reference I didn't quite get. The others, I did. Imagine that distinguished Senator knowing about sex!My favorite sexual reference (way milder than the others) came from page 64 where the future Senator Ellen Fischer was hiking with her husband (and future congressman) Josh in the front and present friend and future political adversary (conservative pundit) Greg Hunter, trailing behind: \\" Ellen came next, wearing a yellow t-shirt and Levi cutt-offs, her back ramrod straight and her freckled calves surprisingly muscular; Greg brought up the rear, happy to watch the lithe swing of her bottom and the sturdy pumping of her legs.\\"In that respect, Senator Boxer knows guys, though I wish it hadn't been the villain checking out the future senator's butt.Basically, the story is centered around Ellen Fischer, whose husband, Josh Fischer, died during his run for the seat of the rich, unethical conservative incumbent senator. Josh was giving up his seat in the House to run for the Senate seat. Fischer won the race and was in her first term, when the contentious nomination of a ultraconservative Supreme Court nominee (a Latina female from her home state and who was the dean of the law school from her alma-mater) came up. An ethical dilemma came up, and the book centers around the background surrounding this particular dilemma.As far as the writing goes: the authors point of view comes across very strongly; it smacks you right over the head. In short, the book is really a liberal \\"talking point\\" piece that makes few demands on the reader and doesn't set up the reader to come to their own conclusion.A plea to Senator Boxer: \\"hey, how about a little more subtlety next time! This isn't campaign literature!\\"Nevertheless, it is a fun read, and I can recommend it to progressives and fans of Senator Boxer."},{"Title":"A Time to Run: A Novel","review":"I was a bit surprised at how much I ended up liking this book.

In fact, I put the book down.I'm glad, however, that I picked it up again. The closer it got to the Senatorial election, the more that went down (especially in the last few pages) in the halls of the Capitol, the more I liked the book.Therefore, I recommend the book without reservation, but just caution you to be patient with the beginning.

Boxer is not idealistic about politics in this book, she portrays reality. She uses her fictional characters to show that politics is very far from being fair or perfect. Eventhough I already knew what the political arena is like most of the time, she helped remind me that it is not always as bad. She uses Ellen, her main character to show that anyone can succeed in politics with motivation, hard work, and a genuine concern for the welfare of others. Whether you believe that there are politicians that are as kind-hearted as Ellen is, Boxer paints a great picture of the ideal politician. Ellen is a great character in the book, someone that most women would aspire to be. Although this book may not be for everyone, I would suggest that you give it a chance. I really liked it.

All the conservatives are greedy, corrupt, and yes, even evil. An intelligent, accomplished, and conservative Supreme Court nominee is implausibly naive. The story is melodramatic; the characters are two-dimensional. I had high hopes of gleaning genuine political savvy from \\"someone who really knows,\\" but Boxer decided to write a pedestrian political thriller that doesn't inform or thrill.One reviewer wrote about the sex scenes in this book. Don't get your hopes up about those, either.

I would definitely recommend it!"},{"Title":"A Time to Run: A Novel","review":"I've been reading a lot of books on politics of late, and it seems like the reviews tend to be a function of how well the author's views square with that of the readers'. This certainly seems to be the case here, where the reviews are very polarized.This in truth is something of an odd novel. It's the prehistory of a fictional California senator framed book-ended by a short story about a controversial nomination to the Supreme Court. The prehistory starts in Berkeley in 1974 and is a love/hate triangle following the future senator, her husband and a mutual friend. As another review noted, it's chic lit, pure and simple.The book tends to wear its faults on its sleeves. The short story about the Supreme Court nomination is too easy, requiring little of the senator, who benefits from a deus ex machina gift of knowledge. The conservatives are cartoonish in their villainy, which is a little disconcerting. (Even letting expression plausible rationalizations for their behaviors would have gone a long way toward making them seem human.) There is a sociopathic character who has to evolve. That's something that would be remarkably hard to pull off, and the novel doesn't quite do it. And some parts are quite frankly poorly written.The strange thing is that it feels like the parts that Boxer probably wrote herself are much better than those written by her professional author counterpart. The contrast is most obvious in the opening two chapters. In the first a senator and her staff discuss how to oppose a Supreme Court nomination. The writing is pretty credible and tight. The next chapter has two former lovers reuniting. It's reassuring in a way as it suggests Boxer has no firsthand experience with adultery because passages feel like they've been lifted from the Encyclopedia of Bad Dialogue.Other reviews complain about that lack of an insider perspective on Senate politics. It would be more accurate to say that it gives an insider perspective through a chic-lit lens. A recurrent theme, for example, is the stress on a marriage in which one partner works out of DC while the other stays in the home state. It makes it clear that when a candidate uses the excuse of \`wanting to spend more time with their family' as a cover for some unseemly reason for dropping out of a race that they might in fact just want to spend more time with their family.The result is a very uneven novel. If you only read one book this year, this shouldn't be it. But if you like politics and inhale books by the dozen and can stomach some weak sections, it's a quick read offering an unusual perspective on politics."},{"Title":"A Time to Run: A Novel","review":"This was a great book and I believe Senator Boxer and her co-author did a nice job! The last chapter seemed a bit rushed but the book is still a good read.After reading some of the other reviews that gave this book 1-star ratings, it seems that people are rating their feelings about Boxer as a person as opposed to rating the book.

You may enjoy it!"},{"Title":"A Time to Run: A Novel","review":"I have to say I wasn't expecting much when I started this book. I was very surprised.

Knowing this terrible senator's political leanings and her impossibly stupid commentary in the media, I guess it isn't surprising this ditzy piece of trash came from her.

This slim volume, only 163 pages, is full of wonderful information about the life of John Dunn for whom that bridge is named, as well as northern New Mexico from the late 1800's through 1953, the year Mr. Dunn died. By reading this book you will be well prepared for passengers' questions and, as a bonus, you'll glimpse a lifestyle that predates most of us. For me the few early photos of the Rio Grande, all from pre-boating years, and the building of the John Dunn Bridge are alone worth the price of the book. The regional history and the life of John Dunn are exquisite bonuses.John Dunn apparently was an irascible and only sporadically honest fellow, the sort of individual whose life story is fun to read about. His is not an exception. You'll learn about his early years in Texas, his later life in New Mexico, and the various legal and not-so-legal enterprises in which he was engaged throughout. I don't think I would have liked being around John Dunn, but I did enjoy reading about his adventures.

Of course, AMAZON does not give that information only the publication year of the Kindle version. Except that in this case not even Kindle year is mentioned.This book is like reading ten memoirs at the same time. It is very comprehensive. It is in depth. It is not at all an memoirs that gives you a feeling of how it would be to be in the Elizabethan court. It tells the lives of many of her courtiers at the same time as it tries to show all that happened during the reign of Elizabeth I. And it also is very much a portrait of the monarch herself.It is littered with long quotes of letters and memoirs. There are no literature list in the end. One would have to create that oneself since the quoted literature is there after the quotations. At the same time as one reads chronological the events concerning Elizabeth I and English history suddenly a biography of a gentleman and his family often 3 generations. The biography bits are annoying, not because they are not interesting but because they often starts with no mention of the name of the person in the beginning and before you can understand who it is the regular history has begun again.Every chapter starts a short overview, unfortunately the formatting with --and it starts just there --so if you need to see what a word means in the dictionary in Kindle, those 2 --hinders that.I have seldom read a book that made me think about editing it. It needs editing. May the reader in the 19th century did not need it but the modern reader would surely have enjoyed the book better had it been better structured by an editor.This book is two volumes in one.

It deals with the true emotional life and loss, of one this centurys true folk heros.

Please read this book."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"I feel at times times the book was slow but the overall story and content was excellent. one of the best bios ive ever read. Bob was the greatest!"},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"Catch a Fire was a great book. It helped me to better understand the culture of Rastafarians and the type of life which a Rastafarian lives. The book Catch a Fire gave tons of background and information that you do not read in the everyday biography of Bob Marley. The book also helped you to understand the politics of Jamaica which in return helps you to understand the lyrics and songs of Bob Marley on a completely different level.Reading this book made me understand why such a vast age range of people enjoy Bob Marley's music. I gave this book five stars because I feel that it is not only a great book on Bob Marley but also a great book about the Rastafarian culture and Jamaican politics. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is at all interested in Bob Marley, Reggae music, Jamaica, politics, and or the history and culture of the Rastafarians. I feel that this book would appeal to a great number of people."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"It's been some time since I read this book TWICE. First bumping into it at the library and then buying my own copy on-line... As you start to read this book, it is as though the lights are turned down low and the projectionist starts to roll the movie - it is entirely absorbing. Bob's life, the changing times, the Jamaican political scene, the protagonists and antagonists - the Chris Blackwells and Scratch Perrys - the hanger-on-ers and the End. Marley's life is better than any fiction - as can be said for each of the players in this true tale. In a way, Chris Blackwell even offers an unexpected &quot;Bond&quot; connection.... The book will give you an escape from wherever you are now and a deeper understanding of the person behind the stage persona you see in the videos... Like a perfect cup of coffee in the morning, or a great album such as Marley's &quot;Legends&quot; album filling the air of your room, you will enjoy the read this book provides."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"I really enjoyed this book and thought it provided great insight into Bob's early life as well as Rastafari and Jamaican culture. Having said that, it seemed like Mr. White devoted so much space to certain aspects of Bob's life that he skimmed right over others without much comment. The recording and release of &quot;Catch a Fire&quot; is barely covered as is Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer's departure from the Wailers. I would recommend reading this along with &quot;Bob Marley&quot; by Stephen Davis as his book covers the Island years in greater detail."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"To begin, this book is wonderful; it is highly original; it reads like literature at times; it is vast and comprehensive; but, for all intents and purposes, it is flawed. It tends to give a greater or equal amount of attention to Jamaican cultural, political, and social history than to Marley's actual life. Admittedly, as the author is trying to assert and as the reader will also assume, the life of Marley and the history of Jamaica are inseparable and, thus, foundational when studying each other. But if you are looking for a book that will provide you with insight into who Bob Marley was as a person, as a singer-songwriter--how he crafted his music and lyrics--this is not for you. To his credit, White has written a fantastic book that is meticulously well-researched and informative, but that I cannot rate it the full five stars simply because of the book's title. To accurately represent the material inside, the title of this book should, without a doubt, be something like 'Bob Marley and the Rise of Jamaica' or 'Bob Marley in the Midst of Jamaican Struggle.' I would still recommend this book as a starting point for understanding the life of Bob Marley, but not as a definitive biography. Readers will need to read further."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"I was prepared to love a book with a blurb on the front calling it \\"the finest biography ever written about a popular musician.\\" But I didn't. And I love Bob Marley. And I am Jamaican. I never felt it captured Bob. Much time was spent on all the spliffs smoked but not as much on the songs written and the inspiration for them. Some of the facts were off, a surprise considering White's exhaustive research and frequent revisions. I mean, surely he should have learned the first settlers of Jamaica were the Taino Indians, not Taina. And that Wolmer's Girls School is a high school, and Wolmer's Prep is elementary (he had them reversed). One place where he talked about the attempt on Bob's life concludes: \\"No one knows what happened to the assailants. Maybe he fled to Miami....\\" Was it one or two who went to Miami? It made me wonder how correct he was about the things I did not know before. On the plus side, he did capture Jamaica and Jamaican life quite well and the parts about Bob's gift of prophecy were plain spooky. And the excerpts were his own book was part of the court case was fascinating too. It's a good intro to Bob Marley but not sure this is the definitive book."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"Okay, I read all of the book and learned a lot more about Bob than had preciously known, but I was disappointed by the lack of details on the making of the music. I was hoping for more details about the inspiration for a lot of Bob's music and this book did not have it.I am currently reading \\"Exodous the Making & Meaning of Bob Marley & The Wailer's Album of the Century.\\" This book goes into a lot more detail if you want to learn more about the music. I would recommend it over this book.Still \\"Catch a Fire\\" is a good read if you want all the details of Bob's life."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"The book title is also the name of the 1973 debut album on Island records for Bob Marley and The Wailers that brought the lyrics and sounds of reggae to an international audience.Originally published two years after Marley's death from cancer, the biography remains a great read due to the exhaustive research by author Timothy White.White had interviewed Marley from 1975-1981 and projects the development & growth musically, spirtually and politically in his life. White also interviewed musicians, friends, family members, music industry executives and poltical leaders, along with the typical research - newspaper articles and other media outlets - and not-so-typical - CIA documents concerning Marley.There are also sections on Jamaican history & politics, the history of reggae & Rastafarianism and how White did his research.Marley projected a militant spiritualism in his music that will remain timeless. Catch a Fire gives the reader an understanding and appreciation on why Marley's message means as much today as it did so many years ago."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"For those of you who have heard Reggae and like the music you should like this book. Undoubtly Bob Marley is the greatest Raggae artist who ever lived, so it is not unusual that people are going to want to know more of his life. The book seems to be fair and objective. Sometimes it seems the writter is a little to sterile in his discription of Jamaican life. Having been to Jamaica I realize how unique Jamaican culture is. It was interesting to read of Bob Marleys mystic background. For a hardcore fan this might not be enough, but for somebody just wanting to know a little more you'll enjoy it."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"This book was really good,but it had couple mistakes on dates that events ocurred people's names were mention on the wrong stories.Also some chapters dragged didn't give enough info on things.jumped place to place to much."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"I was very excited to receive this book, and read it in a few days. The book gives thorough details of Jamaican history, the Rastafarian religion, and Marley's family. But what the book is lacking is emotion and heart. The author speeds through the end of Bob's life and commercial success. It didn't really touch on how much Bob's music affected people. Overall, I think it was a good book, but I wish that I had bought Spirit Dancer. I heard that that book is better."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"Once again, I refuse to pay more than the going rate of $9.99 for a Kindle book. Get real here, publishers. It's not like you're spending a fortune on printing and binding costs. Stop trying to rip off Kindle readers. And Amazon, shame on you for going back on your original promise to Kindle users that no book would cost more than $9.99. Stop caving to the publishers."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"This book by Timothy White is a shallow delve into the life of reggae legend Bob Marley. The book promises to deliver on details of his early life, his rise to stardom, and his death in the crushing grip of cancer. However, Mr. White spends far too much time on the small and irrelevant details of Marley's early years and leaves the reader wanting more and getting less. The book progresses with minor details loosely strung together with trival information and little 'meat' in the scope of the life of one of the most influential musicians of all time. Overall, I would have to say that this is one of the worst books about Marley that I have ever read and I think that though he began with good intentions, Mr. Timothy White did not deliver on his promises to fulfill the reader with knowledge about the life of Bob Marley."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"This book covers it all from the humble beginnings to bob's rise as third world poet and prophet and then to the controversies that occured after his death. White takes much time to tell about the politics and religious issues that help one to understand what is happening and to bridge the cultural gap. In many ways this biography does not paint a comlimentary picture of bob, in many ways it does. It is the truth based on verifiable facts. It's important in a study of this man's life to cut through the varnish of the legend and the myth to what really happened. Bob Marley deserves that much. White takes us right to trenchtown and attempts to paint a complete picture.Life in the kingston ghetto that spawned reggae has a code of it's own. When there was an attempt on bob's life in 1976 it was trenchtown gangs who brought the accused to justice. This story reads like a great novel and never gets boring or stale and that's just one of hundreds of examples.This work is a great study of jamaican life and culture as well as reggae and bob marley. A must read for real fans and the best biography by far of this great man.One reviewer suggested that the book doesn't pay enough attention to bob's rasta faith. Not true, marley's religious faith is the motivation for most of what he does, how he viewed the world. White never misses this point. As bob's world got bigger his perspective on his faith changed.A must read.....................socks"},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"This is the first biography of Bob marley that I have read. But I have read (and written) numerous biographies of people in popular culture, social history, military history etc. This book is written in a way that is hard to describe - it uses the jamaican patois so cleverly and appropriately that you realise there is no other way the events in Bob's life could have been described. So detailed are the descriptions that it is obvious the author writes from a personal knowledge of Bob, his family, his friends and his musical associates. Absolutely rivetting, and impossible to put down, it stays with you. I listen to the music now with a quite different appreciation of what is going on in the songs."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"I recently read &quot;Catch a Fire&quot; while on vacation in Jamaica, and found it the best reading choice I could possibly have made. I was awed by Timothy White's success in describing and documenting the cultural, economic, historical, musical, racial, religious and political contexts which spawned Bob Marley. The book is not just an account of one musician's rise to fame, but of the land and society which inspired, sustained, and betrayed him, and which continues to learn and grow from him. Though I lived in Jamaica for many years, I learned much from the book about the culture and history which I never knew before.The book made Bob Marley at once more human and more astounding. It documents the human perils, uncertainties and challenges he encountered and how he dealt with them, sometimes better than others. At the same time, it does not attempt to explain away his genius, inspiration or transcendent powers - those inexplainable qualities which made him extraordinary and which resulted in the ongoing legend which may never stop.The experience of reading the book whilst involved in activities such as touring the Bob Marley Museum in Kingston, listening to his recordings, and discussing Marley with people across the island made it impossible for me not to make mental comparisons between the birth and growth of the legend of Jesus of Nazareth and that of Robert Nesta Marley of Nine Miles.Timothy White has done a superb job of documenting the birth of a legend. As Bob sang and White concluded, &quot;Time Will Tell.&quot;"},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"After being a fan of Bob Marley's music for years, I decided that I wanted to learn more about the legend. I thought Catch a Fire was an amazing book. Not only does it tell everything about the life and times of Bob Marley, from childhood through his \\"rockstar\\" days, but it tells of the origins of reggae and Rastafari. Learning more about Marley really made me appreciate his music on a whole new level, and I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in learning more about the man behind the name."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"The man, the myth, the legend, it's all here and some. I read this book several years back and consider it one of my favorite biographies. The author goes into great detail concerning the Honorable Robert Nesta Marley life. He also does a superb job explaining the roots of reggae and all the social and political ramifications surrounding Bob Marley's life. This is a must read for any fan of Bob Marley. The man was much more than the music and in order to understand the full picture an understanding of Jamaica and Rastafarianism is essential. The book recounts all aspects of Jamaican life and how the ambassador of reggae became a super star. A good companion book to this is Songs of Freedom by Adrian Boot. Thanks to fine biographies like this and the plethora of music left behind by Bob Marley it is easy to see why he was so great then and now. His legacy continues to grow as each new generation discovers the Hon. Robert Nesta Marley, the Lion lives on forever!"},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"After buying some Marley records, the book was a later buy. Instead I should have bought both at once because the match is very good, in fact. They travel well with each other."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"This is a great book to fully understand bob marley's music, ideas and life. It may lacks a more profound look on his works, but still is THE BOOK if you want to understand the jamaican culture, specially the music. You'll feel like travelling through time and space. You almost can see, feel or smell places and people. Mr.White has done a labour of love and takes you to a incredible journey. It also includes the best Marley's discography so far. Essential."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"This was a purchase after reading the same writer's book on the Beach Boys, which I enjoyed for its many facts and all the historical insight. But it was not a regular bio at all which made it refreshing The same aspects arise here but in an even more intense way. Without the knowledge given on the country, its sociology, politics, religions and superstitions, and so forth, it would get stuck in the category of the generic music biographies, which are getting to be a major bore. Marley and his people live! This book certifies it with lots of interesting layers. So it's cool."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"This book is not only an excellent book on such a great man but it also gives an in depth history and ideology of rastafarianism. It is unlike any other biography and has an incredible amount of information on the rasta culture."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"This book on Marley is much more thorough than others out there. It gives historical and musical insights besides giving you a really inside sense of Marley the person. You learn about his childhood, his time as a teenager and adult, the family, the politics and lifestyles of the Jamaicans, and also cool info on how all the Wailers songs got created. The part on Peter Tosh's death is SCARY. And in the back is stuff on court cases, CIA documents, and a king-size disc history that helps to find usual records. This book has loads in it. It definitely requires concentration but it stays with you afterward."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"\\"Catch a Fire\\" is an excellent book on the life of Bob Marley. The author did a good job of exploring the life of this truly great man. I had always thought that I knew about Bob Marley but reading this book revealed a lot of new insights into his music, his message and his rise to stardom and greatness. In particular, I got a better and deeper understanding of the background and history of Rastafarian movement as well as life in Jamaica.This is the best book so far written about Bob Marley. It provides a comprehensive coverage of this remarkable man and includes other great people like Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer as well as Bob Marley's family, particularly his kids.If you love Reggae music and/or you are a Bob Marley fan, then this book is for you."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"This book is a very good book to read because it goes into excellent detail about the major events that occurred during Bob's life. The book starts off by grabbing your attention and never let's go. The book explains who Bob is and what he believes in as he becomes a Rasta. The book is good because it explains why and how Bob even got started on singing and playing music. The book also tells about Bob Marley's life before he became a reggae poet. It says how life was when he was little living in Trench Town with the other thugs that lived around there too. The author organized and put the book together very nicely. His text was not hard to follow but he could have done better on the time line of the book. I didn't like that the book was very wordy and the author dragged on things that he shouldn't have, like, how the British started to get interested in Bob. Things like that are good to know but he shouldn't have talked so much about them. Overall Catch a Fire is a great piece of literature and I would give it five stars."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"Catch a Fire by Timothy White was extremely interesting and informative even though many parts were a bit too detailed and there were occasional digressions. I learned much about Bob Marley ranging from his background and early childhood in Kingston's poverty stricken Trench Town to his life as a Rastafarian and a musician. The book explains in detail the beliefs of Rastafarians as well as the history of the religion. It tells of how Haile Selassie became the king of Ethiopia and how Bob Marley and his wife became Rastafarians. To me, the most interesting aspect of the book is the history of music in Jamaica and Bob as a musician. The book explains the influence island music and American R & B had on Ska and Reggae music. It talks of Bob's little known first singles as well as his early albums with the Wailers and how, through music, he met his wife. The book offers insight into the mysticism and superstitions that are part of Jamaican culture. Also shown is the lasting impact of Reggae music on society. Though slow at times this book was fascinating and informative. I would recommend it not only for fans of Bob Marley but for any music lover who wants to read a story of a struggling artist who against incredible odds overcame oppression and poverty."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"If your into Bob Marley this is a must have book.

So go to your nearest book store and purchase your book today!xoxo rhino"},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"Whether you are a Music lover or a Passionate historian like myself Mr. Marley is simply a fascinating individual. Born in poverty in one of the worst ghettos of Jamaica he found Music to be his passion, and through it he weaved Politics, history and love into a common mosaic. Marley's new style, his conversion to Rastafarianism, much to the surprise of Haile Sallaise when he visited Jamaica and was almost crushed by crowds, and his exporting of his music and values to America and Africa is an extraordinary story. From Marley's impassioned plea for feuding politicians Manley and Seaga to \`come together' as well as Marleys succesful tours of the States and his appearance at independence celebrations in Africa. This is the standard text on Marley and it covers everything from the intricate details of his musical breakthroughs, to the history of his religion and even the current affairs of Jamaica.You will not be disappointed with this excellent, fast paced read which brings the story to a close with Marleys cancerous toe, discovered while playing Soccer in Central Park.Seth J. Frantzman"},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"This beautiful story of the only king of Reggae, proves the magic still lives. you are taken on a journey from Kingston where Bob was born to the great days and beautiful songs. You will learn more about the rasta religion, the Marley family, and the life of our man. I will forever remember this book. Bob's legend still burns, and I hold on to his fire."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. After reading it, I have a pretty good idea of what Marley's childhood was like, a hazy picture of his adult life but no understanding at all of how a poor man from a third-world country was able to popularize a genre of music that was almost universally disdained, or considered a novelty, in the world outside of Jamaica in 1973.I would have expected more discussion of his music; specifically how he and Chris Blackwell adjusted the arrangement of Marley's reggae songs to appeal to a broader audience, as well as how Marley's music evolved over time. I know from watching VH1's \\"Classic Albums\\", that process was critical to Marley's success but I don't even get an inkling of that in this book.Instead the book has way too much on Marley's childhood (140 pages into it, we have only followed Marley up to the age of 14!). This book also has too many vague, cryptic references to conspiracy theories about the CIA, Ronald Reagan, the Jamaican government, etc.On the bright side, the book does a good job of describing the superstititious world of poor Jamaica, full of demons and ghosts, etc., which helps explain the popularity of Rastafarianism."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"In my humble opinion, this book is for the Marley fan who wants to read a textbook or encyclopedia about Bob, rather than a novel. This is a book for a fan who has read everything else and wants to dig even deeper.I appreciated the appendices about the disposition of Bob's estate (and the related court proceedings) as well as the paperwork showing a possible CIA plot against Bob. However, the book did not flow well because it was heavy on sometimes-tangential research. In addition, there weren't as many quotes from Bob, his family and other people as I would have liked. I also thought the author was judgmental--for example in writing about Bob's strategy for beating cancer. I also think the writer made undocumented assumptions about Bob's feelings--for example, the author discusses Bob's interpretation of his experience in Zimbabwe without demonstrating how the author arrived at that opinion. Finally, crucial dates are wrong, like the year Damian Marley was born.This book really isn't a top choice for this Marley fan.One love."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"The journalistic reviews of the original version of this book -- published in 1983 -- say it better than I can. By paraphrase . . . \\"The best biography of a rock icon ever written\\" . . . \\"transcends the rock bio genre and enters into the world of great literature.\\"Absolutely true.The author has produced a volume that recognizes that the best of biographies do not merely recite dates, nor narrate a linear storyline; but develop a panoramic narrative that takes into its scope context, history, and society--of the protagonist, certainly, but of those who came before him. White thus lovingly--and this is a profoundly obvious labour of love--situates Marley's life within the rotating dynamics of colonialism, poverty, rock excess, and sublime spirituality. His eye for details verges on the uncanny on every page: passages describing Marley's childhood read like intimate short stories of the author's developing genius. While White's prose does verge on the purple, the exuberance he feels for his subject overrules what might be considered wordy language. Personally, I didn't mind it -- and his flights into Jamaican patois feel wholly authentic in rhythm and rhyme.But the inertia of this story is Bob Marley's only journey, globally and internally, to bring a spiritual vision to the world, ensconced in a style of music that is guaranteed to make one feel better. White, from extensive interviews as well as acute investigation, has provided what must be the clearest window we'll ever get into Marley's message and mind.It's truly an extraordinary achievement. I earnestly think this reads better than the majority of prize-winning novels from the last twenty-five years. This work out-literartures the literary types to the extreme. It's an extreme pity this work is shelved as 'rock journalism' and thus somehow of a lesser calibre than 'novels'. It's not. This is an artistic product of the highest level."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"Bob Marley is a giant in the world of music and \\"Catch a Fire\\" is the best available biography on the late reggae singer. Author Timothy White knew Marley and his associates well and he has assembled many interesting facts about the musical artist in this excellent book.Besides the music, White covers details about Marley's personal life and his relationships with his family members. Most fans already know about wife Rita and their children- especially David \\"Ziggy\\" Marley who has made a name for himself as a reggae artist in his own right. But little is known about Marley's father and his other close relatives. White lets it all hang out in this book, explaining the quarrels, the arguments, and the special problems Marley faced with his family and his early life growing up in Kingston, Jamaica.Talking about Marley's life is the main theme of this book, but there is also a good deal of history. You learn all about the political history of Jamaica, the various leaders of the island nation, and Marley's political views and associations with them. Everyone knows that Marley's music was influenced heavily by the living conditions in his native land, and this book provides a solid background on the political situation that Marley considered so important.The writing in this book is a little different. Instead of translating the words to make it easier to follow, the author chose to use the same words that are common in Jamaican speaking. Jamaicans speak English, but they tend to shorten words and they don't like to pronounce the \\"th\\" sound. Thus, words like \\"them\\" and \\"that\\" are changed to \\"dem\\" and \\"dat\\". These words are the ones used in the book whenever someone from Jamaica is quoted. I like reading the actual words, but I know that some readers will be annoyed by this.This book is exhaustive, and White deserves credit for updating it every few years to keep it current. Even though Marley died in 1982, his music still sells well all over the world and there have been endless battles for rights to his estate; rights to publish his music; and other legal issues. Besides the legal battles, there are still controversies over Marley's death and the attempt on his life back in 1976. Many people suspect that the U.S. government was behind the assassination attempt, but no definitive proof exists one way or the other. White includes, at the end of the book, excerpts from court testimonies he has given about these and other important issues.This book is personal and concise, and it will thrill fans of the late singer as well as music fans in general. White deserves much credit for assembling together so much data and so many facts about this musical giant known as Bob Marley. The book is the best one available about the late singer and activist from the Caribbean region and it's a must for Marley fans everywhere."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"One of the better music biographies I have ever read. I knew a bit about Marley and his music before picking this up (and the 1998 edition is the most up-to-date), but this really clued me in. And I, unlike some readers, appreciated the solid background on Jamaica, reggae, and Rastafarianism, all of which are essential to understanding Bob Marley. I would have liked more anecdotes, stories, and information about his recording and touring (patriculary during the late '70s heydey), but White mysteriously does not delve much into this. And it did what a good music bio should - further investigate and listen to the music of the subject. Jah, mon!"},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"I went to the book store and picked up 2 books on Bob, this one and Rita Marley's book, My life with Bob Marley.I spent 90% of my time reading through Rita's book which is a more enlightening,informative and engaging book and presents a personal upfront look into Bob's life.As a biography I expect the author to paint a picture and weave together introspectivly all the events that land-marked Bob life, both personal and professional.What I ended up reading was a compilation of data, chronologocally and robotically documented.For example, one paragraph about Cindy Breakspeare, former girl friend of Bob's, reads that Cindy Breakspeare , Miss Jamaica Bikini, Miss Universe Bikini called Bob [on some night in November] to tell him that she had won the Miss World Crown. And it ends there. And thats it! You're left hanging saying to yourself...'yes and so??? ...... please tell me more', what did she say in details, what was his re-action , what did he say / do....It's raw abrupt data like this that's scattered throughout the book, and leaves one feeling empty, disappointed, with a sense of wanting, unsatisfaction, and nonfulfillment.He doesn't tie together any events or explore any situations, or tells a story that helps you to understand Bob Marley or give any insight into what made him who he is, instead he simply spits out raw facts in robotic style, many times it's just one or two liners; and nothing more, then simply goes on to spit out other raw facts.This is not what I would consider to be a complete and fullfilling biography. It's more of a reference type of book that would supplement a \\"real biography\\""},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"A fascinating study of the legendary Bob Marley. My other favorite world music book is &quot;The Brazilian Sound&quot; (Temple University Press, 1998), which I also purchased through amazon.com."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"In the 1960's at the confluence of the streams of Jamaican independence and the messianic Rastafarian religion, there came a once in a lifetime musical genius who was born, if not in a stable, then in similarly unpromising surroundingss in the mountains of the Jamaican hinterland.This is a very detailed book that explains a great deal about Bob Marley's background and career. Now I can tell you what a &quot;goverment yard in Trenchtown&quot; (from the lyrics of No Woman, No Cry) means and I know what Duppy Conqueror means. I did not know these things before.This is certainly not a fan biography, or even a hagiography. In fact Marley does not even come across as a particularly likeable or admirable person. Perhaps there is a reason for this. I have a couple of CDs that have interviews with Bob Marley. It seems to me that Marley was not particularly articulate in person, and that what he had to say was all said in his songs. The author had many interviews with Marley in his lifetime, but none of them seem to have been very profound.There is something about the style of the author that I don't particularly like, a certain like of directness or reference points, if you like. In a way he admits this in appendixes in which he says that he really has no way of telling what parts of much of the material he was told in interviews is true--so he just quotes it all, and lets you decide for yourself.In the end it seems to me that White piles up lots and lots of data, but we don't learn much about Bob Marley the man. Maybe in the end the Natural Mystic eludes all attemps to pin him down. But the book does give tons of background information that helps to understand his music, and even the particular events in Marley's life that inspired the lyrics of certain songs.The book is definitely worth having, but the true essence of Bob Marley lies in his music, which, fortunately we can all still enjoy today."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"This book talks too much about everyone associated with Bob Marley; Halassie Salassie, Marcus Garvey, Rita Marley (and countless other extraneous characters), and too little about Bob Marley. Although there were rare moments when I caught a quick glimpse of Bob Marley, I finished this book with no clear image of him.The author's implication that Bob Marley possessed supernatural powers is silly, and cheapens his memory. Bob Marley was an artist who overcame great odds as a result of talent, determination, and idealistic conviction. Yet I did not find this Bob Marley in this book."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"I found myself unable to put this book down. Timothy White has, without any doubt, written the most comprehensive and extensively researched account of the life of Robert Nesta Marley.\\"Catch a Fire\\" tells the full story, in vivid detail, of a man who emerged from the Third World to leave in indelible mark on the entire world. White is careful not to exclude any aspect of the soul rebel's remarkable life, beginning in the tiny shantytown of Nine Miles in the hills of Jamaica and his adolescence in Trench Town, one of Kingston's impoverished ghettos. The book also creates, for the reader, a clear understanding of Rastafarianism, Jamaican culture, the Jamaican recording industry, and Jamaican politics, all of which are vital to fully understanding Bob's life, ideas, and music. Another reviewer is correct in pointing out that the book is composed entirely of factual material and the author makes no attempt at embellishing some attributes that portray Bob as being less that perfect.This book is a must-read for anyone interested in Bob Marley's life and music. It is a story that would captivate even readers who are not particularly fond of reggae. \\"Catch a Fire\\" is the most fascinating biography I've ever read, period."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"Bought this in college, read it again the early 90s, and it had hlf again as mch info.

It also discusses the Rastafarian religion, and Ras Tafari (Haile Salassi). The way this book uses the Jamaican patois (The Jamaican English) is wonderful, making you divulge even farther. I could not put this book down. If you like reggae at all, read this; it will tell you the story of the most influential reggae artist of all time."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"This book is more than just a biography of the late Bob Marley. It has a lot to offer the reader.Jamaican history and the history of the Rastafarian religion are covered in detail. It's also a ghost story, where as the author tells us how the believe in the supernatural, influences everyday Jamaican life.Marley, of course is the central character in the narrative. The other characters are highly interesting also. Bob's mother and father (the word father is used loosely) are central characters of the story, as are the member of the Wailers and his faithful wife, RitaI highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in Marley, the Caribbean or Reggae music.RIP Bob"},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"Catch a Fire is as much about Jamaican politics, Jamaican music history, Rastafarianism, and Jamaican folk customs and belief in the supernatural as it is about Bob Marley. What you get about Marley covers his childhood at least as much as the time when he was a famous musician. At least a third of this covers the post death Marley situation with way too much for my interest about the legal wranglings over his estate after he died. You never really get inside of his head or get a true feel for the man. Bob Marley remains a mysterious figure. One fault the book has is White comes at it too much from a fan or groupie perspective not being as objective as he should have by buying into the mythology around Marley more than he should have. For example he often speaks of horrible things happening to people who wronged Bob Marley in one way or another, more than slightly hinting at some sort of supernatural force avenging for him, or Marley himself having the ability to lay curses upon people. You can't really deny that Marley had a supernatural vibe going on, but in this case I think White should have been more objective. You also get wild accounts of instances of Bob Marley, Rita Marley and Peter Tosh being assaulted by a supernatural entity.If you get this book for an analysis of Marleys music you will be disappointed. I mainly was interested in reading it because I wanted to learn more about the political side of Bob Marley and the allegations by some that his cancer was a result of being dosed by the CIA. There is a fair amount of the political stuff, more or less nothing on the cancer conspiracy theory but overall the book kept me interested."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"Highly recommend this book, the author will make you feel like you right next to Bob, and also give you an overview as if you're 'following' along, looking over or riding, right on Bob's shoulders. It has definetly made me understand Bob and humanity better... highly recommend this book"},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"One of the better music biographies I have ever read. I knew a bit about Marley and his music before picking this up (and the 1998 edition is the most up-to-date), but this really clued me in. And I, unlike some readers, appreciated the solid background on Jamaica, reggae, and Rastafarianism, all of which are essential to understanding Bob Marley. I would have liked more anecdotes, stories, and information about his recording and touring (patriculary during the late '70s heydey), but White mysteriously does not delve much into this. And it did what a good music bio should - further investigate and listen to the music of the subject. Jah, mon!"},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"I picked up this book because I'm a fan of Marley's music but I realized I never knew too much about the guy himself. I wasn't disappointed with the content. &quot;Catch A Fire&quot; takes you through Bob's early childhood into when he first started singing and recording, all the way through to his death, with great stories and details along the way.In addition to a book about his life, this is also a book about Jamaica's history, rastafarianism, and reggae music. It goes into some depth on these three topics, putting Marley's life into historical perspective.My gripe is that the writing in the book was only OK. For a topic that I was interested in reading about, the book did a poor job of holding my attention. However, I would recommend the book to a Bob fan, because it is filled with stories and anecdotes about Bob's life that I never knew about. I would not recommend this book to the casual Bob fan. You are probably better off just watching that documentary about him. I forget the name of it right now."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"Are you looking for a well-written, factual and insightful book about Bob Marley and reggae? Well don't buy this book, which no intelligent reader could take seriously. It attributes magical supernatural obeah powers to Marley, recounts chilhood occurances in his life as if the author had been there, and tries to imply that the CIA might somehow have been involved in an attempt on his life. Would White have written such nonsense about Bob Dylan or John Lennon? I doubt it. This book is simply an insult to the man's memory and to his music."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"I bought the book for my son who is a big fan of Bob Marley and he told me I selected an exllencent book.

What I got was the worst written book I have ever read. The author jumps around so much I couldn't keep up. He mentions so many people, names, and dates my head was spinning. This book was not about Bob Marley- this was more about the politics going on at the time. I was looking for a book that told of Bob's life; his family, his relationship with his wife, his kids. This was not the book that I was looking for."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"It is a regrettable fact that too many music books are inadequate. Biographers tend to review the music and omit narrative. One hopes for flow and encounters just data taken from album jackets and the like. Despite its length, a complete and skilled picture is acquired of Mr. Marley, such as one would find in a life of W.E.B Dubois instead of all the gushed blurbs seen in pop star-type writing. The writing has care and respect. Commendable, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"Some good books on Bob out there. This one, it can be stated, has the most information on everything about the past and the present. The work of Bob's children is there. Peter Tosh's story is also told. This is a total immersion job that gives a massive picture, with politics, offical documents to back it up. There's plenty about how the Jamaican people reacted to reggae when it came on strong, and Bob's special meaning for them. It makes you feel you are with the characters all the way, next to them.

White is clearly a knowledgeable and passionate scholar of Bob Marley. He's done a huge amount of original and relevant research, including many interviews with Marley. His cultural/political approach to Marley's life and work offers fascinating glimpses into Jamaican music, culture, politics and religion. Unfortunately, despite these advantages, he is unable to bring them together into a satisfying or coherent whole. Ultimately, I came away with little sense of Bob Marley as a person or artist, and no small amount of of confusion over the various events in his life.One of the book's biggest failures its emphasis on such background issues as Jamaican politics and Rastafarianism at the expense of biographical detail and musical insight. All too often, this contextual material becomes its focus. A particularly annoying example is White's account of the legal battles over the Marley estate. It rambles on in mind-numbing detail for dozens of pages, way out of proportion to its relevance.There is also the odd and frustrating omission of Marely the artist. We get almost no insight into his approach to songwriting, performing or recording. Marley was clearly a huge talent and a musical innovator, but White does almost nothing to explain what made him unique. For example, White tells us next to nothing about the stories behind his fascinating lyrics, which can be inscrutable to non-Jamaicans.Marley's career arc comes across as similarly muddled, though the early portions are fairly well told. In 231 tantalizing pages White takes us from Marley's birth in 1946 to his signing with Island Records in 1972. At this point, Marley is poised at the brink of worldwide superstardom and you're ready to dig in to what should be the most delicious part of the book. Unfortunately, White doesn't see it that way. He spends a paltry 80 pages on the rest Marley's life. But wait, its not over yet! Inexplicably, he gives us another 150 pages on the lawsuits, Marley's CIA files, assorted family squabbles and the Marley family members' recording careers. Some of this is actually interesting, but why waste so many pages on what amounts to a postscript - all at the expense of the main narrative?As if all of this weren't enough, Catch a Fire is shoddily written and edited. Characters seem to appear and disappear out of nowhere, events are referred to but never explained. For example, White tells us in the preface that someone named \\"Coxsone\\" claimed authorship of some early Wailers sides, but he never pauses to tell us who Coxsone is, or if he has a first name. Later in the same paragraph, he refers to someone named \\"Dodd,\\" seemingly the same person. It's not until a few chapters later that we learn that they are, in fact, the same person; Sir Downbeat Coxsone was the stage name of pioneering Jamaican DJ, Clement Dodd. Errors and omissions like these left me scratching my head throughout the book.I wanted to like Catch a Fire. I really did. Parts of it are actually great and I give Timothy White a A for Enthusiasm. Despite all that, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but the most die-hard Bob Marley fan."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"With this book, you get the music, the life, the history, the politics. But you also learn all the behind the scenes information. Students of history should read this, but also students of entertainment law, because the sections on the court cases are fascinating and disturbing, including the &quot;Judge Not&quot; part in the appendix."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"I must say that after reading this book, i came to the full knowledge and understanding of what Jamaican cultures and music are all about.

FROM CHILDHOOD TO DEATH, THIS BOOK IS THE BEST."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"This book, Catch a Fire, was a very well thought out book. However, it gave more of a summary of the history of Jamaica rather than talking about Bob Marley and Reggae Music. The book gave too much information on the history of Rastafarianism and Jamaica. Timothy White did a sufficient amount of research on Bob Marley through his interviews with relatives, but did not tie enough of the information about the man himself into the book. Overall, a good book for learning about Jamaican culture and a small amount of Regae history."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"I think that the background about Jamaican history provided in this book is interesting for those who have a wider interest in reggae and Jamaican culture but it does interrupt the flow of the biography about Bob. The author really could have edited down the amount of background info to good effect.I am quite happy with the amount of info provided about Bob's childhood and adolescence. Very rewarding for painting a portrait of the artist. The only thing that was lacking was more color about the ten most interesting years of Bob's life when he was recording for Island! There are less than a hundred pages devoted to this period of Bob's life but more than a hundred devoted to the irrelevant BS that happened after he died. The most important time of his life was certainly glossed over.That being said I still enjoyed the book (and this was my second time reading it) but if I ever re-read this book, I will remember to stop reading after the time when he died.RASTAFARI!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"Classic book capturing the entire life of the king.

Its not a page-turner, but its definitely kept me interested!"},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"I was so looking forward to reading Catch a Fire, the Life of Bob Marley by Timothy White, but truthfully it turned out to be a constant struggle. Timothy White is a font of information, rather than a good story-teller and that is a real shame.The beginning of the book we are given lengthy lessons in the origins of the Rastafari religion, historic background on the island of Jamaica, an explanation about reggae music and how it developed and a detailed account of how Haile Selassie came into power in Ethiopia which explained his relationship to King Solomon of Biblical fame. And then on page 60, we began to learn about Robert Nestor Marley's parentage and early life.Throughout the book there were many interesting stories and tidbits of Marley's life including some quite fantastical supernatural stories. We learn that Marley's white father took him and placed him with a stranger for a year in his early life and his mother couldn't find him. We learn about his maternal grandfather, Omeriah who was a leader in his rural community who was an herbalist and able to communicate with spirits as a\\"Myalman -a person who possessed the knowledge and the power to deflect the machination of 0beah and to heal with folk medicine.\\"But throughout the book, the stories is interrupted with so much background information that the story of Marley's life fails to flow and unfurl in a fluent way and the facts themselves become irrelevant and confused in the readers mind.To make matters worse the end isn't the end, but another 100 pages have been added since the books publication in 1983. These pages in the rambling and random manner of the previous 300 detail the lives of Bob's loved ones and family after his death and the legal battles which have been fought over publishing and recording rights.I truthfully would have loved to read a concise and flowing account of Bob Marley's life, but this book did not provide that."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"Delivery was very fast.

Extremely interesting and enlightening!"},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"White wrote a very thorough book about Jamaica and Jamaican music. The Jamaica that Bob Marley grew up in. He provides a detailed account of the Jamaican culture before and during Bob Marley's rise to success. White also chronicles the unfortunate hangers-on that accumulated with Bob's success and blemished his later years. The songs i have been listening to by Bob Marley for the last 20 years now have new meaning after reading this book. Initially, I thought a song was about this or that, but with some background into Marley's tribulations at the time the song was written, that particular song has a whole new meaning. For a true Bob Marley fanatic such as myself, read this book if you want to know him from his boyhood to a man as well as the musician that broke barriers that were firmly positioned."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"This book was really good, but there was so much into each section then it was spuratic all around."},{"Title":"Catch a Fire: the Life of Bob Marley","review":"The hands down best biography these eyes have read!

A complex man, a complex faith, deceptively \\"simple\\" music and a chaotic world wove a musical phenomenon perfectly caught in this book.White does a superb job interspersing his obvious passion for Marley and reggae and the island which spawned both, weaving a tapestry which is easy to \\"just\\" enjoy or to really delve into and \\"get\\" where Marley was coming from. Rasta lives, reggae lives and Bob Marley still lives in both.Be you a real fan of reggae and it's ultimate master, or just looking for a good read, you won't go wrong with \\"Catch A Fire\\".hydra.

Faulkner takes the reader into a community that is often ignored with great literary skill. The white working class is a group that live a life that is as unstable as an urban black community. Barn Burning is a story about the desperation, bitterness, and destruction of the working poor. Of course the concept of working poor is oxymoronic. If a person works, they should not be poor. Faulkner does not leave the reader in a negative emotional state, Barn Burning has an endearing hero. What Tupac would call a rose sprouting up from the concrete.

There is absolutely NO break in the text. I find this layout very hard to read. Also, many of the longer works are \\"abridged.\\" There are tons of (...)s between parts of text.

I thought that the two characters were likeable but they just didn't sizzle. The chemistry which began early on, didn't really evolve enough. I enjoyed the intrigue and suspense but felt the love story was under-developed. Still, a good book but a little disappointing.I was annoyed at Abbie for never trusting Hugh. I didn't agree with her logic through out the book. I closed the book feeling just a little cheated.I liked it, just didn't love it.

The synopsis of this book has been attended to, so my thoughts.I liked the character of Abigail Vayle, strong, fiesty and independent. She was determined to live under her own terms in a time that such independence was frowned upon. Hugh was the most interesting character. A scholar and ex spy for the British but in love with Abby. I won't give away any spoilers but he certainly had a major conflict of interest at one stage in the book.This is an historical, mystery romance, more sensual than spicy. There is an engaging plotline and well worth the read. The other aspect that I enjoyed is that the characters were a slightly more mature. For me a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Whisper His Name","review":"I've read this book so many times I was forced to order a 2nd copy to replace the 1st.While I can't say that I really liked Abbie she was a bit too much of a shrew for my tastes.

At first you're really not sure if he's truly one of the good guys or not, but by the end of the book, you realize that he's just as flawed as the rest of these characters are.The fact that Ms. Thornton chose to give this hero brains, brawn AND flaws was a wonderful change from the other authors I've read over the years. I've read almost all of her books and this is hands down my all time favorite and after reading the other reviews here, I think you will just have to read the book and make your own decision."},{"Title":"Whisper His Name","review":"This is my very favorite Thornton book and she is one of my top favorite authors. I won't go over the plot as others have but say at first I was not sure about the book but quickly it grabed me. Abby was not just a pawn, she did not let Hugh dominate her as she had other priorities. I especially liked the way she went (eventually) for help from her family-in many romances they are so bad. Here they may quabble but when thing get tough they stick together. It is worth it to read. It gets more exciting as it goes along. It is a book with more than just sex but it does have that."},{"Title":"Whisper His Name","review":"If you like suspense and passionate characters, you'll enjoy this book. Was my first read for this author but definitely not my last."},{"Title":"Whisper His Name","review":"I can't believe how poorly developed this book was! I was so dissapointed in it. The characters had no spark, neither ever trusted the other, and their &quot;love&quot; story never evolved. I usually like Thornton books, but this was terrible. The back cover was a better read. In fact, I'd LOVE to read the book the cover described, it certainly wasn't Wisper His Name. If there were a no star option, I would have picked that. One star is one too many."},{"Title":"Whisper His Name","review":"I loved the romantic suspence and it was not until the end that I fiqured out who the villian was. This was the first time that I read one of her books and I will be looking for more."},{"Title":"Whisper His Name","review":"It's not very often that a romance writer dares to have a woman and man be FRIENDS first--best of friends at that, then lovers. That alone made this book a worthwhile read. I tire of all those bickering couples. Lovers' spats now and then are expected, but, really, the constant arguing to mask quivering sensitivities does get old. A good plot needs conflict, but quarreling over the usual well-worn devices (&quot;S/he is only using me,&quot; &quot;S/he doesn't/can't really love ME,&quot; etc, ad nauseum) doesn't necessarily qualify for that.This book doesn't do that. The main plot revolves around finding out who has kidnapped the heroine's brother, and why. The answer really isn't a surprise to anyone who has read the spy books of John Le Carre.The romantic plot conflict is very real, and very understandable: We're all thrown for a loop, to realize that someone we THOUGHT we knew so well might have some traits, or secrets, that we hadn't expected. It takes some time to adjust, to get past the feeling of betrayal, the feeling that we weren't trusted with certain information, to trust again. As is often the case, doubt leads to doubt. It is how the lovers overcome all the havoc wreaked by so much doubting that makes a story.Hugh and Abbie are able to overcome these problems not for a reason as idiotic as being good in the sack together (although they of course are), but because they have a stronger foundation than most romance-book couples: They are friends, first. Thank you, Ms. Thornton, for writing a romance book that makes sense, romantically speaking."},{"Title":"Whisper His Name","review":"Abbie Vayle is a smart independent woman who at the age of seven and twenty is quite content with her unmarried state and plans to stay that way. On a trip to Paris in 1814, fate, in the form of a very desperate spy, running for her life would upset the comfortable existence that was Abbie's life. Unknown to Abbie, the spy had slipped a book containing some dangerous coded information into a basket of rare books Abbie was bringing back to England for her book shop - a book that Nemo, who is Napoleon's most feared agent, would kill for! It would be some weeks later, that Nemo would track down, the book and Abbie to threaten her with her youngest brothers life should she not comply with his wishes and turn over the book.Abbie's friendship with Hugh Templar, both of them members of the Antiquarians Society has always been comfortable. Hugh, was once a government agent but had retired from that life and wanted nothing more than to rusticate in Bath as a scholar and archaeologist searching out Roman ruins. When Hugh senses that Abbie is hiding something and seems disturbed, Hugh's former skills as a soldier and spy would come in handy - if only Abbie would confide and trust him. Abbie, unfortunately, cannot decide if he is friend or foe and initially still thinks of him as the quiet, well-mannered scholar. A kiss from him actually startles her enough to start looking at him from a different perspective, but whether she can trust him enough with her brothers life on the line is the bigger problem. As he had always assumed this scholarly role, Abbie, who would have liked to involve him, felt he would have been more or less useless - what could he do! Then when he reverts into this macho type of man - she is more or less repelled. So what's a girl to do - especially as she has prided herself on her independence - nothing but fend for herself!This was another superbly written mystery and romance by an author that this reviewer has just discovered. The complexity of her plots with romance, and historical background has all the elements that keep me enthralled. I loved the character's portrayal of both Abbie and Hugh - although at one point I would have liked to shake Abbie for not telling Hugh the whole truth, especially after they had shared a most sensually delightful evening together. Hey, if you trust a man enough to share your body, you might want to share a few other things - like the truth! The rest of the secondary characters also add to the enjoyment of this book and I loved the way the siblings in the Vayle family drew so close together in support of one another when the chips were down. This was truly a wonderful read, fast paced and hard to put down. Loved it and highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Whisper His Name","review":"This was my first Elizabeth Thornton novel. It took me a while to navigate through the language as I'm not an historical romance fan. I usually read contemporary novels. But Ms. Thornton is a skilled storyteller, and, soon, I was engrossed in Abbie Vayle's life, her growing love for Hugh and their adventure. I didn't know those Victorians were so recklessly passionate! Bravo, Elizabeth Thornton."},{"Title":"Whisper His Name","review":"I came upon Elizabeth Thornton not too long ago and what a find! Her books grab you at the prologue and don't let go until the end. It's not too many authors who know how to immediately capture your attention in the first few pages. Her heroines are always strong, or quickly learn how to be strong, and refuse to be victims. In this story an innocent woman is catapulted into a deadly game of espionage through a chance encounter with a desperate spy. The hero is a friend who wants to be more than a friend. Great reading. Wonderful romance. Fast paced and sure to hold your attention until the end. Don't forget to request the epilogue to this story from ET's web site."},{"Title":"Whisper His Name","review":"Whisper His Name is my favorite Thornton book. After reading the other reviews at Amazon, I guess this is one of the books you either love or hate, so let me put my vote on loving it. Having two extraordinary characters put in a pressure-cooker of danger and suspense just made the love story all the more poignant and urgent. I just couldn't put it down the first time I read it, and I always pick it up every several months to re-read. I would love to read more about some of the secondary characters involved in the book. My recommendation is to give this book a try, especially if you like mystery and action mixed with your romance."},{"Title":"Whisper His Name","review":"I just finished Whisper His Name and loved it! Historical Romance is my favorite read, but having the intrique added was great. I like the fact that the characters didn't just fall into each others arms and stay there. Both had issues to deal with, and getting caught in the midst of murder and spies made this story very exciting."},{"Title":"Whisper His Name","review":"I began this book with very high expectations and Thornton delivered. The hero Hugh is one of the most complex male characters I've come across in ages. The dicotomy between his low-key scholarly persona and his dangerous masterful self made him fascinating to read about. Abbie, the heroine, was also well-characterized. Her fear in the beginning of the novel when the villian holds a knife to her throat was more realistic than the usual stalwart bravery of most romance heroines. It was interesting seeing Abbie progress from petrified to angry about the villian's terrorizing tactics.The sparks between Abbie and Hugh are considerable, even when both believe they have been betrayed by the other. I found myself re-reading many of their scenes together. All in all, Whisper His Name is a superior book."},{"Title":"Whisper His Name","review":"In 1815 England, Abby Vale lives her life as she wants to, not caring what the aristocratic society, including her own family, thinks of her activities. Instead, she runs a rare book business and has the unique opportunity, at least for a female, to apply her intellect.However, her idyllic life runs into a problem when someone demands she returns a book she unknowingly obtained in Paris. If she fails to abide by their wishes, she and her brother will suffer the consequences. She tells her friend, the scholarly Hugh Templar, about the threats. He, having once worked for British Intel, begins to insure her safety because he loves her even though she seems only interested in his works on Roman antiquities. Things change when an assailant abducts one of her brothers. Working closely with Hugh, Abby falls in love with her hero. However, she relishes her independent lifestyle and wonders if love is worth the cost?Famous for her historical romantic who-done-its, Elizabeth Thornton scribes another terrific tale that sub-genre fans will take immense pleasure in reading. The action-packed story line is a thrill a page without scrimping on a warm romance. Readers will admire the autonomous and unafraid Abby (even though she seems a bit too narrow-minded in outlook). Hugh is a huggable hero that demonstrates an action figure can have a brain too. As has occurred with Ms. Thornton's previous works (see the DANGEROUS trilogy and YOU ONLY LOVE TWICE), the audience will shout that WHISPER HIS NAME is must reading.Harriet Klausne"},{"Title":"Whisper His Name","review":"Stubbornly independent Abbie Vayle lives by her own fules. A spinster, she has no plans to marry. When she is given a book with an encoded message in it she only plans to resale the book for profit. But somebody wants that book back and they want it back bad enough to kill. In order to save her own life and her brothers life she is forced to confide in her best friend Hugh Templar.Hugh has been in love with Abbie for some time, but has yet to declare himself. Once a spy for the British government during the Napolionic War, he is instantly on guard when Abbie confied to him. But is she telling the truth?As Abbie and Hugh are thrown deeper and deeper into danger the closer they become. Abbie realizes what Hugh has known all along, love. But can they make it work and live long enough to save Abbie's brother George?Elizabeth Thornton is the master of historical romantic suspense. I highly recommend WHISPER HIS NAME and look forward to reading more in the future."},{"Title":"Whisper His Name","review":"I love, love, love Thornton, and this book met and exceded her other works. Whisper His Name was amazing, the characters and the plot were both very well developed, and it was just a great book overall!!!!

Keep up the fab work Thornton!!!!!"},{"Title":"Children and Childhood in Classical Athens","review":"Mark Golden's book puts the humanity back into our picture of Athenian childhood. He replaces the rather heartless image left us by earlier scholars (based on practices like the exposure of newborns, or the farming out of offspring to nurses) with a more nuanced and gentler one emphasising the natural affection within families, while giving due weight to the more ruthlessly pragmatic practices of the age. A few more illustrations might have been handy, but this is a well-written, well-researched and thought-provoking read."},{"Title":"Children and Childhood in Classical Athens","review":"My students have enjoyed this book over the years as an optional book in ancient history courses; it is the starting place for anyone interested in childhood or education in the period."},{"Title":"Milady's Professional Barber-Styling Workbook","review":"\\"Milady's Professional Barber-Styling Workbook, Revised Edition, Student's Edition, TO BE USED WITH MILADY'S STANDARD TEXTBOOK OF PROFESSIONAL BARBER-STYLING.\\"[from the book]"},{"Title":"Milady's Professional Barber-Styling Workbook","review":"After searching the web for a book for studying for state-administered barbering exams, this book stood as the only comprehensive title widely available.I recommend it because it practically draws not rivals at the time.

Fanoy raids the fridge, assumes control of the remote and relaxes into her new lifestyle - until Courtney's father Bret shows up.Embarrassed and anxious to make amends for not reporting Courtney's disappearance, Fanoy throws herself into the search, accompanying Bret on a canvas of Courtney's favorite bars, friends, and campus activities. Bret commandeers Fanoy and takes her to his decaying mansion, a fantastic Italianate villa built by a flamboyant fan dancer whose wardrobe is still hanging in the closet. Captivated by the possibilities of this new personality, Fanoy steps further out of her former drab life, checked only by disturbing new discoveries about Courtney.Clark builds her story on layers of secrets and deceptions. Fanoy's voice - reasonable, even likable, but slightly skewed and unreliable - finds the perfect pitch of naivet&eacute; and connivance for a story grounded in manipulation and seduction. Delightfully chilling.Portsmouth Herald, March 3, 2005"},{"Title":"Find Courtney: A Psychological Thriller","review":"Melissa Clark has got it. She's a grand storyteller--a gift complemented by good writing. In fact I wrote down about a dozen of her best lines to savor long after, like: his laugh sounded creaky, unused.Fiction, mystery, family dysfunction at full tilt, this second novel has garnered accolades that are well earned.Buckets, I don't know where to start--and you're not going to learn much from me as you must read it yourself. On a sunny fall Sunday, one perfect for being outside, I decided just to read a few pages. Well, 221 pages later, I had devoured it. Find Courtney was finished and all I would say is Whew!Courtney is that girl most of us envy: gorgeous, physically beautiful (and enhanced), rich, consumed by shopping, a nice car--but duh, very self-absorbed. She disappears without her make-up, credit cards and new car. Hmmm, aren't those are all the things important to her?The heroine of Find Courtney is her non-descript roommate. We know her, and some of us were her. Barely getting by, boyfriend or friend-less of any kind, hardly coping.Courtney's dad, well, Hawaiian shirt aside, he's something else--strong, rich, giving (and taking) with glee, powerful--and concerned at Courtney's disappearance.This father and daughter really took the fun out of dysfunctional and Clark put then sharply on the page. The book had more twists and turns than a giant roller coaster and the surprise ending was the final big twist before the screeching hat at the bottom.Armchair Interviews says: Clark's characters, descriptions, family relationships (sick that they were)--and as I said, her writing made the book well worth my sunny Sunday time, and you will agree. I can't wait for her next effort."},{"Title":"Find Courtney: A Psychological Thriller","review":"Melissa Clark's background is varied and exotic. She has a long track record of published poems, plays, and short stories, and her first novel, DEVLYN sold over 100,000 copies. She supported her early writing as an exotic dancer and based her fan dancer character's home on an actual house called Dar El Baraka in Oujda, Morocco, where Ms. Clark lived during her formative years.(Candy) Fanoy is a repressed adult college student living on a shoestring. When glamorous Courtney Armorault asks her to be her roommate Fanoy (as she calls herself) quickly accepts and enters a world she will not quickly forget. Courtney disappears one day, and Fanoy curiously accepts Courtney's probable fate until almost two weeks later when her father, Bret Armorault, suddenly makes an appearance and plucks Fanoy out of her \\"vacation\\" and back into the world of difficult men and unlikely scenarios:\\"What was there about this guy that made me want to argue, sink my teeth into him? He seemed to be just using me for a sidekick, but maybe he was also testing me. But once again I bit my tongue. Maybe it's just hardwired into me to argue with men his age, because of my increasingly adversarial relationship with my father, which I noticed got a lot worse as soon as I was taller than he was.\\"What happens when two psychopaths find consuming love based in a setting of a long dead erotic fan dancer? Bret and Fanoy are seemingly made for each other, based on their history of family violence and their anti-social behavior. But the match takes on a hard edge as Fanoy peels back layer upon layer of Bret's persona to solve the murder of her brief roommate experience with a kidnapped girl made into a sexual object.This novel is written almost entirely on a psychological level, with occasional forays into the real world. The characters, though, seem content to pick at each other until their innermost souls are revealed. Courtney's disappearance is almost a sideshow to the real plot, which is the effect of extreme parental cruelty and desertion of children and how it affects their entire life and inner world. Melissa Clark writes a fantastically great tale.Shelley GlodowskiSenior Reviewer"},{"Title":"Find Courtney: A Psychological Thriller","review":"Not often you read a mystery that is truly surprising and yet plays fair with the reader. Find Courtney is not about what it says it's about or even what its characters think its about, but a true puzzle about identity formation unravelled in the first person. Who are we and what makes us that way, where are we going and what do we want? These ideas are mixed very satisfyingly into a missing person story that turns into a love story that turns into a murder story."},{"Title":"Find Courtney: A Psychological Thriller","review":"This book has no business calling itself a psychological thriller.

I thoroughly enjoyed it, actually, I guess you can say I sucked the marrow out of it. I agree with the other reviewers, Terri Windling's guide book is the best part of the collection, but it's all good, baby! I can't wait for &quot;The Moon Wife&quot;, Terri's new book.

The other books in the Bordertown series were so incredible, that I, being the sort I am, expected this one to meet the same criteria. The best part of the Bordertown series is the interpersonal dynamics of the people. This book seemed to rely on the individual to much, there weren't as many friendships and relationships. Which is, to me, what made the other books work so well. I know this is most likely the last of the Bordertown series that we are likely to see.

Nearly everyone in Bordertown, it seems, is a runaway, a musician, a member of the SCA, an elf, or [dear me] all of the above. Still, the stories are fun, and most of them are readable. &quot;Argentine&quot;, by Ellen Steiber, I thought the best of the bunch: a wonderful love and redemption story set in Bordertown's El Barrio. Other notables include: &quot;How Shannaro Tolkinson Lost and Found His Heart&quot; by Felicity Savage, an amusing story that makes it known that B-Town and Faerie may not really be all they're cracked up to be; &quot;When the Bow Breaks&quot; by Steven Brust, which takes place not in Bordertown at all, but on the Mad River; and &quot;Rag&quot; by Caroline Stevermer, whose writing style quite reminded me of Tim Powers. If you can't stomach any of the other stories, at least give those four a try."},{"Title":"The Essential Bordertown (Borderlands)","review":"Lack of imagination, thin characterizations and watery plots made the &quot;Bordertown&quot; series not at all to my personal cup of tea. Ms. Windling writes beautifully in &quot;The Wood Wife&quot;. These books are dated and precious."},{"Title":"The Essential Bordertown (Borderlands)","review":"Going by other reader reviews of this book, some fans of the series were disappointed by The Essential Bordertown--they felt the stories &quot;just weren't the same&quot; or something. Of course they weren't the same! It has a different character than other books in the series, but that's only to be expected from an anthology, and I enjoyed it immensely. One of its best features, to my mind, is the way &quot;guidebook&quot; excerpts are placed between the stories--for those unfamiliar with Bordertown, they provide excellent background material, and for fans, they're full of little jokes and references to familiar locations/people/events. They also make good transitions from one story to the next. The book contains 13 stories (how apropos) by Patricia A. McKillip, Midori Snyder, Delia Sherman, Donnard Sturgis, Ellen Kushner, Michael Korolenko, Elisabeth Kushner, Charles de Lint, Caroline Stevermer, Steven Brust, Ellen Steiber, Micole Sudberg, and Felicity Savage, of which four particularly struck me.I loved Patricia A. McKillip's &quot;Oak Hill&quot; for many reasons, but one of them is that its protagonist reminded me of myself in junior high--a lonely girl with bad skin looking for magick. I particularly liked the fact that the girl has no terrible reason to come to Bordertown; she just wants something better--something more--than what she has. McKillip's prose is beautiful as ever, and the ending, though of course I won't give it away, is simple and powerful. &quot;Dragon Child&quot; by Midori Snyder is largely set in Dragontown, which has always been one of my favorite areas of Bordertown. Eli, half elvin and half human, escapes from his cruel elvin father to Bordertown, where he struggles to fully free himself from the aristrocratic father who has controlled him all his life. The story doesn't offer any easy answer to Eli's problems; it may be about a boy who blurs the border between the World and Faerie, but it's realistic.&quot;Changeling&quot; by Elisabeth Kushner I admit I was already predisposed to like--young lesbians desperately trying to build a happy life for themselves have always had a special place in my heart. &quot;Oak Hill&quot; shows Bordertown as a place to run to; &quot;Changeling,&quot; like &quot;Dragon Child,&quot; shows it as a place to run away to. Selkie/Seal (neither her given name, of course; people who come to Bordertown frequently give themselves new names, in the hopes of new lives) is trying to find a place where her &quot;difference&quot; won't stand out, and comes to Bordertown--where it might not be easier, but it might also be better. The final member of my top four, Ellen Steiber's &quot;Argentine,&quot; is about an elvin girl who didn't run anywhere--she was banished, her memory erased, to Bordertown, where she does what she seems to do best: steals. Argentine seeks out things that matter to people, and takes them, to feel the love they contain. But no thief's luck lasts forever, as the ghost of a dead man is only too happy to remind her when she takes his living lover's necklace. Steiber makes Argentine a sympathetic character, despite the things she does, and Roberto, already dead, is tragic. This story makes me cry almost every time I read it.The Essential Bordertown definitely holds its own within the series, and I highly recommend it--and if you like it, you should try to find the others, although some are out of print and hard to get ahold of."},{"Title":"The Essential Bordertown (Borderlands)","review":"Well I read the two reviews below and then I read the book itself. I gotta vote along with Flagstaff Reader, not Chicago Reader, that this book is awesom and the best Border book yet. I think since Chicago Reader picked &quot;Bordertown&quot; and &quot;Finder&quot; as his/her personal favs of all the Borderland books then he/she is probably a big fan of Will Shetterly and Emma Bull's Borderland stories. Well, thats cool but Chicago Reader should realize that not all of us are. The Shetterly &amp; Bull version of Bordertown is fine and fun but personally its a bit too &quot;Miami Vice&quot; for me (altho I thought &quot;Elsewhere&quot; was different and pretty cool) and its really nice to see the series move on past the 1980s and into the 1990s. I for one was really glad to see stories by Patricia McKillip, Midori Snyder and Ellen Kushner instead. Chicago Reader is mistaken if he/she thinks that &quot;Bordertown&quot; and &quot;Finder&quot; were the original Borderland books. Look at the older books in the series you'll see that the first book was called &quot;Borderland&quot; and Terri Windling, Mark Alan Arnold, Charles de Lint, Midori Snyder, Stephen Boyett and Ellen Kushner were the people who created the world of Bordertown. And then in the next book, called &quot;Bordertown&quot; ,Shetterly &amp; Bull came into a world that had been created by other people and added some places and characters to it, and in the next book, &quot;Life on the Border&quot; Michael Koralenko, Craig Shaw Gardner, Cara Dalky joined up and all added their own nieghborhoods and characters to the town- which is what makes it so cool, there's plenty of room for everybody here! So all you Border Rats, don't be put off by Chicago Reader, this is a great book full of all the stuff we love best in Borderland! I agree with Flagstaff Reader that no matter what part of Bordertown you like best, whether it's De Lint's Dancing Ferret or Shetterly &amp; Bull's Danceland or Midori Snyder's dojo or Ballamy Bach's Gray and Wicker, there is plenty of room for everybody, so come down to Soho and lets rock!As for me I LOVE the Patricia A. McKillip story here the best and also the Elisabeth Kushner story about two gay girls, and lots of other stories besides. As a mixed race teenager, Black dad and White mom, I can REALLY relate to stories about kids from two races trying to fit in. And also I really like the fact that the books are even more &quot;multicultural&quot; now. My only complaint is that I want more more more. Ms. Windling and Ms. Sherman and Tor Books, please don't make us wait so long for the next one!!! And please bring this out in paperback so I can own my own copy since I can't keep this library copy forever.Thank you."},{"Title":"The Essential Bordertown (Borderlands)","review":"Chicago Reader(review below), I challenge you to a duel by pistols (no make that Border-magic) at dawn! You are wrong, wrong, wrong! This book is still the Borderland we know and love. (Gentrification? Phooey!) B-town is still gritty/still fey/still full of mean streets and rock-n-roll but also full of color/magic/the angst of young human- and elven-beings living life on the edge. The stories make it clear that a few years have passed since the earlier books and the 'town has changed, but Soho is still Soho. And a bit o' change is good, it would be awful if the books stayed stuck in a 1980s vibe. The new book is less &quot;Adam Ant&quot; and &quot;Thompson Twins&quot; than earlier books like Bordertown, Finder, etc.--more &quot;AfroCeltic Sound System&quot; or &quot;Dead Can Dance&quot;, more worldbeat and world culture in them which is a great thing as far as I'm concerned, a personal opinion sure but one shared by my circle of Border fans here.The Delia Sherman story was my personal fav (welcome to Bordertown, Ms. Sherman!) but there was plenty o' other good tunes here too. Patricia A. McKillip's story broke my heart, Ellen Kushner's story made me laugh, Midori Snyder is back in fine form and I liked the less polished but raw and dynamic stories by newcomers like Jenna Felice and Donnard Sturgis too. Special nod to Felicity Savage for her cool and snarky tale at the end o' the book. There's one thing me and Chicago Reader can agree on though: Ms. Windling's &quot;guide&quot; pieces are the absolute best.To the writers and editors of this volume: thanx from all us Border Rats here in Flagstaff.

The story doesn't offer any easy answer to Eli's problems; it may be about a boy who blurs the border between the World and Faerie, but it's realistic.&quot;Changeling&quot; by Elisabeth Kushner I admit I was already predisposed to like--young lesbians desperately trying to build a happy life for themselves have always had a special place in my heart. &quot;Oak Hill&quot; shows Bordertown as a place to run to; &quot;Changeling,&quot; like &quot;Dragon Child,&quot; shows it as a place to run away to. Selkie/Seal (neither her given name, of course; people who come to Bordertown frequently give themselves new names, in the hopes of new lives) is trying to find a place where her &quot;difference&quot; won't stand out, and comes to Bordertown--where it might not be easier, but it might also be better. The final member of my top four, Ellen Steiber's &quot;Argentine,&quot; is about an elvin girl who didn't run anywhere--she was banished, her memory erased, to Bordertown, where she does what she seems to do best: steals. Argentine seeks out things that matter to people, and takes them, to feel the love they contain. But no thief's luck lasts forever, as the ghost of a dead man is only too happy to remind her when she takes his living lover's necklace. Steiber makes Argentine a sympathetic character, despite the things she does, and Roberto, already dead, is tragic. This story makes me cry almost every time I read it.The Essential Bordertown definitely holds its own within the series, and I highly recommend it--and if you like it, you should try to find the others, although some are out of print and hard to get ahold of."},{"Title":"The Essential Bordertown (Borderlands)","review":"Written by some of the biggest authors in fantasy, particulary urban fantasy, this anthology is incredible.

The quality and tone of the stories is uneven, and while there are no real clinkers, there aren't any gems either, compared to the original &quot;Bordertown&quot; volume and the novel &quot;Finder&quot;. Especially missed is the gritty sense-of-place that made the older Bordertown *Bordertown* -- this book is a bit like coming home after a long absence and finding that your beloved spots have all been gentrified out of existance. I didn't *hate* it, but it's a shame that it didn't build from the high standard of the previous works. Still, Windling's &quot;guide&quot; pieces make this worth a look."},{"Title":"The Essential Bordertown (Borderlands)","review":"Back to the Border! Yeahhhhhh! Put on your dancin' shoes everybody!

MacDonald). Set in Boston (as are the following three), Valentine starts looking into the death of a young hustler, found dead on the lawn of an outspoken homophobic legislator.Perhaps better known for its tea parties and baked beans, nonetheless, the city of Boston is all aghast at this latest turn of events, especially the political factions and the gay community. Of course, the police have set this case on \\"top priority.\\" Valentine, who works as a bartender by night and a detective by day, involves his best friend, Clarisse (who's a not-so-inspired straight real estate agent). Author Nathan Aldyne balances well the suspense and intrigue of the murder and its implications with some very wry, dry humor that makes fast reading reading this novel.Of course, by book's end, the murder is solved--but not without first involving some very smart sleuthing and calculations on the part of Valentine and Clarisse, a path that leads them into some very seedy, questionable, and dangerous areas.Nathan Aldyne is also the author of \\"Cobalt,\\" \\"Canary,\\" and \\"Slate.\\" ..."},{"Title":"Vermilion (An Alyson Mystery)","review":"Okay, I admit I'm a fanatic when it comes to this author's books.

Now these humorous gay detective stories seem to be everywhere, but the ones I've read come nowhere close to these gems.Vermillion is the first of 4. The others are Cobalt, Slate and Canary. (Actually, they could almost be the titles of Pet Shop Boys albums ...) Anyway, the Boston/P-town settings are great, the Daniel & Clarisse team is hysterical, the stories solid, and the 80's period --once current with the first publication -- is sweetly nostalgiac.If you want a good, light, comic romp .. get these books.

Gay bartender Dan Valentine and straight best friend Claisse Lovelace get involved in a mystery. It seems a 19 year old gay male hustler has been murdered and dumped on the front yard of a homophobic state legislator. The gay community is being targeted and Valentine and Lovelace set out to find who the killer is.Boy--this takes me back! The authors (Nathan Aldyne is a pseudonym for Michael McDowell and Dennis Schuetz) were gay men living in Boston and painted a VERY accurate picture of gay Boston in that era. The bars mentioned in the book were actual bars around at the time--Nexus was Lexus and Bonaparte was Napoleons (both long gone unfortunately). The Eagle is still around. Back then Park Square was a hustlers hangout and there was a bus station on that street (that's gone too). They also mention the Art Cinema which did exist and play porn movies (also gone). I didn't come out till 1984 but those places were still open and active. This book was like a trip down memory lane! Nostalgia aside this is well-written with an intriguing mystery, colorful characters and one liners flying left and right. It's quick moving and never dull. It also introduces Lovelace's dog (named Veronica Lake) which mysteriously disappears between books two and three. A fun fast-moving book. This isn't the best book of the series (that's book two--\\"Cobalt\\")but it's still great fun. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Vermilion (An Alyson Mystery)","review":"This series of gay-themed mysteries is a hoot firmly anchored in the fun-loving 1980s before Aids. \\"Straights\\" may miss some of the \\"in\\" jokes but there is enough here to compensate. This is almost a genre unto itself; the soluthion does not arise from clever sleuthing. Rather, it is the bar talk of gossipy gays that lets our hero and heroine put the facts together. \\"Cobalt\\" and \\"Slate\\" are just as good, but the final volume, \\"Canary,\\" is a bit forced.

The production standards are terrific and the reproductions of paintings, from the originals, are as crisp and eye-popping as you always hope for in an art book. The book is also a valuable companion volume to &quot;Tapestry&quot; released. last year and covers completey new ground in terms of illustrations reproduced. All this said, I do have a quibble with the thought that went into the layout. Fine coated art paper is used throughout and what did the authors do? They filled up huge portions of this gorgeous paper with a complete checklist of McGinnis paperback covers, rather than the illustrations us fans were looking for. The checklist is a valuable tool for those who wish to compile a complete library of McGinnis paperbacks, (say, 5% of the people who love the work of McGinnis), but it could easily have fit at the back of the book on cheaper stock, which would have left room for dozens (if not hundreds) of color McGinnis covers. Oh well! Still good, but it was &quot;this close&quot; to being great!"},{"Title":"The Paperback Covers of Robert McGinnis","review":"Robert McGinnis is one of America's most gifted illustrators and the breadth of his talent was well-documented in his art book, TAPESTRY. Pin-ups, Westerns, movie posters--the guy could paint it all. THE PAPERBACK COVERS OF ROBERT MCGINNIS, though featuring several paintings as well as pencil roughs and a couple of photo references, is not an art book, but rather is a rather pricey checklist geared toward paperback collectors. The majority of the color works are small reproductions of the actual covers as they originally appeared--and the focus is firmly on McGinnis' detective covers with the other genre's he's worked in getting barely a nod. Even so, I would have preferred to see large reproductions of the artist's trademark femme fatales unmarred by titles instead of the plethora of tiny second-generation reproductions found in this volume: the format and content is geared SO much toward the hardcore collector mentality that the editors/authors seemed to have lost track of the ART and the ARTIST they supposedly revere. A disappointment."},{"Title":"The Paperback Covers of Robert McGinnis","review":"If you would like to check more McGinnis art images that will a companion to Art Scott's outstanding book check out the Robert McGinnis documentary DVD titled ROBERT McGINNIS PAINTING THE LAST ROSE OF SUMMER it contains interviews with McGinnis and Art Scott as well.

I was disappointed because I wanted more information about the actual trailering process - the book doesn't even touch on tow vehicles, and needs more on things like launching and retrieval, trailering different sizes of boats, safety with the trailer (like don't climb on the back of a boat on a trailer and tip it over backwards!), and so on. I'd also like to have seen more of an approach where there would be a statement of the problem, then here are different options to solve it, rather than Mr. Burgess' (admittedly inexpensive and effective) own way of solving the problem.

While the focus of the book is on trailerable boats up to about 28 feet, many of the activities suggested are fun with a boat of any size. But again, the key here is how to wring the maximum enjoyment out of a boat that most people can actually afford. Mr. Burgess has had plenty of experience with this. He shares those experiences eloquently and with an eye for frugality. In fact, this book is a much better reference for sailing on a budget than &quot;Frugal Yachting&quot;. This latter title focuses heavily upon boat selection. In &quot;Handbook of Trailer Sailing&quot; Mr. Burgess will tell you how to enjoy your boat no matter what the size. Best of all, he tells you how to inexpensively enjoy all of the activities which are possible from a small sailboat, not just how to sail cheaply.

The author of the book turned out to be an American transplanted to and now firmly rooted in Canada. As I am, myself, an American transplanted to and now firmly rooted in Canada, it struck me that there might be some common ground.An Amazon reviewer referring to another book in this series--Amazon is currently carrying three and a fourth appears to be on the way--referred to the research that Lance Rucker puts into his work. I must admit that as I read, I began to learn things. It seems that Americans can be distinguished from Canadians by the style of their laughter. Funny, in thirty-two years of residence here in the Great White North, I had never noticed.The overall plot is launched by the interesting notion that the Greek government sells claims to archeological sites on the open market to foreign investors who purchase them in the expectation of digging out profitable treasures (probably with bulldozers.) Well, gee, and here I was thinking that Sir Arthur Evans, on the very sites covered by this book, had managed to run a vast personal fortune into genteel poverty during the course of his distinguished archeological career. And it is nice to know that the Greeks have changed their attitude about well-meaning foreigners who come to loot their country. After all, they have been very huffy--oh, very huffy indeed!--this past century or two about the Elgin Marbles hijacked from the Parthenon and placed on display in London.This is a novel based on an archeological dig at the greatest of the ancient Minoan palaces, Knossos, traditional site of the Minotaur and the Labyrinth. Rucker is clearly a student of the mythology of the place. I have no doubt that he read all about it in the works of Thomas Bullfinch or maybe Edith Hamilton. As to the accuracy of his descriptions of archeological work, I can't say, for nobody in the book seems to be doing any.The particular pleasure of this book is Rucker's exquisite use of language. It is not often that one finds an author with such a gloriously fearless tin ear. Consider Rucker the wordsmith as he describes his hero, Brandon Drake:\\"A few minutes past one a.m., Brandon lay naked across the peeled-back sheets of the double bed in his cabin. An open-faced Brandy sandwich on white. No mayo.\\"With each rhythmic surge of La Cara's huge hull in the Mediterranean seas he felt his internal organs shift inside his thoroughly homogenized body.\\" [Page 29.]Now read Rucker on his heroine's longings:\\"She realized that she was trembling and gulping the air as her cheeks and lips and tongue were straining to find the right shapes to speak, as if this body here now were not her own but some strange, uncooperative flesh wanting to express itself independently. And right now it wanted to call out into the dark, to howl in an animal voice, to call out, to indent and mark the silence. A vision appeared, the one before the waking.\\"A man's face. A man whose gray eyes she craved to have watching her. A man whose thin, grand maleness she wanted to engulf deeply within her.\\" [Page 190.]Finally, Rucker on ratcheting up tension:\\"He looked without touching. It was jury-rigged. The device had a timer plate on it, and that showed an LED digital '25:10:13'. He looked at his watch. Four fifty-one. Looked back at the LED display.\\"It was some kind of bomb! He looked around the room more carefully and found two large boxes which contained large bundles of sticks of what could well have been explosives. They looked a lot like dynamite, but all this rig wasn't required just to activate dynamite. And there was only enough explosives here to open a crater above and seal off part of the labyrinth. It seemed more likely that this was all part of something else. A crude nuclear device? What if there were fissionable materials here, too? Nasty thought. Very nasty.\\" [Page 412.]Impressive, those final four words. Very impressive.When I began reading this book, I thought that I was following Brandy [sheesh!] Drake through a sort of sub-Clive Cussler-ish landscape. Drake comes ashore on Crete in pursuit of a possible swindler. He acquires an ally who appears to be Zorba the Greek's chronologically-challenged younger brother. He races up and down townscape and countryside pursued by or in pursuit of minions of a powerful mastermind. About 150 pages in, however, it struck me that there was an even better exemplar for this book than the admirable Mr. Cussler: Sax Rohmer's Fu Manchu. The insidious Dr. Fu (who might loosely have been based on a real Vietnamese who practiced nefarious schemes in the Parisian underworld around the turn of the Twentieth Century) was a great one for hyper-mega-grandiose plots that involved a great deal of picturesque and largely pointless to-ing and fro-ing, inevitably leading to the kidnaping of a pretty girl. Terrific stuff!In glancing through earlier Amazon reviews for this series, I was pleased to discover that Rucker has acquired a truly loving following whose reviews can be summarized by this comment about an earlier Brandy [sheesh!] Drake novel: \\"Wow, what a treat!\\" Oddly enough, not one of those adoring reviewers has ever been moved to offer a comment on any other author or on any other subject whatever.I was intending to give this Lance Rucker book a curmudgeonly single star, but it struck me that I had, after all, plowed through every turgid page, actually coming to enjoy the sheer Gawdawfulness of Rucker's prose and wondering with some delight about what leaden clunker of a plot twist he would throw out next. Why, if I stumble on another one at the library, I might even read it, too.Two stars, and well worth them!"},{"Title":"Final Labyrinth","review":"The airlines are on strike, which is the reason Brandon Drake is sailing to Crete. He's on the trail of a French con-man who sells stakes in a government program for funding archeological research. The Frenchman has disappeared, which is making Drake's clients nervous.Also sailing to Crete is Dr. Sarah Sanderson, on her way to an apprenticeship with the famed Dr. Pietro Perezia and his excavation of a site which is probably the home of King Minos. The legend of the Minotaur is very relevant, and is told by Dr. Sanderson in great detail to Brandon Drake one tipsy evening after they have danced themselves into exhaustion. Sarah Sanderson is fairly young, pretty, and naive. She is also very wealthy, and determined to make it on her skill as an archeologist rather than on her monetary assets.There are odd happenings on board ship. Drake doesn't know if they are connected to his work, or to Sarah's, but they give him pause. Things get no tidier when everyone gets to Crete. Brandon makes friends with some locals (very quickly, I might add); keeps trying to find Dr. Achille Desormeau; and pursues Sarah, in spite of the very mixed messages she is sending. Perexia's wife Danna is a brassy blonde, ostensibly from California, who wants to add Drake to her long list of paramours. He's not interested, although the repartee is amusing.Sarah wants to buckle down to work with Dr. Perezia. He wants all the work out of her he can get, and as many of her non-working hours as he can persuade her to part with. There are some amusing confrontations between Perezia and Drake - at least amusing to the reader, although uncomfortable for Sarah. Rampant testosterone is not always a delight to be around.FINAL LABYRINTH is a blend of mystery, thriller, and mostly tepid romance as it happens to \\"An information collector. A high-tech reference librarian. A database detective.\\" Drake is a well-rounded character, one I'd like to have on my side in a crunch.FINAL LABYRINTH moves very slowly for most of the book, which is not a good pace for a thriller. This book would benefit greatly from some judicious editing, mostly of overblown and/or purple prose every now and then, and definitely of the sex scene(s). If one skims those chunks, FINAL LABYRINTH moves along fairly well, and does pick up the pace in the last hundred pages or so. I found it surprisingly compelling at the end, although the last four chapters should have been compressed into one.FINAL LABYRINTH is the third Brandon Drake mystery, with another one on the way. BARREL PROOF takes place in a Kentucky bourbon distillery. INTIMATE FALLS begins with a fatal rock climbing accident in Yosemite Valley. NO SECRETS has Drake on a special contract in Japan. So Drake gets around, both in locale and in variety of cases. Good plots, good characters, good writing for the most part but needs work on pace and editing. While I won't bump Rucker to the top of my list, I'd read any of his other stuff knowing that I'll be skimming parts of it."},{"Title":"Final Labyrinth","review":"I haven't had the chance to read the book yet but I'm looking forward to it.

My specialty was the Aeneid, on which I wrote 14 articles and one book and which I taught for many years, both in translation and in Latin. So I can speak with confidence on this subject.The subtitle of this book is \\"Image and Symbol in the Aeneid,\\" and no one has done more than Poschl to explain the nature of the imagery and symbols in the Aeneid and to show how crucial they are to it. I think that I am speaking for most Vergilian scholars that this is one of three studies are absolutely necessary to appreciate the Aeneid.The others are Brooks Otis' book Virgil: A Study in Civilized Poetry and Adam Parry's article \\"The Two Voices in Virgil's Aeneid\\" (Arion, 2, 1963, pages 66-80). I would add to this consensus two more: Chapter VI of C. S.

The RCUS version of the Heidelberg Catechism reads slightly different from the CRC version since it was translated from German to English rather than being translated from German to Dutch to English."},{"Title":"Costume in Art","review":"This is quite small and is composed mainly of images (painting: details of painting: further details of painting etc.). For me the text was actually the interesting part of the publication; quotes and contemporary commentary and criticism of beauty and fashion pair with each reproduced image to emphasize and explain the fashions shown in the painting to a modern viewer. As interesting as the quotes are, they are the only text in the book and I believe any general art history book would give the reader a far deeper appreciation for the context of the painting. Rather than purchasing this book, look for publications of the pencil drawings and portraits of artistis like Ingres for beautifully rendered contemporary costume."},{"Title":"Wrong Things","review":"Caitlin Kiernan and Poppy Z. Brite, the two masters of short horror fiction, join forces to bring us this one-of-a-kind collection that surpasses all levels of expectations. Short stories aren't as loved as they once used to be. These two authors (who have also written great novels of gothic horror) make us open our eyes and wonder why the short stories have become a lost art form. They are able, in a very few words, to make their readers care for the characters and for the things they feel and do, something that many authors aren't even able to do in a full-length novel.The collection opens with Brite's The Crystal Empire, about a man who falls in love with a musician and who's only way out is to murder the signer. The story is dark and atmospheric, everything you'd expect to find in a Poppy Brite story.Kiernan's Onion is the best short story I've read in a long time. Here, we have a couple who saw things in their young age, other worlds, places that were never meant to be seen by the naked eye. Salvation time has come for this troubled couple. Verging the lines of dark fantasy, Onion is a very unique story that masterfully blends emotions, terror and drama. It makes you stand on the very edge of sanity.And then we have the collaborative work, a story called The Rest Of The Wrong Things. This story takes the best of both authors and puts it to full use. Three people are brought to an old factory where (what else) dark things abide. And one of them holds the key to their awakening.I loved every moment I spent reading Wrong Things. This anthology proves once and for all that Kiernan and Brite have perfectly mastered the art of short fiction. If you are a fan of either authors, or if you enjoy dark fiction, then do not let this one pass you by!"},{"Title":"Wrong Things","review":"Poppy Z. Brite and Caitlin R.

The collaboration was originally supposed to be in Kiernan's From Weird and Distant Shores; at a guess, no one who reads the afterword in that book will be able to resist traking this down and reading \\"The Rest of the Wrong Thing.\\" It's worth it.

Both are incredible women, and you will not stop until you have read all of their work..."},{"Title":"Wrong Things","review":"I love Poppy. I really, really love Poppy. She's an awesome writer when she really gets going, and her new stuff is amazing. She's writing about very, very human things, which are just so much scarier than the subjects of her first few books. Take Zee, in &quot;The Crystal Empire.&quot; She doesn't get what her boyfriend sees in this singer--she's a little scornful of the whole situation. However, she still openly believes that what he says, goes. That's SCARY. I've known people like that, who are willing to sacrifice their own will to another.&quot;Onion&quot; is actually the best CRK story I've read since reading &quot;Souveniers&quot; in The Dreaming series. However...she still needs work. I had to read and reread &quot;Onion&quot; to figure out just what was going on. It's better than Silk or Threshold, but not by much. Oh well.&quot;The Rest of the Wrong Thing&quot; was GREAT. PZB and CRK are fabulous collaborative writers. It brought back that wonderful small-town creepiness that I loved about Drawing Blood (and, to a lesser degree, Lost Souls. I just didn't like LS very much).All in all, a B+ effort from two great writers."},{"Title":"Wrong Things","review":"I didn't think something could be so orgasmic.

The style, which shows how Mila progresses in her learning, the theme, a girl taken away from her family of dolphins, are all completely and totatlly new. How people can think that taking someone out of a situation that they are perfectly comfortable with and love, and put them into a completely new place that they have never known while all the time thinking that they are helping the person, is unbeilevable.

I like the way it uses different font sizes to symbolize how much Mira has learned, and I also like how most of her thoughts are written down. The ending was quick, but I liked it just the same. I recommend this book to anyone that likes dolphins and has a big imagination because I never knew that wild children were real and because it gives a different view on a dolphin's life. It refers to music of the dolphins because Mira remembers her dolphin family when she plays a certain type of flowing music.

There was so much to discuss and talk about. We loved exploring the differences between Shay, who was not shown love, and Mila, who had a loving dolphin family.

While living in the ocean she became part of a dolphin family, and while living on land she became part of a human family.

I will agree with some that the concept is a bit 'out there' but because of the excelent writing style, which changes as the character grows more inteligent, the plot works. Don't pick this book if you are looking for a sugar coated happy ending, because it isn't here (while the ending may be argued again and again as to it's happiness) But you will see deep and sometimes hurting observations on human lifestyle and feel the loneliness that we all feel sometimes. Parents buy this book for your young adults but READ IT first. You will not be let down, and oppurtunities for many discussions will follow. Also keep in mind a rich knowledge of dolphins and their lifestyle is very interestingly woven into this incredible story. Once again, Karen Hesse does not disappoint."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"This book did not have the most interesting plot line. Main points:*Reading Level according to Accelerated Reader: 6.0 (6th grade)*Point Size in this book is VERY large and gets bigger and smaller as you read*62 Chapters (one chapter is one sentence, some chapters are a pg)*Good book to read quickly!!"},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"Theres a girl named Mila and her mom got into a plane accident and so Mila went into the ocean and lived with the dohlphins and the dohlphins took care of her.

Then the coast guard finds her and takes her to a facility for study. Although she enjoys experiencing life as a human, she cannot deny her longing to return to the sea and her dolphin family. Eventually, she must return.In this book, Hesse uses the first person point of view as a tool to show Mila's degree of human socialization. At the beginning of the book, the sentences and chapters are short; there are no paragraphs. These characteristics illustrate Mila's limited ability to vocalize because she has not acquired the language skills necessary to organize her dolphin-like thoughts. As she learns English, Mila uses elementary, disjointed speech. In addition to using simplistic words to convey this message, Hesse uses font size to further illustrate her point. The large font size in the first part of the book symbolizes Mila's degree of socialization. Also in the first few chapters, Mila uses observations with few expressions of feelings. For example, she says, &quot;I like good&quot; (8); &quot;I like Sandy happy&quot; (9); &quot;I like to see the picture of dolphin&quot; (11). These examples also illustrate her rudimentary language skills.As the book continues, the sentences get longer, and paragraphs begin to form. By Chapter 23, Mila speaks in paragraphs. This shows how much Mila has learned. Also it denotes that she has reached a level that is more socially acceptable. Hesse now decreases the font size to what one would consider average. She also employs more complex expressions of feelings and ideas to indicate Mila's increased knowledge and language. For example, she says, &quot;I love to use my hands. To play games, to make music . . . I like every little thing I am learning with my fingers and my toes&quot; (83).The turning point of the story is Chapter 29. Until this point, Mila has been content to live in a house with Doctor Beck and the others and learn human things like, playing games, sleeping in a bed, and wearing clothes. In this chapter, Mila decides she no longer wants to be human. She would rather return to the sea and the dolphins. At first, she just tries to be good and follow the rules, hoping that one day they'll let her leave. In Chapter 36, Mila has a talk with Justin in which he tells her that no matter how good she is Dr. Beck will not release her. She realizes then that she doesn't have to let Dr. Beck control her and that she can stand up for herself. After this point, Mila begins her journey back to her former life. Hesse reverses the changes made in font size, sentence length, paragraph length, and word complexity. This reversal symbolizes Mila's reversal to dolphin life.Hesse uses font size and other structural methods effectively. She has transformed these overlooked aspects of writing into tools that convey her intended message with clarity and skill. I have never read a book with this type of strategy, and I found it to be quite rewarding. It speaks in a way that plain words cannot."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"I am writing this as a reply to the review entitled \\"OMG THIS BOOK WAS HORRIBLE.\\"This novel is not about it being a \\"true\\" story, which it isn't, but about the development of language and social communication and interaction.An example case relative to Mila's predicament would be the case of Isabelle, who was discovered when she was 6 years old in a dark room, where her family kept her secluded from the world. She hadn't properly developed speech, nor did she have social experience.The point is that as the book progresses, the author writes from Mila's perspective as she develops her language skills."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"&quot;The Music of Dolphins&quot; has been a fairly popular book with 5th and 6th grade girls in our elementary school library, so I decided to listen to the audio-book on cassette read by the actress Michele McHall.Just as Karen Hesse starts the book with large print and simple language, McHall reads the first part of the book in a slow, halting and almost annoying high-pitched voice. My teenaged son--who normallly loves to listen to books on tape--was so annoyed by this, he quit listening within the first few chapters.However, just as the font in the book gets smaller and the language gets smoother, McHall's version of Mila's voice becomes easier to listen to as Mila ajdusts to being removed from her dolphin family and living with scientists who teach her English and music, while they study her in hopes of learning dolphin language.Both the book and the audio-book have an atmosphere that grows on you, and it's easy to get caught up in Mila's confusion, hopes, concern for another feral child, and stirrings of love. In the end, you're left to ponder the question of what it means to be a human. I think that's why this book is so deceptively simple, when it's really dealing with some pretty profound questions.Although I'm troubled with Karen Hesse's conclusion that a girl raised by dolphins is more &quot;human&quot; than the humans who care for her and study her, it does force you to stop and think about what the good qualities in human beings should be like.I think my son would agree that this is a &quot;girl's book,&quot; but it's certainly one that deserves to be read, discussed and pondered."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"Music of the Dolphins, by Karen Hesse is a heroic book. The struggle Mila must go through to live with her dolphin family is tear-jerking. A young child is on a plane with her mother, and it crashes, killing the mother and leaving the child stranded on a small island. She is saved by a pod of dolphins and then lives there for 7 long years. She is found by the coastgard and sent to Boston, Mass. to study and rehabilitate. All Mila wants to do is go home to her aquatic family. Will mila ever make it back to the family that saved her from the craws of death? You must read the book to find out. I absolutely loved Music of the Dolphins. I think I look at animals differently now. I think anyone that likes animals, or wants a good book to read this is the one you should chose. You might even appreciate your life more, I sure have."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"A young girl is discovered swimming in the waters between Florida and Cuba, and when researchers bring her in, they learn that she has been living with dolphins, basically raised by them and taught to communicate and survive in their world. In the laboratory, where they attempt to teach her human speech and behavior, this girl they've named Mila makes slow progress, and eventually she must choose between living in their world and living in the one she has known for most of her life. This unusual, fascinating story is made even more so by the fact that it is told by Mila, and like Flowers for Algernon, we see her speech and behavior slowly improve as the story is told, and then decline as she realizes that she would rather live among the dolphins than with humans. An intriguing book that will appeal to anyone interested in psychology, especially the psychology of language acquisition and the stories of historical figures such as the Wild Boy of Averon and Genie."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"Have you ever wondered what it's like to be a dolphin?

Imagine being raised by dolphins. This is what happened to Mila,until she was forced from her home to an institution for wild children. There she befriends the doctors, a doctor's son, and a feral child named Shay. Mila becomes more and more human, while Shay regresses. The story reminded me a little bit of &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot;, although it's not nearly as sad. The ending was kind of weird. Why did she give up all her blessings? But I liked how the font shrunk as Mila's knowledge grew, then got big again when she began longing for the sea. She &quot;spoke&quot; poetically of the ocean and her dolphin family. Overall, this was a quick, entertaining read. Of course I reccomend it. What I need now is a sequel. What about Mila's human father?"},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"This book is about a girl named Mila. Mila survives a plane crash and is rescued by some dolphins when she is 3 years old.

She is worked with by Dr. Elizabeth Beck and a kind lady named Sandy. Mila makes rapid progress, but she longs for her real home, with the dolphins. She always tries to make the doctors happy.

I loved it. It has encouraged me to write more and has helped my imagination grow! I encourage many people to read this amazing book! It is like you are inside her. As you read this book you learn more about dolphins. One thing that is cool about the typing in this book is that it begins very big and gets small and then big again! Please read about Mila and her life out of the sea!"},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"You always read books about dolphins. Books that have no effect on you. Books you think back on and say, &quot;Oh yeah, that was an okay story.&quot; Lots of authors will spin a simple tale around the subject of dolphins because it's a popular topic that many people like. When I bought The Music of Dolphins at a book fair, I thought I was getting just that: a simple story about a girl raised by dolphins. Nothing new, nothing exciting, nothing captivating. Boy was I ever wrong.The Music of Dolphins features a teenage girl found off Cuba, in the midst of her only real family, a group of dolphins. Mila, as she is dubbed, speaks no language but the clicks and cries of her cousins, as she calls the animals. This incredible story follows her growth as a human, in her own simple writing, as she learns what she truly is, and what she truly wants to be. As she progresses she discovers more and more about what this life she's been forced into means, and the pain and sadness that come with it. You will truly feel Mila's emotions, and will cry when you realize the decision she makes at the end. Maybe it's the right one, and maybe it's not, but this profound story will make you think about who you are, through the eyes of a girl who is different in ways you can only imagine."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"The Music of Dolphins is emotionally and intellectually appealing to me. Emotionally, I felt for the young child as she struggled to understand her new environment as well as to recapture her old environment. Music played a large role in conveying the emotions of the young girl (Mila). But for me, music also played a huge role in my own emotions. As Mila poured herself into her music, I &quot;heard&quot; and &quot;felt&quot; the music in my heart. Karen Hesse said in Amazon.com's interview that she listened to a dolphin music CD while writing this book. And I believe her. Also emotionally, I grieved for Mila's determined decision to return. I felt that her return was susposed to be &quot;forever&quot; and so, I grieved for her. As she matures (puberty especially), the girl will find that her new environment is restrictive both emotionally and physically. (Perhaps a future sequel!) Intellectually, The Music of Dolphins appealed to me as well. The plot structure is set up both in story and in print. In the story, the plot is told progressive chronologically in Mila's own personal journal. Although she actually begins writing the journal after she is rescued (obviously), she backtracks to tell of her life immediately before the rescue. During the progression of her journal, she also delves information about her sea life. This use of flashback is effective in that we get to know her as she begins to &quot;articulately know&quot; herself. In print, we come to know Mila through her growth as a writer. Hesse brilliantly uses type of font and size to illustrate her progession and then regression. This technique reminds me of a beloved novel Flowers for Algernon. The content is much the same too. Needless to say, I have loved them both. I am a middle school Language Arts teacher. Each year, the book Island of the Blue Dolphins (another girl and dolphin story) is on the curriculum. Most 5th - 7th graders read this story in their English classes. Since I teach 8th grade, this novel is a good story to continue the study of realistic survival stories. (Even as a read-aloud, but only if you show the kids the change in the print.) Fall in love with the style and content of this book. At least, I can promise you will FEEL. (And sometimes we need little reminders that we are &quot;feeling&quot; creatures- whether we are human or animal or a combination of both!) :0)"},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"My name is Tamara and I am in fourth grade.

Mila, a &quot;rescued&quot; feral child, is fascinated by the human world, while also longing for her dolphin family. Her story is presented in the form of a journal as she learns English. Telling the story in large type and simple words at first, Mila quickly grasps the language and the type size and length of chapters change, only to return to the larger type and fewer words as Mila retreats from the human world. Her joy in the discovery of music gives her a link to the dolphins, but it is not enough to sustain her.

The doctor tried to help her by saying that she is a girl and not a dolphin, but the doctor tried to help her because she'd say that she is a dolphin and that she belongs in the ocean with the rest of them. The doctor thought if he brought in a girl named Sandy, who use o be like her, that help's people who think they are different and gets them the help they need. So a few days went by and her mother had to go to the doctor and check on her and see if she was doing fine, and she got much better.My message is for you to read it and please don't think you are a dolphin like the girl in the book thinks she is a dolphin. But after a while the girl gets help and feels normal like the rest of the kids.

I found this book to be unreasonably horrible. There didn't seem to be a poit to it; a first grader could have predicted what was going to happen. Plus a young, teenage girl couldn't live in the wild with dolphins for thirteen years of her life. It would be impossible. She would have either starved to death or been eaten or critically injured by a large animal. Then to try to teach this girl the way of people wouldn't be successfull. I believe that if this could happen any attempts to recover her would fail."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"(I would really rate this book a 3.5, but that is not an option in the Rating System Amazon.com has.)The Music Of Dolphins was a respectable book, but not one of the best I've read. It was interesting to see how Mila progressed in her learning, but it still didn't strike me as so &quot;wonderous.&quot; I can tell Karen Hesse worked hard on this project, but I also felt a strange feeling of been isolated when I read it, almost TOO isolated. Mila was so innocent and fragile - yet, it is not that hard to believe after coming from the ocean. It was a little hard-hitting, I suppose you could say. Some of my favorite parts of the book were when Hesse described Mila in the ocean, swimming with her dolphin friends. I compliment Hesse on this literature, but think she could write a better piece."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"I've read this book probably ten times or more since I had it when I was very young and I never quite understood why I liked it so much. I guess I relate to the main character. I know this is so strange, but I do. I'm not a feral child or anything. I know the feeling of missing, not necessarily home or family, but the feeling of missing a place of safety and a place where people understand and welcome you honestly with no expectations or lies. If you like this book, I highly highly recommend The Clan of the Cave Bear by Jean M. Auel. It explores the same themes of alienation and confusion from living in a culture different than your own."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"The reason I gave this 4 stars is because although I bought it \\"new\\", the book had noticeable scratches and wear on it, as well as a sticker."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"After Mila has lived on an unpopulated island for nine years, she is finally rescued and taken to people that will help her. Mila enjoys living life like a human, but many times she longs for her life with the dolphins once more. The more Mila learn the ways of humans, the more she yearns for her dolphin life again. A great book filled with plenty of surprises."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"Mila is found in an unpopulated island as a teenager. She's been raised by dolphins since a plane crash at the age of four. Mila is a feral child but quickly learns about English, music, and human nature when she is found and put into the hands of researchers.She learns about the bad sides of being a human, about territories and wars, and she longs for her dolphin family.This book displays excellent examples of thought processes and you see Mila's thoughts become more intelligent as she progresses in her learning. It is a very simple style of writing like Steinbeck's The Pearl.I love this book because it makes you think and see animals as more human and looks at humans from a different perspective. it is splendidly told and I highly recommend it to anyone.E @ 3 Book BeesOriginally posted @ [...]Ima swagbucks superstar @ [...]"},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"I've had this book for a very long time. And I've probably read it about once a year. Even though its a children's book, it is very thought provoking.Mila is a young girl who, after her capture by humans, goes to live in a research house where they teach her language, music, and other necessary skills. You see, Mila had been living with dolphins for the greater portion of her life, surviving in the sea and knowing nothing else. Of course the change is a great shock to her but she gradually adapts even though she doesn't always know why the people around her do the things they do or want her to do certain things. But as time goes on, Mila feels more and more the call of the sea and her home with the dolphins.Mila's a great character. Since you progress with her through the book it is very easy to tell her emotions and thoughts and line them up with everything that's happening to her. The other characters I wasn't quite as fond of, but then again we are seeing them through Mila's eyes so however she's feeling is how they are described. Sandy, out of all the other characters, was probably the most empathetic but Mila had a fondness for Justin too that shines through.The was this book was written was very interesting actually. The language and text changes as Mila learns and it goes from very basic large text and words to more intricate as her vocabulary expands. When she's talking about her time with the dolphins and thinking its the most clear and poetic of all. I actually really liked the format and thought it interesting. This would be an easy book for kids to read as there's not a lot of unknown vocabulary or concepts, but it teaches them to empathize with other people.Great children's novel and thought provoking book for any reader. I highly recommend it.The Music of DolphinsCopyright 1996181 pagesReview by M.

In an attempt to avoid procrastinating until the week before school starts to have the required reading finished, I made her start it the first week school was out for summer. She had it finished in less than 24 hours and LOVED it. I was shocked. She is actually motivated now to read the additional 3 books she has to read. YEA!!!"},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"I had read the music of the dolphins when i was just a young teen and recently i began to search for this book so i could revist the lingering memories i could never seem to escape. Its about a girl who grew up living with dolphins. Dolphins took her into their family and watched out for her and its when she gets older she is spoted and taking back into society. And obviously she doesnt fit in. cant speak. dont know how to eat human food. and she doesnt understand the rules. The author writes from the little girls perspective and i really became attatched to the characture. The girl wants to go home, to the dolphins. and there is the conflict because she cant. her care takers legally cant just throw her back to the sea. Oh i was so excited that this book was just as engaging to me now as it was when i was younger. And the text changes with the progress of the girl. At first its really big text and in the middle it gets back to normal. i thought it was very creative.wonderful book for ALL ages"},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"You have no memory of humanity. You've lived with dolphins your entire existence, according to your memory. You know you are different, but so is a dolphin missing a flipper. Life isn't idyllic; sharks, giant squid, thirst, hunger, poisonous fish, and orcas are all to be faced, everyday, and you have the experiences, and scars, to prove it.Then, you are \\"rescued.\\" You have value, not because you are a very rare example of a \\"feral person,\\" but really because you speak... dolphin.This happens to Mila. She begins to learn the human language, our culture. But walls? Locks? Deception? She pines for her dolphin family, but also cares for her adopted human family who care for her as part of a federal research project.Author Karen Hesse writes in a style of an awakening for Mila, from a conscious being engaged in the sea to an aware and articulate teenager, who suddenly understands what she has lost, and gained.A similar experience happened to a young boy named Tarzan, as I remember.Easy to read, with a lingering flavor that begs for another book to tell more of Mila's life."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"There are many ways to discuss, appreciate & analyze this book. A lot of it is busily going on here among the reviews. I have been reading it to my fifth grader (boy) as a bedtime story. At first I had my doubts about the style, thinking it was perhaps dubiously precious or overly self-conscious. It is in fact pure poetry. Very interesting.I don't think my son considers it verse, the way he enjoys Richard Scarry's Nursery Rhymes or Dr. Seuss. I think he likes it for the simple and straightforward progress of the words. It is easy for him to follow, and he hasn't been falling asleep on me.So it works for both of us. Because it is so deceptively simple, I think one might read it too fast if one were not reading it aloud. Give it a try if you have the chance."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"This is an awsome book and Ms. Hesse has a very creative imagination. I do encourage this book and really hope you like it. I like the discriptive writing she uses like when Mila says &quot;sometimes the thick fishy milk&quot;.I also like the way she makes the print big at first and gets smaller to show Mila's progress. What I admire most about this book is what the book is about. I don't think a lot of people would have come up with such an original idea."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"I really liked this book. It's about a girl that is found off the coast of Florida.She is taken and owned by the government.She lives w/Dr.Beck, Sandy,Dr.Troy,Justin,and Shay.She learns to act human.From dressing to playing a recorder.She writes in her journal,plays w/Shay(a friend w/ her at the clinic),reads,and plays music. She tries to understand the doctors.The more she understands the human world the more she longs for the sea.I really liked this book.Although it's not my favorite it's very close.Ms.Hesse put so much feeling and discription that it was like I was watching it and like I was actually there.It is a book that I think everyone should read."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"This book was about a girl who has been living with dolphins for about 10 years and some cost guards find her. This book theaches what problems being human can have and how sometimes less inteligent species have better lives than we do."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"I am in fourth grade and I just recently finished this book in school. If I didn't have to read this book I probably wouldn't have but I did and I liked it a lot. My favorite thing was how the books print changed depending on how smart Mila was. Alought, there are so many books in the world that I could have found a book that was a lot better but still it's really hard to write a good book."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"I teach fourth and fifth grades. My students just finished reading &quot;Island of the Blue Dolphins&quot;. I wanted my students to read this book so that we could then compare both female heroines. &quot;Music of the Dlophins&quot; is an unbelievably touching book. Karen Hesses is a genius! Not only does she show Mila's progress through her short choppy style, she also alters the font as Mila's progress shifts. The book provides a unique view into the animal world. A world where anger does not exist, and where all there is to do is play and be together. Where the young are raised in a group and cared for. Where an outsider is taken in an cared for no questions asked even though she is different. The subplot with fellow feral child Shay is heart-wrenching. Every fifth grade child should be exposed to this modern masterpiece, whether they read it alone or aloud in class. It will change how they think about the environment and teach them how to care for others who may be different."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"I think that this book give an increidible look at being human. It shows the struggle between animal and human. I highly recomend this book!"},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"This book is a simple story that explores some complex aspects of what it means to be human. It is good for readers from age 10. I am 37 and enjoyed it very much."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"this was a good book because at first it was a simple book, like a child's book but it got harder to read around chapter twelve. I have read other books like out of the dust, which was ok but I think it was a better book because out of the dust was like a book of poems that connected at the end, but music of the dolphins is an emotional story."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"it was kinda cool the way mila described everything w/so much detailed expression--brings meaning to the comment read it and weep."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"Mila (the main characters name, Spainish for miracle,)is rescued by the coast gaurd after living with the dolphins for about 10 years.

I highly recommend this book to girls and boys ages 9-13"},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"I really liked this book because it's in diary form. Like the main character, Mila, is actually writing the book. I liked the feeling that I was in the story. I also like this story because I thought it was interesting the Mila functioned and thought. Since she was raised by dolphins, there is a distinct characteristic of her manner. Thirdly, I liked this story because the ending was to my satisfactory. I was little surprised about how it ended but I like surprises in a book.When Mila's friend,Shay brakes Mila's musical recorder, Mila is devastated. She is so confused about Shay and this distorts her whole view on the human race. I think this is the worst part in the book because I kind of get attached to Mila and when she's sad, I guess I get a little sad too.I can see when Mila's nuerological doctor brings in a tape player and plays a whale song on it to Mila. Mila gets so excited! She then asks her doctor where the whales are. The doctor explains to her that it's a recording. Although Mila's sad it's not the real thing, she is happy that she gets a little taste of &quot;home&quot;. Another vivid moment is when she's in her room and she wants to leave for some reason. It's in the middle of the night and the door is locked. She suddenly gets scared, lonely, and confused. She starts banging on the door with her hands, crying. The window on the door breaks. Her hands bleed badly. I see this moment vividly because there is so much action described. Plus, there's blood, which always sticks in people's minds."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"This book had an excellent plot and I found it easy. altogether a good read.

The vocabulary that's used maybe be for a lower grade level but it is a unforgettably great book. The characters, as far reaching as it may seem, are believable. Hesse truely tried to see through Mia's eyes. I agree with another reviewer about how Hesse changed the font size on-goingly through the book, it was something I'd never seen before. If you're thinking about buying this book for yourself or a loved one, do it. You won't be dissappointed!"},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"Mila becomes famous when she is discovered on an uninhabited island between Florida and Cuba.

Her government funding stops and she leaves Milan and the scientists much to Mila's dismay.

It is about Mila, a 'wild child' who has lived with dolphins her whole life. At the beggining of the book, the writing is big, and the language simple, but as she becomes more accustomed to living with humans, and better at speaking, the language becomes more complex, and the writing smaller. But when she wants to return to the sea and the life that she knows, the style of writing returns to it's original style and language.

She is then brought to a ficilty to be studied by Docter Beck, Shay, Doctor Troy, and an assortment of others. Her knowlege grows throughout various experiences. But she eventually decides that humans can be humans--but she is meant a dolphin. (Chapter 47 only contains one sentence: I must get back to the sea.)While this is extreamly easy reading, it is a book to be given only to advanced readers. The lessons, point, and values presented here clearly make this Heese's strongest novel to date. Her story evolves into much more than a telling of Milla's speech devolpment. She devolps, too, character values that are key to any life. In addition to this, she aqires vast knowlege, experiences, and memories that question the very point of human life. It is cruel to lock doors, and to put shut someone away, to cutt them off. It is cruel to control. It is cruel to have no emotion...to treat one as something to be studied instead of a being with feelings. These are all lessons Milla learns, and they result in heartbreak and broken promises. It results in a hauntingy unforgetable novel...that will ask you some very important questions about life, love, family, friends, and the freedom of one being. This is one of the best books I have ever read....This will leave you thinking about it long after...and will force you to answer the question:WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE HUMAN?Read this book and then decide for yourself.

Will Mila be reunited with her Fishy Family? I know what you're thinking. I'm not telling you. You will have to read it like everyone else.I loved how this book was put into autobiographical form. Because it is written from the point of view of Mila, as her vocabulary and her knowledge grow the story becomes more and more complicated.

It's about a girl that was raised by dolphins. The name of the girl is Mila.Mila was taken to doctors so they could teach her English because Mila made squeaky noises like dolphin language. After a couple of weeks Mila started to get better at English. There was a scientist who was a doctor too. Her name was Doctor Beck. Doctor Beck was really interested in Mila. She wanted to know everything she could about Mila's dolphin life. When Mila was learning English Mila sounded really funny. That reminded me of when my sister was learning English. She sounded really funny.I think Karen Hesse writes really well because when she started to describe the house and the ocean you could picture it easily. Her writing is fantastic. This story is kind of sad because Doctor Beck tells Mila always that she is here to help her but she only wants Mila so she could get a lot of information and be richThis book is a great book that l would recommend for all ages.

It was wonderful."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"This book was so good I loved it. I have read this book 7 times and I am going to read it again. I would rate this book more then 5 stars if I could. READ THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"This book is made for all ages even if you cannot read ask your parents to read it to you. When you first look at the first chapter you will see really big letters you will think that the whole book is like that but no. The girl in the story is learning how to read and write so the typing starts off big and then goes to small script."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"The music of Dolphins is a fantastic book! It is very very well written. I felt like a movie(the book)was playing around me! I read it every moment of spare time I had, Which I made sure was alot. This book is the best book I have ever read!! If you had to buy only one book this year make this book be it!!!! P.S I have about 150 chapter books on my bookshelf, so I read alot!!!"},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"The Music of Dolphins was written well, but wan't the greatest book. It wasn't as good as Out of the Dust which was written by the same author."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"I really enjoyed this book. When I read it I could picture myself in her place. I really knew what she was feeling and what she was going through. My younger sister who owns this book also read it and thought it was a fantastic book to read. I'd recommend this story to anyone because it is really easy to understand."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"In The Music of Dolphins there is a girl named Mila who was raised by dolphins. It is a fiction book. It takes place in the present.No one believed her that she was raised by dolphins. Mila has to stay in a place, a building by the ocean, with Doctor Beck and Sandy. They teach her how to talk in human. Mila has to chose to either go to the ocean or stay with Doctor Beck and Sandy.You can find out the rest by reading the book. You should read this book because it has excitement. You would not want to put the book down. Even though the book is fiction it pulls you into The Music of Dolphins. I like this book because I like dolphins and the book has to do with dolphins. So if you are not into dolphins you won't like this book."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"Great book for young readers! When I read it i could picture everything that was happening I could feel her anger I could feel everything that was happening to her! Great book!"},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"Music of the dolphins was written by Karen Hessein in 1996. This story takes place in the coast of Florida. Mila goes to a big city so scientists can study her. Mila was a little girl when she survived a plane crash and lives with dolphins untill Dr. Beck(she)and Sandy find her and try to learn the dolphin language. I also thought it would end in a different way and so will you. So suspect a little somthing at the end. I recommend this book to everyone who loves reading books especially the people who don't really like to read because this book will turn your dislike for books up side down."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"I read this story as a report but I received a lot more from it than just as a report. I learned important things from this book. This story is mainly about a girl who was in an airplane crash that was over the ocean where she grew up with dolphins. Many years after the crash she is found and taken back to the United States. There, doctors teach her how to talk, play the recorder and other things children are taught. She learns to love and when two doctors take her to the ocean to the dolphins she- wait! I don't want to spoil the whole story! I highly recommend reading this classical book only Karen Hesse could have written,added with her own touch of perfection. Please read it and treasure it"},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"My friend saw this book,I thought it looked pretty stupid ,then all my friends were reading ,see I only like horror books but I decided to read it I loved this book I could not put it down!"},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"For one point, Dolphins have always been a favorite topic of mine, so in reading that this girl--Mila, was raised by Dolphins untill her &quot;rescue&quot; was of course a book I just had to read. I was a bit surprised that the lettering was a bit large in the early parts of the book, but I understood that it was because this story was mostly in Mila's (the main character) perspective--in which, she hardly spoke English that well. &quot;The Music of Dolphins&quot; is a great book, it told of Mila's experience being in society and with her own kind. She compares life as a human to that of when she was with the Dolphins from her earlier life and knows that she longs to be back with her ocean family. The book pulled me in and I ended up finishing the book the day I got it. This was an excellent story of a 'wild' girl who learned what being human (again) was like, but better longed for her earlier 'second' family."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"I loved this book! I'm in the 6th grade and I thought it was wonderful! Awe inspiring.It makes you think about our relationship with dolphins.We act (some of us) as if they aren't as smart and as if they have no feelings.They have much more intamate feelings then we do.They've mourned thier dead long before we started to have relationships.Dolphins are really amazing as this book proves.Read it!"},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"The different fonts took a while to get used to, but it was very interesting.

It kept me reading all night and every time i went to my cousins I asked for this book and when she got fed up with it she gave it to me. I still read it at least 1 a week. I think it should win the newberry award."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"As a girl, I never really went in for dolphin stuff. Other girls did. They'd read \\"Island of the Blue Dolphins\\" and \\"A Ring of Endless Light\\" just to feel like they had some kind of connection to those slippery sea-mammals. Had \\"The Music of Dolphins\\" existed when I as growing up, I've little doubt I would have written it off as yet another girl-loves-dolphins tale. It is that, to some extent, but it's also a mighty fine foray into what it means to be a human being. Now I've always kept a wary distance from Karen Hesse. I've read her \\"Out of the Dust\\" and respected it without really falling whole-heartedly in love with it. \\"Dolphins\\" is more accessible than \\"Out of the Dust\\" and is probably the best beloved out of all of Hesse's work (as other reviews here will attest). It's your average death of innocence story but without the usual ain't-humanity-grand ending.When Mila is discovered by the Coast Guard on a remote island between Florida and Cuba, she is instantly a celebrity. One of the rare \\"wild children\\" found in the world and raised sometimes by animals, Mila has been living with a school of dolphins since she was a very young girl. She is instantly claimed by the American government and put under the care of Dr. Elizabeth Beck, a research professor of cognitive and neural systems. Throughout the book we watch as Mila moves from simple ideas and words to far more complex reasonings and sentences. She lives in a facility with Shay, a girl raised wild like Mila but trapped in a dark room by her mother for most of her life. As Mila progresses, Shay regresses. It is only as Mila understands her role in the world and where she truly wishes to belong that she is able to break free of the laboratory setting and find her way back to her original family.Of course, the book this reminded me of right off the bat was Jane Yolen's 1984 fellow wild-child title, \\"Children of the Wolf\\". It doesn't take much in the way of brain power to work out that that particular book was far more lupine and less than friendly than Hesse's contribution to the genre. Hesse makes gentle comparisons between Shay's situation when growing up and Mila's. Dolphins are uniquely caring creatures so it doesn't seem too much of a stretch to assume that they might go one step further and care for a baby human should the need arise. In her note to the book, Hesse had this to say of the story: \\"The Music of Dolphins began as a book about speak development, and evolved into something very different... Mila proved to me she was more than a clinical specimen, just as she did to the characters in the book\\".There are some loose ends, of course. It's a little difficult to believe that dolphins would understand basic human needs like fresh water and the fact that fish bones get caught in infant throats. There's also the ending. I'll give some of it away so if you're looking to be surprised, go no further. In the end Mila joins her dolphin family once more and lives happily ever after, the end. Of course, Dr. Beck has been threatened with jail time if Mila is ever allowed to go free. We never learn what happens to Dr. Beck, and I suppose that's for the best. Mila certainly doesn't care and her willingness to forgo the charms of the human world is convincing.Admittedly, this was not one of Hesse's stronger books. It's perfectly nice and well-written and everything, but aside from those readers with a strong affinity for dolphin tales, Hesse will be better remembered for her \\"Witnesss\\", \\"Out of the Dust\\", and \\"Letters From Rifka\\". It's a nice tale and a good idea. Nothing spectacular. Just nice."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"I think &quot;The Music of Dolphins&quot; by Karen Hesse, is apretty good book. It is definitely not the best book I have ever read,though. I think that this book is written in a different way, that makes it seem more for 4-7 graders.

They work with her on the computer. A little while later she gets a letter from her Dad to come meet her in Poland. You will have to read the book to find out the rest. This is a very good book.

I disliked when they give almost everything away, like when she goes swimming she sees people in white and it's obvious their doctors. I liked the book because the author allows you to picture everything.I rated it 3 because it gives important beginnings and ends away, and also I thought they described everything that happens so you can just tell what the end is going to be. I loved the words the used to describe each character.I would recommend this book for second graders because some would like the sea and others the dolphins and its description."},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"sssssssssssooooooooggggggggggggoooooooooooooooooooooooddddddddddddddddddddd i loved it my friend loved and every one else who read it that i know loved it. you have to get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Music of Dolphins","review":"In my opinion, this is a great book for someone who loves dolphins.

Romance and suspense follow her as she learns how to deal with relationships and eventually learns to fly the craft herself.

The whole weekend was devoted to haunted places--so why eat in a regular, non-haunted restaurant? You get a nice history of the building and its previous uses (if any), the folks who used it while in the flesh, and those (in spirit) who are purported to inhabit it now.If you enjoy this kind of thing (and I do), use this very handy book to add some interest and variety to a trip or just find new ''haunts'' in your own city. Most haunted places are also historic or older buildings, so you get an extra treat in seeing some unique architecture. So even if haunted isn't your thing, but historic is, this is a great book.Be sure to call first to verify hours and if the building is still standing. Unfortunately, one highly haunted tavern in Houston was bulldozed to make room for a modern bookstore. When traveling to any city in Texas, I will always consult this book for unique and special places to enjoy food or a beer."},{"Title":"Texas Guide to Haunted Restaurants, Taverns, and Inns","review":"it was very specific with addresses and phone numbers and the legends as well.

The first 40+ pages explain Mr. Fernandez' symbolism of Neptune and unique system of interpretation which, in simple terms, tells that we are all at our own level of experience and mastery with this vast symbol.The book is actually a mini crash course in learning this methodology. The method includes neptune and the 12th house as the indicators for career, a shocking idea which nevertheless seems to work. It is a lot of information. Once you grasp the layout you can easily identify how neptune is operating in your current reality, something other books on this planet lack, they rather leave you thinking you are in a collective stream of mythology that will make or break you with no explaination on how to be proactive with it.4 stars for the wealth of unique information3 stars for the format which seems to need more clarity and a bit more editing."},{"Title":"Neptune, the 12th House and Pisces","review":"This revolutionary book blew me away!

What many of us may not know are the particular incidents, decisions, and qualities which created the most extraordinary figure in out political history. In this one - volume biography of Abraham Lincoln, Benjamin P. Thomas presents all the significant events and achievements in the life of one of the greatest presidents, and greatest men, in American history. These achievements, Thomas maintains, are a matter of record. There is none of the easy myth - making and hero worship that often mar both longer and shorter biographical treatments. In Abraham Lincoln readers will find little of the lyrical and romanticized Lincoln, nor will they encounter the historically possible but imagined situations which sometimes adorn Carl Sandburg's narrative. What they will find is a full account of the rise to power of a skillful politician and complicated man, who took on an enourmous amount of personal and public responsibility during the greatest crisis in our nation's history. Clearly an admirer of our sixteenth president, Thomas allows the story of Lincoln's successes and failures, and his priviate tragedies, to take its natural course to a regrettable and unnatural end. He permits both the character of the man and the weighty, worrisome decisions of the president to speak eloquently for themeselves. In summing up the Lincoln legacy, Thomas achieves an eloquence of his own: Lincoln saw his countrymen as inheritors of a trust. To them it had been given to make democracy succeed, to cleanse it of the hypocrisies that deprive it of its just example in the world. For in democracy, made genuine, he saw our last, best hope of frustrating any tyrant who seeks to regiment or debase or mislead any people, anywhere and of achieving peace on earth and good will among men and woman through the universal liberty of mankind."},{"Title":"Abraham Lincoln: A biography (A Modern Library Giant #G64)","review":"I have been studying Abraham Lincoln for nearly 40 years. Many Lincoln scholars consider ABRAHAM LINCOLN: A BIOGRAPHY by Benjamin P. Thomas to be one of the three best one-volume biographies of Lincoln written to date. The other two books are LINCOLN by David Herbert Donald and WITH MALICE TOWARD NONE by Stephen B. Oates."},{"Title":"Abraham Lincoln: A biography (A Modern Library Giant #G64)","review":"Very readable one volume life of Lincoln. Pulled things together in a way Sandburg's six volume masterpeice could not. A case of not being able to see the forest for the trees. And made utterly clear exactly what Lincoln was fighting for: that democracy as evidenced by the people's vote at the ballot box might survive as an example to the world. If all the states had voted in elections to let the succeeding states go, then OK. But there was no such election. It was always the Union, never slavery, that was his purpose, although he understood slavery to be at the heart of the matter."},{"Title":"Abraham Lincoln: A biography (A Modern Library Giant #G64)","review":"As a teenager I remember to have read a biography by Emil Ludwig that I disliked because, by the end of it, Lincoln had become a spotless person and whatever he did or said was praised beyond measure.Thompson's biography is different. Pursuant to Michael Burlingame's foreword, this work, which was written more than half a century ago, has passed the test of time with brilliant qualifications. In my opinion, this is a sober biography of Lincoln, showing him as a good and very balanced, down-to-earth, person, but not a saint or angelic figure, a long-limbed man of wit, shrewd politician, somehow socially awkward... A man in flesh and bone with virtues and defects.I think that the professional historian and the educated layperson alike can savour this book, and my rate is 5 (content) and 5 (pleasure).In addition to Thomas' classical biography, I also suggest reading the following books: 1) \\"Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era\\" by James M. McPherson (nowadays the standard, very readable, one-volume history of US Civil War); 2) \\"Perilous Times: Free Speech in Wartime: From the Sedition Act of 1798 to the War on Terrorism\\" by Geoffrey R. Stone, specially chapter II \\"The Civil War: Mr. Lincoln's First Amendment\\" (in fact, all the book is worth-reading); and 3) \\"Lincoln's Constitution\\" by Daniel A. Farber (not enthralling if compared to McPherson's and Stone's, but nevertheless interesting)."},{"Title":"Abraham Lincoln: A biography (A Modern Library Giant #G64)","review":"Over a half century after this book appeared, it is still the standard by which all one-volume Lincoln biographies are measured, and a reminder of how much we lost by the author's premature death when he was just hitting his stride as a Lincoln scholar and writer."},{"Title":"Abraham Lincoln: A biography (A Modern Library Giant #G64)","review":"I have previously read a couple of books about Lincoln, enough to whet my appetite for a thorough biography. I am half way through this book and I'm enjoying the treat of reading about a man who moved ahead in politics while holding uncompromisingly to his principles and ideals which were to a very large extent influenced by his reading of the Bible. I doubt this man would last two weeks in politics today. He clearly possessed superior analytical thinking ability and he definitely earned and deserved the nick-name 'Honest Abe' which makes it easy to like him. The book itself shows honesty in not portraying him as something more than human. The errors of his youth are included in the story enabling the reader realistically to follow Lincoln's learning curve in life.The book is well written and on rare occasion adds a word to my vocabulary which I appreciate. If a very uncommon word happens to be the exactly right one, the author uses it, to the benefit of the reader. After all, words are what we think with.I chose this biography because it was first published in 1952. I expected, correctly as I think it turned out, that the book would give a more straightforward picture of Lincoln. It is without the tendency of some modern authors, who admire Lincoln but don't share his esteem of Scripture, to surmise, for example, that his frequent borrowing of Biblical expressions was merely a matter of Lincoln playing up to his listeners and not evidence of personal convictions. This attributes to Lincoln an insincerity of which he was obviously incapable.The story of course also visits a mentality that existed amongst a substantial population in pre-Emancipation days. It portrays widespread reasoning and attitude toward race that today is appalling. Yet, as Lincoln acknowledged, it was largely based on people inheriting their circumstances and environment, not personally inventing it. He had initially hoped, in vain, that the passage of time and increase in public understanding would gradually shrink slavery right out of existence. We can wonder what widespread reasonings and attitudes people are accepting right now that will later be shown up as appalling.I'll add a little more to this when I've finished the book. It is a superb biography and even the physical book itself is very well made.Additional Comments: Having now finished the book I can say it is a very satisfying read and teaches much about the era and its issues as well as the man. It ends rather abruptly following the assassination and I would have appreciated a bit more about its aftermath, but altogether this book met my high expectations."},{"Title":"Abraham Lincoln: A biography (A Modern Library Giant #G64)","review":"This book is fifty seven (57) years old but it is still living and breathing today.

This book is providing me with answers to all the questions I felt were unanswered on the TV biography."},{"Title":"Abraham Lincoln: A biography (A Modern Library Giant #G64)","review":"I have read several books on Lincoln. Recently I purchased this book at my father's request, who is far more expert than I am. Other biographers refer to this as the definitive book, which is why he had to have it.Battle Cry of freedom is a 'cracker of a read' by James McPherson, according to my father, and won the Pulitzer Prize. This author has written several books on Lincoln, and the Civil War.As for this book, it's very good, and Benjamin Thomas is very concerned with factual accuracy. For example, he will not make up stuff if he unsure on the details. He will say he does not know, so it's easy to distinguish between fact and conjecture.The books I have read tend be more about the assassination. If that topic interests you, I recommend:If you have further interest in this topic I recommend the books:Blood on the Moon: The Assassination of Abraham Lincoln, a tremendously lucid account of events, which ties up the loose ends, particularly what happened with John Surratt. He was tried for the same crime, in a civilian court but not on the same facts. He does explore the legal standards in defining what a conspiracy is which I found helpful, and many other things.American Brutus: John Wilkes Booth and the Lincoln Conspiracies:, explores not only the conspiracy, but also the life of John Wiles Booth, giving a full background. He did play the role of Brutus in a play, and so there are parallels between art and life.Manhunt: The 12-Day Chase for Lincoln's Killer (P.S.)(P.S.), which reads like a fast paced thriller while sticking to the facts.To a somewhat lesser degree The Assassin's Accomplice: Mary Surratt and the Plot to Kill Abraham Lincoln. I have browsed through this one numerous times at the local bookstore, yet have been reluctant to buy it. For one thing, she glosses over the habeas corpus issue, giving it half a page. She does not tie up the loose end of what happened with John Surratt like Steers does. She also concludes Surratt's guilt, yet I found her reasoning somewhat suspect. Her book ties in with the movie,The Conspirator (Two-Disc Collector's Edition), yet I prefer that Redford allows us to make up our own minds.I hope this review was helpful."},{"Title":"People Who Met Jesus: 7 Seeker Bible Discussions (Saltshaker Resources Saltshaker Resources)","review":"This was very helpful resorce as I put together a lesson for a bible study class for my jail ministry work."},{"Title":"Magruder's American government","review":"This is the current Texas Edition Book.

The fascinating thing is that it is not a religious journey but rather an amazing, spiritual one.This is a book to be read more than once and to keep as a reference and as a reminder of the divinity inside each human being.I strongly recommend this book to anyone in search of spirituality.

However, we have nothing else in common. This Kara was a part-time hang gliding instructor who immediately quit when a stray wind blew her into a tree. Wimp. Kara's strong points are that she likes to bake and handles teenagers, part of her job as a music teacher. Our hero, Cole Winslow, is a K-9 officer who rescues her from the tree. While it is refreshing to read novels containing characters with pasts, sometimes authors tend to dwell on it a bit much. This book also commits the sin of throwing our protagonists into the middle of a relationship within days. The story goes: Kara's ex-husband and father of her son was a loser who spent all their money on get-rich-quick schemes and wound up in prison. Cole's ex-wife was in a rock band and, after selfishly ignoring his needs for several years, she died in a car accident. Kara is afraid she won't meet someone she can rely on and Cole is still sniveling that relationships aren't for him, even as he pursues Kara. They finally get over it and, after hanging out together a couple of times, they decide to get married. The book was not badly written; just not for me. Give me a heroine who can make cookies and indulge in extreme sports. And for God's sake, give your characters some time to get to know each other before they get married. Courage Bay is losing its luster because some romance authors just don't know how to give us some adventure."},{"Title":"IT'S THE GREAT PUMPKIN.

CHARLIE BROWN IN FULL COLOR","review":"As the season of autumn moves us from the beautiful landscape of garden colors, we find ourselves walking through a path of yellows, golds, oranges, greens, and browns. What better activity to enjoy than the reading of \\"It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown\\", or if possible, viewing the VHS or DVD.I will look at the book, once again, as I have for so many years, some of which were in the classrooms of life, both in school and wherever else we may have been. I remember the many times I read this story to the children, trying to encourage them to hold on to hope, always. Just as in the story itself, there were skeptics who complained that this story was not valuable, these same \\"skeptics\\", that is doubters, walked through their lives just as the characters in the story.Charlie is watching as Linus is writing a letter to the Great Pumpkin, in hopes of seeing him on Halloween night. This has gone on for several years; it's a ritual with Linus, like the ritual of waiting for Santa Claus on Christmas Eve. Many of the characters in the Peanuts Gang, laugh and make fun of Linus' devotion to waiting for the Great Pumpkin. The only character who just might think the Great Pumpkin will come is Sally, the little blond whispy haired girl who has a crush on Linus. She just glows when Linus speaks and she hopes that the Great Pumpkin will show himself. Even she is a reminder that we all need someone to believe in us.As the story moves along, we all know, each of the characters has his or her hopes of getting bags of Halloween candy, cookies, and apples; some get rocks. Why? It's kind of a tradition to give rocks or stones to kids either because they need to behave better, or because someone wants to mess with them.In the meantime, Sally is sitting with Linus, as the evening moves along and clouds darken, leaving only shadows to experience. All the other kids are checking out their goodie bags, their treat bags; some are grumbling, while others are sincerely glad to receive whatever is in their bags. Be sincere, it's in your best interest to \\"be happy with what you've got\\".Snoopy has his own adventure, flying a World War I plane in a desert; Snoopy is a dreamer and has quite an imagination, as he finds himself imagining being back in the countryside of France, on his way to victory, he has all kinds of adventures.As the story unfolds, that means, develops, Sally and Linus realize that the Great Pumpkin hasn't come; Linus adds his classic comment: \\"Wait until next year, I'll be waiting for the Great Pumpkin to come.\\" You see, Linus \\"NEVER GIVES UP\\"; he has hope and he believes that his hope is strong enough to make it happen. So, you too, don't give up, keep hoping! This goes for grown-ups, too.So, why would I review this book, after so many reviews, and after so many people know this story? I do so, because there are a lot believers out there, like You and Me, who need to be encouraged into believing that our positive thoughts will make the situation or wish come true, that hope is a necessary part of life. All you need to do is, .....believe!Now, once again, I will put this old copy of the book back on the shelf, until the next time I need to read it."},{"Title":"IT'S THE GREAT PUMPKIN.

True, the story has been trimmed down some. But most of the elements are still there: Linus' desperate hoping, Charlie Brown's holey costume, Lucy putting her brother to bed. The illustration look almost identical to the drawings of the beloved Schulz and if it weren't for the fact that Paige Braddock's name appears on the title page, one wouldn't be able to tell the difference.

I happened to have the original 1968 paperback of this book which I have read and re-read since I was a child, and this 2008 version just can't compare.Basically, this is an abridged version of Charles M. Schultz's classic Halloween tale. Megan E. Bryant, who is credited with adapting the text, did a great disservice to this story. Among the atrocities, she obliterated the beginning, left out most of Snoopy's adventure as the WWI Flying Ace, she edited down the story between Linus and Sally and waiting for the Great Pumpkin (not to mention leaving out Linus' search for the Most Sincere Pumpkin Patch) and cut Linus's usual philosophical musings at the end. She makes Charlie Brown seem more like a chump than Schultz ever would have. The illustrations stay true to Schult's form, but some scenes have been spliced with others so that, again, it's an abridged version of the original."},{"Title":"IT'S THE GREAT PUMPKIN.

I really liked this book because it is Charlie Brown and he is the bomb.[cool] I really recommend this book because it is really funny and you should read it."},{"Title":"IT'S THE GREAT PUMPKIN. CHARLIE BROWN IN FULL COLOR","review":"I almost feel like a traitor saying anything less than praise for this book featuring the Peanuts Gang created originally by Charles M. Schulz. I, like millions of others, grew up with Charlie Brown, Lucy, Linus, Violet, Snoopy, Pig Pen, Schroeder, and Sally. Every year at Halloween I looked forward to seeing the story of sincere Linus waiting for the Great Pumpkin in the pumpkin patch. This book contains all the characters and it re-tells essentially the same story but it has been illustrated by Paige Braddock rather than Schulz and adapted by Justine and Ron Fontes and seems to have lost something in the process. The Peanuts gang always was kind of surly with each other, calling names like Blockhead, pulling footballs out from each other and laughing at one another's expense. In this story, of course, Linus is the brunt of the teasing because he has undying faith in the mythical Great Pumpkin. For years I loved watching the Charlie Brown cartoon specials, the catchy piano jazz theme and the short, big-headed kids with their flat feet and funny facial expressions. Who could help loving Snoopy as the Red Baron or little Woodstock? These cartoons have always had a decidedly adult sense of humor, sometimes rather dark humor even though children the world over have loved the cartoon kids themselves.This book doesn't work, in my opinion, precisely because it is NOT the TV movie. As a picture book it is placed directly into the world of children's literature and as such, the innocence of the readership makes satire seem inappropriate and it comes off as bad-tempered, impatient and indifferent to the feelings of others. This is not something I want to convey to children and it is not something I like to see done to a classic. Most of the pictures show facial expressions on the kids that are either discouraged, sad, taunting or angry. There's even anguish on one little face. There are only a few smiles.It is touted as the 35th Anniversary edition but it really doesn't celebrate much of an anniversary because it is an off-shoot of the real thing...sadly not too close to the real thing, in fact. I got this book because I had feelings of fond nostalgia for Linus and his vigil in the pumpkin patch but it made me question why I ever liked it in the first place, and that's sad."},{"Title":"IT'S THE GREAT PUMPKIN.

While Charles Schulz is sadly missed, executive producer Lee Mendelson and animator Bill Melendez serve up many interesting tidbits. It's surprising to hear how tentative the TV execs were, even after the monster hit that the Peanuts gang delivered with their Christmas special. At the time, Halloween was not the powerhouse holiday that it is today in the US.This book contains the full script, along with never-before-seen photographs, storyboard excerpts, production materials, and interviews with the original child actors (who changed every few years as their voices changed).

Growing up in central New York state, I'd been a Yankee fan for my entire childhood, and remembered Bouton pitching for the Yanks in the World Series in the early '60s. In \\"Ball Four\\", Bouton touches on those days, in the process demythologizing some of my heroes--Mickey Mantle and Whitey Ford in particular--but I wasn't bitter; I was fascinated with the stories of how my athletic heroes behaved as human beings.Even better were Bouton's diary accounts of his days as a reliever with the Seattle Pilots, a one-year team that quickly moved to Milwaukee and exists today as the Brewers, and with the Houston Astros (featuring future Hall of Famer Joe Morgan and managed by Harry \\"The Hat\\" Walker\\". How else would I remember that the manager of that team was Joe Schulz, a crusty old baseball lifer whose two favorite \\"words\\" would be sure to get this review removed from view (the first started with F and ended with T, the second started with S and ended with K). As an ex-Cardinal, Schulz exhorted his players to \\"get the win and go in to \\"pound that B...weiser\\". As a 16-year old I also viewed with great hilarity the crude humor of ballplayers on the road--a phrase I still use today came from a ballplayer told that a game would start at 9:30 a.m, \\"Nine thirty? H..l, I'm not done throwing up by that time of day!\\" After a bumpy bus ride, another player offers to buy the bus. I'll leave it to you to guess why. In response to Walker's niggling managerial style, the Astros composed their own theme song \\"It Makes a Fellow Proud to Be an Astro\\" (\\"if we win our game each day, what the f... can Harry say/it makes a fellow proud to be an Astro!\\")Bouton also takes us through his pitching season--outing by outing--you get a feel of how seriously ballplayers evaluate each game (at least Bouton did), and at Bouton's level of \\"last man in the bullpen\\", how tenuous their hold on a major league position is. Maybe there was more to this now famous book than Ms. Trapnell gave it credit for in 1971."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"In 1970, baseball was hit with two ground-breaking events that shook it from its complacent stance left over from the days of FDR. First, Curt Flood began his challenge to the time-honored reserve clause when he tried to block his trade to Philadelphia. And second, the publication of a relief pitcher's season diary with the Seattle Pilots and Houston Astros, a book that challenged the image of ballplayers forever.That book was \\"Ball Four\\", and it was the view of a memorable 1969 season for Jim Bouton, the author and a former star pitcher with the Yankees. Now down on his luck and struggling to remain on a major-league roster, Bouton decided to document his trek from the dungeons of the minor leagues to the full-fledged ecstasy of pitching a major league game successfully.It's the stories along the way, however, that made baseball squirm...Seen through the light of post-Watergate \\"destroying the heroes\\" (and through the troubling trend of post-9/11 to build them back up), \\"Ball Four\\" seems on some levels like \\"been there, done that\\". But seen through the context of the time it came out, it shook the foundations of the game and caused a major scandel for Bouton and kept him from being invited to Old Timers' Day in New York.Bouton was a former phenom whose fastball secured him a spot on the Yankees roster in the early Sixties, but by the time of the 1969 season he was struggling to find a new pitch to accomadate the sore arm that he acquired in place of that fastball. Here documented is his struggle with mastering the knuckleball, easily the most difficult pitch to control. Also, Bouton has money problems that his bosses aren't eager to resolve. Before Curt Flood's post-season trade disputes began, Bouton is seen fighting tooth-and-nail for a measly $1000 at a time, and his trade from Seattle could very well have had something to do with that (or his insistance on investing in a new product on the market, something called \\"Gatorade\\" which was supposedly better than soda for ballplayers).Bouton also discusses the times he's living in, and how baseball chooses to ignore them. Race relations, the civil rights movement, the war in Vietnam, and all the issues that defined the Sixties never seemed to touch baseball, but Bouton gets under the skin of his teammates and his coachs by embracing some of the youth culture around him. Some of the funniest passages describe his reactions to the constant stream of country-and-western music at the back of the team bus, where he tries to \\"fit in\\" with the guys.Bouton is remarkably honest for a ballplayer, spicing his diary with revealing passages about himself, his past, and the pasts of those around him. That's what brought him before the auspices of comissioner Bowie Kuhn to \\"deny\\" what he wrote as being true. His discussions about Mickey Mantle (whose alcoholism eventually killed him) was seen as a Benedict Arnold-esque turn in 1970, but now we all know Bouton was telling the truth.Bouton's struggles with control both on the field and against his bosses make \\"Ball Four\\" a revelation, as it shows old-time baseball as the antiquated institution it is. He also revels in the fact that he's not a typical jock, and many of the teammates around him who may have been angered by tales about their own faults actually emerge as more sympathetic figures than they would have in the typical hagiograpchic sports screeds. Here they're real human beings, not the God-like figures of yore.Jim Bouton went from being a good pitcher with arm problems to a truth-telling Judas who wrote himself out of the game. But when the book you pen is \\"Ball Four\\", it might very well be worth it. Bouton will be remembered for his masterpiece of sports literature far longer than the critics who took him to task for that. You couldn't ask for a better won-loss record."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"After Thirty years I reread this book and it is not the book I remembered. It's better. It was then, it is now, simply the best Baseball Book ever.But it is now more than that. It's history.When the Original edition of Ball Four came out it was considered scandalous and an unflattering expose on Baseball. Now it's history. American history. And the continuing autobiography of a man who is so much more than just a ballplayer.Jim Bouton reveals what baseball was like in the 1960's: Players getting less than $10,000 a year in salary, General Managers lying to players and tricking them into low salaries. It is just hard to believe all that was baseball then.Ball Four is famous, or infamous for giving great insight into several players. Yet in retrospect, not much is really told about the individual players. Mickey Mantle drank a lot and didn't sigh autographs; Roger Maris didn't always hustle. This is small stuff compared with what is told today. Still this is the stuff that started it all.But the best part are the epilogues, written in 1980, 1990 and 2000, because they add a new perspective to the book. The author points out that maybe if more time was spent dealing with Mantle's drinking problem and less time spent hiding it and blasting Bouton maybe the Mick would be here today.The book is fascinating and funny. And Real. I began t o understand what it most be like to be on the road, bored, for so many months a year. I began to understand why they did what they did.Mr. Bouton deflates the image of the baseball player: They drank, took greenies (speed) and looked at girls in the stands. Shocking news! But he also deflates the images of coaches and managers. A player that floats in and out of the book is a rookie to the new Seattle Pilots. He talent is not overlooked by the players but it is overlooked by management is sent down to the minors and then traded to Kansas City. His name is Lou Pinella. A similar story is told about Mike Marshall.Jim Bouton discusses his return to Yankee Stadium for old-timers day and the events surrounding it. In the end, that is what affected me the most. Having read the book thirty years ago, I thought it would be interesting to read the epilogues first. Their you learn the heart-breaking news that the Boutons lost their daughter, Laurie, in an accident in 1997. It changed everything, even the original Ball Four section. Mr. Bouton was devoted to Baseball, but he was devoted to family. In Ball Four we are introduced to Laurie at age three when she comes to a doubleheader with Mrs. Bouton and their two other children. Then, she is ironically nicknamed &quot;The Unsinkable Molly Brown.&quot; Yet it is her spirit that gets Bouton invited back to the Old Timers Day at Shea. Mel Stottlemyre is mentioned in the original 1969 part of the book. Yet it is his conversation with Bouton, about losing his son in 1981, that will remain with me. You can't read it without tearing up.I guess we like to think that baseball is everything to those who play it. Ball Four was the first to show what it was really like to get go through a season. In his Final Pitch Mr. Bouton shows what it takes to get through life. I hope he has a few more chapters in him. I'm sure Laurie would hope so too."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"I first read this book when I was about fifteen or so - way back in the 70's. That tattered paperback copy is one of the few books from my teenage years that I still own, having hauled it and a few other beloved reads in moves from Pennsylvania to Arizona to Colorado. I loved the book then and reread it every couple of years. Bouton's sense of humor pervades the book, and still keeps me laughing.Aside from a fascinating insight into the sport of baseball, it was also a terrific insight into the male mind. The day -to -day accounts of the activities of the exclusively male environment of a sports team was quite engrossing to a girl living with a single mother and two sisters. (Someday, somehow, I am going to play that baby powder/hair dryer prank on someone!)The book also offers a look into America's past that even in the mid-70's was no more. I can recall my shock and disbelief at Bouton's description of the restaurants in the South that would not serve the black ball players inside - forcing those players to take their food outside to eat on the team bus. Nothing like that existed in my Pennsylvania town; it was hard for me to believe such things occurred in my own lifetime. (And to this day, I am indignant that the ball clubs would patronize such restaurants, and the fellow players would accept this situation.)I heard of the book from Mad Magazine, and read it in order to understand the joke in the magazine --something about you know you are Republican if you think Jim Bouton is a traitor -- (and yes, I was the kind of kid who would read a book in order to udnerstand a joke!). I had not been a baseball fan before reading Ball Four, but I've been a fan ever since. (And a lifelong democrat &lt;g&gt;)"},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"I'm one of the many whose lives were enriched by Ball Four and who gained personal inspiration from it. In addition to all else that the book is, it is the story of someone who at the moment was an underdog, in a difficult and sometimes hostile setting, seeking to bring himself back to a better place, little by little -- AND HE MAKES IT! I'm sure that wasn't a part of the original intent of the book, but it's there, and it's very moving. That moment when Bouton runs into the Astro manager and coaches in the hotel lobby while they're talking about maybe giving him a start, is a great literary moment, and there are many others like it -- simple moments that rise surprisingly to the level of drama because of the book's fine pacing and the humanness of the narrative. Each next edition of the book -- \\"Ball Five,\\" \\"Ball Six,\\" \\"Ball Seven\\" -- has added significant new chapters. Ball Four is very much a book of that moment in which it originated, but its humanity, wit, and, yes, drama will keep it alive for a very, very long time."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"What can I say about this book? I used to read it every summer. I read it by date (June 9, I read June 9 entry) tracked the stats etc. I first read this book in eighth grade. It didn't shatter the myth of Mickey Mantle, other ballplayers or the state of the sacred game, in general. I was a METS FAN anyway. What it did do is make light that ballplayers aren't unconditional heroes. They are human beings and rather tame compared to some of today's criminals. (I mean athletes). First time through I laughed at loud and each successive time I fondly remembered scenes painted so vividly by Bouton. For me it was like re-watching a favorite movie such as Say Anything, The Graduate or When Harry Met Sally. Ballplayers are traveling for months at a time and the same issues written here are also found in &quot;reality shows&quot;. Ball Four was ahead of its time for this reason but also for the fact that no one was writting an insider book like this back in 1970. My generation of sports fans can quote from this book, still today."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"This is one of the greatest baseball books ever written--a funny, irreverent, truthful account of a veteran pitcher's attempt to come back from injury as a knuckleballer with the short-lived expansion Seattle Pilots. Bouton tells his story with remarkable humor and insight, and in its day the book was a real shocker. (Mickey Mantle drinks and chases girls!!??! No way!) Real baseball fans will want to reflect on the rest of the story, which unfolded further only this year: how Bouton, after the tragic death of his daughter Laurie in an auto accident last year, was finally invited back to Old-Timer's Day at Yankee Stadium.Welcome back, Jim and Ball Four. We missed you both!"},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"The original text of Ball Four is not as funny or as original as I remember from reading it years ago (1974?), but maybe I've become jaded over the decades. Still, Bouton's diary is hilarious in places, and it gives an inside look at the game any baseball fan has to love. The real bonus is in the appendices Bouton has added to subsequent editions, all of which are included in the \\"Final Pitch.\\" They are excellent. The section on meeting with former MLB commissioner Bowie Kuhn over Kuhn's demand that Bouton sign a statement admitting Ball Four is erroneous and largely a fabrication is as hilarious as it is chilling. Bouton's takes on the owners' interference in the game, the commercialization of the \\"product\\" via television, and the corruption of the reportage of all sports that occurs when media forces own teams or control the broadcast of games are spot-on. Twenty years ago Bouton knew exactly what was wrong with baseball, and the corruption and venality of baseball's owners has done nothing to obviate his complaints or apply his remedies in all this time.Bouton would have been a baseball iconoclast even if he had never played the game. His insights are too piercing for the tender skin of the sport that his diary exposes as parochial, insular, and inbred. Clearly, Bouton loves the game of baseball -- he played at one level or another from age seven to 57 - and it is his love of the game that is at the root of his writing. Bouton wasn't out to destroy baseball, he gave it a loving nudge in the ribs and said,... That was evidently too strong a medicine for the Lords of Baseball to bear. If baseball's ownership had any guts or an appreciation of the game as anything but a profit center, Jim Bouton would be commissioner of baseball today, instead of some owners' puppet like Bud \\"Lite\\" Selig. P.S. My copy came signed by the author."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Books about sports stars can be dated in two ways. BBF (Before Ball Four) and ABF (After Ball Four). Before this book came out, sports stars were mythologized in print and the books had a cardboard-style sameness to them. According to the BBF books baseball stars such as Mickey Mantle, Babe Ruth and Ted Williams did nothing but pull for their team and engage in some occasional boyish antics. In other words, heroes through and through.The reality was quite different, Babe Ruth was an incorrigible woman chaser, heavy drinker and was verbally cruel to people. There is the classic story of a group of baseball writers playing a game of cards on a train taking the Yankees on a road trip. A naked woman followed by an equally naked Ruth ran past them. One writer remarked, \\"It is a good thing I didn't see that because otherwise I would have to write about it.\\" Mickey Mantle was a heavy drinker; he often played so heavily hung over that he had trouble keeping his eyes open. Williams was not a team player, he was at times an indifferent fielder and he refused to enlarge the strike zone by even an inch in order to drive in a run that would tie or win a game. There is a classic story that he once hit a home run that got his team back in the game. However, rather than accepting the accolades of his teammates, he sat in the dugout cussing himself for swinging at a pitch that was a ball.Bouton's book changed all that. He described the players as human, with all their faults. In the early sixties Bouton had one of the best fastballs in the game, his pitching helped propel the Yankees to the American league pennant and some argued that in 1964, he was the best pitcher in baseball. However, in 1965 he hurt his arm and could no longer throw the heat. In 1969, he made a semi-comeback throwing the knuckleball for the expansion Seattle Pilots. Even on a marginal team he was at best a marginal player. This book is a combination of his actions with the Pilots as well as a reflection of his time with the Yankees. Therefore, it is easy to detect a strain of bitterness at the loss of the glory days of the 1964 Yankees. Nevertheless, while many people have decried the book, no one has ever come forward to disprove his statements about the escapades of the players. Many drank heavily and took drugs, most were sexually promiscuous, and at times they were contemptuous of the fans.Since \\"Ball Four\\" came out, the books about sports stars have been more honest. This, in my opinion, is good for the fans, the games and even the players. The nation has become much more knowledgeable and realistic in how it views heroes. It would have been impossible to continue the artificial presentations of the people who so fascinate us when they play for pay."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Bouton's diary-style take on professional baseball in the late 1960s makes for a very funny book that ought to be required reading for any sports fan.Bouton spent a large part of his career pitching his knuckleball for a variety of big-league teams, including for the Yankees in the 1964 World Series. In Ball Four, Bouton goes from the minors to the Seattle Pilots, then to Houston, over the course of the 1969 season. The book really captures a bygone era of baseball. Salaries were low, bus rides were long, and a lot of big names were still in the game.The book has a reputation for being funny, and it is. Bouton has a wry sense of humor and a keen eye for human foibles.A few subjects felt burned, but in this day of athletes accused of drug abuse and criminal behavior, some of the antics that Bouton writes about seem very tame, almost quaint. It's a little hard to see what the fuss was about if you're planted firmly in 2005.Bouton's observations are fascinating, capturing an era in baseball (and more broadly, in our nation) that has all but disappeared. These were the days before million-dollar contracts and when the length of their hair and sideburns sometimes held the key to a player's future.Bouton brings the moments alive, so the reader can feel the nerves of a pitcher blowing a game, the joy of running across a big-league field, the frustration of trying to get Gatorade, the speechlessness of finding one's shoes nailed to the clubhouse floor.Readers should be grateful that someone with a clear, ironic eye had the foresight to take notes and write this book. As Bouton himself says, so many of the funny details would have been lost forever.For baseball fans, young and old, put this at the top of your summer reading list."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"bouton tells a very good story. he shows the funnier side to baseball...and the side that most people don't get to see--what happens in the bullpen during a game, what happens in the clubhouse after the game, how players relate with managers and the front office. if you're looking for a dramatic, heroic baseball book, you might want to go somewhere else. but if you want to know what it's like to be a professional player trying to make it through the grind of a season, then check this one out.not the best baseball book i've ever read, but it's not far off."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Books about sports stars can be dated in two ways.

These are probably the three most useful words when writing about Jim Bouton's great book on life inside and outside the lines. Bouton takes the reader on a season long trip during which the we get to experience the frustrations and joys of being a baseball player. I was truly disappointed that this book had to end. Bouton's honesty, humor and ability to connect with the layman make this one of the best books I have ever read (and I read alot)."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"This book is, quite simply, teriffic.

But, it certainly opened up my eyes to the &quot;real world&quot;, not only of baseball, but the rest of it. Now, 30 years later, I count myself an avid baseball fan, and I have Jim Bouton to thank for that. Bouton's humor, humanity and sheer but simple love of the game come shining through in 'Ball Four', and the fact that it created such a &quot;tizzy&quot; in the baseball establishment, still today, is proof of the book's value and importance. To those of us who have read 'Ball Four'and continue to pull it off the shelf every March when spring training kicks in, it is a dear, old friend coming for a welcome visit--and, in many ways, those of us &quot;in the know&quot; about Bouton and his book consider the knowledge of it admission into a secret society--the wonderful thing about that, is that we welcome everyone! Come join! I promise, at the very least, that you will have lots of great lines to use for the rest of your life (&quot;That's what happens when you can't hit the curveball!&quot;) and, as an added bonus, you'll fall in love with our &quot;National Pasttime&quot; all over again. I mean, haven't you ever wondered what they REALLY talk about when the manager goes out to talk to the pitcher!?

But here's the thing, at age 30 I just don't know who these players in the book are unless it's Mickey Mantle or other big stars. The author does a good job writing about everyones backstory, but without the familiarity of some of these names I just can't keep interest.

He was a struggling pitcher who was trying to use his knuckler to come back; but in reality, he was an aspiring writer waiting to tell the insider stories of his teammates.His book was thought of as a Judas, a traitor initially. In fact, there was quite a bit of hatred and anger over the revealing of Mickey Mantle's alcohol problem. Adultery, playing with hangovers, drugs, and heated altercations are seemingly every day experiences of a professional baseball player.I'll never forget one of the classic lines of the book, a line that showed true insight:MY NAME IS TED F*$#ING WILLIAMS AND I'M THE GREATEST HITTER IN BASEBALL!\\"In light of the recent whistle-blowing of Jose Canseco, I'm struck by how difficult writing this book must have been for Bouton. In a culture and society that has changed drastically since the sixties and seventies, the risk he took is almost unfathomable to anyone today. Publishing the book guaranteed alienation and black-balling from those in baseball with power.It's a must-have for any sports fan who loves to read. It's a classic that captured an era of baseball - the days before agents, greedy players, steroids, ridiculous commercialization, and a watered down league - for which many reminisce."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Although Ball Four was published more than thirty years ago, it remains as true a book now as it was then. Mr. Bouton leaves no subject untouched. Whether writing about the frustration of pitching behind an inferior teammate, \\"activities\\" that go on behind the backs of wives and girlfriends, or dealing with the egos of major league star players and managers, Bouton brings the bigger-than-life world of professional baseball down to earth in a funny and sometimes hilarious way."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Ball Four, Jim Bouton's fine diary about life with the Seattle Pilots and Houston Astros in the year 1969 (the same year man landed on the Moon), has been hailed as a groundbreaking, revolutionary book about baseball, sports, and life in general. Most people are correct when they say it was the first truely successful &quot;tell-all&quot; book, pointing out the human fallacies of such superstars as Mickey Mantle, Elston Howard, and Alvin Dark, as well as the dubious effectiveness of executives in general and managers in particular. Most critics are also correct when they say that this book violated the sanctity of the locker-room by showing a professional sports team as a profane, prank-filled, rather juvenile bunch of guys rather than as cardboard heroes. Still, many people who write about Ball Four miss it's most significant contribution, one voiced by Bouton himself: He told the American public how much (and, more importantly), how little professional athletes really made at the time. According to Jim, most people read the headlines and knew that Mickey Mantle made $100,000 a year or so in the mid-1960's. But they didn't realize that Yankee rookies (the team Bouton started his career with) only made $7000 a year, and that Jim himself only made a salary in the low 20's even after three years of experience, twenty wins a season, and two World Series wins as a pitcher! In other words, most people felt that if Mantle made 100K, then Elston Howard, Tom Tresh, Jim Bouton, and other Yankees of the day must have made about 40-60K each season. The fact that Bouton broke the most sacred code of all and TOLD HOW MUCH MONEY PLAYERS EARNED (or not, as the case may be) made him a pariah to the baseball establishment and forced his exclusion from Yankee's Old Timer games for the next quarter century. Still, you may ask, why would I want to read this 30-year old book? The funny stories, the rude and crude language, the camaraderie among a group which binds them together despite significant differences? Yes, and something much more fundamental. Jim Bouton is the champion of the outsider, the knucklehead, the rebel in all of us who feels, right or wrong, that no matter how good he gets, he will never truly fit in. His daily diary entries prove that all of us, even professional athletes, suffer from what actor Roy Schieder called &quot;flop sweat,&quot; i.e., fear of failure. This quality, along with all the wild, zany, and utimately touching stories, makes Ball Four such an excellent read after all these years. Pick up Ball Four today. You'll find that no matter how much you sometimes feel a misfit, you'll always have a champion in Jim!"},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"I read this book when it first came out. It was quite an eye-opener although it may seem tame by today's standards. There was, we were told, an unwritten (and in some cases WRITTEN) rule that what happens in the club house stays in the club house. Jim Bouton certainly trashed that maxim as well as a lot of other sacred icons in &quot;Ball Four&quot;. In the process he became more famous for his writing than he ever was for his pitching.This book is actually a diary of a pitcher's season. Bouton was a flame-throwing pitcher for the Yankees but he blew out his arm when he was still relatively young. He attempted to come back as a knuckle ball pitcher with the Seattle Pilots (remember them?). Pitching on an expansion team in its' first year gave Bouton an interesting perspective. Afterall, his previous service in the majors involved pitching in the World Series for the almighty Yankees. He went from a great team to a lousy team; from being a very good pitcher to a slightly below mediocre pitcher. With this background, the author shares what it was like to be at the top and what it is like to be at the bottom. We go day to day through the season. Bouton critiques his various pitching performances as well as the rest of the expansion team. Much of the book is hilarious, especially the parts about his manager, Joe Schultz. It is, however, Bouton's comments about his former Yankee teammates that have ruffled so many feathers. For example, he ponders how many more home runs Mickey Mantle would have gotten if he hadn't come to so many games hungover. Well, so much for Bouton being invited to Old-timer's games at Yankee Stadium. Yet his book is tame compared to today's slash and burn sports reporters. Mickey actually comes across as a loveable hero rather than the tragic figure many later portayed him as.Many people have tried to portray the life of a major league athlete. Most have made it too complicated or glamorous. Bouton's version still stands out as the best. He makes it sound like fun. You'll have fun, too, if you read &quot;Ball Four&quot;."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Jim Bouton is not a name that comes up when discussing the all time greats of baseball. However, when discussing the all time greatest baseball novels, his name should come up every time. Ball Four is a fantastic day-in-the-life recounting of a single player's (Bouton's) Major League season - more specifically, the season being 1969, and his playing days that year split between the upstart franchise Seattle Pilots, and the beleagured, relatively new Houston Astros. What sets the novel apart is it's absolutely brutal, truthful (but very taboo) telling of the player's and coach's personalities and lifestyles. Not a single vulgarity or shocking sequence is missed in Bouton's daily log he kept which eventually became this famous non-fiction piece. It also created more enemies in the game than he could've imagined. He only played one and a half more seasons after it's publication, and is a testament to a very intelligent, and brave athlete who wrote with a beautifully relaxing, very funny, and down-to-earth tone. A great read for true baseball fans."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"It's easy to see why this extraordinary book created such a sensation when it first came out in 1970. Bouton, a sporadically successful pitcher nearing the end of his career, airs ALL of Major League baseball's dirty laundry--all those long and carefully concealed nasties and naughties, from relatively minor stuff such as the pervasive use of profanity to more serious issues like habitual drug use, heavy drinking and rampant womanizing. He also documents anti-intellectualism, lingering racial bigotry, homophobia and the casual cruelty of established stars towards rookies and fans. I kept wondering, as I read, to what extent Bouton himself participated in the activities he describes. He admits to drinking and popping the occasional &quot;greenie&quot; (speed, I assume), but never directly owns up to any marital infidelities.He also exposed the dirtiest baseball secret of all, which wasn't sex, but salaries. It may come as a shock to present-day readers, accustomed to multi-millionaire baseball stars, to learn that players 30+ years ago earned barely subsistence wages and were totally at the mercy of club owners. I was flabbergasted to learn that Bouton, with a wife and three kids, earned LESS than my own extremely modest salary at that time as a (single) university Instructor!But this book isn't a heavy-handed, moralistic indictment of Major League baseball. Instead, it's gloriously goofy and hilariously funny! As a writer, Bouton has a genuine, unique &quot;voice,&quot; which I suspect owes very little to his editor. Someone could hand me a copy of any paragraph from _Ball Four_ and I'd recognize it instantly as Bouton. How many authors can you say that about?To me, the funniest anecdote in a book full of marvelous stories is Bouton's report that the Seattle Pilots' manager fined players for appearing at the clubhouse post-game buffet--as Bouton delicately puts it--&quot;with Charlie uncovered.&quot; In itself, this is a funny, somewhat crude anecdote; it's Bouton's additional comment that raises it to the level of high comedy art. He notes that if the Yankees had instituted the same rule they'd have made a fortune in fines, since Elston Howard and Yogi Berra both were &quot;famous for dragging Charlie through the cold cuts.&quot; That line alone is worth the price of the book!"},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"I really had a good time reading Ball Four. Over the last thirty years, the things that Bouton &quot;reveals&quot; about ballplayers are well-known in the year 2000 (such as the fact that baseball players are not demig-ds, and ocasionally have affairs outside of marriage or like to drink alcohol). History has shown that Bouton was right and Bowie Kuhn was wrong -- this book didn't destroy anything or anybody. Instead, what actually struck closer to home was Bouton's talk about how the advice he got from managers and coaches was usually run-of-the-mill tripe (&quot;Keep the ball down! Keep the ball up!&quot;). I've always thought so as well. This is a must-read for anybody who enjoys the game of baseball and its history."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Ball Four is one of the most important, and enjoyable, baseball books ever written. Jim Bouton gives you an inside view of what actually goes on in the Major Leagues. Through him you get to see what all of the players you watch or listen to play are actually like. He doesn't leave anything out in order to avoid upsetting people. He touches upon everything that happened during the season and the result is a wonderfully insightful and funny book. If you're a fan of baseball, you must read this book."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Ball four was a great book because it brought to light a side of baseball that had never been seen or even imagined for that matter.

This is a must read and I rank it very high on my lsit of all time favorite books."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"&quot;Ball Four&quot; remains, over 20 years after I read it the first time, one of my all time favorites. I have read it in its entirety probably ten times and picked it up to read two to three page sections probably hundreds of times to get a quick laugh. And I never get bored with it. This book was written in an age where the mediocre players (like Bouton at that time) had to fight for every dollar and the owners were in control. There weren't the prima donnas of today, expecting to be worshipped like a deity despite a .225 batting average. And Bouton lays it all out; the clubhouse gags, the use of &quot;greenies&quot; (Pep Pills), &quot;Baseball Annies&quot; (Groupies) and the fights of salary negotiation when you're an end-of-the-road pitcher who once was great (Bouton). You'll be shocked at the annual salaries that are fought over in this book! His admission of Mickey Mantle's love of alcohol got him chastised and ostracized, but Mickey's health problems at the end of the life showed Bouton wasn't lying. A great book for sports fans everywhere. I only wish they would reissue this book with Bouton's follow-up &quot;I'm Glad You Didn't Take It Personally&quot; included, which describes Bouton's trials and tribulations after &quot;Ball Four&quot; was released."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"This was a provocative book when it was first published. Jim Bouton, who had been a star pitcher for the New York Yankees, was trying to mount a comeback by working on a knuckleball in the bullpen of the expansion team Seattle Pilots less than five years later. He was a world away from pitching in two World Series in two successive seasons with players like Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris as team mates.His fastball could no longer shatter a pane of glass, but his astute observations about professional sports broke many barriers that had existed between the owners, players and the fans. Baseball Commissioner Bowie Kuhn publicly condemned the book.Bouton was traded to Houston before the season ended. The last place Seattle Pilots faded and died. The team was sold and transferred to Milwaukee after only one year. As such, it is something of a historic artifact of the failed Pilots team as well as a humorous look at the National Pastime."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"This insider's account of playing in the big leagues is side-splitting entertainment. Bouton concentrates on the fun, the funny, and the amusingly odd aspects of what so many call \\"adults playing a boys' game.\\" In his well-travelled career, Bouton played for the Yankees, Braves, Astros, and even the late, not-so-great Seattle Pilots. His personal contacts and anecdotes with many well-known baseball personalities (many still active as commentators, managers, and broadcasters) reminds us all that life, as well as sports, should be fun and we should keep an eye open for the humor in mundane siutations. Anyone with an interest in baseball will truly get more than a few chuckles from this well written book."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Jim Bouton's Ball Four has rightly been called the best sports book of all times by publications that actually matter, but I figure I'll throw my two cents in, too. In a day before an ol' ballplayer could hire a ghost and slap together some fond memories or pathetic pleas for forgiveness (hiya, Pete Rose), Bouton, making a comeback as a knuckleballer with the expansion Seattle Pilots, toted a tape recorder with him for an entire year in order to write this day-by-day account of life in the bigs.The humor is at once anecdotal and observational, and, most importantly, consistent. The Seattle Pilots were rather like the Cleveland Indians in the film Major League - a haphazard collection of rookies and cast-offs trying to make it. Of course, Major League had to have the whole underdog thing going on.The issues that face baseball today - drugs, salaries, lack of interest by hometown fans, the Yankees being the source of all evil - are all present in Ball Four. The only part of the book that hasn't aged perfectly is the scale of the salaries - Bouton and his teammates hold out for an increase of a few thousand dollars, instead of the millions today's players make.In summation, there is no baseball book you should read before this one, and there are precious few books you should read, period, before this one. Ball Four is in every right an American masterpiece."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"I remember reading this book when it first came out and the stir it caused. It was the first time an athlete pulled no punches and described what goes on in the locker room and off the field. Bouton took a lot of heat and was blacklisted by many within MLB for his comments.The book is actually a diary of Bouton's comback season with the Seattle Pilots (they are now the Milwaukee Brewers). They were an expansion team with a few big name washed-up stars. Bouton, once a fireballer for the New York Yankees, hurt his arm and developed a knuckleball pitch to try to make it back to the bigs. Throughout the book he talks about his outings (mostly in mop-up and other non-critical moments) and you feel his frustration at not being noticed for sometimes excellent pitching.Not having seen many Pilot games in 1969, I am not sure whether Bouton was fantasizing his greatness with the knuckleball or he actually was the second coming of Hoyt Wilhelm.Bouton's teammates are quite lovable and memorable, reminding me a lot of the characters from the movie Major Leagues. There have been many books that came out since but this was the first of its type, and in my opinion the best!"},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Who would have thought that when Jim Bouton agreed to keep a diary during the 1969 baseball season, that &quot;Ball Four: My Life and Hard Times Throwing the Knuckle-ball in the Big Leagues&quot; would end up being listed as one of the Books of the Century by the New York Public Library. But there it is, nestled in between Truman Capote's &quot;In Cold Blood&quot; and Stephen King's &quot;Carrie&quot; under the category of Popular Culture &amp; Mass Entertainment. The book is cited as being &quot;the first ripple of a tidal wave of 'tell-all' books that have become commonplace not only in sports, but also in politics, entertainment, and other realms of contemporary public life.&quot; But more importantly &quot;Ball Four&quot; totally changed the relationship between baseball players and their fans.Bouton had achieved early success as a hard throwing right-handed pitcher for the New York Yankees. But by 1969 the Yankee dynasty was officially over, Mickey Mantle had retired, and Bouton was trying to return to the majors by throwing the infamous knuckle-ball. Signed by the expansion team Seattle Pilots, in their only season of existence before moving to Milwaukee, Bouton had his ups and downs as a relief pitcher, but was successful enough to be traded to the Houston Astros who were in the middle of a pennant race. However, little of that mattered once Bouton started talking about what happened in the lockeroom.&quot;Ball Four&quot; was considered scandalous because Bouton frankly talked about baseball players having affairs, popping greenies (suddenly in the news again because of the current steroid controversy), and playing wickedly funny practical jokes on each other (Jesus Alou is the greatest victim of all time). The book's impact can be summed up in one particular story, when Bouton relates how Mantle once hit a home run when he still could not see straight because of a hard night of drinking. Once baseball's golden boy was tarnished in this manner, nobody else in the game had a chance. Bouton kicked down the door to the locker room big time.The book was considered irreverent and was denounced by the baseball establishment when it was published in 1970. But the problem was that it was (a) very truthful and (b) even funnier than it was truthful. Commissioner Bowie Kuhn called Bouton in on the carpet, but it turns out the truth is indeed a defense. The legacy of &quot;Ball Four&quot; today is seen not so much in similar books but in baseball films, where movies from &quot;Bull Durham&quot; to &quot;Major Leagues&quot; have captured the wonderful and wacky environment of a baseball locker room. For more about the book's reaction read Bouton's sequel, &quot;I'm Glad You Didn't Take It Personally.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"I've been a baseball fan all my life, and I heard of this book during an appearance that Jim Bouton did on a radio show. I decided to get a copy, and once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. This book brings out a side of baseball that most people don't realize is there. It is required reading for ANY baseball fan."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"While the baseball world seems to abhor him for being honest, I thought Bouton's book was open and relatively fair. Whenever he had something negative to say (always documented by a detailed story), he mentioned the positives about the people involved too. Mantle and Joe Schultz are good examples. A prececessor to the &quot;tell all&quot; biographies of today that seem to be written for shock value and one upsmanship."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Even though this book is 40 years old now it's still very relevant. Ball four is so different from any other baseball book of it's time. Bouton exposes baseball for what it was back in the 60's and 70's. For those older baseball fans you will remember a lot of the players Bouton talks about. Ball four serves as a time capsule. A time when owners had complete ownership of the game and the players. A time when race was still an issue in baseball. A time when baseball did everything it could to cover up it's seamy side. Ball four was written at a time when if you talked bad about baseball or when against the institution of baseball you could be banished from it (Witness Curt Flood). Bouton uncovers some things about baseball that seem fairly tame now but was big news back then.Written when Bouton was in the minor league triple A team of the fledgling Seattle Pilots Bouton talks about the struggles of players trying to make it to the show, making the minimum wage of 10,000 a year. Hoping against hope to get the call up to the big club. Hope for one mare chance to prove themselves.Over the years Bouton has added several addendum's to the to the book. The version I read was from 1990 but included ball five (added to the 1980 edition), he talks about his life after baseball and his short stint with the Atlanta Braves and how the financial structure of contracts changed. Ball six (written for this edition) Bouton talks about his various business adventures and inventions.This is an easy and enjoyable read. Very insightful especially if you were a baseball fan in the 60's. The writing style is a bit dated now but would have been appropriate for the time. Still a great read. The editing of the original book is outstanding. Boutons biting criticisms of baseball back then were valid. I still think that Ball four is the bench mark for all books written about life spent in organized baseball."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Ball Four represented a profound change in my life's direction. When it came out, I was in Junior High and had little interest in sports. I don't even know why I started reading it, but I laughed all the way through it (even though I didn't \\"get\\" everything.\\"). I came away with a totally different view regarding athletics, and the camaraderie that it can generate among its participants. I started playing sports in high school and college, and later got a teaching credential and began coaching high school sports. Thirty plus years later, I've retired from teaching but continue to coach. Ball Four literally defined my future at a young age, and a good future it has been. God Bless you, Jim Bouton. You had a greater positive impact on people than Bowie Kuhn ever did! Thank you again."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Perhaps Jim Bouton himself says it best: &quot;The books that have come after mine make BALL FOUR, as an expose, read like THE BOBBSEY TWINS GO TO THE SEASHORE.&quot;This is because--dare I say it?--BALL FOUR is now pretty tame stuff. Oh, no doubt, it's entertaining...and Bouton IS a good writer (or Schecter a great editor). And let's never forget that WITHOUT it, we should never have had the pleasure of Dennis Rodman's name on a bestseller.But the book is hardly shocking anymore, and I doubt the high school toughs of today have even heard of it, much less decided to read it (now, if MICHAEL JORDAN decided to write a tell-all....)However, the diminished shock value makes BALL FOUR'S merits stand out more clearly than perhaps they could when it was new. Though I wasn't shocked by it, I often found myself laughing; Bouton has a way of sketching characters and dialogue quite entertainingly. Too, being a bit of an outsider myself, I could certainly relate to his one-rational-voice-crying-out-in-the-wilderness persona. And the 1990 edition of the book has value in that Bouton is able to look back and see the results of the changes in baseball he and others worked toward.So, perhaps, the reader's enjoyment of BALL FOUR is in the approach. Don't expect to be shocked or enraged; that time is past. Rather, expect four or five days of solid chuckles and a good feeling when you finish."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Since this book first appeared, many players have written &quot;tell all&quot; books. But Bouton is a guy who actually reads books, and whose eye for detail and observation, not to mention comic timing, make this a truly outstanding piece of writing.

I just read Ball Four, and next spring, I am giving a copy to every kid on my Little League team, of which I am the head coach. Well, not every player, just the pitching staff. I'm sure that the league offices up in Williamsport, Pennsylvania will reimburse me, because this is one book that no ten year old aspiring ballplayer, particularly pitchers, should be without. Within the book, Jim Bouton tells about the fundamentals of baseball in a way that I could never communicate. It covers everything, from what to do and what not to do in preparation for a pitching start to how to how to throw the knuckleball to how pitching can take a toll on your arm if you don't use the proper fundamentals (like Steve Barber, or Jim Bouton, for that matter). I only wish that this book was around when I was a youngster; I would have been a much better player. Jim Bouton has written a fine book about the ins and outs of baseball, and I'm sure that every parent of every kid on my team, as well as the team's sponsor (John Birch Society, Orangeburg Chapter), will be happy that the kids are taking home this educational and informative reading material."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"This book is a great journal of a marginal player for an expansion baseball team.

Though it must have been pretty ground shaking in 1970, it's tamer than I thought it would be.It's a good book and granted it was the start of the trend that exposes athletes and heroes and mere humans, but if it was released today, most people would not have given it a second thought."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"In all my time of being involved with baseball, playing baseball, and coaching baseball on both the little league and the high school levels, never have I read a book that is this informative. I reccomend this book to any little leaguer trying to get the fundamentals of baseball down pat. Whether it be something as complex as teaching the proper execution of the drag bunt, or something as simple and elementary as good sportsmanship, this book covers it all. It is a wholesome book, and wholesome, clean entertainment is so hard to find these days.

I picked this book up only three days ago and since then have used every spare minute reading from its pages.

There is no difference from todays players to that &quot;great&quot; Pilots team.

Which is why this book created such an uproar in 1970. Marginal relief pitchers can not give the public the low down on Mickey Mantle, or give the bird to Commissioner Kuhn.Baseball needs someone today to give us the real story. I still come back to this book after 10 years. It is refreshing in its innocence. Would Sammy Sosa pop a greenie? Do the Montreal Expos go &quot;beaver shooting&quot; while in Toronto? Certainly there must be a manager today who tells his team to &quot;Pound back the ol'Budweiser like Joe Schultz.

Take a look at my website."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"I discovered this book when I was 13 and must have read it fifty times. It revealed baseball players to be more than tarted-up faux heros but human beings. Bouton's approach to the story was to capture the humor and the pain of an actual season. I really believe this book would not have been complete without his stint in the minors. It just all came together. Now when I watch a game, I watch more than just the stars. I watch the bench-riders, the coaches, the fans, and all the other HUMANS that play the game."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"This book is still selling almost thirty years after it was originally published. That ought to tell you something.I first read it in 1975 as a rebellious teenager. I found, and continue to find, Bouton's independent streak and courage to be admirable. He refused to play along with the Neanderthals; he mouthed off to bosses; he loved the game and wanted to win and play well. The type of person who could hold the above against him is the sort that is currently being parodied in _Dilbert_ books.One thing about this book is that it is hilariously funny. His account of his time with the old Portland Mavericks is as funny as his accounts of bullpen and locker-room humour. His style is highly readable and never boring.And goddess, how he loves the game of baseball. And if you do, as well, and haven't read this book, you have a real treat ahead of you."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"It's hard to imagine an odder pitch than a knuckleball, or a better metaphor for the Jim Bouton \\"comeback\\" season he chronicles in Ball Four.Once a back to back twenty game winner for the Yankess with a blistering fastball, Bouton is now so injured he can barely hold a fork. He decides to re-learn how to throw a knuckleball, and manages to do it well enough to latch on to the Seattle Pilots. This also gives Bouton the vehicle to write a behind the scenes tell all book about baseball- the first of about thirty billion to come but one of the best in all sports, not just baseball, and remaining so to this day.As other reviewers have pointed out, it is a bit tame by today's standards, and even for it's day it relied more on good writing and storytelling than on shock value, but it is still real enough that the reader comes away with a pretty good sense of what the locker room must've been like.Bouton's non-baseball worldview in Ball Four is all too familiar, but at the time he was also ground-breaking in his cynical disparagement of American values. He left Mom and apple pie alone, but he decided to unmask baseball the way American Beauty went after the family.Still, for all his ahead of his time pc cynicism he was still pretty funny, and he's not a hard guy to cheer for. Kind of a likeable Keith Olbermann, if there is such a thing. And the book isn't as political as I'm making it sound, it's just that it has a kind of undercurrent that at once reflected the counter-culture of the 60s/70s but also was a forerunner to much of today's sports writing. About as important a book about a game as you are likely to run across, and it still makes me root for a knuckleball pitcher to this day."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Ball Four takes me back to a time when heroes were icons.This is the first Kiss and Tell novel on baseball, and it was the best of all of them. Bouton may have been the most hated man in baseball for a long time. Unlike a Pedro Martinez, a low life Red Sox headhunter, It was not for his play that he was despised.Bouton was hated for the best real reason: He told the truth. None of the stories that he told were ever discounted that I have heard. He ripped the label of honor off of the old ball game and many will never forgive him.The book is funny, and hip for its time."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"The amazing thing about reading Ball Four now, almost 30 years after it was first published, is how the game of baseball has changed. Bouton's book is almost a time capsule, illustrating what it was like when players didn't control the game and political correctness wasn't even a term. We need another Jim Bouton to describe life in baseball today. Do the Yankees still shoot beaver? Do players even worry anymore about getting back $600 apartment deposits if they're traded? Have greenies given way to andro? Even if a new Bouton surfaced, he couldn't be any funnier than the original. The image that never fails to crack me up is the one of Joe Pepitone giving a guy a hotfoot while being the victim of a hotfoot himself. Has Ken Griffey Jr. ever given anyone a hot foot? Does he even know what it is?"},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"&quot;Ball Four&quot; is a diary that covers the year of a baseball player, in this case Jim Bouton, who spent the 1969 season with the expansion Seattle Pilots and then the Houston Astros. Entertaining on many levels, &quot;Ball Four&quot; also serves as a mirror of the times -- in the late 1960s, many established concepts and ideas, in politics, music, mass media, and sports, were being shattered. Baseball, always about five years behind the curve, was always thought of as a game that was played by wholesome, All-American men. They were our heroes. Ball Four, however, sheds new light and revealed, for the first time, that baseball players, even some of the game's superstars, are human.Bouton tells all, in, by today's standards, a tame fashion. We read about everything -- ballplayers cheating on their wives, playing with hangovers, racial problems between teammates, players taking uppers before a game, etc. Bouton is a very insightful writer and presents the material in a humorous manner, the humor, or barbs, is directed at his teammates, managers, coaches, and, in many instances, at himself.Baseball was outraged when the book first came out in 1970. Many players and baseball executives considered Bouton a turncoat. But the years have shown that Ball Four was a groundbreaking book, one that set the standard for tell-all books to come. These other books, however, have never reached the level of excellence of Bouton's &quot;Ball Four.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"As far as I'm concerned, Ball Four is easily the best baseball book out there. I've read about 45 baseball books and nothing compares to Bouton's masterpiece. I've read this book four times and it still hasn't gotten old yet. I'm sure I'll read it at least ten more times and I doubt that I will ever get tired of it.What makes Ball Four better than any other baseball book is that it allows its readers to see the game from a player's perspective. Never has a book given such an up-close, in-the-locker-room look at baseball. Of course, Bouton himself is brilliant. I love his sarcasm and his biting wit. Ball Four might have been a pretty good book even if it had been written by a poor writer; Bouton, though, is an excellent storyteller and his attitude is what shapes the book. If you consider yourself a fan of the game, you will buy Ball Four immediately. It has given me great joy time and time again."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Jim Bouton is a very bright man who probably could have been a scientist if he didn't go into baseball. In the 1960s when he played nobody wrote colorful exposes of the behind the scenes and road trip life of major league ball players. Bouton was the first with this book. It ended many friendships with teammates and probably broke up his marriage. The book might seem tame by todays standard. Alcohol was the players drug in those days and no one was shooting up steroids back then. But the book was racy, groundbreaking and controversial in its time much like Canseco's books are today.You will also see that it led to several other books by Jim Bouton and even one by his ex wife (another analogy to Canseco whose ex wife also wrote a book). Bouton was a great pitcher but alas for only the period from 1961-1964. 1963 was his best season but even though he pitched well in that world series the Yankees got steamrolled by the Dodger staff with Drysdale and Koufax leading the way. After retirementhe came back to pitch for the Seattle Pilots expansion team in their first year. He had developed a knuckle ball and that allowed him some limited success. Bulldog Jim wrote a book about that experience too. He had a trick when he pitched for the Yankees. He wouldd deliberately wear a very loose fitting cap that would usually fall off his head as he delivered the pitch. This was distracting for the hitters. But in his day Bouton had a good fastball and a deceptive changeup and he was part of a great pitching rotation in 1963 that included Ford, Downing and Terry."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Jim Bouton's &quot;Ball Four&quot; is, without a doubt, the best book ever written by a professional athlete and is arguably the greatest baseball book of all-time. Dozens of kiss-n-tell sports novels have dotted the bestseller lists since &quot;Ball Four's&quot; publication in 1970, but none are as funny or revealing as Bouton's expose. All however, owe their very existence to &quot;Ball Four&quot; which shook the moral foundation of our national pastime upon its release. Bouton forever stripped away the All-American image of the professional sports hero with his humorous -- and sometimes X-rated -- locker room tales. Many, including then Commisioner Bowie Kuhn, felt that Bouton had forever tarnished baseball's image with his less than flattering portrayals of some of the game's biggest stars.(Namely Bouton's former Yankee teammate Mickey Mantle). Jim Bouton, in 1970, was Public Enemy #1 in the eyes of the baseball establishment. Truth be told, Bouton merely humanized the professional athlete. Many players--especially Bouton himself --are portrayed as being uncertain of their abilities and fearful of losing their jobs in the highly competitive world of major league baseball.(Such insecurity is best exemplified when Bouton is traded in mid-season from Seattle to Houston and lives to tell us about it!) Overall, &quot;Ball Four&quot; is one heckuva book. Bouton's sense of humor is absolutely side-splitting and his sensitivity, at times, is downright moving. This is a fantastic, groundbreaking novel which no sports fan should be without. Six Stars!!"},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Ball Four is a good and important book to own. If one mark of a good book is its ability to provoke reactions, and often contradictory reactions, then Ball Four is a fine book.What really makes the book a worthwhile read is the way that it reflects a time of momentous change in baseball. I'm not sure if younger fans can truly appreciate how rapidly things were changing in baseball back then. America experienced a broader social revolution throughout 1967 and 1968, but it really took until 1969 for it to work fully its way into baseball. If you look at the baseball cards from 1967 and 1968, they're bland grey items whereupon the players all look like crew-cutted astronauts. Come 1970, 1971, and beyond, everything is different: sideburns, Afros, wild psychadelic colors. Ball Four came out at the leading edge of these changes, and it captured festering tensions between baseball's old guard and a skeptical generation of young players.Ball Four is widely hailed as a great classic. It's not quite as pathbreaking as its reputation, however. For one thing, it had a predecessor earlier in the decade, The Long Season, by Jim Brosnan, another \\"kiss and tell\\" book written by an active player. Brosnan's previous book is better written and more insightful. Ball Four created more of a sensation, but mostly because it was slummier -- it revels a bit more in the drinking and carousing than does the previous book. Because of this, Ball Four upset the baseball establishment a bit more, and it titillated young readers a bit more. Other aspects of the book were equally shocking (back then, anyway): for example, the portrayal of many authority figures -- coaches, managers, and baseball executives -- as dunderheads. This was an anti-establishment book in many respects.Baseball was changing on all fronts, and these changes are well reflected in this book. Bouton pitches for the Seattle Pilots, in their first and last year of their existence, and the first season of the newly created league divisions. You also read of the attempts of baseball players to create a union, and the divisions among players this caused. You've also got the new turf parks, such as the Houston Astrodome where Bouton finishes up his season. And there are all of the social changes: the sexual revolution, the hashing out of racial issues, and perhaps first and foremost, the generation gap.Bouton captures all this and more. Having said all that, my enjoyment of this book is limited by the fact that Bouton's own perspective is often arrogant and intolerant, in much the same way that he derides the older coaches and managers as being. You get the clear sense while reading him that the 1960s generational wars were caused not only by an older generation stuck in its ways, but equally by a younger generation that assumed it was automatically right and that they had nothing to learn from anybody. For example, Bouton persistently quotes his managers and coaches only to show how stupid they are. Now, there is such a thing as stupidity among the old, but all rebellious kids usually think that the older generation has missed a beat. Sometimes they're right, and sometimes not. Bouton's always convinced he's right, but there's little reason to believe he always is.A typical battle between Bouton and his pitching coach Sal Maglie concerns Bouton's attempt to survive on the knuckleball. Sal Maglie gets on his case about it, and discourages him from throwing the knuckler exclusively. Bouton is convinced that his other stuff is basically gone, and the only way he's going to hang on is if he relies on the knuckler, and he wants to be left alone to concentrate on that pitch.Let's just examine this from both sides for a moment to get a sense of whether Bouton's contempt for Maglie is justified.When Bouton came up, he was a very successful pitcher with the New York Yankees. But although he had a reputation for having a young, live arm, the stats show that he was never really an overpowering pitcher. In 1964, he struck out only 120 men in 271 innings, while winning 18 games. Historically, pitchers don't get by on finesse like that for very long. It's not at all surprising that a few years later, Bouton no longer had hard enough stuff to get major league hitters out. Bouton's self-assessment in Ball Four seems to be justified: he probably doesn't have a good enough fastball or slider by 1969 to make it as a major league pitcher, and unless he gets the knuckler to work, that's it for him.Now let's look on the other side. If there were ever a guy who knew something about such a situation, it was Sal Maglie. Maglie's emergence as a good major league pitcher was delayed by his \\"outlaw\\" years in the Mexican league. Like Bouton, Maglie wasn't overpowering -- in his finest year he struck out only 146 in 298 innings. But unlike Bouton, Maglie was very successful in his 30s. When Maglie tells Bouton that a key ingredient for success of an older pitcher is not walking too many hitters, he's onto something. Bouton gave up 12 gopher balls in only 92 innings with Seattle in 1969, and if you're that vulnerable to the gopher, you've got to keep the walks down. Most importantly, Maglie had accomplished what Bouton was trying to do -- not with overpowering physical gifts, but by assessing his own situation accurately; there was something to learn there.The point is not that Bouton is right or Maglie is right, but that there are two good perspectives here, and if Bouton weren't so full of himself, he might be able to pick up what good things Maglie had to offer him, combining them with his own valid insights. Instead, Bouton spends the whole book making fun of Maglie and anyone else in a position of authority, refusing to learn anything from anyone older.Bouton is a hero to everyone who has ever been fed up with their teachers, their boss, or \\"the establishment\\" at large, because many readers find it cathartic to read someone's rantings against stodgy authority figures. But in the final analysis, Bouton isn't necessarily all that brighter or more insightful than those he critiques: he's just as closed-minded, he just has a different opinion. He's not Galileo; he's not even Bill James. He's just a guy speaking his mind, always candidly, often rudely, and only sometimes with a valid point.Ball Four is a worthy read because there's no other book quite like it; Bouton is always brutally honest about his feelings, and he conveys the full flavor of a turbulent era in baseball history. The book was considered sensational at the time, but it's not such a prurient interest anymore: now it's useful mostly to convey what all the fussing and fighting was about back then. But in the end it's a fallible set of perspectives by a very fallible individual."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"When &quot;Ball Four&quot; was published in 1970, Jim Bouton was attacked by players, sportswriters, and the owners for revealing the secret, sordid underbelly of professional baseball. Which should be enough right there to get you to read this thing. But in &quot;Ball Four,&quot; Bouton also reveals the humanity of baseball, the fear, the hate, and the fun, which makes it one of the classics of baseball literature and a must read.Basically, &quot;Ball Four&quot; is a diary of the 1968 season written by a journeyman middle-relief knuckleballer. Before injuring his arm, and turning to the knuckleball, Bouton was a fireball pitcher for the New York Yankees. In his rookie season in 1962, Bouton won two games for the Yanks in the World Series. He played with Mantle and Ford. Then his arm went dead, and he found himself back in the minors, where he taught himself to throw the knuckler. The Yanks didn't think much of him anymore and traded him to the expansion Seattle Pilots (which left Seattle after a single year for...get this...Milwaukee), where he earned a spot as a spot starter and mopup long relief man.The book reveals the personalities of the players and managers and owners. It tells what the players do on the road, in the bullpen, in the minors. It reveals the petty nature of the coaching staff, who are usually all old-time baseball men, not very clever, not prone to trying new ways. It talks about the dicey contract negotiations by players in the days of the reserve clause, when average players made an average wage.Bouton travels in the world of boys. The players are mostly kids in their 20s, not educated, and spent their formative years in baseball. They like pranks. They like women, but they don't know either how to talk about them, or how to talk with them. Most of the time, they just try to look up their skirts. They drink. They sneak in past curfew.But Bouton also works in a competitive business market. Pitchers hide their arm injuries for fear of being sent down. Players fume over bench time. Coaches think small, because to be creative and new means being out of a job. And baseball is all these guys have. They have nothing else to turn to.Certainly in light of recent ballplayer behavior - think of the Pittsburgh cocaine scandals, Strawberry and Gooden, and the thuggish, drug-addled violence associated with football and basketball - &quot;Ball Four&quot; depicts a harmless and almost nostalgic view of baseball. But it still stands as a baseball classic for its honesty, its authenticity, and you wonder how much has changed since 1968.In the end, the players, owners, and writers should have celebrated the publication of &quot;Ball Four.&quot; Sure, it did spawn a string of subsequent tell-alls, and it did forever swing aside the curtain shielding the ballplayer from public scrutiny, but this is a modern age, and we want heroes with all their flaws. Who is it more fun to root for on the field, a straw dummy propped up by a marketing machine, or a man?"},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Bouton wrote a revealing, funny, and socially conscious diary from his days with the expansion 1969 Seattle Pilots (today's Milwaukee Brewers). The author exposes ballplayers as fallibly human rather than as the falsely promoted role models, and discusses such once concealed issues as salary fights, pep pills and groupies. Bouton also confesses his own insecurities as a washed up pitcher hanging on via the knuckleball. This book dates from the era before free agency, when established players had to fight to get paid incredibly modest salaries. \\"Ball Four\\" also reminds us that long hair, civil rights, and Vietnam were controversial in 1969. Unfortunately, Bouton's &quot;kiss-n-tell&quot; insensitivity towards certain teammates (some of whom disliked him) detracts a bit from his writing.This book annoyed the baseball establishment when published in 1970. Bouton (and editor Leonard Schecter) exceeded \\"The Long Season,\\" a mildly irreverent 1959 diary by pitcher Jim Brosnan that also upset the baseball lords. \\"Ball Four: The Final Pitch,\\" contains successive ten-year updates that each add a nice perspective. The last update also contains very emotional reading concerning a tragic death in Bouton's family. This is a very funny and thought-provoking read."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"When my house cleaner threw my coverless, dogeared copy of Ball Four in the trash, I promptly fished it out. It's anyone's guess why a 41-year-old God-fearing female and lifelong Yankee fan would rank that book as a must-save, but I do. The book that &quot;tore the cover off the biggest names in baseball&quot; didn't make me think any less of my heroesit simply made all of them-Mantle, Maris, Tresh, et. al.-a little more human. Beyond that, it's a very funny book. The quality of &quot;earthiness ... and non-sequitor&quot; that Jim Bouton claims he's trying to capture is all there.The older I get, the more I read Ball Four not only as a book about baseball, but as a book about our times similar to (would'd have thought it) Samuel Pepys diary. Bouton freely discusses race, religion, and sex, but not to the point that the reader gets bored with any of them.Beyond everything else, it is a picture of Jim Bouton. It's all there, his insecurities, his faults, his self-serving attitude as well as his honesty, intelligence, and humor. I've heard very little about Bouton since 1970 when my brother and I read Ball Four and thought it necessary to keep it from our parents. But I feel as though I know Jim. And I feel nothing but kindness toward him."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Unlike most sports-themed book, written by the athletes who seem to always be willing to glad-hand themselves, this terrific account into the year in the life of a ballplayer is irreverent and uncompromising. As a former ballplayer, Jim Bouton played hard but always lived by a higher code. Never willing to place himself in a compromising situation, he nonetheless becomes a somewhat outspoken critic of what baseball had become (remember, this book was written during the 1969 season, well before free-agency and the Enron-esque manner by which MLB seems to handle itself as an organization these days). Yes, he does seem harsh on some teammates, past and present, and doesn't fail to criticize himself on many occasions either. But he ultimately reveals himself to be a fan of the game, warts and all. It's easy to understand why this book generated so much controversy. It still manages to convey an important message that athletes and their sport are, at the end of the day, completely fallible. Despite the somewhat shallow character baseball players and managers reveal throughout &quot;Ball Four&quot;, you still get the sense from Bouton that you wouldn't trade the experience for anything in the world. And, more than anything, it destroys the myth that the game was so much better back in the &quot;good old days.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"I just finished reading this book for the third time, and it honestly never loses any of its superiority. Hands down, there has never been a better book written by an professional athlete.I remember reading this book in high school, thinking that it was truly amazing. Now, having read the book in it's 31st year of print, it is still truly amazing. The best thing about the book is that it gives you an honest perspective of the game from the player's point-of-view. And Jim Bouton holds nothing back. He is very straightforward and candid as he pulls no punches and just tells it like it is.In today's day and age, anybody can, if not already has, written a tell-all book, and this truly wouldn't have been entirely possible if not for Bouton's ground-breaking Ball Four. Written in a diary-style, Bouton tells of his adventures with two Major League Baseball teams, the expansion Seattle Pilots, now the Milwaukee Brewers, and the Houston Astros. He cronicles his wild year, experimenting with his &quot;Superknuck&quot; knuckleball and more importantly, just trying to be one of the guys.Ball Four is well-written, not to mention, quite funny. Bouton is a very intelligent man, and he clearly shines in this book, and comes across very well. This is not your typical tell-all book, but more of a book loaded with wonderful behind-the-scenes stories, that really need to be told to really appreciate the game of baseball today. The section added to the end of the book dealing with the aftermath of the publishing is priceless, and a super addition. This is one complete book and a teriffic read. You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Even if you are not a baseball fan you can appreciate this wonderful book.

Jim Bouton blew the lid off baseball with this truly inside view of baseball's salary negotions, horny players, &quot;annies&quot;, etc. His timing was socially relevent as well, as this was written during the infancy of the black power movement, the players union and free angency. No other baseball book has ever approached this one in terms of inside poop on stars, political insight, out and out laughs, and historical perspective. This book has given more references to myself and my friends' lexicons than any other."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Jim Bouton a former twenty game winner was the first player to brake baseballs unwritten code of Omerta. His classic book published in 1970 was based on his previous decade long experience as a successful pitcher. Reading his work we learn much about the day to day life of the pros. As well as much about their appetite for amphetamines and groupies. Bouton gives us insights into such baseball greats as Ted Williams, Mickey Mantle, Roger Marris and Johnny Sain.Finally Jim Bouton leaves us with a glimpse into the soul of a major league pitcher. When asked when the time comes when he no longer has the stuff to make the grade; would he still hold onto the ball? \\"I went down deep and the answer I came up with was yes. Yes I would.

I first read it when it came out in 1970 and I've gone through two or three copies by now. At one point I came across a copy Bouton had pre-autographed, and someone stole it a party. I wish I had it today. I have read this book so many times I have lost count, and it cracks me up every time. &quot;Hiya blondie, how's the old tomato?&quot; has got to be one of the best throwaway lines I've ever heard. Not to be missed though are the numerous human interest stories in the book, the ones that really made the book what it is. Bouton has a very keen power of observation and an unparalled knack for storytelling. I'm sure Leonard Schechter fit in the equation somewhere, but since Bouton has experienced the thrills of winning in the World Series to pitching for the now lost in time Seattle Pilots, no one is more uniquely qualified to comment like he does. Like another reviewer said, I've read this book so many times over the years I feel l! ike I know Bouton well, but I'd bet there's still more to him than we know. It would be great fun to kill a few beers with him, order take out from the bullpen phone and shoot some beaver. &quot;Hey Gelnar, c'mere a minute. Up there near the Section 23 sign. Check the rack on that broad.&quot; &quot;Yeah, surrrrrre.&quot;"},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"All I can say is that Jim Bouton should keep us updated periodically: about his life, and about what is happening in baseball and culture generally. I say that because this edition, with its new epilogue, is excellent reading.What shines through is an intelligent, funny, very likeable, and exceedingly sane -- partially by virtue of his craziness -- person. I think we should be hearing and seeing much more of him than we do: just providing a reasonable voice and open, honest critique of current events. Bouton's voice gives hope somehow.Keep on keeping on, Mr. Bouton!"},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"This books is one of the bests of its kind. It's also one of the first. The tell-all. Jim Bouton takes you on a tour of his 1969 baseball season, most of which was spent with the expansion Seattle Pilots. And this team was so bad that it makes the Tampa Bay Devil Rays look like a World Series contender. But what makes the book work is that Bouton spills it all: boozing in the bullpen, illicit affairs, arguments with the manager. And what sets it over the others of this type of book that followed is that Bouton is intelligent. You actually get an understanding of what makes him tick as a ballplayer. A great read."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"This book is the greatest baseball book ever, bar none! I make it a point to read this book every five years or so, to renew my warmth for the game.

At times very funny and insightful (and even sad), it's not necessarily what I would call well-written: it's in diary format and conversational in tone, so a bit limited in dramatic effect. Still, if you want to know what it's like to ride the pines in the big leagues hoping to make the team, this will tell you what it was like in 1969 when there wasn't a millionth as much media coverage of every detail of every player's life."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Jim Bouton's book Ball Four is one of the best sports books of all time! It is a must for any one who loves the game of baseball. A must read."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"While most reviews here highlight the baseball in Jim Bouton's classic, Ball Four is also an amazing look at life, the psychology of the human condition and the way people think. Bouton took a simple concept -- record the 1969 season and write about it in diary form -- and created a brilliant self study. It is undoubtedly a classic, perhaps the best sports book ever written and a pattern for all other \\"tell-all\\" books that followed.By today's standards, the tales in Ball Four may be tame. Bouton reveals the hijinx players sought while on the road with beaver shooting, pranks, drinking, taking \\"greenies,\\" etc. Now, athlete/writers feel a desire to top that with more outrageousness. (see David Wells' book, for example). Bouton's book broke away the facade that baseball players were one-dimensional All-American boys, and rather than be aghast, I think readers were pleased to see they were the same as us.I first read this book when I was 9 years old. Heady stuff for a kid. I remember showing friends the curse words in the book and giggling back then. But I also remember it being the first book that made me think and look at people differently. It gave me insight into why people did what they did. Maybe it enhanced a budding paranoia in me, but I credit Ball Four for being a huge influence on the way I turned out, now 42 years later.I read it each year and enjoy it every time. I find myself quoting phrases from the book and applying its lessons to every day life. It is a timeless classic and the book is as vibrant today as it was when published in 1970.On one level, it's a great book about the 1969 expansion Seattle Pilots. Baseball fans will love it merely for that, what with the mention of Mickey Mantle, Lou Pinella and Harmon Killebrew to name a few stars, but also others such as manager Joe Schultz and players Gene Brabender, Wayne Comer and Bob \\"Snot\\" Locker. But it is also a fantastic study of the culture and social norms of the 1960s, the double standards we all face daily, the ponderances of why people do what they do and the assurance it's okay to stand out and be different."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"This my favorite book about baseball, and I have read quite a few. I've seen reviewers who didn't like the book because they felt Bouton trashed some people, especially Mickey Mantle. Having read this at 13, I have to say I really didn't feel much different about Mantle after I read it. I did have a lot more respect for what managers put up with and what its like to live on the edge (lets face it, most players don't live where Mantle lived.) The only thing this book does is show you that these guys are human and multi-dimensional. Of course, players don't know what its like today to try to get $28,000 instead of $26,500 or $22,500 like Bouton had to do. This book has a lot of fun in it, its not just gossip and slamming of heroes. Bouton has a good eye for talent too, spotting Mike Marshall and Lou Pinella as coming stars earlier their careers. For those of you who didn't like it, I was just say look up Joe Schultz favorite multi-syllable one word comment and try it out in all of its variations."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"I recall reading Jim Bouton's revealing expose when it was first released, at the conclusion of the 1969 season. By today's standards, it seems somewhat innocuous; certainly, Bouton revealed that baseball players are human beings who are not only skilled at their craft, but flawed as well. The performance enhancing drugs of the day were \\"greenies\\", although it's clear, the performance was enhanced only in the minds of the players popping those pills. The players themselves were depicted as womanizers, or at least, voyeuers, and some of the frank observations Bouton made probably didn't set too well with the soon to be ex-Mrs Bouton.Clearly, Bouton is a very bright guy, playing a game where being an intellectual was considered somewhat detrimental to the \\"team\\" aspect of the game; it's no wonder he was considered to be somewhat of an oddball; but he also comes across as being more than just a little self-absorbed. There's no doubt he's got the gift of gab, and his commentary on some of the pettiness he encountered, especially with the front office, coaches and managers, is quite compelling; although perhaps more than a bit self-serving. He seems way more concerned with his individual success than the overall success of his team, and his flagrant bias against his original team, the New York Yankees, seems motivated by revenge, more than anything else. While insightful, he comes across as equally petty as any of the \\"villains\\" he writes about.Still, his writing was irreverent, at times hilarious, and always very fascinating. Even 40 years after the fact, it's a story filled with candor and remarkable insight into the previously private world of MLB. The game has never been the same since; the iconoclastic perspective was unleashed with all its fury, and certainly, it's still a most compelling tale four decades later."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"even now, the contents of \\"ball four\\" are as equally as contrary to what you think about the order of things as say the first time you hear that hawaiians aren't happy about being american. what this book has to say about institutions make it as valuable an american document as \\"on the road\\".the only real debate i think that could be made over this assertion is who took more speed; kerouac or bouton?the answer is kerouac.leaving only one other question:who took more speed; kerouac or doc ellis?i can't answer that question but i can say that beaning batters successively until you get thrown out of a major league baseball game is much cooler than anything kerouac ever did."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Jim Bouton is no Walt Whitman....he's an ex-baseball player but man what a book!

Bouton had a great sense of humor, but people forget that despite his rather shocking revelations (at least for the times), he was also a ballplayer who loved the game and was desperately trying to hold on to a career that was slipping away."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"best baseball novel ever written. down to earth and realistic and written with style. a true classic read for anybody."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Read about this book online, and I am excited to jump into it.

But in this journey; using his witt and humor you cant help but to cheer for him. Just another relief pitcher with not so common story telling abilities as Jim pulls you right into his waves of emotional ups and downs.

Jim Bouton's personality had you rooting for him all along. In a world that sometimes takes it's sports to seriously, a determined Jim Bouton was able to make it fun while he was living his dream."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"I originally hesitated buying the book because I'm basically a Yankee fan and I knew this was written after he left the Yankees. But then I read an LA Times review of the updated versions, saying it was the greatest baseball book ever written. I see some complaints on here about it being choppy, but it never pretended to be anything else -- we shared his year with him on a daily basis, good, bad, and terrible. He was so honest, about himself as well as others, and I felt I lived that year with him. He doesn't put himself above the other guys, doesn't spare himself anywhere, sharing his grief as well as his joy. And he has a great style, good sense of humor. Was pleasantly surprised. Mine was the Kindle edition and there was nothing wrong with it."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"This book is a trip through the year in the life of a ballplayer. Written in a journal-like style, with several abrupt slices of life from the bullpen, the manager, and the road. It's a great read, with a lot of humor. I struggled to keep a straight face while reading it in the office at work. Great book, and to anyone thinking about buying it - go ahead and get it! You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Great book about the way it used to be in baseball when it was still just a game. A must read."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Bouton's powers of observation and a timely sense of humor convert a baseball story into a human interest one ofgreat proportion"},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"I purchsed this book for christmas present.

I have always been a baseball fan and this book lets the reader see the real life side of baseball. It will shock you but in the end you will feel like you got your moneys worth."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Ball Four made Jim Bouton quite infamous. The tell-all has become much more commonplace in today's world of sports. Bouton and Ball Four were well before my time, but it is a good read nonetheless. I would imagine Ball Four was as controversial in its time as Juiced was a few years ago. I would strongly suggest any fan of baseball read Ball Four, if for no other reason than for its historical significance."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Well written book and expose about the baseball industry. Anyone who enjoys baseball will enjoy this book. Don't be discouraged by the book length. It's an easy read, you can skip around and read just about any place in the book without ruining the story."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Ball Four is a journal of Jim Bouton's days in baseball. It is light hearted and pokes fun at himself and tells it like it was in the 1960's. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in the behind the scenes and what happens in the locker room."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Hubby had knee surgery and was laid up for 3 months.. did alot of reading when he wasn't in physical therapy.... GREAT BOOK"},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"My teacher for my History of Sports class recommended this book and I bought it. He told us that is was a very controversial book at the time because it spoke of things that were better left unspoken. That is the best recommendation you can get!It is a very funny book, sometimes Bouton describes things that could be in a movie about baseball, a National Lampoon version that is. There is drinking gambling and looking at girls from all angles. But didn't we all expect them to this anyway?He was ostracized by baseball but it is really harmless fun, the new sections in this edition also talk about what happened after the first edition came out. Get it"},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Ball Four is a must read for all sports fans. The first of it's kind, Bouton takes readers on the wild ride of a baseball pitcher that has played with the greats (Yankees) and the not so greats (Pilots). Ball Four is a book that reaches all generations and should be on every book shelf."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"\\"BALL FOUR\\" by Jim Bouton (1970)The truth about athlete as role models occurred with the bombshell publication of Jim Bouton's \\"Ball Four\\" in 1970. The result was a diary of the 1969 season, in which the former star pitcher talked about drinking, drugs, sex and RACE, all subjects the liberal \\"clubhouse lawyer\\" had an axe to grind on. \\"Ball Four\\" had more edge than a Doors concert, breaking new ground long before Watergate, the Internet and Monica Lewinsky. The old protocols had protected J.F.K.'s sex life, but Bouton, who probably idolized Daniel Ellsberg, felt the clubhouse adage \\"What you do here, what you say here, what you see here, let it stay here,\\" did not apply.Bouton pissed off Commissioner Bowie Kuhn with his expose of players' common habit of popping amphetamines. He pissed off a lot of wives by revealing a peculiar member of the female species known as \\"Baseball Annies,\\" attractive young women who enjoy sleeping with ballplayers. He pissed off his old Yankee teammates by putting the myth to Mickey Mantle's legend, paying homage to The Mick's Olympian abilities, but talking about Mantle's equally prodigious drinking habit.Bouton describes \\"beaver hunting,\\" a popular player pastime in which they drilled holes in the dugout in order to look up the dresses of girls in the front row. Gives a whole new meaning to the term \\"box seat,\\" doesn't it?Bouton comes from the \\"white man is to blame for all the black man's problems\\" ideology, and he put the lie to baseball's claim of being color blind, with enlightening racial statistics that revealed that many of the game's stars were black, but few journeymen were.Many of his conservative teammates felt he was a bit of a Communist. It has been said that Stalin would have had a job in baseball if he brought the high heat, which Bouton could do, but the Yankees dropped him like a bad habit as soon as he hurt his arm.\\"Ball Four\\" made Bouton rich and famous, holds up well today, and is a gem of humor, irony and inside baseball."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Even aside from its baseball aspects, Ball Four probably deserves recognition as the funniest string of anecdotes ever put on paper. There really isn't much that can be said about this book that isn't positive; hilarious, a quick-moving style of writing, interesting stories, and a great picture of what life in a clubhouse is really like. Bouton's limited observations on politics and individuality on a team are interesting, even if they're dated by now. The only drawback to this book is that it won't impact a reader today as it would someone who read it at its publication. For someone like me who has grown up with public salary negotiations and open discussion of the private lives of athletes, there's no shock value or revelation to be had. Nevertheless, even if it's no longer groundbreaking, it's still more than a worthwhile read for anyone."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"In all my time of being involved with baseball, playing baseball, and coaching baseball on both the little league and the high school levels, never have I read a book that is this informative. I reccomend this book to any little leaguer trying to get the fundamentals of baseball down pat. Whether it be something as complex as teaching the proper execution of the drag bunt, or something as simple and elementary as good sportsmanship, this book covers it all. It is a wholesome book, and wholesome, clean entertainment is so hard to find these days. As official scorer, I score this one a hit!!!"},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"I know nothing about Baseball, mainly because I am English, and I still know nothing about Baseball but this is one of the best sports books I have ever read. Funny, moving, clever but mainly funny it is about a man struggling to get buy watching and involved with a load of others guys struggling to get by, they are allegedly on the same team - but it is hard to tell. I came to this book because of an English Soccer book 'Only a Game' written by Emanon Dunphy. Dunphy based his diary on \`Ball Four' and I liked 'Only a Game' so much I bought the original. I recommend heartily 'Only a Game' it has the same crazy, abrupt and crazily sporting relations that make \`Ball Four' so revealing and funny - but the original is still the best. One of the few books I've read where all I want to do is sit and read and the rest of the world can go hang."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"not a great bookthought i would like it afteer listedning to the author on the eradio, but i was wrong"},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"With all the uproar this book caused in 1970 when it came out, I expected more. More controversy. More about Mickey Mantle. More about loose morals on the road. Jim Bouton is a funny guy, there's little question of that. From the book, I get the tone that he's quite an egotist as well. He has many self-depricating remarks in the book, but after a while, I came to believe he thinks too highly about himself. There are some great stories about &quot;beaver shooting&quot; and other games that ballplayers play that I thought were hilarious. As well, seeing behind the scenes of a baseball season was neat. But I wanted more of the scandalous stuff."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"I am normally a fan of baseball books, and was looking forward to reading this book. I was severely disappointed, and ended up abandoning the book about 25% of the way through it-something I rarely do. After seeing all the other positive reviews, I am honestly not sure I was reading the same book everyone else was-my review is based on the Kindle version.It starts with a forward written years after the book, telling the reader how important this work was, and how groundbreaking it was in its day. No doubt it was, but it sort of ruins the \\"surprise\\" of the book, and quite frankly come across as overly self-serving.The remainder of the book seems to be constructed of day-by-day notes of what Jim Bouton was thinking. He covers all topics, from voyeurism from hotel rooftops to his battles with pitching coaches over knuckleballs.The problem is that his thoughts are about one paragraph long. Some stretch to two paragraphs, and there is maybe one or two that take up a whole page-but the vast majority of them are two sentence blurbs about some topic that immediately transition into a totally different topic, only marginally related. The first quarter of the book is nothing but these short little blurbs. It is like reading a essay written by someone with ADHD- or spending an afternoon with a senile uncle.I couldn't get through it, and gave up.Some of the material was interesting, although quite a bit of it was somewhat mundane and boring. No doubt back when the book was written people were shocked to find that major league owners would try to skimp on salaries by a few thousand, and that minor league facilities were shoddy-but much of the material does not stand the test of time. Bouton's condescending attitude and smugness didn't do anything to help."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Unorganized mishmash. Hard to follow unless you are a knowledgeable, die-hard fan. Mostly, the players sound like a bunch of overgrown kids, which some of them are, but some are in their late 20's and early 30's...time to grow up. Some interesting tidbits, but not worth the money. Needlessly crude in some places."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"I thought this was actually boring. I bought it thinking I would learn something new about baseball, but he comes across as a whiner and complainer."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"If I remember correctly, this book was supposed to be used, in 'like new' shape. It came to me yellowed (yes I know, 40+ years old), but also dirty and worn. I would have judged it as fair condition only."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"I purchased this book thinking it would be interesting to read what it's like to be a baseball player. I read maybe only 1/4 of the ball four section of the book, & was so incredibly disgusted, & appalled!! What a horrible dirty way to live, & I understand he was wanting the reader to know how their life really was, but Bouton thinks the disgusting lifestyle is funny, & obviously enjoys telling about it. The language is so incredibly vulgar & filthy page after page, that I quit reading it because I felt so filthy. It could be that they talked that way, but why would you want to continually repeat that kind of language! I read parts from Ball 5 to the end of the book, & Bouton definately cleaned up the language & the vulgar way of living on this section, but then to continue with Ball 6, & onward? Bouton is definately someone who can't let go with that time of his life. This was definately not worth the .99 I paid for it!"},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"I thought it was very funny when I first read it, but the attitude that he can trash so many other people is a little hard to take. He apparently made no attempt to understand Mickey Mantle but felt okay about slamming him for drinking too much and yet wanted to make sure everyone knew he (Bouton) was a great guy for supporting civil rights and adopting a kid. The book was an attempt to copy &quot;Instant Replay&quot;, but somehow Bouton and his editor thought it was okay to put in many negative comments about people who can't respond. It's no wonder so many people in baseball hated him after this. He seemed to think he was &quot;telling it like it was&quot; but to dump on teamates who can't respond is pretty low. With friends like Bouton you don't need enemies. I think he could have been just as funny without going out of his way to try to hurt people."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"The so-called sports diary book is usually simplistic and misleading. Author clutches tape and begins, &quot;Dear Diary and Friend.&quot; I could be wrong, by profession I am a podiatrist, but I think this book was researched by Bouton and written by Schecter, a good but unhappy fellow with very poor and painful feet. Schecter didn't like many players and this work reflects his slant more than Bouton's slant, when Bouton grew up enough to have any slant at all. Bouton was a marginal college student, who never tired talking of an evening with a beautiful classmate, -- no names here -- later a smash hit star in Hollywood,and whose arrogance and self-promoting puffery Mantle and Maris could not stand. Bad feet can make strong men cry. Schecter wept in my office. But this kind of generalized anger -having Bouton say all ball players but I myself, Saint James of Hoboken, are klutzes -- makes for a work that while entertainig is no more than that. Dangerous, really. Frankly, it makes my feet hurt. Roger Angell, Robert Lypsite, who live on the hypothesis that they are smarter and more sensitive than ball players, love this book. Less neurotic people don't agree. Entertaining, but like yesterday's lobster tails, sheer garbage."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"I have been reading up on Mickey Mantle since seeing the movie 61*, about the Mantle/Maris race to beat Babe Ruth's single season home run record. I checked this book out of the library to see why there was so much hostility towards Jim Bouton, and why he was never invited to NY Yankee Old Timer's Days after writing this book. He always thought it was Mickey Mantle who was keeping him from attending. After Mantle died in 1995, he still didn't get invited - so that shoots that one down. Bouton learned a lesson. People actually LIKED Mickey Mantle and felt offended by what Bouton said about him in \\"Ball Four.\\"He starts out talking about how nice Mickey was to him, different things he did that were touching, kind. But then he proceeds to tell us how he had mixed feelings for Mickey because he saw Mickey shut a bus window on a group of kids wanting autographs. And he refused to sign balls in the clubhouse one time. Jim Bouton was never Mickey Mantle, and its too bad he never knew what it was to be hounded day and night and never have a minute of privacy. So Mantle shut a bus window on some kids once. Knowing what I do about the fame Mantle created and endured during his ball playing days, I can't understand why Bouton even found that important enough to write about.Oh, that's right. Money. He made alot of money writing this book to trash his fellow baseball players. Otherwise, would any of us remember Jim Bouton for anything else?"},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"This is BY FAR the best baseball book I have ever read. But in addition to that, it's one of the best books of any genre that I've ever read.Funny, provocative, insightful, and unique are just a few of the words I'd use to describe Ball Four.I strongly recommend this book to anyone who likes baseball, and even to those who don't, because they may become fans after reading it."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Still Hilarious the second time around. I've always been a baseball fan, coached by Dad and a family tradition. The humanizing of the players made me love it more. Never did understand the controversy, telling the truth about greedy, exploitive owners maybe? But that's true of all big business from ENRON on down the ladder (that was never a secret). Steroids? In this one it's greenies (uppers) pitchers use them in this iteration and made their sore arms and tired muscles disappear. The disappointing thing is no one seems concerned about the health issues. Sports and business all have a history of taking any advantage, cheating is in the eye of the beholder. Heck with records, throw them all out. Baseball is about fun, and parents interacting and enjoying their children."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"Jim Boutin was a very successful pitcher with the New York Yankees before injuring himself and having to become a knuckleball pitcher for the expansion Seattle Pilots. He wrote a diary of his comeback and it is nothing short of hilarious. The picture he paints of major leaguers is that of young boys who play pranks on one another and get their feelings hurt very easily. The only difference is these kids drive sports cars and pick up women during games. One scene in particular where they put talcum powder in another player's blow dryer makes me laugh every time I think of it. What makes the book so good is Bouton's natural way of writing so that the diary entires are not disjointed like Jim Brosnan's \\"The Long Season\\", but they have a flow to them. Even though I did not know many of the players he referenced in the book because it was before my time, it still remains a timeless classic."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"This book had me laughing out loud several times. Even though it was written about 30 years ago, the baseball experiences still ring true. Bouton has a great sense of humor, and the anecdotes about both stars and players you never heard of are a treat. I used this book to get me through the last off-season, and it was a lot of fun to read."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"While many of the &quot;kiss and tell&quot; books that followed &quot;Ball Four&quot; failed to age well, and were much more graphic and revealing, &quot;Ball Four&quot; has become a classic. The story is told honestly and simply. Bouton doesn't hold back his own views, thoughts and beliefs in the tale. He does not try to aggrandize himself, but gives truthful and humorous views of the life as a washed-up, knuckleball pitcher trying to play another year in the Bigs.The humor and stories, at one time were considered bawdy, now it appears very innocent and tame. Not in a naive or rose-colored way, but the stories are of guys being guys, playing a game. It makes you smile and wistful. Wishing you could have been a part of it, or wishing you were still a part of it.Reading it gives greater insight into why players hang on in any sport as long as they do, beyond simply the money to be made."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"This was the most contreversial book of it's time. Jim Bouton used this book to poke holes in America's game baseball. This novel earned Bouton the status of public enemy number one in all of the world of baseball. He gave wild insights into playing for the most prestigious baseball team in the world,the New York Yankees. Bouton also gave away guarded secrets into some of America's most respected heros(Mickey Mantle).This publication by Bouton does not miss a lick. Nothing is sacred in this book. This book was also a bestseller during it's time. Buy this book and read it. You will agree that it is a masterpeice."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"I picked this book up in 1972 when I was 12...and I haven't put it down since. Much more than a \\"baseball book,\\" Ball Four is an expose of the changing attitudes in post-war America. Myth-shattering, yet inspiring, Ball Four is one of the most important books of the last 50 years."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"In this age of mega free agents with quarter of a million dollar contracts, its easy to hate all players who switch teams like we switch socks. However, Jim tells of a time before free agency and shows us how back then the shoe was on the other foot. I think now more than ever people should read this book to understand how far salaries have come and actually see how free agency might have helped the game.Like many of you, I hate the Ramirez and AROD deals, but this book talks about what the players had to deal with back then. It shows when salaries were in the other extreme; maybe giving hope that someday we will meet in the middle.Besides this, this book is a MUST read for all baseball fans. It tells great stories of players some of us where too young to see play, but always hear about. Tells of a time when sports starts greatest sins were adultery and the occasional ball scuff. Not to say adultery is nothing, but it sure beats the coke rush of the 80's.Simply put, this book will make you laugh so hard at times, at other times it will make you teary eyed with the yearning to have lived in that era if you are too young. Bye this book flat out, I promise you will read it more than once, and will pass it down to your children."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"This is a great book to read, even if you're not a big baseball fan. Jim Bouton just has a knack for telling a great story. From reading the book, he must have been the life of the party with the team members but a pain in the butt to the team management with his opinionated views. He really gives some insight to the up-until-then unpublicized life of a major league player from the pressurized meetings with the general manager to the dugout and locker room antics. There are some funny stories but sometimes he goes off on a tangent about political views on Vietnam or racism. But overall it's a great baseball book and you'll have a hard time putting it down once you buy it."},{"Title":"Ball four;: My life and hard times throwing the knuckleball in the Big Leagues","review":"I just finished Ball Four for the 25th time. I read it every year because it reminds me of why I love sports. Not for the superhumans, but for the humans who play them. There is more insight into pro sports, as well as American society, in this book than any I've ever read. It is especially poignant this year which saw Mr. Bouton finally invited to Old Timers' Day at Yankee stadium in response to his son Mike's op-ed piece in the New York Times. Jim's daughter Laurie was recently killed in an automobile accident, and I was saddened that I didn't know about it early enough to send him my condolences. Mike wrote in the Times that this year, his dad really needed this. Amazingly, the Yankees responded.They only let him pitch to one batter, (perhaps Sal Maglie convinced then he was throwing too damn much), but he wore 56, and Bulldog once again took the mound. And to celebrate I re-read the book that was my personal passage to adulthood. Jim Bouton is a true outsider, a revolutionary, and this book is a work of art and history."},{"Title":"Rationale of the Dirty Joke","review":"Proof that academicians can turn any subject into a scholarly study; Legman, an anthropologist, catalogs dirty jokes by type, then traces their history back to ancient folklore, explaining the sources, variations and history. This is a book that works on two levels; if you're really interested in learning that farmer's daughter jokes have a precedent in 12th Century literature, then you won't be disappointed. On the other hand, if you just want to read the good parts and skip the analysis, the book's format makes that easy to do, too. It's unfortunate that both volumes of the &quot;Rationale&quot; are out of print, because they belong in the collection of anyone who's interested in the &quot;more things change the more they stay the same&quot; theory of history, as well as those who just want good jokes to tell people around the water cooler or via email."},{"Title":"Rationale of the Dirty Joke","review":"I always thought my mother was smarter than she let on. She had me read &quot;the rationale of the dirty joke&quot; when I was in my early teens. She told me not to read the jokes so much, but also what was written about the jokes in between. The book/s we had, two by the same name (vol 1 &amp; vol 2)) taught the psychology of why people laugh at 'dirty' jokes. It's armed me in life with an understanding of humour, and the core of humour within us; why we laugh. I can no longer locate my copies, but like the earlier post, I wouldn't sell them for any money if I could find them."},{"Title":"Rationale of the Dirty Joke","review":"I first read this book in college in the early 70's and thoroughly enjoyed this and the 2nd volume for both their literary and scatalogical merit. I just read that Gershon Legman died on Feb 23, 1999 at age 81 at a hospital near his home in Opio, France. Nice obit in NYT, Sunday 3/14/99.I hope his scholarship and fight against censorship will motivate some publisher to re-issue these two classics."},{"Title":"Rationale of the Dirty Joke","review":"I picked up the dirty old thumbed copy from a salvalion army op shop for 30 cents. It looked like all the pages were bent but they had been carfully turned over to mark some of the jokes many years before. I started reading. It was not just a collection of jokes but a beautifully researched and systematic approach. It is to jokes what the oxford dictionary is to the language. It suprising the change since it was written as amongst my friends many of the jokes are not well known and clearly others have technological adaptation. the suprising issue is how things have changed culturally since it was written. One wonders if menstral jokes for example are shared within lesbian social groups that would be taboo in other company or if the degree of ethnic jokes that are no longer promulgated in polite company have their early source listed here. If the porice was right I would like copies for my friends"},{"Title":"Rationale of the Dirty Joke","review":"Luckily, I have both volumes on my shelf, so I don't need to pick either up-- but volume one, used, for less than ten bucks on Amazon?? Get it! This is a hysterically mordant look at dirty jokes by one of the sharpest and filthiest minds ever. And volume one is easier to digest than volume two (which is more oriented to potty humor and perversion). Check the prices for Vol. II on Amazon! As you see, not cheap. So: pick up Vol. I and see what the fuss is about-- you'll be pleasantly surprised at Legman's cranky takes on jokes in every category. He was completely unique; you'll enjoy meeting him, despite his dyspeptic outlook and air of superiority (to everyone, including you). The joke may be dead, but the body's buried here-- and it still looks funny."},{"Title":"Rationale of the Dirty Joke","review":"Looking for a rather illuminating, analytical, and yet completely fun read on the background and psyche behind dirty jokes? Don't even think about not reading this book. Legman's categorization and insight is beyond interesting. It's great."},{"Title":"Rationale of the Dirty Joke","review":"I read this book when it was new in 1968 and just finished reading it again. I thought it was old-fashioned then and unbelievably out of date now. His description of women is really nasty, based as it is on notions of envy and infantilism. For instance, the reason women resent the toilet seat left up is that it reminds them of the lack that prevents them from urinating standing up. Legman states that any woman of forty or fifty years, or even thirty, knows that she is sexually unattracive, and even considers herself undesirable. Really? But if you just ignore all the psychological bullshit, the jokes themselves are italicized, at least in my 1968 copy, and some are really good. This is one I liked: Seven-year-old Ned tells his daddy, \\"My girlfriend Joan and I are going to get married.\\" \\"Oh, that's sweet. But what are you going to live on.\\" \\"No problem,\\" says Ned. \\"I have my allowance and Joan has almost a dollar in her piggy bank.\\" Daddy goes along with the innocent child and says, \\"But what will you do when the children come along.

The topics covered are wide in scope and are really after enabling the development of effective customer focus.Written in a refreshingly easy and readable format, the book begins with an introduction to the concept of customer care, and the changing nature of customer service. The book then goes on to discuss management's role in developing strategy geared towards effective customer service. What follows is a chapter devoted to developing tools geared towards generating and monitoring customer feedback and satisfaction - my favorite chapter, as this area is the usual point of slack in assessing an organization's quality of service. Pieces of advice are given in various areas including (but not limited to): appropriateness research methods to be used, questionnaire development, involvement of top management in the monitoring of action points taken from customers' feedback.Empowerment, training and development, communications, and implementation of a customer-care strategy - concepts that are all indispensable to the customer care practitioner - are also covered in detail in this book. Real-life examples of concept applications are also incorporated so that the reader does not feel inundated with theories alone. Each section ends with a checklist of practical and applicable activities that can be used in evaluating the service that your company currently provides, and in assessing areas for possible improvement."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Is it what she does with English? With the parking of a car, she snatches you to the next page. Is it her juxtaposition of concepts? With the stroke of a pen, she takes the most sacred and holy sanctuary of the devout, a Convent, and infects it worse than a chimney with soot. Greater than all of these is the rich portraits she paints of her characters. Her men are tall and soaring at seven feet. Her birds stop, look, and listen. Her children wait patiently until Sunday and then (innocently) do unspeakable things in full view of the congregation. And then, of course, there are her women. When they are not heckling defiance at the good Lord's sky or badgering Death as to the reason for his inexplicable delay, they grow crops that refuse to be coaxed from the ground for anyone else. Their biscuits and pies are the stuff of legend, and whole meals spark wild-eyed exaggeration in men who are normally rational. Outside the kitchen, they flit. They twitter. They sing like Sirens, fight like dragons, leap through the air with Amazonian thighs, and sweat the sweat that is the oil of God. Ms. Morrison's five-star talent lies not only in creating these characters but also in weaving them together in a rich and rather elegant tapestry. In addition to tossing off a first chapter that is both Alpha and Omega (!), she freely feeds the reader with profound themes of color, race, and religion. And, Hell, it wouldn't be a good book without a pinch of sex, so the good chef's mixed that in as well. Being the writer's writer that she is, Ms. Morrison will be best enjoyed by those who know her craft (writing) and have sat down with the simple goal of enjoying her story, her telling of it, and her unique characters. Listen to them, watch them walk, feel their hair, imagine their eyes. Sit in the corner and see them live. Then, good friend, you will see why they could not help but summon her to Stockholm."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This book is perhaps the best I have ever read. Toni Morrison is a brilliant author, and her prose is beautiful. This novel highlights the hypocrosies of prejudice, leading one to reflect on the true meaning of life and to avoid the meaningless judgements we all pass each day. The intricacies of her novel leave the story to interpretation and the reader with a hunger for more of this fascinating story. Paradise is a novel that can be read and reread, allowing the reader to glean more insight from this book with each new stroll through its magnificence."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This is the most confusing book I have ever tried to read. It started out good then it jumped to other things and I was lost. I never could understand if the characters were living or dead, old or young, or male or female. And the oven???? This book was too much for me, there are too many good books to waste my time with one I don't understand."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"A perfect set-up for conflict is deflated by character sketches, backstory, and an annoying 3rd person omniscient narrator who refuses to plausibly build the tension between the town and the women. Instead, we get the same message--men are violent and women magically realistically escape their violence. Anyone buy that ending?"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Paradise is the only book of Morrison's that i have read and likely it will be the last. From the first page i couldn't help thinking: &quot;this woman is trying way too hard&quot;; there is something i find extremely trying in her writing style. Not to say that i don't generally enjoy great attention to detail in literature -- for example, the visuals in the respective works of Henry Miller and William S Burroughs in which the descriptions seems geniune, as if written with real passion. In Paradise, on the other hand, Morrison really presses the issue, and frankly, her sensory descriptions are average at best and often come across as forged and artificial -- like a square attempting to be interesting and witty. Morrison was described to me as a &quot;postmodern writer&quot;, however, to say this seems to equivocate &quot;postmodernism&quot; with something like vacuous or empty. The opening scene of the book is described on the back cover as something like &quot;horrifying&quot;, but it really isn't, and herein lies another of Paradise's weaknesses: It seems to stay on a flat plane throughout, lost in an eternal grayness. Of course, there are times when Morrison tries to work towards extremes, however, all of these attempts come across as forged, fake, and artificial."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I love Morrison's work generally, but this book was not her best. There are flashes of excellent work but unfortunately it seems that Morrison's genius evaporated with her Nobel Prize. Hopefully her next will be better!"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"After spending half an hour reading all the diverse commentaries on this book, I can't decide whether to read it or not. Maybe I'll sleep on it for a day or two. To the 18 year old from Toronto and the February writer from Michigan, &quot;soaly&quot; is spelled s-o-l-e-l-y."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I'm not a particularly linear person mySelf, but there are times when fluidity becomes too much to hold together. I put the book down after the first chapter and picked it up again when I had some insight into what part of the story was about. It dawned on me one day that &quot;the Convent&quot; represented the problem people (mostly those aligned with the patriarchal system) have with women who are not in relationships with men (and I don't mean only lesbians, any woman choosing not to be in intimate relationships with men for whatever reason). I wanted to understand more about this because of my work with women and spirituality, so I picked up _Paradise_ again and read til I was finished. It was not easy and I didn't find the style helpful for understanding the story. I've read others' books that are fluid with regard to time and place and really felt opened up by that. Not this book. I do think that Toni Morrison outlined the issues of generation gaps, history, gender and race very well. I just wish it had been both more emotionally engaging and easier to follow."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I love to read a good book,nothing like curling up in the corner with a blanket and a nice light to read by. With this book I was sitting upright,grabbing the book with both hands and I kicked the blanket off me with utter frustration.

Dont waste precious time reading this book, when you could be doing or reading something better..."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Once I pick up a book, I feel I have to plow through the whole thing, but with this one I only made it halfway through. I stopped pushing myself to finish this novel because there are too many other good books out there waiting to be read! This was a waste of my time and I will never read a book based on Oprah's recommendation again if this is the kind of literature that is on the list! It was extremely slow-moving and the characters were dark and mysterious to a point of confusion for this reader. Friends have mentioned that they thought they would read this book based on the fact that it was a prize winner and I have flat out told them not to bother."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Be forewarned: this is not a beach read. As a bookseller, I exercise great caution when recommending this book. It is infinitely complex, mentally draining, and worth every bit of effort. Stick with it if it intrigues you. If you just can't get into it, put it down....for the time being. Return to it at a time when you want the satisfaction of completing a daunting task."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I bailed out on this one halfway through. I didn't care about any of the characters or situations and saw no purpose in continuing. Toni Morrison is an interesting author who has written several better novels."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Toni Morrison dared to force readers to think, engage and rethink. Something that Americans are no longer used to doing. The small town, Ruby portrays the same qualities that the &quot;Crucible&quot; dared tackle many years ago. Morrison intricatly weaves a story built on complex and well structured sentences. I found my vocabulary increasing significantly page after page. If a reader does not want to be challenged then this is not a book for you. If a reader gets pleasure not only from the actual plot, but the style of writing, and the uses of symbolism and irony, then this is a book for you. Please, do not let Morrisons sentence structure scare you away. Stick to it, and the satisfaction of completing the novel will be like completing the Boston Marathon."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Although it was somewhat difficult to keep track of all the characters in the beginning, this book is certainly worth the effort. As I delved deeper into the novel, I began to realize how the characters intertwine with one another. This novel is the first that I have read by Toni Morrison, but it certainly will not be the last. There are few books that I read more than once, but this is the exception to my rule."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Enough of Oprah and the media hype surrounding this book. It is a work of art--genius. With the accessibility of novels like this to the general population it is easy to think that everyone will be able to appreciate and enjoy this book. It isn't for everyone and if you can't get through it don't fault the author. Like anything good, this novel needs time and concentration--two things most of us, post-college, do not have. But if you have the inclination--do not deprive yourself of this magical journey."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I was first warned, by O.Winfrey, that the first 100 pages of this novel were very hard to get past. Wrong. It is the first 100 pages that kept me so enraptured. With each new female character I met I was much too anxious to get to the convent."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Paradise may not have been the easiest book to read, but it was truly worth while. As a student in high school I felt accomplished when I finished Paradise, just as I felt when I finished Light in August and Catch-22. Paradise pulled me in and never let go. I was enchanted by the history and depth that Morrison provided for each character. I think, having read all her novels, that Paradise is the best of Morrison's work.To the people who find this book to diffucult to read for entertainment. Why read if you are going to read books that aren't challenging? You are just wasting your time. Reading should increase your understanding of the world around you and take you to places you will never be able to see."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I am just beginning to read Paradise a second time. That fact alone says that I was extremely impressed with it. I never read a book twice or see a movie twice, because I always say,&quot;I know what's going to happen.&quot; Now that I know what happened in Paradise, I am going back to figure out why (more deeply-with a deeper understanding). The first time I read through, to get to the &quot;what&quot; at the end. I gave this book a nine, because Ithought Toni should have left the book ending with the women missing and we didn't know if they espaced, were hidden in the house , were buried by Lone, some were driven away by some survivers or what. Theencounters they all had in the last chapter, I used to help me figure out who survived and I was left with the thought that only Consolata and the white woman died. Now who was the white woman? It wasn't Consolata, because she was shot last and they said she was light-skinned. Another reason for the nine- if there was another woman in the convent, a white woman, why wasn't she discussed? She wasn't Mavis, Gigi, Seneca, Pallas or Dede, because we visited all of them, alive and well, in the last (unecessary) chapter. It couldn't have been the woman lost in the blizzard, because she wasn't gettin' out the car. She died with her family. It's not important, except that it's a big leap for us to imagine or feel sympathy for a white woman &quot;killed first&quot; that we never met. Third reason for the nine- I don't know if I liked this book better than, Possesing the Secret of Joy, by Alice Wlaker, also worth a reread. This book gets nine points, because it was magnificently written. It was actually poetry. To call it a novel is to discredit it. It raised important questions/issues: why have we forgotten all that our ancestors have done to bring us this far/get us here? Why don't we pay homage to our ancestors by voting, becoming enterpreneurs, building our communties and respecting our elders? What do we need to teach our children? Are we still looking for a scape goat today? Who taught us to be independent of one another and isn't that attitude killing us? What happened to , &quot;It takes a whole village?&quot; What are our ideals of beauty and where do they come from? What role do/should men play in relationships? Where have our values gone? Here's a thought/interpretation: The people in Ruby were not in Paradise; The people in the convent were. The people in the convent were in paradise, because they had a place wherein they could get away from it all, leave their baggage at the door, not be judged, not have responsibilties, not have to answer questions and not be held accountable, they only had to &quot;Talk about it,&quot; if they wanted to , when they wanted to (not to mention all the,liquor they wanted-just kiddin'). The people of the convent were in paradise, because they finally had therapy. They finally dealt with their pasts. They got it all out , while the people of Ruby were still pointing fingers. The women in the convent set themselves free and were not held captive by the pain of the past any longer. They seemed to let go of false hope and thoughts of revenge. After the loud dreaming was over, they found out what they were hungary for, but the people of Ruby were still searching. Don't we all need a convent of that sort, at least once in lifetime?"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This book was excellent. We all speak English but Toni Morrison has a way of linking words that is brilliant. I love her mind. Unlike some books that you can sit and read without thinking, Toni Morrison makes you think."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"After watching Oprah, I decided to read this book. While I didn't enjoy it very much, I think the fault lies with me. I must not be smart enough to understand it. I'm going to read it again and maybe I'll enjoy it more."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"For most readers, literary selectivity is function of variable tastes. In some instances even with an author you may have enjoyed in the past, that author's choice to experiment with different writing styles, exploration of new subject matter or the reader's evolving preferences may result in a less than favorable experience with a particular book. I also believe an author's growing popularity and reputation tends to attract a number of readers who would not normally include that author on one's reading list.I find my perplexed by the number of negative recommendations for PARADISE as I consider it one of the very best I have read in a long time. I do not purport the book is an easy read but I'm equally as certain Ms. Morrison never set out to write a summer poolside &quot;light reading&quot; effort. The book demands consideration and contemplation as she infuses such a wide range of issues - moral, sociological, theological, political, economic, among others - I thought it was way too short.In the main, PARADISE recounts the history of a close knit African American community in the town of Ruby, Oklahoma, and the convergence of events leading up to a tragic conflict with the peculiar, possibly occultist transients inhabiting a functionally abandoned convent 17 miles outside of town. It is tale of displacement and migration; of an egalitarian plan that devolved into status and class; of the dangers of xenophobia and misplaced prejudices, and those descriptives only brush the surface of the book's themes. It is also a story of escapism and the search for security; of people seeking non-judgmental support and social acceptance.PARADISE illuminates all of Toni Morrison's literary talents at her best and is one of the limited number of books that can ever reach the status of timeless classic."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This novel, one of Morrison's darkest, of self-righteous men and independent women could easily be transplanted from its all-Black community in Oklahoma to a Muslim village in Pakistan, to a Jewish shetl in the Pale, indeed, to a small or not-so-small town anywhere in the world inhabited by any race, color or creed. It is a universal story of the smugness that can come from power and safety and the perceived threat of women who have thrown off the accepted roles of battered wife, pregnant girlfriend or understanding Missus with a wandering husband. A warning, a shot across the bow, a tale of caution for uppity women, and ... I was about to say a cautionary tale for self-satisfied males but they, of course, will not read it"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"If your idea of fiction involves various \\"shades\\", then this is NOT the book for you. Then again, it should be. It's time to put your gray cell matter to work and complicate your thoughts. It's not Ms. Morrison's job to make reading easier for you, and if you have read her other books, you HAVE to keep up! (12/24/2012)When Oprah had her book club meetings on television, this was a book that at least 50% of the members claimed having to re-read it once or twice. I started this book 3 times -I would get stuck at the same place. I thought I lost the ability to read -where were these new characters or incidents coming from? On the third go 'round, I vowed I'd keep moving on; about 20 pages after where I thought I hit my own roadblock, EVERYTHING BEGAN TO MAKE SENSE! Best of all, I became consumed with this treasure. Working, eating, bathing, and sleeping took a backseat; I would think about getting back into the book at every possible moment. One night (after some considerable tossing and turning, going over previously read pages in my mind), I gave up and finished the book -never leaving the bed. I was blown away by the ending; enough so that while working in a bookstore, I could sell this book just by saying, \\"I couldn't believe that happened to the nuns!\\"\\"Paradise\\" is just one the many reasons to love language."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This complex cluster of stories will keep you guessing and trying to figure it all out. It can be a difficult read, but it's well worth it."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This is certainly a complex book, reminiscent (for me at least) of Faulker's &quot;The Sound and the Fury&quot;. Several characters tell of the budding, ominous, and inevitable conflict between the town of Ruby and the nearby women of the Convent. The town is the epitome of male-dominated order, and the Convent is the home of women seeking refuge from that order. &quot;Paradise&quot; is the story of their creation, how they evolve, and how the town eventually must destroy the Convent for its own perceived survival.This is an amazing book, extremely well-written, if extremely confusing in parts. The narrative is constantly switching hands, and the story is not told in chronlogical order. Combining this with the many characters in the story can lead to a pathological chaos. But the book is worth it, largely because the prose is so magical and poetic. The biblical and mythological themes are not on the surface, but give a rich backdrop to the story. The characters, especially of the town (for me) are memorable.This is definitely more complex than &quot;Beloved&quot;. But the complexity, which forces concentration, does create intrigue and subtlety that rewards."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Besides that i liked the story/stories it was much better when rereading parts i had not understood well, infact then it was enjoyable . I think one does not have to try and compare this one to the other books she has written before. To me it felt like she got all the themes from most of her past books going as one book. It would have to take very good imagination and a high level of consciousness to get through this one, well actually with Beloved as well I suppose,... there I go with the comparison myself, i suppose in the end they are all written by the same person. Paradise too with time, thinking about it, becomes clearer and more fulfilling."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Never have I wanted to get out of Pardise so bad.

The story being portrayed here had great potential, but I think maybe Miss Morrison was cooking or on the phone and forgot where she was and so did I."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Come on Toni, are you kidding?

I was dissapointed that so many people gave it one or two stars because it was confusing. I had a little trouble following it at first but I understood it, and I'm only 13.

Overall this book is a great piece of literature."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I read this for a book club. I went away for a weekend and read it in 24 hours. Paradise is about isolation. Are you interested in isolation? I was.

I read slowly, but to no avail. It was like a manic depressive nightmare with not a very good plot.

But that is why there are so many good books out there for us, to keep us looking for a good read and we all read differently. Thank god for that."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Morrison's new novel begins, &quot;They shoot the white girl first.&quot; After that opening statement, it's all downhill. E.B. White once equated fine writing with clarity and simplicity. If indeed these two qualities are the mark of exemplary writing, Morrison's Paradise fails terribly. This tale is twisted and convoluted. There are no turns of phrase that strike this reader (a university literature professor) as exemplary and extraordinary. My thoughts, as I read this work, were thus: (1)if it had been written by a newcomer, it likely would not have been published and (2) Ms. Morrison has probably reached the stage in a literary career when awards and accolades intimidate editors and most reviewers from offering an honest appraisal. In short, confusion reigns in Paradise and, unless you have ample time to waste, it is a book best left on the shelf."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I am nearly finished with this book, and I still waiting for Ms. Morrison to finally disclose what she is trying to say. I want to read novels for comfortable enjoyment. This book certainly doesn't meet that criteria. It is more in line with a heavy college textbook. I would certainly not recommend it for relaxed reading."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Toni Morrison (both Beloved and Paradise) is the only author on Oprah's list who engendered distaste in me for the entire work. Both are disjointed and vague...so much so that it's very difficult to follow the action or even understand what has transpired. Attempts to use flashback are unsuccessful. Instead, the author jumps from one scene to anther in a totally disorganized manner. In Paradise, at the end of the book, it was still impossible to discern what had happened to some of the women who ended up at the convent. The emotions presented are flat and unrealistic. For example, after not seeing her mother for nearly 10 years, a young woman reacts with the intensity one might expect if she'd been in the kitchen and had been away for only a minute or too. The mother, on the other hand, left terrified that this girl was trying to murder her, yet is not affected at all when running into her again. Finally, the mass murder scene as the book opens is left hanging..literally, and in the end there is no clue about how some survived or how they were able to escape w/out notice. This is definitely a 2 thumbs down book!"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Others have recapped this story too well to be improved upon by me. I'll just say I like it and I didn't like it, but it did keep me reading. I often find Oprah's book list heavier reads than I sometimes want. There is a distinct undertone throughout the story and while it does get those brain cells going, sometimes it's not the best relaxing read. It is a good novel and worth the read, but know what you're getting into so you can best enjoy it."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I had heard Toni Morrison say that you should continue to read this book even if you didn't understand it.

I really hated this book."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"the author has some sort of problem with light skin and dark skin, this is all she expoused throughout the book, there are many, many, many beautiful colors of black people and light skin isn't the prettiest...get over it! what a sorry book!"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Most of the readers in our book group regretted choosing this book.

There is no way for me to compare this to her works or any other writers works for that fact because she is truly in her own realm. Now with this being said I must admit that I enjoyed the challenge in the reading of Paradise and even though it's not MY idea of PARADISE it was to the citizens of Ruby and that must be respected. I will not try to sway you one way or the other into reading this novel but I will say that if you are looking for a thought-provoking novel with twist and a couple of turns this is indeed for you."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Seems to be a lot of disagreement on this book. While I can understand a lot of people not liking it (not a conventional plot driven novel), what I can't understand is how so many people found it \\"confusing\\". I'm a handyman, not some english major grad student, and I didn't have any problem following along, though the ending was NOT straight forward. I loved it. It was one of the best books I've read in years. Another reviewer called it \\"Faulkner light\\"; they were right. Actually they could have called it \\"Absalom, Absalom!\\" light. It's like Faulkner with a GREAT editor. This book was MUCH better than \\"Beloved\\". If you love great language and writing, it's hard to go wrong with Toni Morrison."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"This is a huge book encompassing human fear, love, sex, religion, and destruction of society. The story is of women and color and society. Morrison writes in strong, intelligent language. The story slips in and out of space and time fluidly. It's complex and engaging. Not an easy read but worth it."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I was interested in this unique story from the first page, but as it unfolded, I felt a bit perplexed. Instead of having a pencil and paper to decode the family trees involved (as I probably should have) I was mopping sweat from my forehead. I almost felt as if I were reading the section in Genesis &quot;Abraham begot Isaac. Isaac begot..&quot; and so forth. But, these people were definately not biblical.The elements of the &quot;supernatural&quot; incorporated in the book were OK, but I felt they were just kind of thrown in there to make things a bit more mysterious. On the surface, it's the story of a close-knit (almost incestuous) society who has a cult of outsiders living near their town.Although the meat of the novel was tough going, I did enjoy the finale. Through all the tumult within, I was uplifted by the end. I wouldn't call this one of Ms. Morrison's best, and it's not &quot;The Bluest Eye&quot;. But, I'm not giving up on her."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Like Beloved, Paradise is layered with meanings and resonances. Some of this can be caught more or less subconsciously when you read it the first time--there was a _definite_ emotional impact on the first reading, but like most people the story confused me completely. I've read it four times through, and it was worth the effort. But it is meant mostly (I think) for people who've been studying literature; this is NOT intellectual snobbery, but learning to see symbolism and connections in the author's writing is a skill, and studying literature (especially Ms. Morrison's other works) is necessary in a lot of ways. For quick entertainment, this book rates very lowly; it's aimed at a different audience.That said, I think overall I preferred both Beloved and Jazz; Beloved especially took the reader into the character's minds much more effectively. Possibly that's because the aims of the novels are different. One of the most important aspects of Beloved is how it maintains sympathy with Sethe without condoning her actions; Paradise' message is much more ambiguous and hence the characters are as well. Altogether, very worth reading."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Our bookclub meets once monthly and reads african writers. We've read all Sister Morrison's books. We never ran out of ideas and concepts during our Paradise discussion which we did for two sessions. Following are a few of our comments/observations: Myriad layers and people mingle and the only certainty is that life will change and we must accept and validate these changes. This book will change your reality. It should be shared with thoughtful people who care about ideas. You will find out a lot about who you are. Paradise is a book that must be discussed. It is deep, provocative and unpredictable. The reader must be interested in the community at large and the personalities that inhabit it. Morrison's ability for strange names and unusual metaphors keep the reader enthralled. Paradise needs to be read and re-read as we mature. Readers must suspend usual notions of plot, chronology, reality. A book you must stay with! Randomness of evil. Can we create Paradise? Paradise is in the moment. Paradise is in our heads,not in our hearts Who was the white girl? Why was she shot first? In guessing that you'll reveal your own stereotypical thoughts about racial images. What holds it together is Morrison's packing it with incidents,characters. She stuffs this book with everything."},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"Like all of Ms. Morrison's novels, &quot;Paradise&quot; is powerful, complex and brilliant. What a joy to come across a book which can resonate such power and intensity as this novel achieves. Ms. Morrison is brilliant in weaving a complex narrative to heights very few writers achieve, but who many desire. The complexity of &quot;Paradise&quot; is partly due to Ms. Morrison's use of time which is a key element in the construction of her characters. We are all a product of time - our lives are shaped by past, present and future events. Therefore to write about onself is chronological order is, perhaps, misleading. Consequently, Ms. Morrison chooses to illustrate her characters with narrative and dialogue that are not necessarily a part of the precise moment but are elements, nevertheless, that have shaped their behavior, their lives. As this becomes confusing when reading one soon learns, as the story unfolds, the continuity of the characters. Equally complex, is the story about Ruby itself- a town steeped in tradition. A town that wants to maintain order so much so that it becomes dangerous and unhealthy. A town where male dominence rules over everything, even its progress to move forward. These are only some of the elements in this incredible work. Spirtiuality, God and love are also key, here, so aptly told through the four major women in this novel - it is through the women that we see the balance that Ruby can achieve but that the town will not allow. To experience this monumental work is to take a journey - a journey to &quot;Paradise.&quot;"},{"Title":"Paradise","review":"I promised someone I love I would read this book. It was horribly written.
