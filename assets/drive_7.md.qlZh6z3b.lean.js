The OPM, Organisasi Papua Merdeka, has been fighting Indonesian rule in West New Guinea since 1969; the military presence there was established in 1962. The author believes that the great majority of West Papuans support the OPM. The Indonesian Transmigration programme has forcible alienated clan land and sponsored settlers from Java. As a result of this policy 10,000 Papuans fled Irian Jaya in mid-1984 to seek safety in Papua New Guinea. The exodus was more than 1 per cent of the indigenous population. The OPM has almost no foreign allies. Both Papua New Guinea and Australia emphasize that Irian Jaya is part of Indonesia and thus an internal matter. The author predicts that greater autonomy for Irian Jaya would be more likely to result from political pressure on Jakarta than from a military victory by OPM.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=noQhAAAAMAAJ&dq=Indonesia%27s+Secret+War:+The+Guerilla+Struggle+in+Irian+Jaya&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Java Power Reference: A Complete Searchable Resource on CD-ROM","description":"Explores J2ME, covering topics including graphical user interfaces for small devices, designing applications for wireless environments, and the Mobile Information Device Profile.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ieBA3-Q-V6sC&dq=Java+Power+Reference:+A+Complete+Searchable+Resource+on+CD-ROM&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Rider of the Ruby Hills","description":"A WORD FROM LOUIS L AMOUR  Almost four decades ago, when my fiction was being published exclusively in  pulp  western magazines, I wrote a number of novel-length stories, known back then as  magazine novels.  In creating them, I lived with my characters so closely that their lives were still as much a part of me as I was of them long after the issues in which they appeared went out of print. Proud as I was of how I presented the characters and their adventures in the pages of the magazines, I wanted to tell the reader more about my people and why they did what they did. So, over the years, I revised and expanded these magazine works into novels that I published as full-length paperbacks under different titles.  These particular early magazine versions of my books have long been a source of considerable speculation and curiosity among many of my readers, so much so of late, that now I ve decided to bring four of my  magazine novels  back into print in this latest volume of my short fiction.

This re-release of Different Children, Different Needs clarifies what the Bible means when it commands us to \\"train up a child in the way he should go\\" (Proverbs 22:6). It teaches moms and dads how to understand the personality God has given each of their children and how to tailor their parenting styles to meet their children's needs. Pastor Charles Boyd uses the popular DISC personality assessment model to help parents better recognize, accept, and appreciate their kids' temperaments. IF ONLY YOUR PARENTS HAD READ THIS BOOK... Do you know whether your child is determined, influencing, soft-hearted, or conscientious? The key to effective parenting is knowing what motivates your child. The information and tools provided in Different Children, Different Needs will take the mystery out of the way you interact with each other. You'll begin to realize things you never understood about the best way to relate to each unique son or daughter. Your children will come to realize how God has designed and gifted them, growing in confidence and finding a sense of belonging. And you'll enjoy the fulfilling parenting experience you've always wished for. Story Behind the Book Based on the biblical teaching of Proverbs 22:6, the principles in this book can become the backbone for everything you do as a parent. If you don't practice the \\"big picture\\" principle presented in Different Children, Different Needs , your kids will be negatively affected. But if you take Proverbs 22:6 seriously and seek to apply what you find in this book, your children will come to understand how God has designed and gifted them. They will grow to have both a sense of confidence and a sense of belonging. Just when you master the art of parenting one child, here comes another and they're \\"different as night and day.\\" You must learn how to tailor your own unique parenting style to meet your children's special needs more effectively.

Developer s Workshop to COM and ATL 3.0 provides an in-depth treatment of COM and shows how to adopt a component framework, namely ATL, to help lessen the burden of repetitive code. Every chapter contains integrated lab assignments that give you numerous opportunities to build COM clients and servers using raw C++ and IDL, as well as the Active Template Library. The book is divided into five sections, each focusing on a particular aspect of COM and ATL development. The book begins with a review of object-oriented and interface-based programming techniques, then moves into the core aspects of COM, including a full examination of language independence and location transparency. The author illustrates the numerous CASE tools used during ATL development and discusses apartments, COM exceptions, object identity, and component housing, in addition to various advanced concepts such as COM categories and tear-off interfaces. The fourth section examines a number of COM patterns such as enumerators, collections, scriptable objects, and callback interfaces. The book closes with an investigation of using ATL as a windowing framework and wraps up with the development of a full-blown animated ActiveX control using ATL.

Rather than giving only general advice, or black letter law and some practice problems for a specific subject, Bridging the Gap provides the context, the process, and the problems.

There is a focus on the integration of theory, research, and practice throughout the book. The book proceeds from the more global pre sentations of basic theoretical approaches to applications of these approaches with specific problems and populations. It then presents more integrated intervention approaches and overviews of the research literature. One of the unique features of this book is its focus on future directions for each approach, both in clinical prac tice and in research. A second unique feature is its structured format across di verse approaches with a focus on empirical validation of approaches. Another innovation is the presentation of interventions that integrate major components of different theoretical approaches. Thus, the book reflects the current trends in the field of interventions with specific problems and populations, empirical valida tion of the approach, and the integration of treatment approaches. There are five major sections in this book. Part I consists of four chapters that address a variety of issues related to child psychotherapy. Chapter 1 by the editors examines the historical roots of child psychotherapy and explores current trends in the treatment of diverse child disorders. It emphasizes the movement to \\"treat ments that work\\" and sets the stage for the chapters that follow.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ApfTBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Call Me Pat: The Autobiography of the Man Howard Hughes Chose to Lead Hughes Aircraft","description":"A definitive biography of the man who helped build one of America's premier aerospace companies, it documents the trials, traumas, & triumphs of a career that took him from Navy radioman to molder of America's space policy to principal architect of Hughes Aircraft Company.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5aznAAAAMAAJ&dq=Call+Me+Pat:+The+Autobiography+of+the+Man+Howard+Hughes+Chose+to+Lead+Hughes+Aircraft&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Samurai And The Tea: A Legacy of Japan's Early Christians","description":"Michael, a Japanese American boy, longs for a set of samurai swords owned by his grandmother; he's humiliated when instead, he receives a Tea Ceremony Set.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=dODjPAAACAAJ&dq=The+Samurai+And+The+Tea:+A+Legacy+of+Japan%27s+Early+Christians&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Early Writings of Alan Watts","description":"Discusses Zen Buddhism, the influence of Buddhism on Japanese art, Buddhism in the modern world, and the nature of the mind, the self, and reality","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bAYHAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Early+Writings+of+Alan+Watts&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hawaii Handbook: The All-Island Guide (4th ed)","description":"A fourth revised edition of a handbook to the 322 islands of the Pacific that make up the Fiji Islands, covering Viti Levu, Yasawa islands, the Lomaiviti group, Vanua Levu, Taveuni, the Lau group and Rotuma.

The resulting files - and those on Joyce's wife Margaret, known as Lady Haw Haw - were kept secret for many years, but in 2000 were released to the UK National Archives. It is from these unique sources that this account of Joyce's life and personality is constructed. Featured documents range from broadcast transcripts to statements and correspondence from Joyce's family, friends and colleagues; from Joyce's official documents to his personal journal in the desperate days before his capture in May 1945. Along the way, many enduring questions about Lord Haw Haw are considered: why a man described as a nonentity was a threat to the British establishment; how he captured the public's imagination to become universally loathed; why the authorities prosecuted when the documents published here prove they were aware of Joyce's American citizenship; and the circumstances that led to Joyce's execution when prosecution of his wife was waived on compassionate grounds.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jfIMAQAAMAAJ&dq=Lord+Haw+Haw:+The+English+Voice+of+Nazi+Germany&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Review of Ophthalmology: Expert Consult - Online and Print, 1e","description":"Don t take chances with your exam prep!

In UNDERSTANDING JESUS, author Joe Amaral delves deep into Jewish history, societal mores, and cultural traditions, closing the gap created by geographical distance and over two thousand years of history. Using a chronological approach to the life of Christ, he guides the reader through significant events such as Jesus' birth, baptism, and crucifixion, pointing out illuminating details that that the Western mind would normally miss. Amaral's premise is that to understand Jesus, we must understand the time and place in which he was born, the background from which he drew his illustrations, and the audience he spoke to. Throughout the book he explores specific terms, places, and events for their significance and shows how they add richness and meaning to the text. Topics include the connection between Jesus and John the Baptist, the annual Feasts and why they are important to modern Christianity, Jewish customs such as foot-washing, clean and unclean foods, paying tribute to political governments, and the significance of various miracles. In UNDERSTANDING JESUS, Amaral draws back the curtain on a way of life that existed during the reign of the Caesars, and in doing so, reveals truths about the way we live more than two thousand years later, half a world away.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fAyvFmRssxEC&dq=Feasts+of+the+Old+Testament:+Their+Historic,+Christian+and+Prophetic+Significance+(Creation+Worldview+Ministries,+Study+Guide)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A+ Certification Test Yourself Practice Exams","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=G_CjxeFOOwcC&dq=A++Certification+Test+Yourself+Practice+Exams&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blue Highways: A Journey into America","description":"Published in 1983 to phenomenal reviews, Blue Highways: A Journey into America became a cult classic on par with Jack Kerouac's On the Road and John Steinbeck's Travels with Charley.

The essence of 60 consecutive sermons given over the course of more than a year at Westminster Chapel, London, is preserved in this contemporary devotional classic. The Sermon on the Mount is one of the most familiar passages in the Bible, but is also one of the most frequently misunderstood. For Martyn Lloyd-Jones, the failure of the church today to appropriate its message is a telling symptom of its superficiality, ineffectiveness and unattractiveness. 'The Doctor', as he was affectionately known, shows the remedy for the church's lamentable weakness in Jesus' lakeside teaching, which he explains and applies memorably, through the Sermon's rainbow of themes - including blessedness, joy, spiritual mourning, salt and light, denying oneself, fasting, anxiety, discernment, self-deception, and the trials and tests of faith. Re-covered and reformatted February 2002.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cFCoDwAAQBAJ&dq=Studies+in+the+Sermon+on+the+Mount&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Death and the Invisible Powers: The World of Kongo Belief","description":"\\"[Bockie's] description of Kongo culture is vivid, beautifully clear, and absolutely authentic, as only a native could make it....

Jean, the youngest of the clan, grew up to be a world renowned folksinger. But she was hardly unique in the family. All the Ritchies sang -- when they worked, when they prayed, when they rejoiced, even when tragedy struck. Singing Family of the Cumberlands is both an appealing account of family life and a treasury of American folklore and folksong. In the deceptively simple but picturesque language of rural Kentucky, Jean Ritchie tells of a way of life now nearly vanished and of a gentle, upright people shielded from the outside world by forbidding mountain ranges, preserving the traditions of their forebears. Foremost among those traditions were the British folksongs brought from England by James Ritchie in 1768. Even in a region noted for its wealth of folksongs, the Ritchies' inheritance was exceptional. Forty-two of the family's beloved songs are woven through Jean Ritchie's narrative, complete with words and often musical scores. Each song evokes a memory for Jean -- hoeing corn, stirring off molasses, telling ghost stories, singing a dying baby to its eternal rest. Songs lightened the burden of poverty for the Ritchies and brought them joy and solace. Illustrated by Maurice Sendak, Singing Family of the Cumberlands will delight readers in all walks of life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=0lAnKTbZrVgC&dq=Singing+family+of+the+Cumberlands&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Great Chicago Fire","description":"Did the Great Chicago Fire really start after a cow kicked over a lantern in a barn? Find out the truth in this addition to the What Was? series. On Sunday, October 8, 1871, a fire started on the south side of Chicago. A long drought made the neighborhood go up in flames. And practically everything that could go wrong did. Firemen first went to the wrong location. Fierce winds helped the blaze jump the Chicago River twice. The Chicago Waterworks burned down, making it impossible to fight the fire. Finally after two days, Mother Nature took over, with rain smothering the flames. This overview of a stupendous disaster not only covers the fire but explores the whole history of fire fighting.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bWB_CwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Crossroads 2: 2 Workbook","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=o5fBAAAACAAJ&dq=Crossroads+2:+2+Workbook&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Best American Nonrequired Reading 2003","description":"The \\"fresh anthology of hip American writings\\" (Forth Worth Morning Star-Telegram) returns this year with a spectacular array of fiction, nonfiction, and humor, drawn from traditional and alternative magazines by Dave Eggers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VA4sda0VpsIC&dq=The+Best+American+Nonrequired+Reading+2003&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MCSD Architectures Exam Prep (Exam: 70-100)","description":"Learn the new MCSD Solutions Architecture approach from an exam perspective (Analyzing Requirements and Defining Solution Architectures, exam 70-100) Features real-world examples, interactive activities, and over 100 hands-on projects that reinforce key concepts to help prepare for the exam.

But there is more than one sort of luck. In 2008, historian Tony Judt learnt that he was suffering from a disease that would eventually trap his extraordinary mind in a declining and immobile body. At night, sleepless in his motionless state, he revisited the past in an effort to keep himself sane, and his dictated essays form a memoir unlike any you have read before. Each one charts some experience or remembrance of the past through the sieve of Tony Judt's prodigious mind. His youthful love of a particular London bus route evolves into a reflection on public civility and interwar urban planning. Memories of the 1968 student riots of Paris meander through the sexual politics of Europe, a series of roadtrips across America lead not just to an appreciation of American history, but to an eventual acquisition of citizenship. And everything is as simply and beautifully arranged as a Swiss chalet - a reassuring refuge deep in the mountains of memory.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x3fjBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hey, I'm the Customer: Front Line Tips for Providing Superior Customer Service","description":"Offers step-by-step guidelines and tips for providing superior customer service, discussing customer satisfaction, how to identify customer needs, problem solving, and other topics","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lIMlvFLW2SkC&dq=Hey,+I%27m+the+Customer:+Front+Line+Tips+for+Providing+Superior+Customer+Service&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Heal Yourself: Body Mind Spirit","description":"The body wants to return to balance.

The originator of Metaphysical Painting, and precursor of the Surrealists, de Chirico was born in Volos, Greece, studied at the Academy of Fine Arts in Munich, and was initially influenced by Bocklin and Klinger. However he soon developed his own distinctive style, producing the first of his 'enigmatic' paintings in Italy around 1910. De Chirico's early works evoked an uneasy atmosphere through their use of strange perspectives, illogical shadows and open spaces, and he developed a theory of 'metaphysical insight' which located familiar objects in essentially mysterious relationships. In de Chirico's oeuvre a naturalistic vision always alternates, like waking and sleeping or dreaming, with another vision presenting abnormal forms and situations. If de Chirico's first period of Metaphysical paintingbetween 1910 and 1918 - remains his most celebrated, and has provided us with some of his most memorable images, it is also true that his later Metaphysical period was also a time of intense creativity and evocative art-making. But this period is his least well known. De Chirico moved on from his baroque and romantic paintings of the Forties and Fifties - works which diminished his standing among a number of art critics - to a 'new' Metaphysical period which related strongly to the rich, early phase of his work. This book is a celebration of that period in de Chirico's career, and evaluates not only his paintings, but also the mythic and symbolic sculptures produced at this time. De Chirico: The New Metaphysics is an essential resource for any reader interested in appreciating de Chirico's uniquecontribution to 20th century art.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=voBQAAAAMAAJ&dq=DE+CHIRICO:+The+Metaphysical+Period&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Hair : Its Power and Meaning in Asian Cultures","description":"An interdisciplinary exploration of the meanings of hair in Asia from classical times to contemporary contexts.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PRPymT12c40C&dq=Hair+:+Its+Power+and+Meaning+in+Asian+Cultures&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Build Your Own PC","description":"This updated edition of the Build Your Own Gaming PC Manual will help readers get the performance they want on a budget they can afford.

But within lay a root of darkness - inheritance, perhaps, of Viking ancestors. Twice, at least, in her lifetime the Viking streak broke through, in vengeance on a faithless lover, in fury wreaked on a rival of the marriage bed. The marriage, though fruitful of so many children, was on her side no match of love. But a passionate loyalty to her husband, an equally passionate ambition, together with her own sense of justice, gave her the will and the skill to dissemble her feelings and to make her the praise of Christendom. No Queen ever wielded so much power as she in the long years she ruled Normandy; before her no woman in England was ever crowned or was known as Queen.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=72o7AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Swallow Barn","description":"Originally published in 1832 and revised in 1851, Swallow Barn, John Pendleton Kennedy s novel of antebellum life on a tidewater Virginia plantation, was described by its author as  variously and interchangeably partaking of the complexion of a book of travels, a diary, a collection of letters, a drama, and a history.  Swallow Barn has returned from oblivion many times in the past 150 years, in part because it resists categorization and retains its originality. It is a novel that is not a novel, written by a man who was and was not a southerner or even, by his own reckoning, a writer. Swallow Barn began as a series of letters written by a Mark Littleton (Kennedy) to his hometown neighbor, Zachary Huddlestone of Preston Ridge, New York. Littleton, visiting his Virginia relatives at their farm called Swallow Barn, on the James River not far from Richmond, told his friend that he would write a  full, true and particular account of all my doings, or rather my seeings and thinkings  while he was among his genial relatives. But Kennedy soon dropped the pose of letter writer and devoted successive chapters to sketches of Virginia country life. In choosing to write about the  manners  of his own region, he won not only esteem as an American author but recognition for a way of life toward which an open hostility was developing in the North. Lucinda MacKethan s introduction to this edition considers biographical information and the cultural and literary forces that operated to make Swallow Barn a unique as well as a representative product of its period. MacKethan also discusses Kennedy s design for the novel, the ideological and artistic strategies that governed the choices and changes he made as he created what is now regarded as one of the most important fictional portrayals of plantation society by one intimately involved in that place and time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OXrBKpUAIT4C&dq=Swallow+Barn&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Nature's Medicines","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=oyoOxwEACAAJ&dq=Nature%27s+Medicines&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Walt Disney's Alice Favorites","description":"A collection of stories about the adventures of Alice in Wonderland and other Walt Disney characters.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Lia2swEACAAJ&dq=Walt+Disney%27s+Alice+Favorites&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Knives of the world","description":"Profusely illustrated, full-scale reference by a leading authority on edged weapons provides a clearly written historical analysis of the entire range of weapons used in hand-to-hand combat ? from prehistoric flint knives and bronze daggers of 1000 BC to eared daggers of the mid-16th century and 19th-century British and American naval dirks.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=7K4xAQAAIAAJ&dq=Knives+of+the+world&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Joe X: Rethinking Physical Fitness for Adults","description":"Theres a huge gap between what the fitness industry is selling and what the typical person in todays society needs. We know this to be true by the end resultsjust look around you! The book begins with a concise review of humanitys five thousand year quest for health, fitness, and longevity. With the benefit of this perspective, just what have been our true best practices? (Hint: proper breathing, form, range of motion, and appropriate muscle-mass are important; gallons of sweat are not). It ends by detailing an eminently practical and low-impact exercise routine for people of all ages and fitness levels. In between is an entertaining, often humorous, occasionally tragic fitness fable that readers will quickly identify with, particularly baby-boomers. Refreshingly absent are the mind numbing case histories, lame before-and-after photos, product line pitches, and self-promotion that fill so much of the genre. The dominant theme is that physical fitness is a mental challenge, not a physical challenge. It isnt a program or project, but an uplifting journey. The leveraging of the psychological aspects of life-long fitness is what especially sets Joe X apart from the rest of the field. The perfect antidote to hounding infomercials and celebrity hype, Joe X is a fast paced enjoyable read, packed with both timeless wisdom and poignant advice. Its content can be put to practice immediately. A well-crafted gem of a book, youll look forward to sharing with loved ones, friends, and colleagues.

It was the sixties, but you haven't read this story before. -- Comment on Amazon.com from a reader in Sioux Falls, South Dakota Hammond's book may be one of the quintessential freak histories. -- Michael Simmons, LA Weekly columnist It brought back memories I've never had! -- Gary Fulkerson, singer/songwriter When the counterculture was busy being born in Los Angeles and San Francisco in the mid-1960s, Hammond Guthrie found himself in the midst of hipster heaven, somewhere between late Beat and early Hippie. A budding painter and writer, he quickly made friends with many of the musicians, poets, performance artists and street people who were blazing trails into new lifestyles. Realizing that life was meant to be a total trip, a non-stop adventure, he left the West Coast with his wife for England and immersed himself in the alternative scene in London - the world of International Times, the UFO Club, Arts Lab, inner-city squats - with a writing gig at Time Out magazine. Moving on to Amsterdam, he befriended Provos and free-living bohemians, while building a promising career in the art world - the Stedelijk Museum even bought his paintings for their collection. But in the early 1970s the trip took a surreal turn. His wife started taking free love far too literally, and her amorous escapade with a drug dealer entangled them both in a nerve-racking intrigue in the twilight zone of Tangier. Hammond's Moroccan mission was to spring five Americans, including his wife's lover, from 60-year prison sentences for wholesale hashish smuggling. Here he tells it all in his playful style, with a keen eye for absurd detail and an unflagging sense of humor. Among the hundreds of famous and not-so-famous personalities he encountered along the way were the Buffalo Springfield, Del Close, Max Crosley, Richie Havens, Nico, Carmen McCrea, Allen Ginsberg, John \\"Hoppy\\" Hopkins, William Burroughs, Simon Vinkenoog, Kenneth Alsop, Pete Townshend, and Emmet Grogan. I laughed, I cried. It's a marvelous book written in intriguing conversational style, bringing back wonderful memories from a wonderful time. -- Herb Gold, Beat journalist AsEverWas captures the story of countless others who lived on the fringes during an era when the country was at an important crossroads. Anyone who was alive during these turbulent times and who gives a damn about just how we got here should read this book -- John Aiello, poet and journalist Helps you see, feel and understand the moods, people and places that shaped an extraordinary decade. For its style and its lessons, Hammond Guthrie's memoir is a rare and important achievement. -- Stew Albert, co-founder of the Yippies I'm blown away by the stories - [he] really [has] seen and done it all.

In this comprehensive account, Ellen Noonan examines the opera's long history of invention and reinvention as a barometer of twentieth-century American expectations about race, culture, and the struggle for equality. In its surprising endurance lies a myriad of local, national, and international stories. For black performers and commentators, Porgy and Bess was a nexus for debates about cultural representation and racial uplift. White producers, critics, and even audiences spun revealing racial narratives around the show, initially in an attempt to demonstrate its authenticity and later to keep it from becoming discredited or irrelevant. Expertly weaving together the wide-ranging debates over the original novel, Porgy, and its adaptations on stage and film with a history of its intimate ties to Charleston, The Strange Career of \\"Porgy and Bess\\" uncovers the complexities behind one of our nation's most long-lived cultural touchstones.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ghkbVSU-b68C&dq=Porgy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Classical Music CD Listener's Guide: The Best on CD","description":"A summary of each entry includes the CD's title, label, and catalog number, plus artists' biographies and insightful notes explaining highlights of each recording. 150 illustrations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uxxBNwAACAAJ&dq=Classical+Music+CD+Listener%27s+Guide:+The+Best+on+CD&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Movie Songs by Special Arrangement: Alto Saxophone","description":"Each collection contains 11 songs arranged for the instrumentalist wanting to play in a jazz style -- without the need to learn to improvise.

Hij schrijft in buitengewoon persoonlijke bewoordingen over de jaren waarin hij politiek werd gevormd en over de bepalende momenten in de eerste termijn van zijn historische presidentschap - een roerige periode vol dramatische veranderingen. Obama neemt de lezer aan de hand op een fascinerende reis, die voert van zijn eerste politieke aspiraties en de cruciale overwinning in de voorverkiezingen van Iowa - waarin de kracht van grassroots-activisme aan het licht kwam - tot de revolutionaire avond van 4 november 2008, toen hij werd gekozen tot 44ste president van de Verenigde Staten en daarmee de eerste Afro-Amerikaan werd die het hoogste ambt in het land zou bekleden. In zijn bespiegelingen over het presidentschap toont hij op een bijzondere en scherpzinnige wijze welke mogelijkheden en beperkingen presidenti?le macht met zich meebrengt, en daarnaast biedt hij ons een uniek inzicht in de dynamiek van de Amerikaanse partijpolitiek en de internationale diplomatie. Obama neemt de lezer mee tot in het Oval Office en de Situation Room van het Witte Huis, maar ook naar steden als Moskou, Ca?ro en Peking. We zijn getuige van zijn overwegingen bij het samenstellen van zijn kabinet, hoe hij worstelt met een mondiale financi?le crisis, Vladimir Poetin inschat, schijnbaar onoverbrugbare conflicten beteugelt om zijn wet op de gezondheidszorg te verwezenlijken, botst met zijn generaals over de te volgen strategie in Afghanistan, hervormingen op Wall Street doorvoert, doortastend optreedt na de ramp met de Deepwater Horizon en opdracht geeft tot Operatie Neptune's Spear, die leidt tot de dood van Osama bin Laden. Een beloofd land is een bijzonder intiem en persoonlijk boek - het verhaal over een man die historische beslissingen neemt, over het rotsvaste geloof van de opbouwwerker die op de proef wordt gesteld op het wereldpodium. Obama is openhartig over de moeilijkheden die hij ondervond toen hij als zwarte Amerikaan president wilde worden, waarbij hij de verwachtingen verpersoonlijkte van een generatie die werd ge?nspireerd door de boodschap van hoop en verandering en de morele problemen trotseerde die besluitvorming op het hoogste niveau met zich meebrengt. Obama is openhartig over de krachten die hem in eigen land en elders tegenwerkten, eerlijk over de invloed die het verblijf in het Witte Huis had op zijn vrouw en kinderen. Daarnaast is hij niet terughoudend in het delen van zijn onzekerheden en teleurstellingen. Toch wijkt hij nooit af van zijn overtuiging dat binnen het geweldige, zich voortdurend ontwikkelende Amerikaanse experiment vooruitgang altijd mogelijk is. Dit fraai geschreven en krachtige boek getuigt van Barack Obama's inzicht dat democratie geen geschenk van boven is, maar iets dat is gestoeld op inlevingsvermogen en wederzijds begrip, iets waaraan we samen voortbouwen, elke dag weer.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=V6L9DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Antimicrobial Drugs","description":"This reworking and expansion of Pratt's Chemotherapy of Infection has three new chapters.

David Hajdu's remarkable new book vividly opens up the lost world of comic books, its creativity, irreverence, and suspicion of authority. In the years between World War II and the emergence of television as a mass medium, American popular culture as we know it was first created in the pulpy, boldly illustrated pages of comic books. No sooner had this new culture emerged than it was beaten down by church groups, community bluestockings, and a McCarthyish Congress only to resurface with a crooked smile on its face in Mad magazine. When we picture the 1950s, we hear the sound of early rock and roll. The Ten-Cent Plague shows how -- years before music -- comics brought on a clash between children and their parents, between prewar and postwar standards. Created by outsiders from the tenements, garish, shameless, and often shocking, comics spoke to young people and provided the guardians of mainstream culture with a big target. Parents, teachers, and complicit kids burned comics in public bonfires. Cities passed laws to outlaw comics. Congress took action with televised hearings that nearly destroyed the careers of hundreds of artists and writers. The Ten-Cent Plague radically revises common notions of popular culture, the generation gap, and the divide between \\"high\\" and \\"low\\" art.

Saint Bernard of Clairvaux, a dominant figure in the history of the Catholic Church and the last of the Church Fathers, died in his monastery in Burgundy on August 20, 1153. In commemoration of the eighth centenary of his death, Pope Pius XII issued one of his most significant encyclical letters Doctor Mellifluus which Thomas Merton presents here, together with an introduction to the life and teachings of the great mystic. The essence of Saint Bernard s doctrine, Father Merton writes, is nothing else but the spiritual peace distilled in monasticism, and it is one of the purest and most authentic sources of Catholic tradition. Pius s encyclical letter draws on that doctrine to bring the highest spiritual perfection within reach of all Christians.

A multilevel secure database management system (MLS DBMS) is designed to store, retrieve and process information in compliance with certain mandatory security requirements, essential for protecting sensitive information from unauthorized access, modification and abuse. Such systems are characterized by data objects labeled at different security levels and accessed by users cleared to those levels. Unless transaction processing modules for these systems are designed carefully, they can be exploited to leak sensitive information to unauthorized users. In recent years, considerable research has been devoted to the area of multilevel secure transactions that has impacted the design and development of trusted MLS DBMS products. Multilevel Secure Transaction Processing presents the progress and achievements made in this area. The book covers state-of-the-art research in developing secure transaction processing for popular MLS DBMS architectures, such as kernelized, replicated, and distributed architectures, and advanced transaction models such as workflows, long duration and nested models. Further, it explores the technical challenges that require future attention. Multilevel Secure Transaction Processing is an excellent reference for researchers and developers in the area of multilevel secure database systems and may be used in advanced level courses in database security, information security, advanced database systems, and transaction processing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XPfpBwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MOUS PowerPoint 2000 Exam Prep","description":"Two-color illustrations and a unique hands-on tutorial approach with real-world exercises and projects is ideally suited to on-the-job training situations for learning MOUS PowerPoint 2000, the most popular training/assessment program used today.

But every puzzle can be solved if you approach it the right way. Paul Benware compares prophecy to a picture puzzle. Putting the edge pieces together first builds the 'framework' that makes it easier to fit the other pieces in their place. According to Benware, the framework for eschatology is the biblical covenants. He begins his comprehensive survey by explaining the major covenants. Then he discusses several different interpretations of end times prophecy.

Leading historian Michael F. Holt convincingly offers a disturbingly contemporary answer: partisan politics. In this brilliant and succinct book, Holt distills a lifetime of scholarship to demonstrate that secession and war did not arise from two irreconcilable economies any more than from moral objections to slavery. Short-sighted politicians were to blame. Rarely looking beyond the next election, the two dominant political parties used the emotionally charged and largely chimerical issue of slavery's extension westward to pursue reelection and settle political scores, all the while inexorably dragging the nation towards disunion. Despite the majority opinion (held in both the North and South) that slavery could never flourish in the areas that sparked the most contention from 1845 to 1861-the Mexican Cession, Oregon, and Kansas-politicians in Washington, especially members of Congress, realized the partisan value of the issue and acted on short-term political calculations with minimal regard for sectional comity. War was the result. Including select speeches by Lincoln and others, The Fate of Their Country openly challenges us to rethink a seminal moment in America's history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oX-veJcZvrEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Celebrated Jumping Frog and Other Stories","description":"A high-jumping frog named Daniel Webster ...

A major precept of Buddhists of all denominations is to practice harmlessness. Such activity is not supposed to be theory, but a practical fact, a sacred pledge (samaya) integrated into the fibre of one's every mode of conduct on the path to enlightenment and liberation from the samsara. However, as this text elaborates, all good intent along this line falls flat in the light of the practice condoned by many Buddhists of meat consumption. Harm is thus caused to the animal butchered, to the consumers of the flesh, and to the environment we all live in. It is also a decidedly gross act of adharma to all in the society wherein the Buddhist practitioner that consumes animal products resides, as clearly explained in this book. It is time that Buddhists whole-heartedly spurn all considerations of meat toxins in their bodily environments, to actively espouse the cause of true harmlessness in all that they do; and to act as Bodhisattvas by teaching all how to be compassionate through not killing or harming their animal brethren. The reasons are clear as to the way to be truly compassionate, as all Buddhists should be. Read, learn and observe your true motives in everything you do; desist from harmful actions, and thereby grow and become Bodhisattvas and Buddhas at the end of it all.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=sfAKAAAAYAAJ&dq=Ahimsa:+Buddhism+and+the+Vegetarian+Ideal&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Who's hiding here?","description":"A rhyming text explores animal camouflage, while die-cut pages reveal the animals hiding throughout the book.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=O7pxyZMnJQwC&dq=Who%27s+hiding+here%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Whatever Happened to Worship: A Call To True Worship","description":"A.W.

Like the early guides to the seashore by the Naturalist Philip Henry Gosse as much a part of the myth and history of the British coastline as fishermen's tales of mermaids and eerie monsters beneath the waves.

Wherever they settled, from the wide Missouri River to the white-foamed shores of the Pacific Ocean, they clung to the hope of a bright new beginning for their lives. Often their hopes were dashed by fierce opposition from the Indians who had inhabited the land long before them.

This study takes a look at some of the famous correspondence between the two statesmen who devoted their lives to a new chapter of freedom and self-government. Peterson draws an extended parallel between the backgrounds, experiences, personalities, and intellectual styles of Adams and Jefferson and examines their work in the achievement of independence and the design of new governments for Massachusetts and Virginia. While Adams and Jefferson had much in common, their ideas of human nature, history, society, and government included many differences that would reveal themselves in the course of time. Merrill D. Peterson looks at Adams and Jefferson s relationship across their lives, including their disputes in the midst of the coming French Revolution, their excitement for the establishment of a new American government under the Constitution, their contest for the presidency in 1796, and their eventual reconciliation.

Helen Hoover and her husband made it come true for themselves, and this is the richly told story of how they did it. As she demonstrated in The Gift of the Deer a book greatly loved and praised Mrs. Hoover has the gift of sharing with her readers her own profound feeling for the wilderness she has made her home and for the wild animals whom she makes her friends, without destroying the integrity of their wild lives. But she was not always so at ease with nature. And she tells here how she and her husband, leaving behind everything that was familiar to them, bridged the infinite distance in life-style from Chicago, where they had lived, to a cabin home on the fringe of Minnesota s northernmost wilderness. Neither of them had so much as a Cub Scout s experience of the woods, and their first year was punctuated with near-disasters. They quickly discovered that a long-time desire for the simple Thoreauvian life was not enough. The obstinance of inanimate objects the crumbling stone foundation, the leaky roof, the unruly double-bitted ax that must be mastered when you depend on a woodburning stove at thirty below was new to them. The changing seasons astonished the not only with surprising loveliness but with unexpected crises of survival. But they managed, despite their trials, to rebuild their primitive cabin. And, as they worked and learned, they built for themselves, little by little, a rewarding relationship not only with the sparsely settled community but with a marvelous succession of their closest neighbors: wild weasels and jays, squirrels and shy fishers, even bears in the basement. The reader experiences it all, the hardships and joys, the gradual feeling of becoming connected to earth and elements, of belonging. The is the special delight of Helen Hoover s warm, evocative, and sometimes extremely funny account of the way in which two city people made for themselves A Place in the Woods.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vQo5AAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Little Man's Family","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lVrXAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"MacAddict Guide to Living the iLife","description":"A guide to iLife provides information on such topics as iTunes, GarageBand, iPhoto, iMovie, iDVD, iChat AV, iCal, the address book, mail, Safari, Sherlock, Font Book, and Preview.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QolV2uSPV4UC&dq=MacAddict+Guide+to+Living+the+iLife&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Alfred Hitchcock (Radio Spirits and the Smithsonian)","description":"With her striking looks, the raven-haired, dark eyed Ruth Roman had an air of sophistication that made her seem sexy yet wholesome. She had to strive harder than most to establish herself as a leading actress in Hollywood during its glory years and finally broke through in 1949 with her role in Champion. As one of the last Warner Bros. contract players, she appeared in Alfred Hitchcock's classic Strangers on a Train. Seen at her best in strong parts, such as the ambitious Ronda Castle in Anthony Mann's The Far Country or as a modern-day Lady Macbeth, she enjoyed a varied career as a freelancer before re-inventing herself as a character actress of note on television. A remarkable return to the screen in the bizarre psycho-horror The Baby (1973) assured her of cult status. This is the first book dedicated to a committed but often undervalued actress who is fondly remembered by fans of classic film. More than a biography, it seeks to contextualize the actress within her own time, illuminate her Hollywood experience and celebrate her extensive career.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tTN3EAAAQBAJ&dq=Alfred+Hitchcock+(Radio+Spirits+and+the+Smithsonian)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Jimmy Stewart: Bomber Pilot","description":"Of all the celebrities who served their country during World War II -and they were legion -Jimmy Stewart was unique. On December 7th, when the attack on Pearl Harbor woke so many others to the reality of war, Stewart was already in uniform - as a private on guard duty south of San Francisco at the Army Air Corps Moffet Field. Seeing war on the horizon, Jimmy Stewart, at the height of his fame after Mr. Smith Goes to Washington and his Oscar-winning turn in The Phadelphia Story in 1940, had enlisted several months earlier. Jimmy Stewart, Bomber Pilot chronicles his long journey to become a bomber pilot in combat. Author Starr Smith, the intelligence officer assigned to the movie star, recounts how Stewart's first battles were with the Air Corps high command, who insisted on keeping the naturally talented pilot out of harm's way as an instructor pilot for B-17 Flying Fortresses and B-24 Liberators. By 1944, however, Stewart managed to get assigned to a Liberator squadron that was deploying to England to join the mighty Eighth Air Force. Once in the thick of it, he rose to command his own squadron and flew twenty combat missions, including one to Berlin.  My father would feel honored by this book.   Kelly Stewart Harcourt, daughter of Jimmy Stewart \\"We would have made Jimmy a group commander [equivalent to an army regiment] if the war had lasted another month.\\" - General Jimmy Doolittle. \\"An excellent biography of a distinguished airman and fine human being.\\" - Roger Freeman, author of The Mighty Eighth: A History of the U.S. 8th Air Force. \\"How wonderful it is that Starr Smith has finally directed a literary light on the personal history of Jimmy Stewart. . . . I welcomed Starr's book. It is needed and wanted. Bravo!\\" - Gay Talese. \\"This is a very well researched and written book. . . . It fills a place in history about no mere actor but a courageous and selfless man, Brigadier General Jimmy Stewart, USAF.\\" - General Michael E. Ryan, former Chief of Staff of the Air Force.  I have met a few movie stars, but of them all, I think that Jimmy Stewart was most like those modest heroes he portrayed. Now journalist Starr Smith has raised the curtain on Stewart s gallant service as a bomber pilot and air combat commander in World War II.

Green Darkness is the story of a great love, a love in which mysticism, suspense, and mystery form a web of good and evil forces that stretches from Tudor England to the England of the twentieth century. The marriage of the Englishman Richard Marsdon and his young American wife, Celia, slowly turns tragic as Richard withdraws into himself and Celia suffers a debilitating emotional breakdown. A wise mystic realizes that Celia can escape her past only by reliving it. She journeys back four hundred years to her former life as the servant girl Celia de Bohun during the reign of Edward VI and to her doomed love affair with the chaplain Stephen Marsdon. Although Celia and Stephen can't escape the horrifying consequences of their love, fate (and time) offer them another chance for redemption.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=gZLTAAAAQBAJ&dq=Green+Darkness&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Artificial Intelligence and Scientific Method","description":"Artificial Intelligence and Scientific Method examines the remarkable advances made in the field of AI over the past twenty years, discussing their profound implications for philosophy.

It was the beginning of an astounding 64,000-mile voyage that was to take the ship around the world, leaving a trail of destruction and devastation in her wake. For this was no ordinary freighter this was the Wolf, a disguised German warship. In this gripping account of an audacious and lethal World War I expedition, Richard Guilliatt and Peter Hohnen depict the Wolf  s assignment: to terrorize distant ports of the British Empire by laying minefields and sinking freighters, thus hastening Germany s goal of starving her enemy into submission. Yet to maintain secrecy, she could never pull into port or use her radio, and to comply with the rules of sea warfare, her captain fastidiously tried to avoid killing civilians aboard the merchant ships he attacked, taking their crews and passengers prisoner before sinking the vessels. The Wolf thus became a huge floating prison, with more than 400 captives, including a number of women and children, from twenty-five different nations. Sexual affairs were kindled between the German crew and some female prisoners. A six-year-old American girl, captured while sailing across the Pacific with her parents, was adopted as a mascot by the Germans. Forced to survive on food and fuel plundered from other ships, facing death from scurvy, and hunted by the combined navies of five Allied nations, the Germans and their prisoners came to share a common bond. The will to survive transcended enmities of race, class, and nationality. It was to be one of the most daring clandestine naval missions of modern times. Under the command of Captain Karl Nerger, who conducted his deadly business with an admirable sense of chivalry, the Wolf traversed three of the world s major oceans and destroyed more than thirty Allied vessels. We learn of the world through which the Wolf moved, with all its social divisions and xenophobia, its bravery and stoicism, its combination of old-world social mores and rapid technological change. The story of this epic voyage is a vivid real-life narrative and simultaneously a richly detailed picture of a world being profoundly transformed by war.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=bKV4y584Rb0C&dq=The+wolf&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hymns Of Orpheus","description":"The present volume is a verbatim reproduction of Thomas Taylor's 2nd Edition of his Hymns of Orpheus. This 2nd edition (1824) represents Taylor's effort to significantly emend, alter and add to his 1st edition (1787). However, the former, superseded edition has been recirculated both online and in print in previous years, clearly in ignorance that a 2nd edition exists-an edition which in many ways renders the first obsolete. 37 years of study and translation work occurred between Taylor's 1st and 2nd editions, during which time he translated the complete works of Plato, the complete works of Aristotle, much of the work of Proclus, Iamblicus and others of the later Platonists, along with several other works of Greek philosophy. Thus the difference between the 1st and 2nd editions of this text is the difference between the work of a young, eager and gifted, but relatively new philosopher on the one hand, and the work of one of, if not the most knowledgeable English Platonists ever to have lived. For this reason alone, it is rather worthless to continue printing and circulating the 1787 edition; all such editions ought to be left to expire in favour of Taylor's own extensively revised 2nd Edition. Indeed, we can be confident in suggesting that Taylor would not have committed the time and energy required to produce his 2nd edition had he not himself recognized the need for significantly revising his first effort (a facsimile reprint would otherwise have sufficed). There are several changes between the 1st and 2nd editions: the numbering of the hymns, the introduction, notes, and significant changes to the translation itself. In the present volume, the formatting of the original has been changed in order to render the text more easily readable. The copious footnotes found in the original have been collected and placed in order at the end of the Hymns, allowing for a more easily readable layout for each individual hymn. In the margins we have added the pagination of the original edition, so that all references made to the original over the intervening centuries may be easily traced in the present volume, despite its altered pagination. Besides these changes, and minor changes in formatting style, the text has not been altered, except in cases where certain Greek characters were in need of modernization. \\"The Grecian theology, which originated from Orpheus, was not only promulgated by him, but also by Pythagoras and Plato; who, for their transcendent genius, will always be ranked by the intelligent among the prodigies of the human race. By the first of these illustrious men, however, it was promulgated mystically and symbolically; by the second, enigmatically, and through images; and scientifically by the third. That this theology, indeed, was derived from Orpheus is clearly testified by those two great philosophic luminaries Iamblichus and Proclus. From this golden chain of philosophers, as they have been justly called, my elucidations of the present mystic hymns are principally derived: for I know of no other genuine sources, if it be admitted (and it must by every intelligent reader), that the theology of Orpheus is the same as that of Pythagoras and Plato.\\"-Thomas Taylor","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=lBSMswEACAAJ&dq=The+Hymns+Of+Orpheus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life is a Road, the Soul is a Motorcycle","description":"\\"I was on a lonely stretch of road.

Following the destruction of the RAF fighter forces, the sweeping of the Channel of mines, and the wearing down of the Royal Naval defenders, two German army groups were set to storm the beaches of southern England. Despite near-constant British fears from August to October, the invasion never took place after first being postponed to spring 1941 before finally being abandoned entirely. Robert Forcyzk, author of Where the Iron Crosses Grow, looks beyond the traditional British account of Operation Sea Lion, complete with plucky Home Guards and courageous Spitfire pilots, at the real scale of German ambition, plans and capabilities. He examines, in depth, how Operation Sea Lion fitted in with German air-sea actions around the British Isles as he shows exactly what stopped Hitler from invading Britain.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LwGGDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Microsoft Management Console Design and Development Kit","description":"Until now, PC managers and network administrators had to rely on a hodgepodge of incompatible, inconsistent tools to manage PCs.

Drawing on things he's learned from the many buildings he himself designed (and in some cases built with his own hands), Edward Allen explains complex phenomena such as the role of the sun in heating buildings and the range of structural devices that are used for support, from trusses and bearing walls to post-tensioned concrete beams and corbeled vaults. He stresses the importance of intelligent design in dealing with such problems as overheating and overcooling, excessive energy use, leaky roofs and windows, fire safety, and noisy interiors. He serves up some surprises: thermal insulation is generally a better investment than solar collectors; board fences are not effective noise barriers; there's one type of window that can be left open during a rainstorm. The new edition emphasizes \\"green\\" architecture and eco-conscious design and construction. It features a prologue on sustainable construction, and includes new information on topics such as the collapse of the World Trade Center, sick building syndrome, and EIFS failures and how they could have been prevented. Allen also highlights the array of amazing new building materials now available, such as self-cleaning glass, photovoltaics, transparent ceramics, cloud gel, and super-high-strength concrete and structural fibers. Edward Allen makes it easy for everyone--from armchair architects and sidewalk superintendents to students of architecture and construction--to understand the mysteries and complexities of even the largest building, from how it recycles waste and controls the movement of air, to how it is kept alive and growing.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ab3Q2hR7xfkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Black in white America","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6afkcQAACAAJ&dq=Black+in+white+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A New Metrical Psalter","description":"Psalm paraphrases in verse form with suggested familiar tunes for singing in Short Meter, Common Meter and Long Meter for the appointed psalms for the Book of Common Prayer lectionary.

Complete with commentaries by experts in the field, Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis, and the New Biology of Mind reflects the author's evolving view of how biology has revolutionized psychiatry and psychology and how potentially could alter modern psychoanalytic thought. The author's unique perspective on both psychoanalysis and biological research has led to breakthroughs in our thinking about neurobiology, psychiatry, and psychoanalysis -- all driven by the central idea that a fuller understanding of the biological processes of learning and memory can illuminate our understanding of behavior and its disorders. These wonderful essays cover the mechanisms of psychotherapy and medications, showing that both work at the same level of neural circuits and synapses, and the implications of neurobiological research for psychotherapy; the ability to detect functional changes in the brain after psychotherapy, which enables us, for the first time, to objectively evaluate the effects of psychotherapy on individual patients; the need for animal models of mental disorders; for example, learned fear, to show how molecules and cellular mechanisms for learning and memory can be combined in various ways to produce a range of adaptive and maladaptive behaviors; the unification of behavioral psychology, cognitive psychology, neuroscience, and molecular biology into the new science of the mind, charted in two seminal reports on neurobiology and molecular biology given in 1983 and 2000; the critical role of synapses and synaptic strength in both short- and long-term learning; the biological and social implications of the mapping of the human genome for medicine in general and for psychiatry and mental health in particular; The author concludes by calling for a revolution in psychiatry, one that can use the power of biology and cognitive psychology to treat the many mentally ill persons who do not benefit from drug therapy. Fascinating reading for psychiatrists, psychoanalysts, social workers, residents in psychiatry, and trainees in psychoanalysis, Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis, and the New Biology of Mind records with elegant precision the monumental changes taking place in psychiatric thinking. It is an invaluable reference work and a treasured resource for thinking about the future.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KCkkoXVyKQcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Director 6 Bible","description":"Shows how to create interactive media applications, animation, Web pages, and games, and introduces Director's scripting language, Master Lingo","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qTGEQgAACAAJ&dq=Director+6+Bible&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tottel's Miscellany (1557-1587)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=56N257Qt71MC&dq=Tottel%27s+Miscellany+(1557-1587)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Christianity in a Revolutionary Age.

Torvald's perception of Nora is of a silly, naive spendthrift, so it is only when the truth begins to emerge, and Torvald appreciates the initiative behind his wife, that unmendable cracks appear in their marriage.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=vb9LAQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Doll%27s+House&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Fauquier County (Virginia publick claims)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FdbGPAAACAAJ&dq=Fauquier+County+(Virginia+publick+claims)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Random House Dinosaur Travel Guide","description":"From world-renowned paleontological museum collections to theme parks to roadside attractions, a state-by-state guidebook to all things dinosaur lists over three hundred locations in the U.S. and Canada where visitors can learn about these crazy critters.

Offering a gritty and engaging view of daily life in Richmond, Shirley Ann Wilson Moore examines the process and effect of migration, the rise of a black urban industrial workforce, and the dynamics of community development. She describes the culture that migrants brought with them including music, food, religion, and sports and shows how these traditions were adapted to new circumstances. Working-class African Americans in Richmond used their cultural venues especially the city's legendary blues clubs as staging grounds from which to challenge the racial status quo, with a steadfast determination not to be \\"Jim Crowed\\" in the Golden State. As this important work shows, working-class African Americans often stood at the forefront of the struggle for equality and were linked to larger political, social, and cultural currents that transformed the nation in the postwar period.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TPLkDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"New York Run (Endworld)","description":"The Alpha Triad warriors undertake a mission into the zombie-ridden nightmare of New York City in order to recover the Genesis seeds, a pre-World War III scientific creation that may provide food for the ravaged survivors of nuclear destruction","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=kAZYAAAACAAJ&dq=New+York+Run+(Endworld)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Windows 2000 Pro: The Missing Manual","description":"Windows 2000 Pro combines the friendly interface of Windows 98 with the famous stability of Windows NT.

It also argues that the enormous challenge of restructuring large industrial enterprises or reabsorbing their workers, while appropriately based on market signals, cannot be accomplished by the market alone. Some type of planning will eventually be required. Ideally, such planning should receive high priority from the outset with clear recognition that durable macroeconomic stabilization will be very difficult to achieve in a democratic political system until the large state enterprises have been successfully transformed or their workers reabsorbed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UlkYEAAAQBAJ&dq=Establishing+incentive+structures+and+planning+agencies+that+support+market-oriented+transformations+(IMF+working+paper)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Individualism, old and new","description":"America's most renowned social philosopher John Dewey shines his powerful intellect on the serious public and cultural issues surrounding the place of the individual in a technologically advanced society. In this penetrating study, he addresses the fear that personal creative potential will be trampled by assembly-line monotony, political bureaucracy, and an industrialized culture of uniformity. Armed with his pragmatic approach and his belief in the power of critical intelligence, Dewey argues that individualism has in fact been offered a uniquely higher plane of technological development upon which to grow, mature, and redefine itself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ichHAAAAYAAJ&dq=Individualism,+old+and+new&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Americans and Their Weather","description":"This revealing book synthesizes research from many fields to offer the first complete history of the roles played by weather and climate in American life from colonial times to the present. Author William B. Meyer characterizes weather events as neutral phenomena that are inherently neither hazards nor resources, but can become either depending on the activities with which they interact. Meyer documents the ways in which different kinds of weather throughout history have represented hazards and resources not only for such exposed outdoor pursuits as agriculture, warfare, transportation, construction, and recreation, but for other realms of life ranging from manufacturing to migration to human health. He points out that while the weather and climate by themselves have never determined the course of human events, their significance as been continuously altered for better and for worse by the evolution of American life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fTskDwAAQBAJ&dq=Americans+and+Their+Weather&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Discourse in commemoration of the glorious reformation of the sixteenth century: Delivered before the Evangelical Lutheran synod of West Pennsylvania,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=q5ZdAAAAcAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"With A Single Spell","description":"A SINGLE SPELL Tobas had been lucky to find a wizard to take him on as apprentice.

In October of 1943, Schatz discovered streptomycin. But his professor, Selman Waksman, took the credit, relegating Schatz to the footnotes of history. Over fifty years later, German-born Inge Auerbacher read an article that named Schatz as co-discoverer of the drug. As a young Jewish girl during World War II, Auerbacher was a prisoner at Terezin concentration camp in Czechoslovakia. She was diagnosed with tuberculosis during her imprisonment and was able to receive the life-saving streptomycin after her immigration to America. Auerbacher contacted Schatz in 1997, compelled to offer him gratitude for the scientific research that saved her life. She learned of the controversy surrounding the discovery of streptomycin and Schatz's ultimate recognition for his work. As a result of their friendship, they decided to co-author this book. Finding Dr. Schatz is their powerful true story-told in their own words-of a scientist who changed the world and a woman who lived because of it.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=rLW2zLOrLl4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Let Me Hear Your Voice: A Family Battle to Rescue Two Children from Autism","description":"She was a beautiful doelike child, with an intense, graceful fragility.

Fifty centuries ago Krishna descended from the transcendental world to show us His eternal spiritual activities. His acts reveal the fullest concept of God and attract us to join Him again. They are tangible subjects upon which to meditate. Sri Krishna's life is fascinating and highly entertaining-even children love the stories. His life is full of deep philosophical wisdom and spiritual insight, and is a window into the personality, thoughts, and feelings of God.

Dr Harris's work fills this important need, and indeed her book provides one of the best and most thorough studies available in English of the syntax of a non-Indo-European language. Working in the framework of relational grammar - a framework that is attracting great interest - Dr Harris shows that Georgian does have constructions found in better-known languages, and the study of individual languages to the development of linguistic theory.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=sHCTPwAACAAJ&dq=Georgian+Syntax:+A+Study+in+Relational+Grammar+(Cambridge+Studies+in+Linguistics)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Valentine for Mr. Wonderful","description":"1996 An intimate collection of hand-printed love-themed intaglios, with William Carlos Williams' poem St. Valentine.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=oXVyAQAACAAJ&dq=Valentine+for+Mr.+Wonderful&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Poor Mrs. Rigsby","description":"Ninety-year-old Elsie Rigsby needs to trust someone with a destructive secret.

From late 1920s silent features to the psychedelic experiments of the 1960s and beyond, the book describes how inventors battled to provide film and television studios with practical zoom lenses, and how cinematographers clashed over the right ways to use the new zooms. Hall demonstrates how the zoom brought life and energy to cinema decades before the zoom boom of the 1970s and reveals how the zoom continues to play a vital and often overlooked role in the production of contemporary film and television.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FchVDwAAQBAJ&dq=Zoom!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Install, Configure, and Customize Red Hat Linux","description":"Showcases the operating system's newest features, while explaining how to manage compatibility issues, partition drives for multiple operating systems, configure the PPP Dialer, and set up network connections.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=39XCrDg2y4UC&dq=Install,+Configure,+and+Customize+Red+Hat+Linux&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Comfort Food: Rachael Ray Top 30 30-Minute Meals","description":"Presents a compilation of the author's 30 best recipes for comfort food, including Italian-style mac 'n cheese, 30-minute shepherd's pie, and ziti with sausage and beans.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=dR6TAAAACAAJ&dq=Comfort+Food:+Rachael+Ray+Top+30+30-Minute+Meals&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pilote de guerre (Collection Folio)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=JTx0ngEACAAJ&dq=Pilote+de+guerre+(Collection+Folio)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Excel 2000 Answers!","description":"Gary Paulsen's slapstick tales capture the \\"wonderful madness\\" of growing up in a small town in northern Minnesota, when high spirits, showing off for girls, and general idiocy led Gary and his pals to attempt some amazing stunts, including: * Shooting a waterfall in a barrel* Breaking the world speed record on skis * Hang gliding with an army surplus target kite * Inventing the skateboard* Jumping a bike through a hoop of fire* Wrestling--with a bear?Wacky, daring, just plain nuts--extreme sports lead to extreme fun in new stories from Gary's boyhood.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=I_j_spIq7m8C&dq=Excel+2000+Answers!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Psychology of Winning: The Ten Qualities of a Total Winner","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1IZEAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Psychology+of+Winning:+The+Ten+Qualities+of+a+Total+Winner&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Window on the Deep: The Adventures of Underwater Explorer Sylvia Earle (New England Aquarium Books)","description":"Describes the underwater exploration of Sylvia Earle, the woman who has set many of the current diving records.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OLpWNwAACAAJ&dq=Window+on+the+Deep:+The+Adventures+of+Underwater+Explorer+Sylvia+Earle+(New+England+Aquarium+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Piano For Dummies (For Dummies (Computer/Tech))","description":"The easy way to get keyed up on the keyboard Where Piano For Dummies helps budding musicians to master the black-and-white musical keyboard, Keyboard For Dummies helps them understand the possibilities that unfold when those black-and-whites are connected to state-of-the-art music technology.

The Black Aces. Their courage, ferocity, and instincts made them legendary in military aviation. Flying F-14 Tomcats, they played as much a part in recent US operations in Kosovo as did any air squadron in the theater, air force or navy, and probably more. Because of its superior performance, sophisticated equipment and the two-man crews who took it upon themselves to do something extra, the Tomcat and its aviators distinguished themselves over and over. Forced to locate Serb fighters operating covertly in a mountainous land much like Afghanistan, with almost no help from ground spotters, VF-14 pilots and backseaters spearheaded new methods for the navy to pinpoint, identify, and destroy enemy troops and weapons. These were tasks that fighter crews had seldom had to do before. The Aces had to break rules and frequently go in harms way in order to be successful. And they performed so well that for the first time in aviation history, a fighter squadron - theirs - was awarded The Wade McClusky Trophy, the navy's premier bombing honor. The award, named for a World War II dive bomber pilot and post-WorldWar II admiral, had been won previously only by bombing squadrons. Robert Wilcox spent two weeks with The Black Aces aboard the aircraft carrier USS Roosevelt and here provides a long-awaited, never-before-seen glimpse into the world of a modern navy fighter squadron. Wilcox takes readers into the cockpits as the pilots go out and attack targets while avoiding anti-aircraft weaponry. He takes us into the war room as they plan their strikes and into their cabins as they contemplate the danger they are facing. And the reader can't help but worry for these men as they head off into battle, can't help sitting on the edge of the seat as they try to land at night, in a rainstorm, with waves crashing against the ship, and can't help ducking with them as they dodge missile attacks. And in the end, it is impossible not to feel for these aviators as they question their own courage, or to cheer for them when they finally return safely. Black Aces High is a story of fear and courage, mishap and success, fighting spirit and military innovation. It's a human story that goes behind the smiling, sunglass-wearing facade of aviators flashing a \\"V\\", the sterile, slow motion target video that has become a staple of Pentagon briefings, and the rock 'n' roll cowboy image of fighter crews seen in the movies. Instead, it is a story that shows who these aviators really are and what they do beyond what we know, a story which probably will be repeated again and again as our carriers continue to be deployed in the new, 21 century war our nation is fighting.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=supDKFqHKl4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What Happened to Heather Hopkowitz?","description":"When the parents of fourteen-year-old Heather go on a month-long cruise, she goes to stay with Orthodox family friends and decides to change her life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=WVWyAAAACAAJ&dq=What+Happened+to+Heather+Hopkowitz%3F&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mantled with Authority: God's Apostolic Mandate to Women","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=45JKAAAACAAJ&dq=Mantled+with+Authority:+God%27s+Apostolic+Mandate+to+Women&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Getting Started with WAP and WML","description":"An introduction to Wireless Application Protocol and Wireless Markup Language explains how to create content for wireless devices.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=9QJrQgAACAAJ&dq=Getting+Started+with+WAP+and+WML&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Complete Encyclopedia of Locomotives","description":"Just like today, with high-specification computers being used to design even higher specification models for the next generation, the making of machines to make machines was one of the most important aspects of the Industrial Revolution.

The different contributors examine in some manner the relationship between religion and the ideas and institutions that have given shape to Cambodia as a social and political body, or nation. Although they do not share the same approach to the idea of \\"nation,\\" all are concerned with the processes of religion that give meaning to social interaction, which in some way includes \\"Cambodian\\" identity. Chapters touch on such far-reaching theoretical issues as the relation to religion of Southeast Asian polity; the nature of colonial religious transformation; \\"syncretism\\" in Southeast Asian Buddhism; the relation of religious icon to national identity, religion, and gender; transnationalism and social movements; and identity among diaspora communities. While much has been published on Cambodia's recent civil war and the Pol Pot period and its aftermath, few English language works are available on Cambodian religion. This book takes a major step in filling that gap, offering a broad overview of the subject that is relevant not only for the field of Cambodian studies, but also for students and scholars of Southeast Asian history, Buddhism, comparative religion, and anthropology.

She sets up startling juxtapositions (Lazarus among video paraphernalia; Virginia Woolf and Thucydides discussing war). And, in a final prose poem, she meditates on the recent death of her mother. With its quiet, acute spirituality, its fearless wit and sensuality, and its joyful understanding that 'the fact of the matter for humans is imperfection', Men in the Off Hours is profound, provocative and unforgettable.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=zKO1wAdOpu4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SuSE Linux Unleashed","description":"Covers installation of SuSE Linux 6.2, system management, configuration, network security, Internet connections, backup, file storage, managing peripherals, and Linux productivity clients","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-iFwGYhUtrwC&dq=SuSE+Linux+Unleashed&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Liturgical Environment: What the Documents Say","description":"Thousands of readers have found Fr.

Rooted in the norm of active participation as the guiding principle for all liturgical celebration, each chapter considers the ecclesial documents that pertain to the particular objects under discussion, the theology found in the documents, and the praxis that flows from the theology. Now in its third edition, The Liturgical Environment has proven to be an essential resource for all those involved in planning, building, renovating, decorating, and worshiping in a sacred environment. This new edition is significantly expanded and revised to take into account important material from the Third Edition of the Roman Missal, the new General Instruction of the Roman Missal, Pope Benedict s apostolic exhortation Sacramentum Caritatis, and the Vatican s Instruction on the Eucharist, Redemptionis Sacramentum. Additional material has been added on celebrating the parish feast day, principles involved in decorating, and fakery in the liturgical environment. New information on the font and various baptismal scenarios for the Easter Vigil is also included. Three new chapters focus on celebrating marriages, funerals, and anointing the sick; on the concept of progressive solemnity in the liturgy; and on liturgical furniture for conference use when Mass is not celebrated in a church.

It questions two events held sacred by the left wing - the French Revolution of 1789 and the Russian Revolution of 1917 - that had resulted, he believed, in terrorism as a political instrument. In this towering intellectual document, Camus argues that hope for the future lies in revolt, which unlike revolution is a spontaneous response to injustice and a chance to achieve change without giving up collective and intellectual freedom.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=MaToAQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Naked Soul of Iceberg Slim","description":"In  The Naked Soul of Iceberg Slim,  the fierce and lyrical icon for criminal reformation describes himself as  ill from America s fake fa?ade of justice and democracy.  For Iceberg, the illness may have been a detriment, but for us, it s a gift. His tales serve as a chilling reminder that we are all still inmates of one prison or another, and the time to break free has arrived. Iceberg Slim took the public into the raw, unseen, predatory reality of America with  Pimp . This time around, he puts the emphasis on reality with his collection of personal essays. This is Iceberg, in California, broken down into a million pieces of anger, wisdom, but ready for a shift in his own consciousness. From the corrupt LAPD to a broken heart, Iceberg recounts woes that the average Joe can t even fathom. Iceberg Slim takes us for a ride; this time not only through the harrowing world of a pimp, but through his brain, his soul, and his psyche. The racist, gut-wrenching universe Iceberg Slim inhabits throughout this novel and his struggle to endure is one that will be appreciated by all. The story s arch of chaos to cleansing is startlingly honest. After all, one can t help but root for the man who had the courage to rupture the bars of the cell society created for him and the man who gave a voice to those too afraid to speak. In  The Naked Soul of Iceberg Slim  his voice reigns loud and clear, and ready for vengeance.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=AzM3cJiJf1sC&dq=Naked+Soul+of+Iceberg+Slim&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History as Mystery","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2Hu9zgEACAAJ&dq=History+as+Mystery&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Curacin cuntica (Spanish Edition)","description":"El Oriente se une al Occidente cuando el Dr. Sha, destacado sanador y autor de # bestseller del New York Times, ense?a a los lectores una nueva y radical forma de sanar mediante la meditaci n y la comunicaci n con el alma.

What is the use of putting legs on a woman's body when she is not permitted to take a step with her own desire? What is the use of putting eyes on her body when your society keeps a Burka on that? What is the use of a heart when her feelings and emotions are suppressed in molesting her making the wrinkles on bed sheets during intercourse? What is the use of a brain when society does not permit her to have her own reasoning? What is the use of tongue, as speaking truth is the biggest crime in Islam? *****If Allaha does not reside in human beings then where does he lives. Who is he and where is that supreme power Allaha.

He offers a wealth of information and practical tips, incorporating the wisdom of experts, studies about parental development, and his own extensive interviews with hundreds of fathers. Because fatherhood is a progression, the chapters are organized chronologically and describe a father's physical and emotional growth, how he influences a child at every age, and how a child impacts a father's evolution in turn. Brott covers everything from such general issues as how to juggle work and family roles, how to affect the kind of person your child becomes, and when to encourage his individuality and independence to such specific topics as how to get to know your baby, what to do if your teen uses drugs, and how to cope when adult children return home. Illustrated throughout with New Yorker style cartoons that underscore the universality of the joys and woes of parenting, Father for Life is brimming with insights and advice, and is an indispensable, lifelong guide not only for every dad, but for every mom and child as well.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=L-VOEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"IN HIS IMAGE The Cloning of a Man","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=W9YfAQAAIAAJ&dq=IN+HIS+IMAGE+The+Cloning+of+a+Man&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Power of Followership, The","description":"A look at the cult of leadership argues that followers are more important than leaders, offers advice on how readers can learn to cultivate follower part inside them, and draws lessons from cultures such as Germany and Japan. 25,000 first printing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=S6MnAQAAIAAJ&dq=Power+of+Followership,+The&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Essential Excel 2000 Book","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ELm4jwEACAAJ&dq=Essential+Excel+2000+Book&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gothic politics in the Deep South;: Stars of the new Confederacy","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=1GaOAAAAIAAJ&dq=Gothic+politics+in+the+Deep+South%3B:+Stars+of+the+new+Confederacy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Murder at a Time: The Casebook of Lindsey & Plum","description":"Is it really over?

Her relentless honesty, along with her encouraging voice, is one reason so many contemporary Buddhist teachers recall Upasika Kee so fondly, and so often. With this book, readers seeking something reminiscent of the classic Mindfulness in Plain English can receive instruction on meditation practice as they become acquainted with the legacy of a renowned Buddhist figure. Pure and Simple, the first widely-available collection of her writings, will be gratefully received not only by those who knew Upasika Kee, but by anyone who encounters her for the first time in its pages.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EjY6AwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Creating Compositions","description":"In a traditional deployment model, software is installed on a physical server, and it is configured for the particular data center environment.

Robert E. Lee s Traveller eventually became more familiar but he was mostly famous for his looks. Not so with the little sorrel. Early in the war he became known as a horse of great personality and charm, an eccentric animal with an intriguing background. Like Traveller, his enduring fame was due initially to the prominence of his owner and the uncanny similarities between the two of them. The little red horse long survived Jackson and developed a following of his own. In fact, he lived longer than almost all horses who survived the Civil War as well as many thousands of human veterans. His death in 1886 drew attention worthy of a deceased general, his mounted remains have been admired by hundreds of thousands of people since 1887, and the final burial of his bones (after a cross-country, multi-century odyssey) in 1997 was the occasion for an event that could only be described as a funeral, and a well-attended one at that. Stonewall Jackson s Little Sorrel is the story of that horse.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=i57RDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chesterfield County (Virginia publick claims)","description":"Examining the role of violence in America's past, this collection of essays explores its history and development from slave patrols in the colonial South to gun ownership in the 20th century.

Hallett provides the first thorough, systematic exposition and defense of proportionalism in Christian ethics. Prominent in both philosophical and theological ethics, proportionalism judges the morality of acts by their proportion of good and evil.

The author assesses the norm's moral and theological validity in and of itself; in dialogue with the encyclical Veritatis Splendor; and in comparison with various rival viewpoints, stressing natural law, divine commands, respect for persons, inviolable goods, proportionate ends, irreducible rights, and agent-centered ethics. He appraises the norm's overall significance, showing its rootedness in Christian tradition, its inclusiveness and amplitude, and its relevance to those seeking a foundation for Christian ethical thought and moral activity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YRDmsA_90-MC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Spirituality for Lent and Easter: A Guide for Bridging the Mysteries","description":"Challenges readers to explore, share, and celebrate the themes/mysteries of the Sunday Lent and Easter readings.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8556SNy-KL4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Grace Notes: Poems","description":"\\"New Hampshire, A Poem; with Notes and Grace Notes\\" is a collection of poems featuring adventures, encounters, and places.

After the ideals of the Revolution are betrayed, Carmen takes up arms for Texas? independence from Mexico. Although born of an aristocratic Spaniard and an Indian woman, Carmen is raised to be proud and fearless and unfettered by any limitations that her sex and mixed heritage might impose. An ardent supporter of the Spanish crown, she witnesses the injustices that Indians, Mestizos and other people of color endure, first at the hands of the colonial Spanish government, then at the hands of the white power brokers that control the newly-independent Mexico. Persecuted and hunted by the authorities for her political activities, she flees disguised as a frontiersman north to Texas with Coalter Owens, a young North American committed to the independence movement. In a carefully laid-out progression of events, this epic story leads the reader through the attempt to establish a Texas kingdom, the early colonization of Texas by Anglo settlers, and the mounting hostilities that end in the conflagration at the Alamo. Throughout, such historical figures as Miguel Hidalgo, Stephen F. Austin, Jim Bowie, Sam Houston, Santa Anna and David Crockett are brought to life to interact with the fictional characters and reveal the true motivations behind the historical movements encompassed by the novel.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=L8ltkUQ4eygC&dq=Call+No+Man+Master&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Determination of crystal structures (The crystalline state)","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bUBRAAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Test Yourself MCSE Windows 2000 Network Administration (Exam 70-216)","description":"This practice exam provides broad exposure to Exam 70-216-style questions and objectives to build knowledge and testing confidence.

Now Carroll once again conjures the unforgettable castle by the sea--a place where love is as mysterious and invincible as the family legacy. . . . Valentine St. Leger is a healer with a wounded heart. Born with the amazing gift to eliminate the suffering of others by taking their pain into his own body, Val's gentle hands cannot change a tormenting truth: he will never marry. According to history, should he defy his destiny and wed, his unfortunate bride would be doomed to an early death. Though he aches for the one woman who knows all his secrets, he cannot return her passion. Until a night of magic transforms Val into a different man, a man with desires he can no longer resist. Kate Fitzleger has loved Val almost her entire life and is not about to let a foolish superstition ruin her chance for happiness. Venturing into a forbidden room of the St. Leger castle to steal an ancient book of sorcery, she desperately hopes to find a powerful love potion. On All Hallow's Eve, when the spirits of good and evil mingle upon the earth, Kate tempts fate with an unholy spell that goes awry. When Val awakens, he has no memory of the bizarre events that have changed him--the visit from an old enemy or the return of a lost heirloom that has altered his soul. All he knows is that life is for the living . . . and his fair Kate is ripe for seduction. He will tempt heaven and hell to have her--even if it means he could lose her forever. Brimming with enchanting characters and stunning atmosphere, Valentine's Bride is a romantic masterpiece that will hold your imagination captive and provide a glimpse of a timeless world found only in dreams or the most treasured love stories.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uNkx2Dmdh1AC&dq=Midnight+Bride&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Staying Wealthy: Strategies for Protecting Your Assets","description":"This is the most accessible consumer book ever to address the question, \\"How can I enjoy and pass to my heirs more of what I'm working a lifetime to accumulate?\\" Breuel's three decades of experience in giving people more control over their wealth is evident in the power and simplicity of his advice.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=iMjmwAEACAAJ&dq=Staying+Wealthy:+Strategies+for+Protecting+Your+Assets&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Big game and big game rifles","description":"This classic includes the following chapters: I.

Southern California's Spanish Revival monuments are pictured here-such as Hearst Castle at San Simeon, the Adamson House in Malibu, Casa del Herrero in Montecito. You will enjoy Rancho Revival landmarks like the Lummis House on Pasadena's arroyo, and Will Rogers' ranch near Pacific Palisades. These are all different portrayals of the California Colonial, its romantic past and its manner of settling into California's climate and landscape. Vernacular and religious structures built between 1769 and 1848, during the Spanish Mission and Mexican Rancho eras, gave California its unique character; a look that was subsequently fictionalised in the revival architecture produced since those colonial days. Particularly influential on residential work, the colonial styles have indulged in the rich associations with Spain's culture-employing styles and ornament from the country's provincial Andalusian, Plateresco, Churrigueresco, and Desornamentado styles and its ever-present Mud jar crafts -- or burrowed into its rustic pioneer roots and depicted as individual visions of earthy rancho haciendas.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=J3VdAAAAMAAJ&dq=California+Colonial:+The+Spanish+and+Rancho+Revival+Styles+(Schiffer+Design+Book)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"ALGEBRA STUDENT WORKBOOK","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=w1XsugAACAAJ&dq=ALGEBRA+STUDENT+WORKBOOK&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fortune Hunters","description":"Empress Elizabeth of Austria, known as Sisi, is the Princess Diana of nineteenth-century Europe.

Captain Bay Middleton is dashing, young, and the finest horseman in England. He is also impoverished, with no hope of buying the horse needed to win the Grand National until he meets Charlotte Baird. A clever, plainspoken heiress whose money gives her a choice among suitors, Charlotte falls in love with Bay, the first man to really notice her, for his vulnerability as well as his glamour. When Sisi joins the legendary hunt organized by Earl Spencer in England, Bay is asked to guide her on the treacherous course. Their shared passion for riding leads to an infatuation that jeopardizes the growing bond between Bay and Charlotte, and threatens all of their futures. The Fortune Hunter, a brilliant new novel by Daisy Goodwin, is a lush, irresistible story of the public lives and private longings of grand historical figures.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Zxs4AwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Fortune+Hunters&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Auction This!: Your Complete Guide to the World of Online Auctions","description":"A guide to online auctions covers safe trading, locating and navigating auction sites, bidding, offering items for sale, and getting the best deal","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xJLJAAAACAAJ&dq=Auction+This!:+Your+Complete+Guide+to+the+World+of+Online+Auctions&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The End of the War; Europe: April 15-May 23, 1945.","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4n8StwAACAAJ&dq=The+End+of+the+War%3B+Europe:+April+15-May+23,+1945.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Guide to Owning Central American Cichlids","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qJACAAAACAAJ&dq=The+Guide+to+Owning+Central+American+Cichlids&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Life in the crystal palace (Discus books)","description":"Thousands of men enter the crystal palace yearly.

Drawing upon years of unparalleled experience in diplomacy and government, Azzam examines the social and economic ramifications of the Muslim state, one based on humane ideals of law and justice expressed in the Qur'an, and one which can provide the foundation for a just society. Abd al-Rahman Azzam (1893-1976) is generally considered as the father of the Arab League. He served as the League's first Secretary-General between 1945-52 as well as distinguishing himself in a long career as an ambassador and parliamentarian. As Vincent Sheean points out in his introduction, 'In Damascus as well as in Djakarta, Istanbul and Baghdad, this man is known for valour of spirit and elevation of mind...He combines in the best Islamic mode, the aspects of thought and action, like the Muslim warriors of another time who are typified for us Westerners by the figure of Saladin.' Malcolm X's reading of The Eternal Message of Muhammad and his meeting with Azzam Pasha are vividly recounted in his Autobiography.

Now, almost one hundred years later, this definitive account offers a unique look at the Wright Brothers' achievement, and at the many experiments that led up to their momentous ride. Revealing the brothers' youthful interest in technology and flight, the authors recount the trials and errors of other would-be aviators, and explain how the race to be the first man aloft became an international obsession. Readers will learn how The Flyer -- the Wright Brothers' original plane -- was built, and how its indefatigable inventors solved the challenges that stumped their predecessors. And finally there is the historic flight itself -- what went wrong and what, amazingly, went right -- and the enormous impact the Wright Brothers had on their own and future generations. Written in engaging, accessible prose and, featuring more than 200 photographs and illustrations, On Great White Wings will delight anyone interested in the history of flight and in the fantastic story behind the twentieth century's most important achievement.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=WszswAEACAAJ&dq=On+Great+White+Wings:+The+Wright+Brothers+and+the+Race+for+Flight&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Harlem: The 30's; Postcard Book: Postcard Book (Postcard Books)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QxEvAAAACAAJ&dq=Harlem:+The+30%27s%3B+Postcard+Book:+Postcard+Book+(Postcard+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Toad on the Road (Step Into Reading: A Step 1 Book (Turtleback))","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=NXDxHIpAKm0C&dq=Toad+on+the+Road+(Step+Into+Reading:+A+Step+1+Book+(Turtleback))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sarah Orne Jewett: Her World And Her Work (Radcliffe Biography Series)","description":"Traces the life and career of the New England writer, discusses her personal relationships, and looks at the intellectual life of the period","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=LbhlAAAAMAAJ&dq=Sarah+Orne+Jewett:+Her+World+And+Her+Work+(Radcliffe+Biography+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lift Every Voice: Constructing Christian Theologies from the Underside","description":"This updated edition confirms its place as the most important systematic theology reader available with a liberationist perspective.

These iconic notions have actively altered the way society relates to old-growth forests, catalyzing major changes in policy and management. But how appropriate are those changes and how well do they really serve in reaching conservation goals? Old Growth in a New World untangles the complexities of the old growth concept and the parallel complexity of old-growth policy and management. It brings together more than two dozen contributors ecologists, economists, sociologists, managers, historians, silviculturists, environmentalists, timber producers, and philosophers to offer a broad suite of perspectives on changes that have occurred in the valuing and management of old-growth forests in the Pacific Northwest over the past thirty years. The book ? introduces the issues and history of old-growth values and conservation in the Pacific Northwest; ? explores old growth through the ideas of leading ecologists and social scientists; ? addresses the implications for the future management of old-growth forests and considers how evolving science and social knowledge might be used to increase conservation effectiveness. By confronting the complexity of the old-growth concept and associated policy and management challenges, Old Growth in a New World encourages productive discussion on the future of old growth in the Pacific Northwest and offers options for more effective approaches to conserving forest biodiversity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_6YKSYJyDUMC&dq=In+the+New+World&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Inside Microsoft Sql Server 6.5 (Microsoft Programming Series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=2HF2zgEACAAJ&dq=Inside+Microsoft+Sql+Server+6.5+(Microsoft+Programming+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Notre Dame: its people and its legends","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=oHY7AAAAIAAJ&dq=Notre+Dame:+its+people+and+its+legends&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"25 Years of the Ironman Triathlon World Championship","description":"Covers 25 years of the IronmanTriathlon World Championship, a combination of distance swimming, cycling, and running, frequently in exotic locations, held annually in October.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=dy8HAAAACAAJ&dq=25+Years+of+the+Ironman+Triathlon+World+Championship&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"JAVA 2 Network Security (2nd Edition)","description":"This authoritative Java security book is written by the architect of the Java security model.

The pieces from the early days are largely short snippets from newspapers; it is only later - from the 1940s on - that Hemingway begins to get the star treatment from publications such as the New Yorker or George Plimpton's Paris Review.

But the occasion was essentially serious. All of America was serious now, after the seven years of depression since 1929.

The Jews of New Jersey: A Pictorial History redresses this lack with a lively narrative and hundreds of archival and family photographsmany rarethat bring this history to life. Patricia Ard and Michael Rockland focus on representative Jewish communities throughout the state, paying particular attention to the extraordinary stories of ordinary people. Through the joys and struggles of homemakers, storekeepers, factory workers, athletes, children, farmers, activists, religious leaders, and Holocaust survivors, the authors tell the stories of how these communities have evolved, thrived, and changed. They note the difficulties posed by intermarriage and assimilation and, at the same time, depict a burgeoning revival of Jewish orthodoxy and traditions. The Jews of New Jersey will please both the historian and general reader. Its heartwarming stories and pictures truly make the point that it is through the joys, triumphs, and defeats of everyday people that history is made.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=R4DgTMfsb00C&dq=The+Jews+of+New+Jersey:+A+Pictorial+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"One Wild Rose (Zebra Historical Romance)","description":"In 1867 Colorado, Roselyn O'Neill is ready to settle down for a quiet life after following her saloon-singer mother for years.

In chronological order, references and images of women in church writings and lay culture are explored, as well as the actual lives of women and their vitae. Patricia Ranft shows how the accumulated evidence provides persuasive data that this positive tradition coexisted with the more notorious misogynist tradition. For a millennium and a half, Ranft reveals, Christianity possessed the lone voice in society that posited women s equality in any aspect. She argues that without knowledge of this tradition, our understanding of the history of Western women is significantly incomplete. Women and Spiritual Equality in the Christian Tradition is the first lengthy study to document such a tradition and it gives long overdue life to the previously muted voices of women s equality in Western society s discourse on women. Well-written and engaging, it fills a significant gap in the areas of ecclesiastical and women s history.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=BUKuQgAACAAJ&dq=Women+and+Spiritual+Equality+In+Christian+Tradition&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Tara","description":"Tara zegt meteen \`ja als Britt haar mee vraagt op vakantie.

The Arctic has for centuries been a destination for the most ambitious explorers a place of dreams, fears, and awe-inspiring spectacle.

Your baby cries and you can't understand why. Is he hungry? Is he tired? Maybe he dirties his diaper? At birth, toddlers can only use crying as a way of transmitting their needs to others, a sign that is not always easy for adults to understand. Deciphering the needs of children, in preverbal age, is a need very felt by mothers, who would break down that sense of frustration because they cannot interpret the reasons for the cries of babies, their necessities, or their attempts to communicate. The solution is Baby Sign Language, which is used to facilitate verbal communication with the infant using symbolic gestures. All human beings use symbolic signs, it just comes naturally to them -- For instance, when your baby raises her arms so that he can be lifted, or he points at something that he wants you to get it for him. Our little babies already have ideas to communicate before they are even able to talk; hence, sign language opens a window of opportunity for them to express their thoughts and feelings. With Baby Sign Language You Will Learn: - The Benefits of Baby Sign Language in the Communicative Relationship between Baby and Parent - Strategies to Get Your Toddler's Attention in Easily and Effective Way - Over 100 Signs from Basic to Useful, with the Addiction of Made Up Signs - Lots of Songs and Stories for Faster and Funnier Learning - 101 ASL Signs with Numbers and the Manual Alphabets - A Signing Vocabulary We know that the foundations of attachment are based on the first few months of life, and in particular on the ability of the parent to understand the mental states of their child. If the child can transmit his mental states through gestures, the parent's task of decoding them will certainly be easier. So, provide babies other tools to communicate effectively in addition to the spoken language certainly gives fundamental cues for building this bond. Would You Like To Know More?

It continues to evoke images of heavily laden caravans crossing endless deserts, steppes and mountain ranges to reach the markets of wealthy oasis towns. From the second century BC, this network of merchants' routes, well over 4,000 miles long, linked China and the Roman Empire. It served the trade of luxury goods, notably silk, and stimulated the spread of ideas of religion, culture and art. The young republic of Uzbekistan, with its ancient urban cultural centres of Bukhara, Chiwa and Samarkand, is the heartland of the Silk Road.The artistic and cultural history of the region, through more than two millennia, is represented here in four main sections: Transoxiana from the fourth century BC to the arrival of Islam in the eighth century AD; Central Asia as a cultural and political centre of Islam in the eighth century until the fall of the Timurid empire at the beginning of the sixteenth century; Turkestan at the time of the Uzbek-dominated khanates from the sixteenth century up to the Russian conquest and Russian Revolution; and Uzbekistan from Soviet rule until after the establishment of sovereignty. The evolving history of the region is clearly explained in the context of its complex geography, together with analyses of the architecture, the art of the book, Islamic arts and crafts, and the rich variety of textiles of the region. Uzbekistan's cultural history is illustrated with pictures of archaeological finds and ethnographical objects from European and Uzbek museums and private collections, many published here for the first time.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=TuBMHAAACAAJ&dq=Uzbekistan:+Heir+to+the+Silk+Road&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Primates (Life Nature Library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=DSjWzAEACAAJ&dq=The+Primates+(Life+Nature+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Programming with JFC","description":"PROGRAMMING GAMES WITH JAVA explains (in simple, easy-to-follow terms) how to build a 2D Java GUI game project.

This book is designed to help provide that formation for bishops, priests, deacons, and indeed for all the people of God. The introduction provides a brief history of the use of deacons in Anglican liturgies, from 1549 to the present, including characteristics and statement of purposes.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=qY5QcI-mllkC&dq=Deacons+in+the+Liturgy&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How To: Listen to God","description":"How do we listen to God speak to our hearts, minds, and wills especially above the noise and stress of the modern world? What is the process of discerning God's will? Best-selling author and popular EWTN host Fr. Mitch Pacwa, SJ, tackles these and other questions in this comprehensive book on discernment. He says that first we need to believe in God and his moral laws and make a commitment to please him in all that we do. Then we need to pray so that we can experience the peace that can come only from God. Fr. Pacwa draws from St. Ignatius' Spiritual Exercises, using plenty of everyday examples as well as stories from Scripture to help clarify his points. He encourages readers to develop a rich prayer life and says we can learn to listen to God's powerful voice and hear him speaking lovingly to us even when we are suffering in some way. Confronts modern-day assumptions that can prevent us from being open to God's will for our lives. Emphasizes the many ways we can develop our prayer life to nourish an authentic relationship with the Lord.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mFkkkgAACAAJ&dq=How+To:+Listen+to+God&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bhutan Map by ITMB (Travel Reference Map)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZZkYAQAAMAAJ&dq=Bhutan+Map+by+ITMB+(Travel+Reference+Map)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Science Times Book of Insects","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FqAsAAAAYAAJ&dq=The+Science+Times+Book+of+Insects&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elmo's World: Opposites!

In de jaren '50 werden haar kankercellen zonder dat zij dat wist bij haar weggenomen. Met behulp van deze cellen, die letterlijk onsterfelijk zijn, werden de meest uiteenlopende geneeskundige ontdekkingen gedaan en rond de verkoop ervan ontstond een miljoenenindustrie. Het leven van Henrietta bleef echter vrijwel onbekend en ook haar familie wist tot ruim dertig jaar geleden niet van het bestaan van de cellen af. Rebecca Skloot vertelt het verhaal van de 'HeLa-cellen', maar laat ons vooral ook kennis maken met Henrietta, haar verleden en haar familie, die nog steeds worstelt met de nalatenschap van de cellen. Ze laat zien dat het verhaal van de familie Lacks onlosmakelijk verbonden is met de duistere geschiedenis van het experimenteren met Afrikaans-Amerikanen, het ontstaan van de ethiek binnen de biologie en de juridische strijd over de vraag of we de baas zijn over de materie waarvan we zijn gemaakt.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=glIqDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pounds and inches;: A new approach to obesity","description":"This book, popularly known as \\"Pounds and Inches,\\" contains the original HCG diet protocol, as created by Dr. A.T.W.

Only two of Bounds' books were published before he died. After his death, Rev. Claudius (Claude) Lysias Chilton, Jr., grandson of William Parish Chilton and admirer of Bounds, worked on preserving and preparing Bounds' collection of manuscripts for publication. By 1921, Homer W. Hodge completed additional editorial work. Edward McKendree Bounds was born on August 15, 1835, in Shelbyville, Missouri. He is the son of Thomas Jefferson and Hester A. (n e Purnell) Bounds. In the preface to E.M. Bounds on Prayer, published by Hendrickson Christian Classics Series over 90 years after Bounds' death, it is surmised that young Edward was named after the evangelist, William McKendree, who planted churches in western Missouri and served as the fourth bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church.

Award-winning journalist Sean Naylor, an eyewitness to the action, vividly portrays the fight for Afghanistan's most hostile battleground. At dawn on March 2, 2002, the first major battle of the 21st Century began. Over 200 soldiers of the 101st Airborne and 10th Mountain Divisions flew into Afghanistan's Shahikot valley - and into the mouth of a buzz-saw. They were about to pay a bloody price for strategic, higher-level miscalculations that underestimated the enemy's strength and willingness to fight. After the attacks of September 11, 2001, Coalition forces quickly toppled the Taliban regime from the seat of government. But, believing the war to be all but over, the Pentagon and US Central Command refused to commit the forces required to achieve total victory in Afghanistan. Instead, they delegated responsibility for fighting the war's biggest battle to a tangle of untested units thrown together at the last moment. Then the world watched as Anaconda seemed to unravel. Denied the extra infantry, artillery and close air support with which they trained to go to war, the soldiers of this airborne assault fought for survival in brutal high-altitude combat. Backed up by a small, but crucial, team of special forces, they were all that stood between the Coalition and a military disaster. Perfect for fans of Black Hawk Down, Zero Dark Thirty, Chris Ryan, and Andy McNab. About the author: Sean Naylor is a senior writer for the Army Times.

This pivotal event drove his interest in his new country resulting in his consistently voting in every election since being sworn in as a citizen. While he voted, he was astonished that so few of the qualified voters bothered to go to the polls, and so many incompetents have been elected. As a result he has published this book in an effort to encourage everyone to exercise their earned privilege and their right as a US citizen to cast a ballot for our governing officials.

Indeed, though the traditional, touristic kind of Indianness may be touted by certain elite groups, this type of Indianness is simultaneously being deconstructed and subverted by other Indians who assert theirown, sometimes opposing views of what it means to be Desi. This work utimately demonstrates that Desi identity is ephemeral -- it constantly needs to be manufactured and begs to be performed.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cfJ_QgAACAAJ&dq=Doing+the+Desi+Thing:+Performing+Indianness+in+New+York+City+(Studies+in+Asian+Americans)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The right to be lazy,: And other studies,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hp7xzQEACAAJ&dq=The+right+to+be+lazy,:+And+other+studies,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"THE ART OF CUISINE.","description":"Henri de-Toulouse-Lautrec brought to his art a zest for life as well as an impeccable style. It is an exciting discovery to find that Lautrec applies this same exuberance and meticulous technique to the art of cuisine--that he invented recipes and cooked new dishes as an artistic creation worthy of his serious attention. This volume is a collection of the recipes that Lautrec invented, or were garnered in his company from acquaintances of all classes of society. It has been illustrated with the menus that Lautrec himself designed and decorated, as well as with a rich abundance of other appropriate Lautrec paintings and drawings. The frontispiece is a portrait by Edouard Vuillard of lautrec preparing one of his masterful dishes. The recipes are given here in their original form, retaining their color of thought and language. The only modifications are culinary notes that have been added to facilitate the work of modern cooks. Lautrec took great pride in his culinary ability, and if he felt it would not be appreciated, he would say that some people \\"are not worth of ring dove with olives, they will never have any and they will never know what it is.\\" Lautrec planned meals carefully, made beautifully decorated menus, and was inspired by the dinners to draw more sketches of the dinners, and of the food. He also brought to cuisine, as to the rest of his life, a marvelous wit. Who could forget the invitation to eat kangaroo, in honor of an animal that he had seen boxing at a circus (it was replaced at the last moment by an enormous sheep with an artificial pouch): or the housewarming of the apartment of his friend Natanson, where in a crazy atmosphere, he managed to intoxicate the artistic elite of Paris and launch the fashion of cocktail food. We owe the record of this cuisine (and also of a great body of the art collection itself) to Maurice Joyant. Joyant and Lautrec had been childhood friends, and their intimacy was renewed and deepened during the Montmartre years, when Lautrec's fame was growing and Joyant was director of the same art gallery in Paris that Theo Van Gogh had run before him. Lautrec was, throughout their relationship, the artist and innovator; Joyant, the steadying influence, the protector, and, after the painter's death, the executor. This book is a tribute to their friendship and to their daily intercourse in art and in cuisine. Thus, art, friendship, and food have come together in The Art of Cuisine as a joyful legacy of Henry de Toulouse-Lautrec and Maurice Joyant.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=D12zBgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Celebrated Crimes: Mary Stuart Vol. 3 (Celebrated Crimes)","description":"? ???? ? ? ?? ?? ???? ????! : ??? ????(???)(Celebrated Crimes(Complete) by Alexandre Dumas)(1839)? ????? ??(Alexandre Dumas)? ???? ?? ??? ?? ??(biography)?? ??? ??(historical records)? ??? ?? ??(a historical novel)???. ?? ??? ??? ??? ?? ???? ??? 18?? ?? ?? ??? ?? 8?? ??? ???? ??????, ?????? ???????. ??? ?? ???? ??(derring-do), ??? ??(foul deeds), ??? ??(close escapes), ????? ??(glorious victories)? ??? ? ??? ?? ???? ??(the action adventure novel)? ??? ??? ? ?? ??? ?? ??? ??? ??? ?????? ???? ??? ? 180??? ?? ???? ?? ??? ????. ??????

It renders with authenticity and poignancy a young woman s struggle to break out of the cycle of poverty that has entrapped her family for generations. From the surrealistic world of a mental institution, a young woman struggles to come to terms with her past after a failed suicide attempt. From her very birth into abject poverty, Blanca is lost in a nightmarish labyrinth of abuse and deprivation. In vivid and gripping detail, Blanca remembers her victimization at the hands of family and strangers, both in New York and in Puerto Rico. As her destructive odyssey progresses, she becomes a rag doll tossed about by her family and her foster parents, by her brutal husband and by the very institutions meant to help her. This story is a tribute to a woman s capacity to endure and survive.

In this paperback edition of his definitive book on Scholem's work, David Biale has shortened and rearranged his study for the benefit of the general reader and the student. A new introduction and new passages in the main text highlight the pluralistic character of Jewish theology as seen by Scholem, the place of the Kabbalah in debates over Zionism versus assimilation, and the interpretation of Kafka as a Jewish writer.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=-L62EgOhNcUC&dq=Gershom+Scholem,+Kabbalah+and+Counter+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Continental Philosophy Reader","description":"The Continental Philosophy Reader is the first complete anthology of classic writings from the major figures in European thought and provides a powerful introduction to one of the 20th century's most influential intellectual movements.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=NTcT3idyGG0C&dq=The+Continental+Philosophy+Reader&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Unfaded Pageant: Edwin Austin Abbey's Shakespearean Subjects","description":"Chronicles the history of the artist's Shakespearean work, which influenced late Victorian stage productions, and examines his interpretations in the context of late Victorian attitudes towards the plays and the wider context of English art.

He begins by developing a solution to the problem of induction - a solution whose key idea is that the regularities in the workings of nature that have held in our experience hitherto are to be explained by appeal to the controlling influence of laws, as forms of natural necessity. His second line of argument focuses on the issue of what we should take such necessitational laws to be, and whether we can even make sense of them at all. Having considered and rejected various alternatives, Foster puts forward his own proposal: the obtaining of a law consists in the causal imposing of a regularity on the universe as a regularity. With this causal account of laws in place, he is now equipped to offer an argument for theism. His claim is that natural regularities call for explanation, and that, whatever explanatory role we may initially assign to laws, the only plausible ultimate explanation is in terms of the agency of God. Finally, he argues that, once we accept the existence of God, we need to think of him as creating the universe by a method which imposes regularities on it in the relevant law-yielding way. In this new perspective, the original nomological-explanatory solution to the problem of induction becomes a theological-explanatory solution. The Divine Lawmaker is bold and original in its approach, and rich in argument. The issues on which it focuses are among the most important in the whole epistemological and metaphysical spectrum.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1Kf0G9YV0LUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Complete Idiot's Guide to Soccer","description":"\\"The Complete Idiot?s Guide? to Soccer Basics explains anything and everything a parent or new coach needs to know to understand the game and make the most of a child?s soccer experience.

Java provides many different kinds of streams, each with its own application. The universe of streams is divided into four largecategories: input streams and output streams, for reading and writing binary data; and readers and writers, for reading and writing textual (character) data. You're almost certainly familiar with the basic kinds of streams--but did you know that there's a CipherInputStream for reading encrypted data? And a ZipOutputStream for automaticallycompressing data? Do you know how to use buffered streams effectively to make your I/O operations more efficient? Java I/O, 2nd Edition has been updated for Java 5.0 APIs and tells you all you ever need to know about streams--and probably more. A discussion of I/O wouldn't be complete without treatment of character sets and formatting. Java supports the Unicode standard, which provides definitions for the character sets of most written languages. Consequently, Java is the first programming language that lets you do I/O in virtually any language. Java also provides a sophisticated model for formatting textual and numeric data. Java I/O, 2nd Edition shows you how to control number formatting, use characters aside from the standard (but outdated) ASCII character set, and get a head start on writing truly multilingual software. Java I/O, 2nd Edition includes: Coverage of all I/O classes and related classes In-depth coverage of Java's number formatting facilities and its support for international character sets","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=42etT_9-_9MC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Costume Design: Techniques of Modern Masters","description":"Written in interview format, this text presents the techniques of 18 modernostume design masters.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=XMUR0vPjv7MC&dq=Costume+Design:+Techniques+of+Modern+Masters&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elementary Platen Presswork","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=UIUsAAAAYAAJ&dq=Elementary+Platen+Presswork&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cheap Thrills New York: Great NYC Meals for Under $15 (Cheap Thrills series)","description":"Crockett Johnson (born David Johnson Leisk, 1906-1975) and Ruth Krauss (1901-1993) were a husband-and-wife team that created such popular children's books as The Carrot Seed and How to Make an Earthquake. Separately, Johnson created the enduring children's classic Harold and the Purple Crayon and the groundbreaking comic strip Barnaby. Krauss wrote over a dozen children's books illustrated by others, and pioneered the use of spontaneous, loose-tongued kids in children's literature. Together, Johnson and Krauss's style--whimsical writing, clear and minimalist drawing, and a child's point-of-view--is among the most revered and influential in children's literature and cartooning, inspiring the work of Maurice Sendak, Charles M. Schulz, Chris Van Allsburg, and Jon Scieszka. This critical biography examines their lives and careers, including their separate achievements when not collaborating. Using correspondence, sketches, contemporary newspaper and magazine accounts, archived and personal interviews, author Philip Nel draws a compelling portrait of a couple whose output encompassed children's literature, comics, graphic design, and the fine arts. Their mentorship of now-famous illustrator Maurice Sendak (Where the Wild Things Are) is examined at length, as is the couple's appeal to adult contemporaries such as Duke Ellington and Dorothy Parker. Defiantly leftist in an era of McCarthyism and Cold War paranoia, Johnson and Krauss risked collaborations that often contained subtly rendered liberal themes. Indeed, they were under FBI surveillance for years. Their legacy of considerable success invites readers to dream and to imagine, drawing paths that take them anywhere they want to go.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=H_caBwAAQBAJ&dq=Cheap+Thrills+New+York:+Great+NYC+Meals+for+Under+%2415+(Cheap+Thrills+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Linux System Administration White Papers: A Compilation of Technical Documents for System Administrators","description":"For more than 20 years, Network World has been the premier provider of information, intelligence and insight for network and IT executives responsible for the digital nervous systems of large organizations.

She has been called rock and roll's original female outlaw, as famous for her bad behavior as for her haunting singing voice. In her 25-year career as a musician, Grace Slick charted dozens of hits and sold millions of albums. From \\"White Rabbit\\" and \\"Somebody to Love\\" to \\"Sarah\\" and \\"Miracles\\", the songs she performed became the anthems of a generation. Whether describing her antics at the White House with Abbie Hoffman or the unforgettable experience that was Woodstock, Slick's recollections have the same rich imagery found in her lyrics. In this provocative narrative, readers will discover the many sides of Grace Slick: as artistic pioneer; she records songs with Jerry Garcia and David Crosby; as practitioner of freedom and rebellion; she sleeps with Jim Morrison and gets arrested for DUI on three separate occasions (without actually being in a car); and as a loving mother to actress China Kantner, she tries to balance casual friendship with parental wisdom. Slick offers a revealing self-portrait of the complex woman behind the rock-outlaw image, and delivers a behind-the-scenes, no-holds-barred view of the people and spirit that defined a quarter-century of American pop culture. Wildly funny, candid, and evocative, Somebody to Love?tells what it was really like during, and after, the Summer of Love-and how one remarkable woman survived it all to remain today as vibrant and rebellious as ever.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=zVc1AQAAQBAJ&dq=Somebody+to+Love+A+Rock-and-Roll+Memoir.&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"NMS Review for USMLE Step 3 (National Medical Series for Independent Study)","description":"An awaited component to NMS review books, NMS Review for the USMLE Step 3 keeps the gold standard.

Advance praise for Roger Sessions's new book: \\"Roger has a gift for relating the somewhat esoteric topic of distributed computing to the everyday world. COM+ and the Battle for the Middle Tier provides a fine introduction to the problems addressed by the middle tier and the solutions offered by Microsoft's COM+.\\"- MARY KIRTLAND Program Manager, Microsoft Corp. \\"Although I often don't agree with Roger Sessions's opinions and conclusions, I always enjoy reading his work.

Calling themselves the Knight Company after their captain, Newton Knight, they set up headquarters in the swamps of the Leaf River, where they declared their loyalty to the U.S. government. The story of the Jones County rebellion is well known among Mississippians, and debate over whether the county actually seceded from the state during the war has smoldered for more than a century. Adding further controversy to the legend is the story of Newt Knight's interracial romance with his wartime accomplice, Rachel, a slave. From their relationship there developed a mixed-race community that endured long after the Civil War had ended, and the ambiguous racial identity of their descendants confounded the rules of segregated Mississippi well into the twentieth century. Victoria Bynum traces the origins and legacy of the Jones County uprising from the American Revolution to the modern civil rights movement. In bridging the gap between the legendary and the real Free State of Jones, she shows how the legend--what was told, what was embellished, and what was left out--reveals a great deal about the South's transition from slavery to segregation; the racial, gender, and class politics of the period; and the contingent nature of history and memory. In a new afterword, Bynum updates readers on recent scholarship, current issues of race and Southern heritage, and the coming movie that make this Civil War story essential reading. The Free State of Jones film, starring Matthew McConaughey, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, and Keri Russell, will be released in May 2016.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hGvoCgAAQBAJ&dq=The+Free+State+of+Jones:+Mississippi%27s+Longest+Civil+War&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Martyr","description":"This book has been prepared for the benefit of people who want the real truth concerning Huey P.

Jodahs is supposed to be just another hybrid of human and Oankali, but as he begins his transformation to adulthood he finds himself becoming ooloi the first ever born to a human mother. As his body changes, Jodahs develops the ability to shapeshift, manipulate matter, and cure or create disease at will. If this frightened young man is able to master his new identity, Jodahs could prove the savior of what s left of mankind. Or, if he is not careful, he could become a plague that will destroy this new race once and for all. Readers of Ursula K. Le Guin and N. K. Jemisin will be fascinated by bestselling author Octavia Butler s thought-provoking and compelling vision of humanity. This ebook features an illustrated biography of Octavia E. Butler including rare images from the author s estate.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=N0c8HorFPZwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The astrology of personality;: A re-formulation of astrological concepts and ideals, in terms of contemporary psychology and philosophy,","description":"A modern classic, as potent today as when first written in 1936.

Yet for all its practical reach, which extended over centuries and as far as the Spanish New World, it is an unusual text, argues Jes s R. Velasco, one that introduces canon and ecclesiastical law in the vernacular for explicitly secular purposes, that embraces intellectual disciplines and fictional techniques that normally lie outside legal science, and that cultivates rather than shuns perplexity. In Dead Voice, Velasco analyzes the process of the Siete Partidas's codification and the ways in which different cultural, religious, and legal traditions that existed on the Iberian peninsula during the Middle Ages were combined in its innovative construction. In particular, he pays special attention to the concept of \\"dead voice,\\" the art of writing the law in the vernacular of its clients as well as in the language of legal professionals. He offers an integrated reading of the Siete Partidas, exploring such matters as the production, transmission, and control of the material text; the collaboration between sovereignty and jurisdiction to define the environment where law applies; a rare legislation of friendship; and the use of legislation to characterize the people as \\"the soul of the kingdom,\\" endowed with the responsibility of judging the stability of the political space. Presenting case studies beyond the Siete Partidas that demonstrate the incorporation of philosophical and fictional elements in the construction of law, Velasco reveals the legal processes that configured novel definitions of a subject and a people.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=YzPEDwAAQBAJ&dq=Voice&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pre-Foreclosure Property Investor's Kit: How to Make Money Buying Distressed Real Estate -- Before the Public Auction","description":"Pre-foreclosure real estate is one of the hottest investment opportunities on the market.

He felt that he might have lost touch with the country, with its speech, the smell of its grass and trees, its color and quality of light, the pulse of its people. To reassure himself, he set out on a voyage of rediscovery of the American identity, accompanied by a distinguished French poodle named Charley; and riding in a three-quarter-ton pickup truck named Rocinante. His course took him through almost forty states: northward from Long Island to Maine; through the Midwest to Chicago; onward by way of Minnesota, North Dakota, Montana (with which he fell in love), and Idaho to Seattle, south to San Francisco and his birthplace, Salinas; eastward through the Mojave, New Mexico, Arizona, to the vast hospitality of Texas, to New Orleans and a shocking drama of desegregation; finally, on the last leg, through Alabama, Virginia, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey to New York. Travels with Charley in Search of America is an intimate look at one of America's most beloved writers in the later years of his life a self-portrait of a man who never wrote an explicit autobiography. Written during a time of upheaval and racial tension in the South which Steinbeck witnessed firsthand Travels with Charley is a stunning evocation of America on the eve of a tumultuous decade.

Whether walking along the streets of New York or teaching writing at a university, Gornick is a woman exploring her need for conversation and connection with men and women, colleagues and strangers. She recalls her stint as a waitress in the Catskills and a failed friendship with an older woman and mentor, and reconsiders her experiences in the feminist movement, while living alone, and in marriage. Turning her trademark sharp eye on herself, Gornick works to see her part in things how she has both welcomed and avoided contact, and how these attempts at connections have enlivened and, at times, defeated her. First published in 1996, Approaching Eye Level is an unrelentingly honest collection of essays that finds Gornick at her best, reminding us that we can come to know ourselves only by engaging fully with the world.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=pW6VDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mars - A Warmer, Wetter Planet (Springer Praxis Books / Space Exploration)","description":"Mars is the Solar System's other wild, wet, water world. Long believed to have become cold, dead, and dry aeons ago, we now having striking new proof, not only that Mars was a relatively warm and wet place in geologically recent times, but that even today there are vast reserves of water frozen beneath the planet's surface. This compelling new evidence may well boost the chances of a manned mission to Mars sooner, rather than later. The discovery is also forcing a complete rethink about the mechanisms of global planetary change. What does the drastic turn of events on Mars mean for Earth's climate system? Could life have thrived on Mars very recently, and might it survive today in short-term hibernation? Will humans soon be capable of living off the natural resources that Martian hydrogeology has naturally offered us? Will humans one day be capable of setting off the same chain of events that nature has repeatedly triggered to set off warm, wet episodes on Mars? How could Mars be terraformed into a New World? (And should we even contemplate doing so?) This book offers a visually beautiful, scientifically detailed and accurate presentation of the evidence that has forced this new revolution in Mars science. From the reviews:\\"Long believed to have been cold, dead and dry for eons, there is now striking new proof that not only was Mars a relatively warm and wet place in geologically recent times, but that even today there are vast reserves of water frozen beneath the planet's surface. In this absorbing, beautifully illustrated book, Kargel describes the still-unfolding revolution in our knowledge about the Red Planet and how future concepts of Mars will continue to be molded by new revelations of four billion years of geology\\". (LUNAR AND PLANETARY INFORMATION BULLETIN)nbsp; From the reviews:\\" This exhaustive, effusive, and enthusiastic book conveys the excitement of frontline scientific research about as well as can be done. Kargel describes himself as a member of the \\"Tucson Mafia,\\" a group of scientists in full rebellion against the \\"Mars Establishment\\" and its belief in a cold, dry Mars. His ideas are presented in meticulous detail, supported by hundreds of superb pictures, many taken by the author himself. Some--perhaps most--of his ideas are controversial and may ultimately prove to be wrong, as he himself often points out, but we have to applaud the (sometimes career-risking) courage with which he has pursued them. In spite of the large amount of rather technical information, the reader is swept along by the author's enthusiasm in conveying it and ability to integrate it into a coherent vision. The reader also learns about the process of science: the thrill of having a new idea and discussing it with others at conferences and cafes (and bars), the drudgery often involved in pursuing the idea, the perils of the formal review process for publications and grant applications, and the roles played by personality conflicts and power politics.

Raber took him out, held him, and just couldn't put him back. He made four promises that day: one, no more petting, out of respect for Cougar; two, no more cages; three, he would educate the public against exotic-animal ownership; and four, he would make Cougar happy, and this has become a twenty-four-hours-a-day learning process and a duty that he adores. Being the only large cat in the country who is federally licensed without a cage, Cougar strides down streets, roams hotel lobbies, enters competitions, and even films a Puma Sportswear ad with several Olympic gold medalists. As the official poster model for the Iams pet food company, Cougar has been seen by millions. Together, Raber and Cougar are a team, and in this book, Raber recounts their many adventures: He teaches Cougar about elevators, switches, and doors while saving him from bullets and speeding cars; and Cougar teaches him about deer, opossum, and squirrels while rescuing him from alligators and raging rivers. In helping each other, they share their weaknesses and become strong. Beautiful and touching, entertaining and provocative, Through Cougar's Eyes is a love story that dispels the prevalent and presumptuous thinking that mankind and wildlife can't get along. This true story depicts sacrifice and dedication with a message: relating well to animals can set you both free.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=YXGtYA5VBq0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Cape May packet","description":"European explorers were captivated by the seemingly endless bounty of natural resources on Cape Cod Bay. One Englishman declared that the codfish were so thick one could walk on their backs. Early settlers quickly learned how to harness the bay's resources and excelled at shore whaling, shipping and salt making. But as these new industries flourished, the native Wampanoag, who helped the fledgling colony to take root, nearly vanished. Author Theresa Mitchell Barbo's skillful narrative weaves together the natural and cultural histories of the bay, highlighting some of the region's diverse milestones- from the drafting of the Mayflower Compact in 1620 to the establishment of the Pilgrim Nuclear Power Plant 350 years later. Cape Cod Bay: A History of Salt & Sea inspires new appreciation for this storied and stunning seascape, and underscores the importance of new efforts to preserve the bay's unique ecosystem.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=twaACQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lily and Willy","description":"As Lily and her brother Willy play together, whatever Lily's doll does Willy's teddy bear wants to do too.

Major Jackson, through both formal and free verse poems, renders visible the spirit of resilience, courage, and creativity he witnessed among his family, neighbors, and friends while growing up in Philadelphia. His poems hauntingly reflect urban decay and violence, yet at the same time they rejoice in the sustaining power of music and the potency of community. Jackson also honors artists who have served as models of resistance and maintained their own faith in the belief of the imagination to alter lives. The title poem, a dramatic monologue in the voice of the American jazz composer and bandleader Sun Ra, details such a humane program and serves as an admirable tribute to the tradition of African American art. Throughout, Jackson unflinchingly portrays our most devastated landscapes, yet with a vividness and compassion that expose the depth of his imaginative powers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MG9qQDdhclcC&dq=Leaving+Saturn+(The+Cave+Canem+Poetry+Prize)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"TOEFL for Dummies","description":"If you're an international student dreaming of attending a college or university in the United States, you'll have every opportunity to make the grade on the required Test of English as a Foreign Language when you consult TOEFL For Dummies!

If he is remembered today, it is as the author of a law of elasticity or as amisanthrope who accused Newton of stealing his ideas on gravity. This book, the first life of Hooke for nearly fifty years, rescues its subject from centuries of obscurity and misjudgement. It shows us Hooke the prolific inventor, the mechanic, the astronomer, the anatomist, the pioneer of geology, meteorology and microscopy, the precursor of Lavoisier and Darwin. It also gives us Hooke the architect of Bedlam and the Monument, the supervisor of London's rebuilding after the Great Fire, the watchmaker, the consumer of prodigious quantities of medicines and purgatives, the candid diarist, the lover, the hoarder of money and secrets, the coffee house conversationalist.

The two nations share a common history, religious heritage, pattern of law and politics, and a body of great literature. Yet America cannot be wholly confident that this heritage will endure forever. Declining standards in education and the strident claims of multiculturalists threaten to sever the vital Anglo-American link that ensures cultural order and continuity. In America's British Culture, Russell Kirk offers a brilliant summary account and spirited defense of the culture that the people of the United States have inherited from Great Britain. Kirk's view of culture links high achievement in mind and art with the folkways of a people, the former both growing from and guiding the latter. Within this order he discerns four essential fashions in which the British mind and experience have shaped American culture. The language and literature of England as transmitted to America carried with it a tradition of liberty and order as well as certain assumptions about the human condition and ethical conduct. American common and positive law, being derived from English law, gives fuller protection to the individual than does the legal system of any other country. The American form of representative government is patterned on the English parliamentary system. Finally, there is the body of mores - moral habits, beliefs, conventions, customs - that compose an ethical heritage. Through penetrating considerations of such influences and observers as Burke, Blackstone, Bryce, and Eliot, Kirk shows how the English inheritance has determined the success and stability of the American Republic. His powerfully argued case against multiculturalism points to the intellectual vacuity and betrayal embodied in its destructive hostility toward values of individual liberty and intellectual freedom. Elegantly written and deeply learned, America's British Culture is an insightful inquiry into history and a timely plea for cultural renewal and continuity.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MuPUNIj_4eMC&dq=America%27s+British+Culture+(Library+of+Conservative+Thought)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Aurora Leigh (Collected Works of Elizabeth Barrett Browning)","description":"A selection of poems from one of the greatest female poets of the Nineteenth Century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_BQEogEACAAJ&dq=Aurora+Leigh+(Collected+Works+of+Elizabeth+Barrett+Browning)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cover Me Naked","description":"Nurse and doctor express love against many odds.

This lecture seeks to introduce the reader to the most important details of the memory system; it targets both computer scientists and computer engineers in industry and in academia. Roughly speaking, computer scientists are the users of the memory system and computer engineers are the designers of the memory system. Both can benefit tremendously from a basic understanding of how the memory system really works: the computer scientist will be better equipped to create algorithms that perform well and the computer engineer will be better equipped to design systems that approach the optimal, given the resource limitations. Currently, there is consensus among architecture researchers that the memory system is \\"the bottleneck,\\" and this consensus has held for over a decade. Somewhat inexplicably, most of the research in the field is still directed toward improving the CPU to better tolerate a slow memory system, as opposed to addressing the weaknesses of the memory system directly. This lecture should get the bulk of the computer science and computer engineering population up the steep part of the learning curve. Not every CS/CE researcher/developer needs to do work in the memory system, but, just as a carpenter can do his job more efficiently if he knows a little of architecture, and an architect can do his job more efficiently if he knows a little of carpentry, giving the CS/CE worlds better intuition about the memory system should help them build better systems, both software and hardware.

Social and economic progress but also the brute treatment of people and nature throughout Europe were possible due to the use of urban planning and the other levels of spatial planning. Thereby, planning has constituted itself in Europe as an international subject. Since its emergence, through intense exchange but also competition, despite country differences, planning has developed as a European field of practice and scientific discipline. Planning is here much more than the addition of individual histories; however, historiography has treated this history very selective regarding geography and content. This book searches for an understanding of the historiography of planning in a European dimension. Scholars from Eastern and Western, Southern and Northern Europe address the issues of the public led production of city and the social functions of urban planning in capitalist and state-socialist countries. The examined examples include Poland and USSR, Czech Republic and Slovakia, UK, Netherlands, Germany, France, Portugal and Spain, Italy, and Sweden. The book will be of interest to students and scholars for Urbanism, Urban/Town Planning, Spatial Planning, Spatial Politics, Urban Development, Urban Policies, Planning History and European History of the 20th Century.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DT1_EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Java Virtual Machine (Java Series)","description":"This second edition of the official, definitive description of the Java Virtual Machine covers the many fundamental changes incorporated into the newest version of the Java Development Kit.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=V7RQAAAAMAAJ&dq=Java+Virtual+Machine+(Java+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Access Cookbook (O'Reilly Windows)","description":"Not a reference book, and not a tutorial either, the new second edition of the highly regarded Access Cookbook is an uncommonly useful collection of solutions to problems that Access users and developers are likely to face as they attempt to build increasingly complex applications.

Bede's The Reckoning of Time (De temporum ratione) was the first comprehensive treatise on this subject and the model and reference for all subsequent teaching discussion and criticism of the Christian calendar. It is a systematic exposition of the Julian solar calendar and the Paschal table of Dionysius Exiguus, with their related formulae for calculating dates. But it is more than a technical handbook. Bede sets calendar lore within a broad scientific framework and a coherent Christian concept of time, and incorporates themes as diverse as the theory of tides and the doctrine of the millennium. This translation of the full text of The Reckoning of Time includes an extensive historical introduction and a chapter-by-chapter commentary. It will interest historians of medieval science, theology, and education, Bede scholars and Anglo-Saxonists, liturgists, and Church historians. It will also serve as an accessible introduction to computus itself. Generations of medieval computists nourished their expertise in Bede's orderly presentation; modern scholars in quest of safe passage through this complex terrain can hope for no better guide.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=yFsw-Vaup6sC&dq=The+Reckoning&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Man with the Clubfoot","description":"Reproduction of the original: The Man with the Clubfoot by Valentine Williams","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_-pRDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Man+with+the+Clubfoot&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"I.Q.

The Game Design Reader is a one-of-a-kind collection on game design and criticism, from classic scholarly essays to cutting-edge case studies. A companion work to Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman's textbook Rules of Play: Game Design Fundamentals, The Game Design Reader is a classroom sourcebook, a reference for working game developers, and a great read for game fans and players. Thirty-two essays by game designers, game critics, game fans, philosophers, anthropologists, media theorists, and others consider fundamental questions: What are games and how are they designed? How do games interact with culture at large? What critical approaches can game designers take to create game stories, game spaces, game communities, and new forms of play? Salen and Zimmerman have collected seminal writings that span 50 years to offer a stunning array of perspectives. Game journalists express the rhythms of game play, sociologists tackle topics such as role-playing in vast virtual worlds, players rant and rave, and game designers describe the sweat and tears of bringing a game to market. Each text acts as a springboard for discussion, a potential class assignment, and a source of inspiration. The book is organized around fourteen topics, from The Player Experience to The Game Design Process, from Games and Narrative to Cultural Representation. Each topic, introduced with a short essay by Salen and Zimmerman, covers ideas and research fundamental to the study of games, and points to relevant texts within the Reader. Visual essays between book sections act as counterpoint to the writings. Like Rules of Play, The Game Design Reader is an intelligent and playful book. An invaluable resource for professionals and a unique introduction for those new to the field, The Game Design Reader is essential reading for anyone who takes games seriously.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=aZv6AQAAQBAJ&dq=The+Game&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Henrietta and the Golden Eggs","description":"Henrietta has big dreams for a little chicken: learning to sing, to swim, to fly, and, most important of all, to lay golden eggs.

For more than five decades, he set forth his comprehensive perspective on the world s problems in numerous essays, which offer an illuminating insight into the intellectual universe of this renaissance man. These texts remain surprisingly topical even today, decades after their initial publication. While Fuller wrote the works in the 1960 s and 1970 s, they could not be more timely: like desperately needed time-capsules of wisdom for the critical moment he foresaw, and in which we find ourselves. Long out of print, they are now being published again, together with commentary by Jaime Snyder, the grandson of Buckminster Fuller. Designed for a new generation of readers, Snyder prepared these editions with supplementary material providing background on the texts, factual updates, and interpretation of his visionary ideas. Initially published in 1969, and one of Fuller s most popular works, Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth is a brilliant synthesis of his world view. In this very accessible volume, Fuller investigates the great challenges facing humanity, and the principles for avoiding extinction and  exercising our option to make it.  How will humanity survive? How does automation influence individualization? How can we utilize our resources more effectively to realize our potential to end poverty in this generation? He questions the concept of specialization, calls for a design revolution of innovation, and offers advice on how to guide  spaceship earth  toward a sustainable future. And it Came to Pass  Not to Stay brings together Buckminster Fuller s lyrical and philosophical best, including seven  essays  in a form he called his  ventilated prose , and as always addressing the current global crisis and his predictions for the future. These essays, including  How Little I Know ,  What I am Trying to Do ,  Soft Revolution , and  Ethics , put the task of ushering in a new era of humanity in the context of  always starting with the universe.  In rare form, Fuller elegantly weaves the personal, the playful, the simple, and the profound. Utopia or Oblivion is a provocative blueprint for the future. This comprehensive volume is composed of essays derived from the lectures he gave all over the world during the 1960 s. Fuller s thesis is that humanity  for the first time in its history  has the opportunity to create a world where the needs of 100% of humanity are met. This is Fuller in his prime, relaying his urgent message for earthians  critical moment and presenting pioneering solutions which reflect his commitment to the potential of innovative design to create technology that does  more with less  and thereby improves human lives . . .  This is what man tends to call utopia. It s a fairly small word, but inadequate to describe the extraordinary new freedom of man in a new relationship to universe - the alternative of which is oblivion.

A spinster whose passion was bird-watching, a dotty peer who pinched pennies, and a baffling murder made the tiny village of Littlebourne a most extraordinary place. And a severed finger made a ghastly clue in the killing that led local constables from a corpse to a boggy footpath to a beautiful lady s mansion. But Richard Jury refused, preferring to take the less traveled route to a slightly disreputable pub, the Anodyne Necklace. There, drinks all around loosened enough tongues to link a London mugging with the Littlebourne murder and a treasure map that would chart the way to yet another chilling crime.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=9--1tYcW-OgC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lives Through Literature: A Thematic Anthology","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=MDh8PQAACAAJ&dq=Lives+Through+Literature:+A+Thematic+Anthology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"World of Bonsai","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Dw2DAQAACAAJ&dq=World+of+Bonsai&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Itsy Bitsy Spider (Sing-Along Storybook)","description":"Little ones can sing along as they look through this board book featuring five slider mechanisms and a QR code with directions for how to download both an instrumental and vocal version of the nursery rhyme.

Dave Nimmons proceeds to synthesize that information to reveal a number of unseen patterns of gay male behavior, truths about our lives we feel instinctively but have not named. For instance, countless studies show that gay men have developed a culture in which public violence is almost non-existent, which is notable when you consider that violence in this society is almost entirely a male phenomenon. Even in intensely over-crowded gay bars and discos, with alcohol and testosterone saturating the atmosphere, fist fights are virtually unheard of. On in the area of volunteerism, study after study shows that gay men volunteer at a much higher level than any other segment of the population (and, very interestingly, our volunteerism is about evenly divided between gay and non-gay causes, as are our charitable contributions). Our patterns of intimacy and friendship are much more diffuse and extended than heterosexual patterns; sexual jealousy and exclusiveness are extremely different, as are our relationships with women and our pursuit of playfulness and sexual bliss. Altogether, these gay social innovations have no parallel in modern American culture; they describe a new kind of public ethics, one with deep implications for gay men and for the larger society.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DXwz27dr0-wC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Webster's English-Pinyin-Chinese Dictionary, Level One for Beginners Using Traditional Characters: Easy-To-Read Edition for Everyday Practical Use","description":"Provides Chinese words and phrases that are useful in everyday life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QiebCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dwarf Cichlids: Keeping and Breeding Them in Captivity","description":"Cichilds are beautiful and intelligent, but they can also be destructive and predatory.

Meticulously documented and theoretically innovative, this book illuminates the manifold factors economic, political, and social that determine the nature of the oil state, from the coherence of public bureaucracies, to the degree of centralization, to patterns of policy-making. Karl contends that oil countries, while seemingly disparate, are characterized by similar social classes and patterns of collective action. In these countries, dependence on petroleum leads to disproportionate fiscal reliance on petrodollars and public spending, at the expense of statecraft. Oil booms, which create the illusion of prosperity and development, actually destabilize regimes by reinforcing oil-based interests and further weakening state capacity. Karl's incisive investigation unites structural and choice-based approaches by illuminating how decisions of policymakers are embedded in institutions interacting with domestic and international markets. This approach which Karl dubs \\"structured contingency\\" uses a state's leading sector as the starting point for identifying a range of decision-making choices, and ends by examining the dynamics of the state itself.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VaQwDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Paradox+of+Plenty:+Oil+Booms+and+Petro-States+(Studies+in+International+Political+Economy)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Have Mercy!

Those who worry about personal privacy and identity--especially in this day of technologies that encroach upon these rights--still use Orwell's \\"Big Brother\\" language to discuss privacy issues. But the reality is that the age of a monolithic Big Brother is over. And yet the threats are perhaps even more likely to destroy the rights we've assumed were ours.Database Nation: The Death of Privacy in the 21st Century shows how, in these early years of the 21st century, advances in technology endanger our privacy in ways never before imagined. Direct marketers and retailers track our every purchase; surveillance cameras observe our movements; mobile phones will soon report our location to those who want to track us; government eavesdroppers listen in on private communications; misused medical records turn our bodies and our histories against us; and linked databases assemble detailed consumer profiles used to predict and influence our behavior. Privacy--the most basic of our civil rights--is in grave peril.Simson Garfinkel--journalist, entrepreneur, and international authority on computer security--has devoted his career to testing new technologies and warning about their implications. This newly revised update of the popular hardcover edition of Database Nation is his compelling account of how invasive technologies will affect our lives in the coming years. It's a timely, far-reaching, entertaining, and thought-provoking look at the serious threats to privacy facing us today. The book poses a disturbing question: how can we protect our basic rights to privacy, identity, and autonomy when technology is making invasion and control easier than ever before?Garfinkel's captivating blend of journalism, storytelling, and futurism is a call to arms. It will frighten, entertain, and ultimately convince us that we must take action now to protect our privacy and identity before it's too late.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Mji4KPEqV3AC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Transformations in Slavery: A History of Slavery in Africa (African Studies)","description":"This history of African slavery from the fifteenth to the early twentieth centuries examines how indigenous African slavery developed within an international context. Paul E. Lovejoy discusses the medieval Islamic slave trade and the Atlantic trade as well as the enslavement process and the marketing of slaves. He considers the impact of European abolition and assesses slavery's role in African history. The book corrects the accepted interpretation that African slavery was mild and resulted in the slaves' assimilation. Instead, slaves were used extensively in production, although the exploitation methods and the relationships to world markets differed from those in the Americas. Nevertheless, slavery in Africa, like slavery in the Americas, developed from its position on the periphery of capitalist Europe. This new edition revises all statistical material on the slave trade demography and incorporates recent research and an updated bibliography.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dXVFnHqhLvcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Zero Administration for Windows (Windows Series)","description":"Saying that most network administrators will find the scenarios in the Zero Administration Kit usable in their unmodified state, Zacker shows how to adapt its techniques to an existing network environment.

Matthew Levinger challenges the conventional notion that Prussia lagged behind Western Europe in its political development, demonstrating that Prussian leaders embraced a distinctive program of political modernization in response to their country's defeat by Napoleon in 1806-1807. Building on the eighteenth-century tradition of enlightened absolutism, Prussian leaders attempted to unite a rationalized monarchy with a politically active \\"nation,\\" thus mobilizing the populace to resist the French oppressors. The new culture of \\"enlightened nationalism\\" influenced the political theory and program of both liberals and conservatives in nineteenth-century Prussia. The book has important implications for understanding both subsequent German history and the history of nationalism in general. The author shows that the so-called authoritarian tendencies in Prussia's political culture resulted from its distinctive response to the challenges of the French Revolution and Napoleonic era, rather than from the persistence of premodern cultural or socioeconomic patterns. Likewise, by showing how nationalist activists drew on the cultural legacy of the Enlightenment, Levinger demonstrates that German nationalism cannot be understood as a uniquely pathological political phenomenon. Inspired by recent work exploring the role of discourse in historical change, the book analyzes how the word \\"nation\\" functioned in day-to-day debates and how this limited and shaped political options. Enlightened nationalism produced a mixed legacy: it promoted the reform of the education system, popular participation in local self-government, and administrative rationalization. But it also resulted in exaggerated fears of political dissent, reinforcing the authority of the monarchical state and inhibiting the formation of a vibrant system of parliamentary rule.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=PTmmU-6k_w8C&dq=Enlightened+Nationalism:+The+Transformation+of+Prussian+Political+Culture,+1806-1848&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Telling it like it is: Selected columns from the Saint Joseph telegraph","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=VGwRtwAACAAJ&dq=Telling+it+like+it+is:+Selected+columns+from+the+Saint+Joseph+telegraph&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"SWAN SONG : THE FORSYTE CHRONICLES 6.","description":"Jon Forsyte is back.

The tracks are faster. The cars, too. But the hunger for speed--and the hunt for the checkered flag--hasn't changed. Jodell Bob Lee has long since retired from driving, but the love of the sport is still like a fire in his belly. When he spots a talented young driver he can't help remembering his own glory days.

Jodell has an idea: his old friend and former \\"wrench,\\" Billy Winton, has put together a racing team, but so far wins have been hard to come by.

But the Kid has a few obstacles in the way, namely Dale Earnhart, Jr., Adam Petty, Casey Atwood, and the other young guns who are clearly stock car racing's next wave of stars.

Theatre is a primal language that used to be spoken by everyone; everyone included the \\"living community\\". Weaving together Systems Theory and the groundbreaking work of Fritjof Capra , Theatre of the Oppressed and the revolutionary work of Augusto Boal , and his own 25 years of practical experience in community-based popular theatre, David Diamond creates a silo-busting book that embraces the complexity of real life. Some of the questions Theatre for Living asks and attempts to answer: From a perspective of biology and sociology, how is a community a living thing? How do we design a theatre practice to consciously work with living communities to help them tell their stories? How do we accomplish this without demonizing those characters with whom we disagree? Must we constantly do battle to defeat an endless stream of oppressors, or can we imagine a world in which we stop creating them? Why is this important? What should we be on the look-out for (both positive and negative) when doing this work? What practical games and exercises can we use to awaken group consciousness? Who will be interested in Theatre for Living? Artists; community development workers; educators; activists; people working in social services, mediation and conflict resolution; health care professionals; anyone with an interest in finding new ways to approach the intersection of culture and social justice. \\"I greatly admire the achievements of David Diamond and his Headlines Theatre. He is following his own path, doing extraordinary and groundbreaking work in several fields, like his work with many First Nations communities in Canada and the US, and his adaptation of Forum Theatre on TV and on the Internet. This book relates the experiences of his life in theatre. For what he has already done, is doing, and certainly will do, David Diamond deserves all our support.\\" Augusto Boal, founder of Theatre of the Oppressed, author of Theatre of the Oppressed, Rainbow of Desire, and Legislative Theatre David Diamond's work has been an inspiration to performers, artists, community leaders throughout Canada and beyond. The ideas in Theatre for Living are large, daring, challenging; but the steps by which Diamond follows and implements the ideas are precise and accessible. As I read I found myself being taken further and further into the life that is both theatre and the making of theatre, which is to say I was led into how life can be given its meaning.

But how did this club-footed son of a factory worker rise from obscurity to become Hitler s malevolent minister of propaganda, most trusted lieutenant and personally anointed successor? In this definitive one-volume biography, renowned German Holocaust historian Peter Longerich sifts through the historical record  and thirty thousand pages of Goebbels s own diary entries  to answer that question. Longerich paints a chilling picture of a man driven by a narcissistic desire for recognition who found the personal affirmation he craved within the virulently racist National Socialist movement  and whose lifelong search for a charismatic father figure inexorably led him to Hitler. This comprehensive biography documents Goebbels  ascent through the ranks of the Nazi Party, where he became a member of the F hrer s inner circle and launched a brutal campaign of anti-Semitic propaganda. Goebbels delivers fresh and important insight into how the Nazi message of hate was conceived, nurtured, and disseminated, and shreds the myth of Goebbels  own genius for propaganda. It also reveals a man dogged by insecurities and  though endowed with near-dictatorial control of the media  beset by bureaucratic infighting. And, as never before, Longerich exposes Goebbels s twisted personal life  his mawkish sentimentality, manipulative nature, and voracious sexual appetite. This complete portrait of the man behind Hitler s message is sure to become a standard for historians and students of the Holocaust for decades to come.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dbSBBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Metahistory: The historical imagination in nineteenth-century Europe","description":"In White's view, beyond the surface level of the historical text, there is a deep structural, or latent, content that is generally poetic and specifically linguistic in nature.

Each essay and conversation is followed by a list of suggestions for further reading. Written for the non specialist, Five Voices Five Faiths is an accessible book in which neighbors honor both our differences and our common bonds. Some may say that my only obligation to other non-Christian believers is to preach the good news of God in Christ Jesus. They may also believe that participating in interfaith dialogue and relationship, by the very nature of the task, causes me to disobey the gospel mandate to go into the world and make disciples of all people. I understand the position, and for much of my life subscribed to it. But today, as a middle-aged woman, with grown children and aging parents, another line from the Christian gospels compels me. Today, I reflect more deeply on the new commandment Jesus gave, to love one another as he has loved us. In order to be obedient to that commandment, I understand myself to be required to participate in conversations in which I am not afforded the last word or the luxury of full agreement, compliance, or conversion. This love requires that I involve myself in the lives of others, even when my most basic human instinct is to run, to hide, and to avoid the unfamiliar. The love that Jesus commands of me requires that I, as he has done before me, kindle and engender deep relationships with those others: the outcast, the unfamiliar, the different, and the very ones that we presume constitute the greatest threat to our institutional and cultural norms. from the Introduction, by Amanda Millay Hughes\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=TcmuXcqZoLQC&dq=Five+Voices+Five+Faiths:+An+Interfaith+Primer&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Apache Server Commentary: Guide to Insider's Knowledge on Apache Server Code","description":"Table of contents","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=tUYo644-SYcC&dq=Apache+Server+Commentary:+Guide+to+Insider%27s+Knowledge+on+Apache+Server+Code&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Endangered Pleasures In Defense of Naps, Bacon, Martinis, Profanity, and Other Indulgences","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Screenwriting For Dummies","description":"Suspend your disbelief you can make it as a screenwriter Behind every blockbuster film and binge-worthy show, there s a screenwriter and that writer could be you!

Then the Internet rewrote it with a little something called TCP/IP. Now Novell networking authority Drew Heywood has literally written the book on how network administrators like you can maintain a smoothly running internal network while taking advantage of the universality of the Internet's TCP/IP protocol. Novell's Guide to TCP/IP and IntranetWare helps you make a successful transition from NetWare 3 and 4 to TCP/IP   la IntranetWare. Even if you've been blissfully oblivious to the nuts and bolts of protocols like IPX -- let alone TCP/IP -- you'll soon have a solid understanding of how they work and how to configure all kinds of clients, servers, and routers. Heywood offers practical, in-depth coverage of essential NetWare TCP/IP topics, including * A layer-by-layer description of the TCP/IP protocol stack -- from the network access layer to the process/application layer * Implementing TCP/IP on NetWare servers and clients * Setting up the domain host configuration protocol * Managing NetWare TCP/IP and name services * Bridging between NetWare and UNIX * Creating and administering FTP and World Wide Web servers Plus, the bonus CD-ROM included with Novell's Guide to TCP/IP and IntranetWare features exclusive software from Novell: The IntranetWare Client Suite for Windows NT, Windows 95, DOS/Win 3.x, OS/2, and Mac OS.

This act brought to an end American military presence in the Philippines that extended back over 90 years. It also represented the final act in a drama that began with the initial rumblings in April of that year of the Mount Pinatubo volcano, located about 9 miles to the east of Clark. The following pages tell the remarkable story of the men and women of the Clark community and their ordeal in planning for and carrying out their evacuation from Clark in the face of impending volcanic activity. It documents the actions of those who remained on the base during a series of eruptions, and the packing out of the base during subsequent months. This is the story of the \\"Ash Warriors,\\" those Air Force men and women who carried out their mission in the face of an incredible series of natural disasters, including volcanic eruption, flood, typhoons, and earthquakes, all of which plagued Clark and the surrounding areas during June and July 1991. The author of \\"The Ash Warriors\\" knew the situation first hand. Colonel Dick Anderegg was the vice commander of the 3rd Tactical Fighter Wing when the volcano erupted, and he was at Clark throughout the evacuation and standing down of the base. He brought his own personal experience to bear in writing this story. He also conducted extensive research in the archives of the Pacific Air Forces and Thirteenth Air Force, utilized scores of interviews of those who witnessed and participated in the events, and visited Clark in 1998 to see in person how the installation had changed in the 8 years since the Americans left. This story is one of courage, resourcefulness, and dedication to duty on the part of Air Force men and women called upon to respond to one of the great natural disasters of the 20th Century. As the following pages reveal, the Ash Warriors were up to the challenge in every respect.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=RGvxjbWok4IC&dq=The+Ash+Warriors&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Internet Performance Survival Guide: QoS Strategies for Multiservice Networks","description":"\\"A critical guide through the tangled thicket of hype, assumptions, and facts about Quality of Service in IP Networks.\\" - Scott Bradner, Senior Consultant at Harvard and Transport Area Director, IETF The next wave of Internet services will include voice and video as well as data.

The most visible of these migrants have been the male industrial workers who labored on the city's automobile assembly lines. African American women have largely been absent from traditional narratives of the Great Migration because they were excluded from industrial work. By placing these women at the center of her study, Victoria Wolcott reveals their vital role in shaping life in interwar Detroit. Wolcott takes us into the speakeasies, settlement houses, blues clubs, storefront churches, employment bureaus, and training centers of Prohibition- and depression-era Detroit. There, she explores the wide range of black women's experiences, focusing particularly on the interactions between working- and middle-class women. As Detroit's black population grew exponentially, women not only served as models of bourgeois respectability, but also began to reshape traditional standards of deportment in response to the new realities of their lives. In so doing, Wolcott says, they helped transform black politics and culture. Eventually, as the depression arrived, female respectability as a central symbol of reform was supplanted by a more strident working-class activism.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=Vgoz-fwV3ugC&dq=Remaking+Respectability:+African+American+Women+in+Interwar+Detroit&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"X-Men Mutant Empire","description":"Bringing the classic X-Men: Mutant Empire trilogy back into print in a brand-new omnibus.

Branwell Bronte?--brother of Charlotte, Emily, and Anne has a childhood marked by tragedy and the weight of expectations. After the early deaths of his mother and a beloved older sister, he is kept away from school and tutored at home by his father, a curate, who rests all his ambitions for his children on his only son. Branwell grows up isolated in his family s parsonage on the moors, learning Latin and Greek, being trained in painting, and collaborating on endless stories and poems with his sisters. Yet while his sisters go on to write Wuthering Heights, Jane Eyre, and Agnes Grey, Branwell wanders from job to job, growing increasingly dependent on alcohol and opium and failing to become a great poet or artist. With rich, suggestive sentences  perfectly fitted to this famously imaginative, headstrong family  (Publishers Weekly), Branwell is a portrait of childhood dreams, thwarted desire, the confinements of gender and an homage to the landscape and milieu that inspired some of the most revolutionary works of English literature.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m9wREAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"5-Minute Math Problem of the Day: 250 Fun, Multi-Step Problems That Sharpen Math Reasoning, Number Sense, and Computation Skills","description":"The world lies devastated after the massive oil crisis that was described in LAST LIGHT.

At the centre of the story are the intersecting fortunes of two men, who at first glance seem almost complete opposites: Ewen Cameron, a young Highland laird in the service of the Prince, is dashing, sincere, and idealistic, while Major Keith Windham, a professional soldier in the opposing English army, is cynical, world-weary, and profoundly lonely. When a second-sighted Highlander tells Ewen that the flight of a heron will lead to five meetings with an Englishman who is fated both to do him a great service and to cause him great grief, Ewen refuses to believe it. But as Bonnie Prince Charlie s ill-fated campaign winds to its bitter end, the prophecy is proven true and through many dangers and trials, Ewen and Keith find that they have one thing indisputably in common: both of them are willing to sacrifice everything for honour s sake... Twice adapted for BBC Radio (1944 and 1959) and made into a TV serial by Scottish Television (1968) and the BBC (1976), this is the unmissable best-seller that first catapulted author D. K.

After school and at night, mostly on the threshold of adolescence, they eagerly mix with fascinating visitors from the edge of town who carry the seeds of Calcutta's legendary social unrest. Their political activity takes place in the carnival atmosphere of the city's streets and markets, until a bloody political clash turns them into adults before their time. While they inevitably grow up and grow apart, their lives remain inextricably linked by the carnage and cover-up they were powerless to do anything but witness. Rude, a young rebel with a cause, keeps a diary that is confiscated by a corrupt anti-terrorist police officer. Twenty years later, Nina, who might have loved Rude, decides at all costs to recover the diary and the history that was stolen from them. Set mainly in Calcutta, Houston, and briefly in Montreal, this novel intertwines humour and despair until the human condition is laid bare and recovery is finally complete.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=xPEDAAAACAAJ&dq=Recovering+Rude&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Windows 2000 Systems Programming Black Book: The Only Reference Needed to Successfully Deploy Applications Within the Windows NT Operating System!","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hCQMreNY2voC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Out of Control (Defender (Americana))","description":"The American cinema of terrorism, although coming to prominence primarily in the 1970s amidst high-profile Palestinian terrorist activity, actually dates back to the beginnings of the Cold War. But this early terrorist cinema was centered largely around the Bomb who had it, who would use it, when and differs greatly from the terrorist cinema that would follow. Changing world events soon broadened the cinema of terrorism to address emerging international conflicts, including Black September, pre9/11 Middle Eastern conflicts, and the post9/11  War on Terror.  This analytical filmography of American terrorist films establishes terrorist cinema as a unique subgenre with distinct thematic narrative and stylistic trends. It covers all major American films dealing with terrorism, from Otto Preminger s Exodus (1960) to Ridley Scott s Body of Lies (2008).","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nV4BvL8AqEwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Matthew, Vol.2 (Ch. 13-28), The Expositor's Bible Commentary","description":"We find ourselves in an hour that requires great spiritual preparation for the unique dynamics that are still ahead for the church, Israel, and the world as it is and will be. I am thankful for any and every resource that gives courage to godly men and women to see where the world is going and embrace the unique role that the church serves this generation. Therefore, I am thankful for Richard Tow and his timely service to the body of Christ in laboring to produce this important book. A generation of believers, young and old, are searching for biblical truth with depth on the subject of the return of Jesus because of the recent escalation of trouble and darkness. I highly recommend that Richard s book be a priority for any searching for a clearer sense of the  why behind the what  of the timing of the Tribulation that precedes the Lord s return. David Sliker President, International House of Prayer University My friend and fellow minister for many years, Richard Tow has written a must-read book if you are interested in eschatology. His comprehensive, scholarly, non-dogmatic research of Scripture, and the positions held on the Tribulation and the Rapture of the church, leave it up to the individual reader to decide for him or herself which view to espouse.

First published in French in 1948, the book overturns the then commonly held view that the Jewish and Christian communities gradually ceased to interact and that the Jews gave up proselytizing among the gentiles. On the contrary, Simon maintains that Judaism continued to make its influence felt on the world at large and to be influenced by it in turn. He analyses both the antagonisms and the attractions between the two faiths, and concludes with a discussion of the eventual disappearance of Judaism as a missionary religion. The rival community triumphed with the help of a Christian imperial authority and a doctrine well adapted to the Graeco-Roman mentality.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=um1vEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Baltimore Bride's Quilt Designs (Dover Pictorial Archives)","description":"Rich selection of 81 authentic, expertly rendered album quilt designs, mostly florals, known as Baltimore Bride's designs.

In Cross Purposes, Anthony Bartlett claims that the key Western doctrines of atonement have been dominated by a logic of violence and sacrifice as a means of salvation. Subsequently, the graphic suffering of the crucified in images and narrative has served to unleash a prolonged sacrificial crisis in which there is always a potential need to displace blame. These doctrines of atonement have sanctioned wide-spread violence in the name of Christ throughout history. But Bartlett argues that a minority tradition also exists. He contends that the tradition of the compassion of Christ provides the possible way out of Christian violence. Bartlett's study gives this tradition a dynamic new reading, showing how it undoes both divine and human violence and offers a powerfully transformative version of atonement for the contemporary world. Cross Purposes provides a rich historical and theological overview of the evolution of various atonement theories, using literature, art, and philosophy to provide a creative and provocative reading of Christian atonement. Anthony Bartlett is engaged in post-doctoral research and is an instructor in Religion at Syracuse University.

With her distinctive psychological acumen, she argues that Shakespeare s play frames the uneasy relationship between Christian and Jew specifically in familial terms in order to recapitulate the vexed familial relationship between Christianity and Judaism. Adelman locates the promise or threat of Jewish conversion as a particular site of tension in the play. Drawing on a variety of cultural materials, she demonstrates that, despite the triumph of its Christians, The Merchant of Venice reflects Christian anxiety and guilt about its simultaneous dependence on and disavowal of Judaism. In this startling psycho-theological analysis, both the insistence that Shylock s daughter Jessica remain racially bound to her father after her conversion and the depiction of Shylock as a bloody-minded monster are understood as antidotes to Christian uneasiness about a Judaism it can neither own nor disown. In taking seriously the religious discourse of The Merchant of Venice, Adelman offers in Blood Relations an indispensable book on the play and on the fascinating question of Jews and Judaism in Renaissance England and beyond.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=NDUMwfePuQEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ideas Behind the Chess Openings","description":"Not a list of moves, but simple and logical explanations of opening systems.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=c61mna53jdwC&dq=Ideas+Behind+the+Chess+Openings&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Sing to the Dawn","description":"No Marketing Blurb","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_pphk3Yk4SoC&dq=Sing+to+the+Dawn&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Whene'er You Make a Promise: A Paper Doll History of the Girl Scout Uniform, Volume Two","description":"A welcome new edition of a standard unavailable for nearly a decadeIn more than nine decades of Girl Scouting, a vast popular and material culture has given rise to a wealth of Girl Scout history collections.

But, as Richard Gillman maintains in the introduction to this volume, poetry was the driving force behind these other special skills and interests. Humphries was, Gillman writes, an example of \\"the total poet. . . . If ever there were poets who did in fact breathe their art, he was one of them.\\" These letters for the first time illumine Humphries and his achievements. We see him as the mentor to younger poets including Theodore Roethke, providing rare glimpses of poetics and the creative process; the teacher so charmed by horseracing he sometimes \\"put an exam on the blackboard . . . and then bugged out for the track\\"; the \\"literary terrorist\\" whose criticism Robert Frost never forgot and probably never forgave him for; the translator whose Aeneid prompted W. H. Auden to call it \\"a service for which no public reward could be too great\\"; the author of an introduction to Ezra Pound's poems who demanded that a reference to his anti-Semitism be deleted. And so on and on, in all of Humphries' surprising variety and unfailing candor. Active in America's literary community, Humphries was a friend of many poets and writers, including Louise Bogan, Edmund Wilson, and Roethke. This volume takes on added meaning by completing the published account of the relationships of these four as already told by Roethke, Bogan, and, to a lesser extent, Wilson. Poets, Poetics, and Politics is set in a period that opened just two years before the birth of Harriet Monroe's Poetry; when it closed, most of the twentieth century's literary giants had died. Also in this time, many writers, Humphries included, dreamed the dreams of communism; his letters on this subject are both informative and absorbing.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=jXewAAAAIAAJ&dq=Poets,+Poetics,+and+Politics:+America%27s+Literary+Community+Viewed+from+the+Letters+of+Rolfe+Humphries,+1910-1969&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gustav Mahler: With a Biographical Essay","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=_cZIswEACAAJ&dq=Gustav+Mahler:+With+a+Biographical+Essay&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Vital Spark, The","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=d3-FoAEACAAJ&dq=Vital+Spark,+The&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"decking the halls: The folklore and traditions of christmas plants","description":"Traces the culture, legends, and symbolism of traditional Christmas foliage, including holly, ivy, mistletoe, rosemary, and yule logs.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=mSvgAAAAMAAJ&dq=decking+the+halls:+The+folklore+and+traditions+of+christmas+plants&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Great Naval Disasters: U.S. Naval Accidents in the 20th Century","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=uRyEvvjRUx8C&dq=Great+Naval+Disasters:+U.S.+Naval+Accidents+in+the+20th+Century&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pfizer Atlas of Veterinary Clinical Parsitology","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=pKfJPQAACAAJ&dq=Pfizer+Atlas+of+Veterinary+Clinical+Parsitology&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Panoramas of English Villages","description":"Nothing in the 20th century seems to portray age-old values as powerfully as the village.

This develops understanding of offenders' behaviour that can be harnessed to improve investigations. In this rapidly developing area much has been learnt about what offenders reveal about themselves through their styles of offending. Beyond criminals  actions the location of their crimes can also reveal where the offender lives or which offences can be linked as part of the same series. Investigative psychologists also explore how to interview witnesses and suspects and assess the veracity of accounts given. The variation in criminal style across crimes as diverse as arson, burglary, hostage negotiation, serial killing and sexual assault is reviewed, using narrative theory and criminals  emotional experience when offending as the basis for explaining these variations. This provides a framework for drawing inferences about offenders' characteristics. Studies in investigative psychology require a special methodology, developed by David Canter to allow scientific explorations in such a challenging field, previously assumed not to be open empirical study. The practical potential and applications of the research are given, as well as a selection of commentaries on the cutting edge debates that are driving the future of the investigative psychology. This new discipline is of relevance to forensic psychologists in many different settings, criminologists and law enforcement agencies, bringing together work that lays out current achievements and sets the agenda for future research in the field.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8AUHDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Best Plays Theater Yearbook 2003-2004","description":"Covers plays produced in New York, awards, details of productions, prizes, people, and publications, as well as the editors' choices of the ten best plays.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=kz6UzQEACAAJ&dq=The+Best+Plays+Theater+Yearbook+2003-2004&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Getting Older, Growing Wiser","description":"We are all aging.

Nevertheless, the epoch marked a great cultural shift in sensibilities, the dawn of a new age in which classical Greek and Roman values were \\"reborn\\" and human values in all fields, from the arts to civic life, were reaffirmed. With this volume, Eugenio Garin, a leading Renaissance scholar, has gathered the work of an international team of scholars into an accessible account of the people who animated this decisive moment in the genesis of the modern mind. We are offered a broad spectrum of figures, major and minor, as they lived their lives: the prince and the military commander, the cardinal and the courtier, the artist and the philosopher, the merchant and the banker, the voyager, and women of all classes. With its concentration on the concrete, the specific, even the anecdotal, the volume offers a wealth of new perspectives and ideas for study.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=3rbqLymYSOQC&dq=Renaissance+Characters&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Walk of Fame","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=AAE_pwAACAAJ&dq=Walk+of+Fame&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Data Analysis and Graphics Using R: An Example-based Approach (Cambridge Series in Statistical and Probabilistic Mathematics)","description":"Discover what you can do with R!

But what of the rest of their generation, the thousands of other free blacks in the North? Patrick Rael explores the tradition of protest and sense of racial identity forged by both famous and lesser-known black leaders in antebellum America and illuminates the ideas that united these activists across a wide array of divisions. In so doing, he reveals the roots of the arguments that still resound in the struggle for justice today. Mining sources that include newspapers and pamphlets of the black national press, speeches and sermons, slave narratives and personal memoirs, Rael recovers the voices of an extraordinary range of black leaders in the first half of the nineteenth century. He traces how these activists constructed a black American identity through their participation in the discourse of the public sphere and how this identity in turn informed their critiques of a nation predicated on freedom but devoted to white supremacy. His analysis explains how their place in the industrializing, urbanizing antebellum North offered black leaders a unique opportunity to smooth over class and other tensions among themselves and successfully galvanize the race against slavery.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=CZRBpRJzR9QC&dq=Black+Identity+and+Black+Protest+in+the+Antebellum+North&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How I Helped My Grandma Rose","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=H7E1AgAACAAJ&dq=How+I+Helped+My+Grandma+Rose&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The history of Buddhist thought, ([The History of civilization.

Hutchens. The proof of that is in her powerful re-creation of pioneer days in the Sandhills of northwestern Nebraska in these autobiographical pieces written between 1929 and 1965. Those who have not read her classic Old Jules (1935) will find Sandhill Sundays and Other Recollections a colorful introduction to Sandoz Country, and those who have will look for the same landmarks and unforgettable people. They include the Sandoz patriarch, the fiery libertarian Old Jules; Marlizzie, the archetypal pioneer woman who was Mari's mother; siblings, chums, neighbors, homesteaders, and Indians, all individualized and defined by a harsh and lonely frontier. Dangers in every form?blizzards, fires, rattlesnakes, murderous men?are described, and, just as vividly, so are the pleasures afforded by country cooking, storytelling, pet animals, and the first phonograph for miles around. Even when she strays, as in the final piece, \\"Outpost in New York,\\" Mari Sandoz never leaves the Sandhills in spirit.

The Republic's Law Reform Act of 1993 was the result of a campaign which established an age of consent equal with heterosexuals, and, by default, a recognition by the state of a lesbian presence in Ireland. More recently the inclusion of sexual orientation in the Unfair Dismissals Act guarantees rights for lesbian and gay workers. Abroad ILGO's fight to march in the St Patrick's Day Parade in New York City forced worldwide attention on a redefinition of Irishness, while at home, President Robinson welcomed lesbians and gays into the Arus for the first time. These events have resulted in a lively public discussion of lesbian and gay issues in Ireland. In this volume we present a range of voices of those who have been at the centre of the changes that have occurred for Irish lesbians and gays. The writers engage in a process of reflection on their work, their involvement in the lesbian and gay community, and their envisioning of a future Ireland.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=rciGAAAAIAAJ&dq=Lesbian+and+Gay+Visions+of+Ireland:+Towards+the+Twenty-First+Century+(Lesbian+and+Gay+Studies)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"At the Edge of the Light: Thoughts on Photography and Photographers, on Talent and Genius","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=5Gg9zwEACAAJ&dq=At+the+Edge+of+the+Light:+Thoughts+on+Photography+and+Photographers,+on+Talent+and+Genius&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Golden Rider","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=KfYePQAACAAJ&dq=The+Golden+Rider&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Genesis and Evolution","description":"Genesis: The Evolution of Biology presents a history of the past two centuries of biology, suitable for use in courses, but of interest more broadly to evolutionary biologists, geneticists, and biomedical scientists, as well as general readers interested in the history of science. The book covers the early evolutionary biologists-Lamarck, Cuvier, Darwin and Wallace through Mayr and the neodarwinian synthesis, in much the same way as other histories of evolution have done, bringing in also the social implications, the struggles with our religious understanding, and the interweaving of genetics into evolutionary theory. What is novel about Sapp's account is a real integration of the cytological tradition, from Schwann, Boveri, and the other early cell biologists and embryologists, and the coverage of symbiosis, microbial evolutionary phylogenies, and the new understanding of the diversification of life coming from comparative analyses of complete microbial genomes. The book is a history of theories about evolution, genes and organisms from Lamarck and Darwin to the present day. This is the first book on the general history of evolutionary biology to include the history of research and theories about symbiosis in evolution, and first to include research on microbial evolution which were excluded from the classical neo-Darwinian synthesis.

Writing secure .NET code requires three things: an understanding of the .NET code security system, attention to detail, and the ability to think from the point of view of an attacker. Many security vulnerabilities in fact have little to do with the security system but rather are a result of treating hostile input as non-hostile. This book is a practical reference of the .NET security framework, and demonstrates best practices that will go a long way towards making your code secure in the face of attacks.

The plot centres around the romantic fortunes of young sisters Lily and Bell Dale, who live with their widowed mother in the Small House at Allington thanks to the generosity of their uncle, Squire Dale. Packed with tangled romances and moral dilemmas, this is classic Trollope. In  The Small House at Allington  we are also introduced to some of the most popular recurring Trollope characters, including Lady Glencora and Plantagenet Palliser. Anthony Trollope (1815  1882) was a Victorian writer and author of 47 novels. He also wrote an autobiography, short stories and plays, travel articles, reviews and lectures. A prolific writer, he made no secret of the fact that money was his motivation for writing  an admission which raised eyebrows among his literary contemporaries at the time. The amount of works Trollope authored are testament to his belief in hard work. His first successful novel was The Warden followed by its sequel, Barchester Towers. The Chronicles of Barsetshire are perhaps his most well-known series of novels, though many of his works have been adapted for TV and radio, starring many familiar faces such as Alan Rickman, David Tennant, Bill Nighy and Tom Hollander. Alongside his literary career, Trollope also worked for some time for the Post Office and is credited with the introduction of the iconic post box to Britain. A memorial to Anthony Trollope was unveiled in Poets  Corner in Westminster Abbey in 1993.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ivk3EAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Oxford Color German Dictionary Plus","description":"This is a brand new edition of the Oxford Colour German Dictionary Plus.

Nights uninterrupted by email? Days to pursue set-aside dreams? Do you promise yourself that  someday  you will get a break? Mary Lou Quinlan had those  someday  thoughts. But her hard-earned job as CEO of a New York advertising agency claimed most of her waking hours. Exhausted and losing motivation, she was so desperate she perversely imagined breaking her leg to get some time alone. Then, she declared a brief timeout. During her time off, she slept late, took walks, danced the salsa, kept a journal and ultimately, uncovered the roots of a new business. In the process, she rediscovered herself. Time Off for Good Behavior is the result of listening to women like her, who realized enough was enough. Quinlan tells no-holds-barred stories of dozens of women who sacrificed their health, relationships, their good humor and a good night s sleep until they found the courage to ask themselves if they were happy with the life they were living and made the decisions to take life-saving breaks. Mary Lou Quinlan explores the factors that compel you to work so hard and examines how to take back control of your life. She explores our unwillingness to give ourselves permission to rest so that we can re-imagine our futures. And she shows the powerful, self-fulfilling changes that can occur when we do decide to take that rest. Whether you contemplate leaving a career that took years to build or just need a long vacation to assess what you want next, you ll find practical tools and bolstering advice throughout. Each chapter ends with provocative questions to help you plan your good behavior reprieve. Specific exercises on financial planning, advice for negotiating time off, and tools to uncover your passions make this a must-read for women who are ready for  someday.  Time off for Good Behavior ultimately shows that stepping away from everything even for a short while often means ending up with so much more.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ug9YCEhvPt4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Black Panther Party [Reconsidered]","description":"Featuring never-before-published essays by former Panther members and Panther scholars, a collection of articles examines the black revolutionaries' organizational dynamics, treatment of women, and controversial legacy.

From launching points in newly acquired Poland, in three prongs North, Central, South German forces stormed western Russia, virtually from the Baltic to the Black Sea. By late fall, the invasion had foundered against Russian weather, terrain, and resistance, and by December, it had failed at the gates of Moscow, but early on, as the Germans sliced through Russian territory and soldiers with impunity, capturing hundreds of thousands, it seemed as though Russia would fall. In the spirit of Martin Middlebrook s classic First Day on the Somme, Craig Luther narrates the events of June 22, 1941, a day when German military might was at its peak and seemed as though it would easily conquer the Soviet Union, a day the common soldiers would remember for its tension and the frogs bellowing in the Polish marshlands. It was a day when the German blitzkrieg decimated Soviet command and control within hours and seemed like nothing would stop it from taking Moscow. Luther narrates June 22 one of the pivotal days of World War II from high command down to the tanks and soldiers at the sharp end, covering strategy as well as tactics and the vivid personal stories of the men who crossed the border into the Soviet Union that fateful day, which is the Eastern Front in microcosm, representing the years of industrial-scale warfare that followed and the unremitting hostility of Germans and Soviets.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=7KVoDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mastering Java 2","description":"The 1.4 version of Java 2 Standard Edition provides many new programming capabilities while making plenty of old tasks easier.

In the name of diversity, many leading academic and cultural institutions are working to silence dissent and stifle intellectual life. This book exposes the real impact of multiculturalism on the institution most closely identified with the politically correct decline of higher education Stanford University. Authored by two Stanford graduates, this book is a compelling insider's tour of a world of speech codes,  dumbed-down  admissions standards and curricula, campus witch hunts, and anti-Western zealotry that masquerades as legitimate scholarly inquiry. Sacks and Thiel use numerous primary sources the Stanford Daily, class readings, official university publications to reveal a pattern of politicized classes, housing, budget priorities, and more. They trace the connections between such disparate trends as political correctness, the gender wars, Generation X nihilism, and culture wars, showing how these have played a role in shaping multiculturalism at institutions like Stanford. The authors convincingly show that multiculturalism is not about learning more; it is actually about learning less. They end their comprehensive study by detailing the changes necessary to reverse the tragic disintegration of American universities and restore true academic excellence.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FXglAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Diversity+Myth&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Complete Idiots Guide to Conquering Fear and Anxiety - 1999 publication.","description":"Learn how to recognize and destroy barriers to authentic love.

It has greatly stimulated research in many sciences and given rise to the vast new area variously called applied dynamics, nonlinear science, or chaos theory. This introduction for senior undergraduate and beginning graduate students of mathematics, physics, and engineering combines mathematical rigor with copious examples of important applications. It covers the central topological and probabilistic notions in dynamics ranging from Newtonian mechanics to coding theory. Readers need not be familiar with manifolds or measure theory; the only prerequisite is a basic undergraduate analysis course. The authors begin by describing the wide array of scientific and mathematical questions that dynamics can address. They then use a progression of examples to present the concepts and tools for describing asymptotic behavior in dynamical systems, gradually increasing the level of complexity. The final chapters introduce modern developments and applications of dynamics. Subjects include contractions, logistic maps, equidistribution, symbolic dynamics, mechanics, hyperbolic dynamics, strange attractors, twist maps, and KAM-theory.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TcfLCgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"JavaScript Objects","description":"The authors teach object oriented programming using a simple, accessible scripting language, while giving the reader many cool JavaScript apps at the same time.

From the outset it was mired in disrepute. Cleland penned the novel to liberate himself from debtors  prison, and the book s manifestly lewd content led to its legal suppression within a year of publication. Though versions of the novel, nearly always abridged in some form, continued to find a way into print, the Memoirs remained an underground text until the 1960s. Only as that decade ushered in a culture less socially deferential and more sexually permissive was the moment opportune for the obscenity ban to be successfully challenged. Cleland s novel is a triumph of literary style, resting on his invention of an entirely new, vividly metaphoric, terminology for describing sexual pleasure. This Broadview Edition provides extensive materials on Cleland s biography and career, contemporary censorship, and pornography and prostitution in the eighteenth century.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=NmFCDwAAQBAJ&dq=Memoirs+of+a+Woman+of+Pleasure&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Catch Salmon","description":"This book is a comprehensive guide to salmon fishing in tidal waters on the BC coast.

For the most part, Democrats and Republicans have put up a very poor quality of men before us to run for the President. The most important person in the 'Free World.' I wrote this book to show them a 'Third Party' woman or man could get elected when the American people get 'MAD' enough to throw them all out of office. Almost 50% of their wages are going for taxes to pay for their 'SOCIALISTS SCHEMES' and their 'ONE WORLD GOVERNMENT,' (they hope). Both husband and wife have to work while children are raising themselves. I have had it with the 'Co-Presidents' and their cronies and fellow traveling socialists in 'OUR WHITE HOUSE.' I'm mad as hell at the Democrats for knowingly putting this bunch in the White House. His reputation and speeches were known over the years. The excuse that 'they didn't know,' doesn't fly! The press has knowingly covered up for his and their socialist ideals over the years. Many living it up like he does. I am grateful to the Republicans who stood up to him and 'IMPEACHED' him. I am 'livid' that all of the Democratic senators and five cronies 'cowardly' let him 'SKATE' scott free! The Chinese have stolen many of our secrets over the years. The President knew yet he gave his OK for Lorale and Hughes Co. to sell 'VITAL INFORMATION FOR MILITARY USE ON THEIR MISSILES,' (pointed at us) in exchange for 'boodles' of money for the Presidents re-election. Are we talking 'TREASON' HERE? Mr. Hughes, a patriot, must be rolling over in his grave over the sell out of our country for money! President Clinton has become the 'FUHRER' of the Democrats and their fellow travelers who cover up for him. The so called 'Spinmisters' (liars). Read None Dare Call It Treason by John Stormer; The Naked Communist and The Naked Capitalist by W. Cleon Skousen and Mein Kampt by Alolf Hitler. They all document the plans to take over America way back in the twenties and in the Unions of that day. Just change the names in these books to see exactly what is going on now. 'WAKE UP AMERICANS, IT IS LATER THAN YOU THINK.' Bombard your Congress with 'TEA BAGS' and letters telling them you will join with other 'PATRIOTS' for another 'BOSTON TEA PARTY' and to vote them all out of office if they don't stand up for 'AMERICA FIRST' and our interest first! We have a President who ran to Russia to demonstrate against our military men in a shooting war and arrogantly burned 'OUR FLAG.' He now sends our wonderful military men and women all over the world in harm's way saying 'we might have some casualties but it is worth the risk!' (not his of course). No 'ground troops;' (more smoking mirrors). We have the Clintons running all over the world, throwing 'your' hard earned tax money at 'THEIR' problems. At home, Mr. President flies all over this country in his special plane raising 'boodles' of dollars for himself and the Democratic party. He makes all kinds of grandiose promises, (lies and smoking mirrors). As does Mrs. President. 'KINKY SEX' in or near 'OUR OVAL OFFICE.' This is apparently a life long pattern of 'ADULTERY, TWO RAPE CHARGES, LIES AND COVER-UPS, AND SECRET EXECUTIVE ORDERS BEHIND CONGRESS BACK.' When does he have the time to 'do business that the American public elected him to do?' 'WAKE UP AMERICANS,' THE HOUR IS LATER THAN YOU THINK. Thank you for reading my 'historical novel'...

Fusing the traditions of European painting with the distinct character of American abstraction, Scullys great achievement is the reinvigoration of abstract painting with the metaphorical, the philosophical and the sublime combined with the earthy tangibility of paint. From his precisely gridded works of the 1970s to the three-dimensional panels of the 1980s and his now celebrated Wall of Light paintings from the 1990s, this volume gathers the entire oeuvre of the artist, whose work is held in numerous public collections including The Metropolitan Museum of Art, MoMA, and Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, New York; The National Gallery of Art, the Corcoran Gallery of Art, and Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden, Washington, DC; Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, Fort Worth; and the Tate, London. Elected a Royal Academician in 2013, Scully has been shortlisted for the Turner Prize twice, in 1989 and in 1993.

From God's creation of Adam out of clay, to the narratives of priests and kings whose regulations governed bodily practices, the Hebrew Bible focuses on the human body. Moreover, ancient Israel's understanding of the human body has greatly influenced both Judaism and Christianity. Despite this pervasive influence, ancient Israel's view of the human body has rarely been studied and, until now, has been poorly understood. In this beautifully written book, Jon L. Berquist guides the reader through the Hebrew Bible, examining ancient Israel's ideas of the body, the unstable roles of gender, the deployment of sexuality, and the cultural practices of the time. Conducting his analysis with reference to contemporary theories of the body, power, and social control, Berquist offers not only a description and clarification of ancient Israelite views of the body, but also an analysis of how these views belong to the complex logic of ancient social meanings. When this logic is understood, the familiar Bible becomes strange and opens itself to a wide range of new interpretations.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=ZSEigoqDI10C&dq=Controlling+Corporeality:+The+Body+and+the+Household+in+Ancient+Israel&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Industrial Strength Java","description":"This reference is for the experienced Java programmer and teaches advanced Java concepts.

Although the raw enterprise and improvisation that characterized the American westward movement seem to have little to do with ritual, Douglas Comer argues that the fort grew and prospered because of ritual and that ritual shaped the subsequent history of the region to an astonishing extent. At Bent's Old Fort, rituals of trade, feasting, gaming, marriage, secret societies, and war, as well as the \\"calcified ritual\\" provided by the fort itself, brought together and restructured Anglo, Hispanic, and American Indian cultures. Comer sheds new light on this heretofore poorly understood period in American history, building at the same time a powerfully convincing case to demonstrate that the human world is made through ritual. Comer gives his narrative an anthropological and philosophical framework; the events at Bent's Old Fort provide a compelling example not only of \\"world formation\\" but of a world's tragic collapse, culminating in the Sand Creek massacre. He also calls attention to the reconstructed Bent's Old Fort on the site of the original. Here visitors reenact history, staff work out personal identities, and groups lobby for special versions of history by ritual recasting of the past as the present.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=vKk8l_WRKzUC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The foundations of personality,","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=j2zYAAAAIAAJ&dq=The+foundations+of+personality,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mental acts (Studies in philosophical psychology)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=4M6CnQEACAAJ&dq=Mental+acts+(Studies+in+philosophical+psychology)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Coast of Nowhere: Meditations on Rivers, Lakes, and Streams (Great Lakes Books)","description":"In The Coast of Nowhere, Michael Delp explores the way rivers, lakes, and streams seep into our daily lives and into our consciousness. The organization of the text, a collection of short prose meditations and poetry, embraces the motion and rhythm of moving water. Through his poetry and prose, Delp demonstrates the way one can literally build an inner landscape out of the places of water one frequents. Having grown up on water and embraced it as a part of his being, he writes passionately about existing rivers, lakes, and streams in Michigan, and uses powerful metaphors to keep these places thriving in the imagination. The collection concludes with \\"What My Father Told Me\\", a powerful prose piece in which Delp reflects on the wisdom his father shared with him about the magic of water and of life during their fishing outings. Like Delp's other works, The Coast of Nowhere reveals the author's love for water and nature and captures the essence of northern Michigan's culture.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=fZzDSza5-ZMC&dq=The+Coast+of+Nowhere:+Meditations+on+Rivers,+Lakes,+and+Streams+(Great+Lakes+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Leave It to Beaver (G406)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=O-pKAQAAMAAJ&dq=Leave+It+to+Beaver+(G406)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Losing My Mind: An Intimate Look at Life With Alzheimer's","description":"When Tom DeBaggio turned fifty-seven in 1999, he thought he was about to embark on the relaxing golden years of retirement -- time to spend with his family, his friends, the herb garden he had spent decades cultivating and from which he made a living. Then, one winter day, he mentioned to his doctor during a routine exam that he had been stumbling into forgetfulness, making his work difficult. After that fateful visit, and a subsequent battery of tests over several months, DeBaggio joined the legion of twelve million others afflicted with Alzheimer's disease. But under such a curse, DeBaggio was also given one of the greatest gifts: the ability to chart the ups and downs of his own failing mind. Losing My Mind is an extraordinary first-person account of early onset Alzheimer's -- the form of the disease that ravages younger, more alert minds. DeBaggio started writing on the first day of his diagnosis and has continued despite his slipping grasp on one of life's greatest treasures, memory. In an inspiring and detailed account, DeBaggio paints a vivid picture of the splendor of memory and the pain that comes from its loss. Whether describing the happy days of a youth spent in a much more innocent time or evaluating how his disease has affected those around him, DeBaggio poignantly depicts one of the most important parts of our lives -- remembrance -- and how we often take it for granted. But to DeBaggio, memory is more than just an account of a time long past, it is one's ability to function, to think, and ultimately, to survive. As his life becomes reduced to moments of clarity, the true power of thought and his ability to connect to the world shine through, and in DeBaggio's case, it is as much in the lack of functioning as it is in the ability to function that one finds love, hope and the relaxing golden years of peace. At once an autobiography, a medical history and a testament to the beauty of memory, Losing My Mind is more than just a story of Alzheimer's, it is the captivating tale of one man's battle to stay connected with the world and his own life.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=X5NqTZTVwgMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Hundred Years War (A Capricorn giant)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cgtBtAEACAAJ&dq=The+Hundred+Years+War+(A+Capricorn+giant)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Children of the Mind","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=U9UTzgEACAAJ&dq=Children+of+the+Mind&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Thrill Club (Fear Street, No. 24)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=QxQQAQAAMAAJ&dq=The+Thrill+Club+(Fear+Street,+No.+24)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Orion book of time","description":"Describes man's methods dor measuring time and developments in watch and clock making techniques.

Furthermore, the state's withdrawal from providing social security is taking place throughout the world. One response to these developments has been increased migration, which poses further challenges to kinship-based social support systems. This innovative volume focuses on the ambiguous role of religious networks in social security and traces the interrelatedness of religious networks and state and family support systems. Particularly timely, it describes these challenges as well as social security arrangements in the context of globalization and migration. The wide range of case studies from various parts of the world that examine various religious groups offers an important comparative contribution to the understanding of religious networks as providers of social security.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=0hu-MQvXXdAC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Gospel According to Mark (Pocket Canon Bibles)","description":"Encouraging the reading of the Bible as literature rather than doctrine, the four central gospels are presented here in the beauty of the Authorised King James Version, with four fresh, modern introductions.

But consider this: What if it simply is not true? What if God can only rely on His best guess about tomorrow just as you and I do? Would it not affect your trust in Him, your confidence in facing the future, your worship, and your motivation to leave everything in His hands? And yet this is what a number of leading voices in evangelicalism are proposing under the doctrine of open theism. Open theism adjusts the entire picture of God's sovereignty and involvement in our lives. Bruce Ware carefully summarizes and critiques this dangerous doctrine from a thoroughly biblical perspective, exploring their implications and faithfully pinpointing the subtle ways that open theism undermines our trust in God and lessens His glory in our lives.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=hGOHz0EIRVkC&dq=God%27s+Lesser+Glory:+The+Diminished+God+of+Open+Theism&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The anti-Zionist complex","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=25ZtAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+anti-Zionist+complex&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"How to Make It in Musicals: The Insider's Guide to a Career as a Singer-Dancer","description":"The author starts with the very basics and guides the performer (and also the parents of the youngest beginners) through every aspect of the training and career development needed to bring the curtain up on a life of performing.

Smith fished from the original cast and crew the full no-holds-barred story from their behind the scenes experiences, a tale as action packed and occasionally as bloody as the film. Based on Peter Benchley's original Jaws novel, Jaws 2 starred Roy Scheider as a police chief dealing with another great white shark terrorizing the waters of a resort. The original director, John D. Hancock, proved unable to handle the action film and was replaced by Jeannot Szwarc. Actor Roy Scheider, who only made the film to end a contractual issue with Universal, was also unhappy during production and had several heated exchanges with Szwarc. Follow the entire fascinating production of the unforgettable film from concept to the impact the film made on Hollywood after Jaws 2 achieved a spot on Variety's list of Top 10 box office hits. About the authors: Louis R. Pisano is the director of the very popular series of  JawsFEST  fan DVDs. Michael A. Smith is the co-founder of MediaMikes.com and is a long-serving officer of the Kansas City Film Critics Circle. Jaws 2 The Making of the Hollywood Sequel is their first book. Includes Footnotes and illustrated with more than 200 rare behind-the-scenes photos taken by the cast and crew.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xVBKDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Religion For Dummies (For Dummies (Religion & Spirituality))","description":"Populaire inleiding tot het fenomeen religie, de wereldgodsdiensten en universele thema's uit religies.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=HILtosETRs8C&dq=Religion+For+Dummies+(For+Dummies+(Religion&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Guppies, Keeping and Breeding","description":"A guide to keeping guppies, describing the different varieties that exist, breeding strategies, care and feeding, aquarium maintenance, and more.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=cOg1WG5gLfkC&dq=Guppies,+Keeping+and+Breeding&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Mindfulness Meditation","description":"Embodying mindfulness allows both therapists and clients to make the most of treatment sessions.

His trial was a Roman circus. The chief gladiators were two great legal giants of the century. Like two bull elephants locked in mortal combat, they bellowed and roared imprecations and abuse.

And yet his form of Sufism was the subject of much discussion within the Islamic world, as it elicited responses ranging from praise and commendation to reproach and contempt for his Sufi practices within a generation of his death. This book assesses the few comments written about Kirm n  by his contemporaries, and also provides a translation from his Persian hagiography, which was written in the generation after his death. The controversy centres on Kirm n  s penchant for gazing at, and dancing with, beautiful young boys. This anonymous hagiography presents a series of anecdotes that portray Kirm n  s  virtues . The book provides an investigation into Kirm n  the individual, but the story has significance that extends much further. The controversy of his form of Sufism occurred at a crucial time in the evolution of Sufi piety and theology. The research herein situates Kirm n  within this critical period, and assesses the various perspectives taken by his contemporaries and near contemporaries. Such views reveal much about the dynamics and developments of Sufism during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, when the Sufi orders (?ur q, s. ?ar qa) began to emerge, and which gave individual Sufis a much more structured and ordered method of engaging in piety, and of presenting the Sufi tradition to society at large. As the first attempt in a Western language to appreciate the significant contribution that Kirm n  made to the medieval Persian Sufi tradition, this book will appeal to students and scholars of Sufi Studies, as well as those interested in Middle Eastern History.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Ge1HDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Visitor","description":"Based on a multi-year international study of 20 innovative museums, Peter Samis and Mimi Michaelson answer key questions regarding the processes and problems involved in transforming a collections-based museum to a visitor-centered approach.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=GTfNrQEACAAJ&dq=Visitor&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Winning his way","description":"\\"Winning His Way\\" by Charles Carleton Coffin.

Well if so, then, look no further. You can hold in your hands one of the most advanced and revolutionary method that was ever designed for quickly becoming conversational in a language. In creating this time-saving program, master linguist Yatir Nitzany spent years examining the twenty-seven most common languages in the world and distilling from them the three hundred and fifty words that are most likely to be used in real conversations. These three hundred and fifty words were chosen in such a way that they were structurally interrelated and, when combined, form sentences. Through various other discoveries about how real conversations work discoveries that are detailed further in this book Nitzany created the necessary tools for linking these words together in a specific way so that you may become rapidly and almost effortlessly conversant now. If your desire is to learn complicated grammatical rules or to speak perfectly proper and precise Portuguese, this book is not for you. However, if you need to actually hold a conversation while on a trip to Brazil or Portugal, to impress that certain someone, or to be able to speak with your grandfather or grandmother as soon as possible, then the Nitzany Method is what you have been looking for. This method is designed for fluency in a foreign language, while communicating in the present tense. Nitzany believes that what s most important is actually being able to understand and be understood by another human being right away. More formalized training in grammar rules, etc., can come later. This isn t a pronunciation book. Thus, this book is recommended for those with prior knowledge in pronunciation of the Portuguese language. However, for those who aren t previously familiar, this book does provide some basic tools to teach pronunciation. The main thing this book offers is the necessary tools to become conversational in a foreign language in record time. As previously stated, though, with regards to grammar and pronunciation, you are on your own! This is one of the several, in a series of instructional language guides, the Nitzany Method s revolutionary approach is the only one in the world that uses its unique language technology to actually enable you to speak and understand native speakers in the shortest amount of time possible.

With Conversational Portuguese Quick and Easy, all you need are fifty-three pages.

For a half century, Axel Vervoordt's vision has been defined by a continual quest for harmony, beauty, and the creation of interior atmospheres that are rooted in the past, connected to the future, and imbued with today's comforts. These eighteen residences--from an urban New York penthouse or Moscow apartment to a waterfront estate in New England, and from a Tokyo dwelling to a Bordeaux wine chateau or a Wabi-Sabi farmhouse--reveal how art complements architecture and the elements of nature in an alchemy of Vervoordt expression. Portraits of each residence--including the Vervoordts' own homes in Venice and Belgium--feature sweeping vistas of the surrounding landscape and a tour through the interiors. Each detail--from the materials used to the graceful placement of a well-chosen object--offers deep insight into the Vervoordt design approach and abiding principles for living and working well.","infoLink":"http://books.google.nl/books?id=OFtOEAAAQBAJ&dq=Portraits&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"History of William the Conqueror (Makers of history)","description":"\\"William the Conqueror\\" by Jacob Abbott.
