Robin Buss skillfully translates 19th century French into 21st century English without compromising Dumas' prose. Ample footnotes have been provided to help the modern reader with the details of French history between the Revolution and the rise and fall of Napoleon that are an important part of this novel. Yes, this is long but it will be time well spent! I purchased this as a Kindle download and found it quite easy to access the footnotes and return to the story. Unfortunately, there are a couple of places in the novel where Dumas includes some Greek text that renders poorly on the Kindle."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This was an unbelievable book. I had read shorter versions in school and seen diferent versions in the movies over the years but now that I have read this unabridged version I feel truly slighted. The size of this book put me off at first but once I got into the book I couldn't put it down.Dumas manages to capture probably the best account of human emotions that I have come across in a written form in a long time. Love, jealousy, hate, despair, revenge, remorse, pity, grief, and the list goes on and on. Through our beloved Count, Edmond, we see all of these thing that make us human. We find by each turn of the page that it isn't these emotions that are bad or good but how we put them to use in our lives.I was truly stunned by this book and all that is contained within...and as the Count said in his last words I am left to \\"wait and hope\\".This book is a must read for everyone."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I love the classics, but for a long time I held off on reading this due to its length and the ordeal of carrying around such a heavy book. Well, the Kindle version has made the second reason a non-issue and pretty much taken care of the first as well. For anyone who does love the classics or simply a rippingly-good read, this spectacular tale of love, politics, 19th-century hypocrisy (by the boatload) and plain old revenge is a must. Dumas, the son of a black slave~~whose last name he took~~and a father he barely knew had few compunctions about showing the sanctimonious sham that was much of post-Napoleonic France at all social levels. And seeing as how many of the same injustices and favoritism of the well-connected are still very much with us today, this makes The Count a very modern novel. As others have already pointed out, this translation by Robin Buss puts everything back that was apparently left out in previous translations, and does so in a way that is true to the language of the time, but still sounds more or less natural to us today. There is something for everyone in this wonderful book: for those who love fantasy, there is the island of Monte Cristo itself, where time seems to stand still; for those more into politics, there is post-Napoleonic France, with all of its intrigues and power-plays at all levels of society; and for those who just love a great story well-told, it is on every page. Not to mention that there is also a fairly hefty erotic charge through much of the book. So if you love adventure, romance, intrigue, great characters and enough plot twists to keep the tension ratcheted up almost nonstop, consider spending a few weeks or however long it takes~~with The Count. I guarantee you won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I just recently finished reading this 600+ page novel and was very disappointed in it. With the Count of Monte Cristo being considered such a classic - I was left asking \\"why\\" after reading this version? Apparently, it is not the entire book and that would explain some of my confusion with the relevance of many characters who are introduced and then left out.I'm very disappointed that this book is not listed by the publisher as \\"abridged\\" (nowhere on this book does it say abridged). After spending all the time to read 600 pages, I feel obligated to go back and read the recommended version, so I can find out what makes this a \\"Classic\\" and so many people's favorite book.I find it very beneficial that Amazon provides the reviews - this is an excellent resource that I use before I purchase almost anything. My wife purchased this book at a local bookstore and now I am purchasing the full version from Amazon after reading the reviews to see what I am missing. The version I read can't be so many people's favorite book, so they must have left out some important information. Thanks for the reviews, Amazon."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I read The Count of Monte Cristo a few months ago, and it took me two months to get through it. It was the best reading experience I've had since reading The Lord of the Rings almost twenty years ago.Initially I wanted to read an ebook version of the novel -- I wanted to be able to carry it around easily in an ebook reader. So I loaded one of the free versions in the public domain onto my ebook reader and started in ... but it was no fun. The translation was very old, and latinate sentence structure and archaic words made it difficult to understand. After doing a little research I found that the only fully modern translation is the one by Robin Buss in Penguin Classics. And I actually had a copy sitting around my house, but I was reluctant to carry around a fat paperback as big as a Bible for the time it would take to finish the book. Yet I wanted to read this novel, so I gave up and started in on the paperback edition. (I see now that amazon carries a kindle version from Penguin that appears to be the Robin Buss translation. But I don't have a kindle.)As other reviewers have noted: don't bother with any other version than the one translated by Robin Buss. Seriously -- don't waste your time (unless you know French and are going to read it in the original language). The suffering quotient is just too high. And that would be true even if you read an abridged version. Yes, this is a very long novel, but any abridgment is going to have to leave out some of the most truly wonderful things in the book, because again and again, the things that make The Count of Monte Cristo such a pleasure to read are things that don't really advance the plot. So just resign yourself to slogging through the whole thing. It's worth it, believe me. Not only is the style of writing infinitely easier to understand, but the book is, as they say, \\"unexpurgated.\\" Earlier translations apparently leave out some of the weirdest and most fascinating parts of the book. In one section there's a lengthy description of a drugged, erotic reverie. In another section one character is portrayed implicitly and (by modern standards) humorously as a lesbian. And in yet one more section, we get a truly fascinating and horrifyingly detailed description of a brutal execution. Someone looking for things to cut from the book could easily cut any of these. But I know you'll want to read them.My impressions of the Dumas' novel overall are that it creates a whole world that's both remarkably similar to our own, yet remarkably different, and very strange. In fact the book creates several worlds, including the world of the young Edmond Dantes, before his incarceration; the world of the prison, the Chateau D'If; the world of Monte Cristo, Dantes island paradise, the world of carnival season Rome; the world of high society Paris; and several others along the way, drawn quickly and then not seen again (e.g., the world of the telegraph operator). Linking all these worlds is Edmond Dantes, aka the Count of Monte Cristo (and many other aliases), in his journey from innocence, through suffering, to vengeance and final repentance.From what I knew of the book before reading it, I assumed the greater part of the novel would be taken up with the adventures surrounding Dantes' arrest, imprisonment, and escape, with vengeance plot being somewhat secondary. But this is completely wrong: the section leading up to Dantes' escape and his finding of the treasure is all prelude: by a great degree, the book's main plot deals with Dantes secretly returning to the world and insinuating himself into the lives of those who victimized him. He does this over a period of years, and his essentially infinite wealth turns him into a kind of God, pulling the strings for almost everything significant that happens in their lives. Admittedly much of this very long part of the book is slow ... too slow. The plot becomes quite convoluted, and sometimes you wish the writer would just get on with it. But then, suddenly, when you're almost ready to give up, a big action scene will take place, and the suspense will be ratcheted up for another two hundred pages.One trick I used to make myself keep reading through the slow parts was to remember how the book was originally published: as a serial. Dumas had to produce a certain number of words for each installment, so even if he wasn't ready to make use of a planned plot development, he still had to write X number of words. This means some installments have little plot development. But at other times, the plot seems to move very quickly, and some action scenes seem oddly compressed -- again, probably because Dumas was limited in how many words he could write for each section.A significant flaw of the book is that the major characters who plotted Dantes' downfall in the early part of the book, and who disappear for several decades while Dantes is imprisoned and then while he is planning his return -- these characters seem hard to connect to the villains who appeared in the early pages. For the most part their characters seem unrelated to the people Dantes later tracks down. Since they also change their titles, this makes it hard to keep track of who's who. And the extremely complex plot makes it even harder. So, another suggestion: as you read, keep a little chart of the major characters (including ALL the villains, as they appear, and their families). As the book progresses and more details are revealed, you can add to your chart. Of course you can find this information in many sources -- wikipedia, CliffsNotes, etc. -- but these all contain spoilers. It's best to discover these things for yourself.In the end, The Count of Monte Cristo is not very deep, in the way Tolstoy or Flaubert are deep. To put it simply, what it is, is the most fun you can have in reading for the sheer pleasure of reading. Some scenes stay strongly in my mind even now -- for example the Carnival scenes in Rome, and the gruesome executions that follow it.I only wish I had this book to read one more time, for the first time."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I did not get the opportunity to read this book in High School, which is probably for the best.

Yes, the print edition is 1300+ pages, but don't be scared off: it will draw you in.Also, the unabridged Penguin Classics translation looks great on the Kindle.

If you do not like to read large books or do not have time, the abridged will do. But you will be missing out on some gripping story lines and plot twist.

I made the mistake of not paying attention to weather this book was abridged or unabridged so if this is important to you, keep that in mind when you order. So the abridged gets 3 stars were as the unabridged gets an easy five stars."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I am a full time adult college student.

The only thing that i didnt like was one character Eugenie Danglars, she is minor character but in the few chapters that she is in, the book seemed to slow down in pace and i found myself skimming those chapter. If it wasnt for her a think the book would be much better but w/e she isnt a major character so its not that big of a deal. I highly suggest that you jot down notes on the characters as you read the story since there are about 40 characters more or less also if you dont have any knowledge of The Arabian Nights you may want to consider at least reading a summary or movie on it because Dumas frequently makes camparisons to it towards the middle of the book.So as i said before this book is truly wonderful! dont be scared by its large size!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I first read \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" in fifth grade. I started with a five hundred or so paged version, knowing that it would be too hard for me to take on the entire book. I fell in love instantly. Unable to rip myself away from the book, I actually got yelled at by my parents for not coming to eat dinner.Two years later, in seventh grade, I decided that it was about time for me to read this entire, unabridged version. I sat for days, doing nothing but reading, and when I reemerged, I found that I was just as much in love as I had been two years before. I also found that this was going to be a long, wonderful relationship between myself and Dumas.\\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is a wonderful book for several reasons. One is that it is exciting. There is constantly something going, and the story never fully stops (though it certainly slows at certain points in comparison to others). Another reason is that the characters are beautifully made. You have a wonderful main character; a young man who seems to have everything, but then everything crashes on him, and he is instead left a slightly sinister, frightening man. Another wonderful thing is that every character has their virtues, and their flaws, including our main character, whose need for revenge leads him to do not-so-noble things.There are few books that top \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\".

When I first began reading the book I was stumped by the first couple of pages. I had to go back and do a bit of re-analyzing, because sometimes they call the characters by their first name, at times by their last, and some gain a specific title throughout the book. That really threw me for a loop, and if you don't pay attention to that you'll be confused the whole way through. The first couple of chapters moved a little sluggishly for me, but after I got to a point of interest this was a quick read for me. The thing that makes this book so interesting is the underlying theme. The whole point is someone will double cross anyone if they think they'll benefit from it in the long run. It also shows just how much revenge can cloud a person's mind. This was one of the first books I've been given to read for an assignment that I actually found meaningful. Much better than the \\"Oeidipus,\\" or \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" by far. Although this book is a classic, there is a very modern feel to it because much of the things menchined in this book happen today in different ways. Overall it was a wonderful book. I don't regret reading it at all."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Review for THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTODumas' 1844 novel about passion, betrayal and justifiable vengeance provides exhilarating reading even in the 21st century. Opening in February of 1815, when France was polarized into either Bonapartist or Royalist camps; society risked reprisals as the pendulum of power shifted capriciously; personal fortunes and careers rose and plunged until the Emperor's final imprisonment.Nineteen-year-old Edmond Dantes, capable first mate for the Morrell Firm, is poised to enjoy life to the fullest: promoted to captaincy despite his youth and engaged to his beloved Mercedes. Betrayed by three \\"friends\\" with private grudges or weak natures Dantes falls an easy victim to the conspirators. Accused though innocnet, Dantes is not even tried, but thrown into a miserable prison on a rocky isle in Marseilles harbor--the dreaded Chateau d'Yf. Victim of the relentless wheels of political fate the young man languishes there for some 14 years.During his imprisonment Dantes undergoes a metamorphosis from desiring death to living for revenge against his unknown foes. With the help of Father Faria-a priest considered mad by prison authorities because he insists on possessing a vast fortune-he realizes the names of his unseen tormentors, how and why he was betrayed. Since time was in abundance Faria undertook to educate the embittered youth; eventually this passionate mentor considered Dantes his son and together they planned their escape. Ultimately Dantes reached the rocky islet of Monte Cristo, recovered the treasure and was able to live a luxurious life as the Count of Monte Cristo.The bulk of the novel chronicles Dantes' personal odyssey as the self-appointed hand of providence; he devised complicated schemes to enact ruin upon the men who destroyed his career and happiness and who allowed his elderly father to starve to death.Dantes' privately likens his power and justice with God's. Asself-appointed avenger he carefully schemes and patiently waitsto savor his moments of triumph.Dumas' style includes swashbuckling action, extensive dialogue and frequent flashbacks on the parts of various characters. His clever schemes and surprise counterfoils keep readers alert with literary suspense. A connoisseur of the darker side of human nature, Dantes often relies on the baser instincts of his targetswhich facilitate their ultimate downfall. Yet even he cannot always predict the feminine factor. Himself mentored in prison, Dantes treats two young men as his sons, and acts as guardian to two young couples. Despite this, does one mortal man-emotionally scarred---have the right to claim divine privilege?"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This one of my all time favorites. Great drama, mystery, and suspense. Also a fascinating portrait of an era. The age of this book (amazingly) does not dampen the excitement and intrigue. Get the unabridged version, its worth it."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo, written by Alexandre Dumas revolves around the life of a young man living in France in the early 1800's. The novel begins with the handsome young sailor Edmond Dantes. He has just returned from a journey aboard the Pharaon, which is owned by a man named Monsieur Morrel. The ship's captain died on the voyage home, and Dantes assumed the post with admirable skill, so M. Morrel made him the new captain.Not only that, but Dantes is also abut to marry his beautiful fiance. Unfortunately, all of Dantes's good fortune causes some men to become jealous and they begin to plot his downfall...The rest of the story is about the 13 years Dantes spends in prison and then how he exacts his revenge on those who betrayed him. The story is much more than that however, it is also about a love and a man who must rediscover his soul after all goodness has been ripped away from him. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read, even if only the slightest bit. From pirates to prisoners, love to war, this book has something for everyone."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The synopsis on the back of this book doesn't at all do it justice, it's the equivalent of describing the aurora borealis as a buch of lights in the sky. The Count of Monte Cristo is truly a masterpiece, don't let it's immense size deterr you Dumas' smooth style and this particular translation carry you through every page almost effortlessly, not to mention it being a thoroughly enjoyable and engaging read.

Just read it."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I am a student who rarely reads \\"classics\\" in her spare time outside of school, but this one was totally worth my time! I took this book to the beach with me (i know, an unusual choice to bring to the beach) and i could not put it down - it is such a seamless story, clearly written and with so many twists and turns in the plot to keep you fully engaged in the novel. lucky you if this novel is on your summer required reading list for school but even if you are just looking for an intense and unforgettable beach read, this novel is for you."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I can't decide whether I like this book or not. I suppose I should start with the bad, and finish off with the good.The first thing that bothered me about this book was the improbability of the events. How an ignorant, nave sailor could have become a powerful, knowledgable man with deep human understanding is beyond me. Admitedly, he did learn for many years from the Abb&eacute; Faria and later studied in the east, but I do not think that it could have turned him into the sudden enigma of the Count. The careers of most of the other characters, perhaps excepting Villefort, were improbable, too. For example, Fernand was a poor fisherman, and while he may have earned his fortune in the war, he could not have recieved enough knowledge and standing there to become a Peer of France.I also found this book bothersome because of the romanticized and unrealistic descriptions Dumas wrote. I know you will have accused me of extreme realism and cynicism by now, but in my defense, I do like many Romantic novels. This particular Romantic novel was pushing it, however. For example, in the oficial document that tells how Franz's father was killed, he dedicates a paragraph to describing how dark and stormy the night was and how there was snow on the banks next to the river, although technically it was a legal testament. The everyday converstation between the characters is similarly stilted. The love affair between Maxemilien and Valentine was so teary, fake, and idealized, that I wanted to slap them by the end of the book.And yet, despite all this, I cannot help but admire the book as a work of literature. The psychological twists and turns of this book are amazing. I love the way Edmond is convinced that he is an agent of Providence by doing justice, and how this \\"justice\\" goes out of control. I love the fact that the protagonist is in many ways an antagonist, and that this seemingly supper-human man can make mistakes. I always hated how the movies glamorized Edmond and his revenge. The book, instead, makes the revenge all the more profound because you feel a lot of sympathy for his victims.This book also has a great deal of mystery, and it is fun to guess what is going on behind the scenes. As one person once told me, it is very much like a chess game, in which Edmond is laying out all the pieces but you can never be sure what move he is going to make next."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Sorry to disappoint the previous reviewer, but when Dumas wrote this book, the ideas and plot were not new, not fresh, and certainly not original. Robert Wilson clearly outlines the history in his introduction to the book. &quot;In 1838 a police archivist named Jacques Peuchet published six volumes of crime stories taken from the files of the Paris police. In one file was the story of a young shoemaker from Nimes who in 1807 became engaged to marry a rich and beautiful orphan, but because of a despicable practical joke played by four jealous friends was falsely arrested as a spy for the English against Napoleon and imprisoned until the empire fell in 1814. While in prison he had met a dying Italian priest who told him where a great treasure was buried. Upon his release he found the treasure and, using various disguises, cold-bloodedly wreaked his vengeance on those responsible for his misfortune, one of whom had married his fiancee. When Dumas read the story, he knew he wanted to retell it. That real-life melodrama is, pretty nearly, The Count of Monte Cristo in outline.&quot; There is also an island named Montecristo that Dumas found enchanting, so very little of this novel is &quot;original&quot; or &quot;creative&quot; material. On the other hand, this should not deter anyone from reading the book because the story itself is fascinating, easily holding the reader's attention. A movie of this tale was made several years ago, starring Richard Chamberlain, and complements the book nicely. I enjoyed both the book and the movie and happily recommend both."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I like the book, I can read it whenever I like on my ipad. I don't really know what else to say.

I guess we all can be thankful for the translator's avoidance of the awful \\"their\\" as the gender comprehensive.I found the annotations in the back surprisingly difficult to work with, considering the fine annotations extant in the other Penguin editions of Dumas.

At first the reader may have to read, then re-read many of the sentences in an effort to garner the true meaning as, for most of us, this wordy text can be a little confusing and somewhat overwhelming. Not to far into the book, it becomes easier to handle and, in all honesty, it's a delight to read. Personally, I would enjoy being able to use words the way Dumas portrayed in his characters.Edmond Dantes is the main character who is falsely imprisoned due to a mixture of jealousy and self-preservation by others. He spends some 14 years in a dungeon where he is befriended by another inmate who schools Dantes and informs him of a fortune in buried treasure. Dantes escapes and sets out to garner revenge.

Dantes returns to his native soil as Count of Monte Cristo and exacts revenge on those who were responsible for his misery.Alexandre has displayed his skill in mapping out the rather elaborate manner in which Edmond reduces his opponents to near despair but at the same time ensuring that no innocent bystanders get hurt. the episode in which he bribes a telegraph clerk to deliver a wrong message which ultimately bleeds one of his opponents by millions of francs is very reflective of his understanding of human nature.overall, a book that is a must for anybody who is keen on understanding human emotions at play."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Alexandre Dumas, one of the greatest romance novelists of all time does it again in this post - Napoleonic swashbuckling tale of adventure, love, betrayal and revenge.

Highly recommended!!!!I find it unfortunate how much the book differs from the movie, especially Dantes' attitude towards God. I feel that in the movie, Dantes exhibits a hatred toward God throughout until perhaps the end. However, both the book and the film give examples how the love of God is shown (in spite of all the suffering) in the end of the book.Two words, \\"wait and hope.\\""},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is a very dated but enjoyable romp. If you just want to be entertained and to enjoy a simpler time than our stressed out world, step back into this novel. Nothing deep, just pure escapism."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This book is amazing! and nothing bad happened to my kindle when i downloaded it, i think the other reviewer just had a malfunctioning kindle...i've read it for the past two days with no problems."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I have read thousands of book - more than I care to count and I am never without a book - my hands don't feel right if I don't have a book to hold. This is my favourite book of them all. No film or TV broadcast has ever done this book justice. The depth of Dantes revenge and the fine detail that Dumas gives had always enthralled me. I challange every lover of the written word not to find themselves hooked by this dark tale."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This review is for those who've already decided they want to read The Count of Monte Cristo (you won't regret it!), and don't know which version to get.Short answer: see review title, duh!The Count of Monte Cristo is my favorite book, and I've read several translations, both abridged and unabridged.TRANSLATIONThe Buss translation is the most modern, and reads most fluidly. A quick example comparing this translation with the one found on Project Gutenberg:PG - His wife visited for him, and this was the received thing in the world, where the weighty and multifarious occupations of the magistrate were accepted as an excuse for what was really only calculated pride...BUSS - His wife visited on his behalf; this was accepted in society, where it was attributed to the amount and gravity of the lawyer's business -- when it was, in reality, deliberate arrogance...Buss's work reads like the book was written in English. The two or so times that the work is nearly untranslatable, Buss makes a footnote about it (eg, an insinuated insult using the formal \\"vous\\" instead of the familiar \\"tu\\"). Other translations just skip the subtlety. The most common translation out there (uncredited in my version) reads like a swamp. Trust me, get Buss.ABRIDGED V UNABRIDGEDAbridged versions of this book rarely say \\"abridged.\\" You can tell by the size: abridged is 500-700 pages, unabridged is 1200-1400 pages. Go for the unabridged.The abridged version is VERY confusing! Pruning 1200 pages down to 600 leaves a lot of plot on the cutting room floor. Suddenly, arriving at dinner are 4 new characters; it's very tiring to try to keep up with the hole-ridden story of the abridged versions. And you know where the holes are? Publishers \\"clean up\\" the book by omitting the affairs, illegitimate children, homosexuality, hashish trips, etc.As an added bonus in the Penguin Classics edition, there's a wonderful appendix bursting with footnotes to explain all the 19th century references, and a quick guide to the rise and fall of Napoleon (crucial to the politics in the story).Hope this helps. Get the book and start reading!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Warning: Do NOT pick this book up and start it if you have something that you need to do in the next day or three. You won't be able to put the book down, or if you do, you'll move zombielike through your everyday tasks while your mind stays with the adventures of Edmund Dantes.The Count of Monte Cristo is a delicious book, full of intrigue, great fight scenes, love, passion, and witty social satire. Dumas has a wonderful grasp of human nature and a talent for rendering all the follies of man in delightful, snappy prose. I immediately recognized people that I know (yes, even myself) in his vivid characters, which made the book all the more engaging to me.Some people might be put off by the size of the book -- it's a pretty hefty volume -- an tempted to buy the abridged version. Don't! I've heard from people who've read both versions that the abridged version is a pathetic, washed out shadow of the full novel. At any rate, as thick and impossibly long as The Count of Monte Cristo may seem when you open it for the first time, you'll feel as though it's far too short by the time you get to the last page."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This book is an example of perfect fiction writing. Its length is 5 times the average book and it still was not long enough! The story, the characters, the settings and the emotions enthralled me for days. I could not put it down. I was living the book as it took me to France, the mediterranean, Italy and every home, cave and mode of transportation detailed in exemplary fashion by Dumas. Without giving away the intrigue... This book is the story of a wronged young sailor and follows his life as he is imprisoned due to the actions of 3 jealous men. He lives in prison for an extended period of time, meeting a man who gives him hope and a life beyond his dreams. He escapes the horrid dungeon and seeks revenge on the 3 men who took away everything he ever hoped for. This book is amazing, it will not disappoint anyone. I cannot believe I did not read it before. Thank you Kindle for allowing me the pleasure of reading this book for free, however, it is worth paying for and sharing with anyone who loves to read."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I agree with the reviewers that this is one of the best books ever written. I read this book as part of a book club and probably never would have read it on my own--having read many of the books of Hugo and Dickens and other writers of that approximate era. I love both of these writers but find them both at times cumbersome and stilted and really wasn't in the mood for another. However, I could not put the Count of Monte Cristo down. This book seems freshly modern in writing style compared to these superb writers. From the beginning it is a page turner--almost Harry Potter like in its ability to have action, adventure and drama on almost every page. If you read the unabridged version you will find some allusions to morality and the wrongness of revenge which I enjoyed. But what makes the book great is the grandeur of the writing, the tightness of a wonderful plot, filled with subplots, the development of the characters, and the constant magic of combining romance and adventure. It is the ultimate romance book. If you watched the most recent version of the movie, you might be disappointed at the lack of sword fights, but there is never a lack of adventure and suspense. It might be 1400 pages long, but it never disappoints."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I first read the Bantam abridged Monte Cristo when I was 13 years old. Then, the next year, I saw the unabridged version and immediately bought a copy. Monte Cristo is an absolutely wonderful and wonderfully written masterpiece that tells the story of a young man that could be any of several people that you and I know. It is a story of injustice, despair, remorse, cruelty, misfortune, and evil. However, at the same time, the book manages to show that in the seemingly rotten world we live in there is hope, charity, love, honor, and purity as well. Edmond is one of the greatest dynamic characters of all time, innocently sent to face punishment that he in no way deserves. While enduring this unjust punishment, he meets a man and they become friends. Edmond learns from this man that everyone acts according to their own standards, and that everyone will eventually receive reward for the actions or crimes that they have committed, whether that reward be payment for honest living or pain in reparation for hardships forced upon others. Edmond then becomes that reparation, rewarding those that were his true friends, and exacting revenge upon those that caused him pain. A wonderful story, with excellent characters and an intricate plot. I would recommend this book for anyone that wants to laugh, cry, and triumph with a single character and his struggles. As the title states, this is one of my favorite books of all time, the only other that really compares with it is Victor Hugo's Les Miserables."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I've reviewed this book before. I'm writing another review of it now so that it will appear on my list of reviews next to my review of the butchered 2002 screen adaptation of this epic work.Alexandre Dumas's _The Count of Monte Cristo_ is one of the greatest novels of all time and in fact stands at the fountainhead of the entire stream of popular adventure-fiction. Dumas himself was one of the founders of the genre; every other such writer -- H. Rider Haggard, C.S. Forrester, Zane Grey, Louis L'Amour, Mickey Spillane, Ian Fleming, Tom Clancy, John Grisham -- is deeply in his debt.The cold, brooding, vampiric Count (born Edmond Dantes; known also, among other aliases, as \\"Sinbad the Sailor,\\" Lord Wilmore, and a representative of the firm of Thomson and French) is the literary forebear of every dark hero from Sherlock Holmes and the Scarlet Pimpernel to Zorro, Batman, the Green Hornet, and Darkman. And the intricate plot provides everything any reader could want: adventure, intrigue, romance, and (of course) the elegant machinations of the Count himself as he exacts his terrible revenge on those who have wronged him -- thereby serving, or so he believes, as an agent of divine justice and retribution. Brrrrrrrr.The book is also a good deal _longer_ than many readers may be aware. Ever since the middle of the nineteenth century, the English translations have omitted everything in the novel that might offend the sensibilities of Victorian readers -- including, for example, all the sex and drugs.That's why I strongly recommend that anyone interested in this novel read Robin Buss's full-text translation. Unlike, say, Ayn Rand (whose cardboard hero \\"John Galt\\" also owes his few interesting aspects to Monsieur le Comte), Dumas was entirely capable of holding a reader's undivided attention for over a thousand pages; Buss's translation finally does his work justice, restoring all the bits omitted from the Bowdlerized versions.The heart of the plot, as most readers will already know, is that young sailor Edmond Dantes, just as his life starts to come together, is wrongfully imprisoned for fourteen years in the dungeons of the Chateau d'If as the victim of a monstrously evil plot to frame him as a Bonapartist. While in prison he makes the acquaintance of one Abbe Faria, who serves as his mentor and teaches him the ways of the world (science, philosophy, languages and literature, and so forth), and also makes him a gift of a fabulous treasure straight out of the _Thousand and One Nights_. How Dantes gets out of prison, and what he does after that -- well, that's the story, of course. So that's all I'm going to tell you.However, I'll also tell you that the 2002 screen adaptation doesn't even begin to do it justice. The plot is so far \\"adapted\\" as to be unrecognizable, except in its broad outlines and the names of (some of) the characters. Pretty much everything that makes Dumas's novel so darkly fascinating has been sucked out of it. It's not a bad movie on its own terms, but if you're expecting an adaptation of this novel, you'll be disappointed. And if you've already seen it, don't base your judgment of the novel on it."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is a great book and I highly recommend it, but don't buy this enriched classic version of the book. It was good, but I felt like something was missing, and not until I finished the book did I discover that this version leaves out significant portions of the actual story. Nowhere in this book does it tell you that it is an abridged version, but it actually is. Buy a different version of this book."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is more of a note to compare the Oxford unabridged version to abridged versions of this story.Previously, I read an abridgement of The Count of Monte Cristo and enjoyed it thoroughly. The story is a classic Man-Done-Wrong-Wreaks-Revenge tale.Eventually, I decided to read the unabridged version, even though it is over 1,000 pages, and I'm exceedingly glad that I did!There is an incredible amount of tension in this book, which miraculously enough is retained throughout the entire work. In the unabridged version, the reader is inserted into the story in a &quot;you are there&quot; sense, moment by moment, which is, in my opinion, the thing that retains this tension.Not to disparage the abridgement, but - in shortening the story - the reader is sometimes not a participant in the storyline, but merely hears about the events in an off-hand summary. As a result of this, part of the soul of the book is removed.That is a shame - especially with this work - because you are partly robbed of the emotional reward of following Edmond Dantes' journal from hell along his complicated strategy to struggle toward heaven ... which is a long journey from Marseilles!You should set aside the time to read the unabridged version of this work! You will not feel the time a useless sacrifice!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I'll admit up front - I'm only 15% of the way through the book. But so far, I love it. It's got plenty of intrigue and suspense to keep me very interested. I have no doubt I'll love the remaining 85%. Also, I'm 90% sure that this is the unabridged version. I took this Kindle version to a bookstore and compared it to an unabridged hard copy of the book, and they line up very similarly. From what I can tell, the unabridged versions have 117 chapters, compared to about 71 chapters in the abridged version. A hard copy unabridged version will have roughly 1200 pages, compared to about 600 pages for the abridged. For what it's worth, this Kindle version has 19,069 \\"locations.\\" All in all, a great read so far."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I first read this book in high school, and it is a great book. Unfortunately, this edition is, as far as I can tell, abridged, so it doesn't have the full story. I just finished reading this edition, and based on what I remember from my earlier reading, as well as conversations with another person who has read the work, this edition leaves things out. While I can find nothing indicating that this edition is abridged, I think it is, so I would suggest finding the full version if you are truly interested in the book."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This book is one of the greatest novels of all time. I read the Signet classics abridged version of Count of Monte Cristo but have yet to read the unabridged version. Not knowing the difference between the abridged and unabridged, I found that the Signet abridged was fairly well done. There will be a few holes when you cut out about half of the book, but this abridgment didn't make it seem so obvious. I was drawn into the story from the beginning. The middle part of the story was a little slow, but the denouement was so suspenseful and compelling that it made me emotional. Everyone should read The Count of Monte Cristo once in their life."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I just read this for the first time. Oh my, I feel like I've watched or been through an epic experience and felt the highs and lows of Edmond. I am heartbroken to find that his fiance is unfaithful, and that they can never be together. Yet, what a master writer Alexandre Dumas is not to make me hate him, for I can see now why it had to be so. How do some writers do that? Twist what you would normally hate into something so powerfully moving? Wonderful story, based on fact. However, there is one plot inconsistency, and that is when Mercedes tells Edmond that he is still so handsome. Tell me, do you know of anyone that has been through a major trial in their life? Divorce, death? How does their face look? Do they have more lines around their eyes, or maybe a deep wrinkle or two on their forehead or cheek? Bad habits that destroy their looks? Try 14 years in the worst prison and I cannot imagine it would leave anyone handsome. True, Mercedes might have said such a thing out of her love for him, but throughout the story the hint of his looks are that of a handsome gentleman. Wow, what a great story though. My heart bleeds for Edmond and I wish that he and Mercedes would have made a couple at the end, and even though Edmond says he will find peace, it is not enough to make me think his torture has ended. Revenge is the thread in this story, white hot, unstoppable, self tormenting revenge. The things he confronts is what we all confront when faced with betrayal. Do we become what we despise? Turn the tables and exact revenge? Do we have the right? Can we live with ourselves afterwards? Edmond overcomes his doubts as to his purpose by reminding himself of all the tortures he faced. He becomes the thing created from his experience. Once set on this path, he cannot undo it. Thusly, suicide crops its head as it should. No easy task, to slowly destroy those who ruined you. It seems with each success he destroys some of his self, too. The old Edmond. What amazed me is the author placed such realistic thoughts in Edmond's head about how he felt he'd gone too far, the guilt...it makes you wonder whether you would choose to be wise and forgive in order to move on or follow the same path...which shaped Edmond because he spent so much time in that hellish cell. Recommended reading, but don't expect happy endings, just an amazing rollercoaster!@"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I just finished this book, the Modern Library Classic, and I must say it is the best book I've ever read in my life. What a thrilling tale of adventure, revenge, romance, spirituality, and morality. Dumas takes us through the European countryside, cities, and islands, setting the stage for the one of the best-crafted plots ever written.There's not much more I can say about this book that has already been written other than that one should get the long version. Yes, it took me awhile to get through the 1,462-page book, but I really don't see how the abridged versions could eliminate 900 pages of this masterpiece. This is truly a work of spendid prose and story telling. It's a must read for anyone who enjoyes adventure, drama, and history."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The pages come off. Do not purchase this book. I spent the first week of school trying to prevent the pages from coming off."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is the quintessential book about revenge!Edmond Dantes has everything going for him - a promising career and the hand of the girl he loves. Yet things go disastrously wrong when he is set up - accused of being a Bonapartist he is sent to Chateau D'If...a prison on an island with no chance of release, and not even being told of what he is being charged.At first first it seems he will go mad, yet he is befriended by the Abbe Faria, who is thought to be mad. The Abbe teaches Edmond about a myriad of subjects, and informing him of a secret treasure. When the Abbe dies (14 years after Edmond's arrival at the prison), Edmond siezes the opportunity to escape and, after locating the treasure, sets out on a patient, complex, course for revenge against those who had ruined his life.Ever since I first read The Three Musketeers, I have been a fan of Alexandre Dumas, but never had a chance to read this book. I'm glad I finally had this opportunity as it's well worth the time, and I highly recommend reading The Count Of Monte Cristo."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I bought this book without a picture, but by the description written. It turned out great.

The cover had no knicks or bent edges to it and the inside was just fine. There were no markings or folds in it at all, and I'm pretty sure there weren't ripped pages."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This book is incredible! I watched the movie that came out in 2000 or 2001 and really enjoyed it but after reading this book, I think I would really HATE the movie. If you're looking for an incredibly intricate plot line then read the book and skip the movie. The movie takes pieces of the plot and twists it in such a way that leaves the viewer with little to know surprise or suspense. Alexandre Dumas writes in such a way as to put the reader right in the very scene that is being played out. As I read this book I felt like I was sitting in the conversations taking place amongst the characters. I don't know how he does it (I'm not a writer!) but he does it quite well.Believe it or not, I've not been much of a reader until recently (I'm 30, if that tells you anything). When I found this book and saw how long it was I thought I was jumping in over my head, however, I quickly found that this was a book that I could NOT put down and one that I did NOT want to end! One of the highlights in the book (at least for me) is how you'll be cruising along with the story and tracking pretty well with it when all of a sudden you take a hard left turn and can't figure out who is who and what is what. Just when you think Dumas has lost his mind and can't write to save his life, he pulls out this magic thread that pulls these mystery pieces together and out of nowhere you have a new and amazing concept introduced in a way you didn't expect. Understanding that these threads are intertwined into the story helps the reader get through chapters that may not make sense at the time but have a huge payoff in the end.One last thing, I have only read this version which is unabridged (nothing has been cut out). I've not read the abridged version (pieces of the story have been cut out to shorten it) but I can't imagine that it holds a candle to the unabridged, of course you'll have to determine that for yourself. I'm an all or nothing individual and so of course I wanted every aspect of the story included, I'm so glad I did! Buy this unabridged version, you will NOT be disappointed and please don't let the size of this book intimidate you. You'll be amazed (especially if you're not a fast reader like myself) at how quickly this book can read.Buy the book, you will love it!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Dumas is the king of drama and the swashbuckling hero with a broken heart.

It will not make you think in the same way that a book like 1984 might, but Dumas has an incredible skill when it comes to storytelling. If you think that you would enjoy a book that is packed with adventure and emotion, read this one."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This book is amazing. I've never read a book this long that has kept my attention every minute throughout the entire book. No matter what kind of literature you prefer, you can't go wrong with this book. It's what I call an everything book, meaning it has a little bit of everything in it: adventure, romance, mystery, humor, etc. The way the characters develop is very interesting and the way that each chapter leads so well into the next just makes you want keep the book in your hands at all times. Whatever you do, don't read an abridged version. I don't see how anyone could take even one chapter out of this book. Highly recommended to everyone, no matter what type of literature you're most interested in."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This particular translation was the most visible at a particular Border's (as well as on Amazon), and I almost bought it. However, I had time to kill, and so I read the first three pages from several other translations: it really made a difference. I opted for the Penguin Classics edition trans. by Robin Buss, which I found to be both clear and faithful. This frickin book is well over 1,000 pages, so it may be worth your while to sit down in the bookstore and investigate for a few minutes.p.s. Look out for the sneaky abridged versions, too. I wish I could burn them. Just kidding."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Look, if you've seen the movie, it's a good adaptation, yet, as often with movies, it is diminished when compared to the book. THis is even more so with Monte Cristo, the book is quite long, but filled with intrigue, if you think Dantes could be cruel on the film, just read the book. Also, it has a less corny ending, which I appreciate.Truth, the book is quite long, but it is completely absorbing, I just couldn't put it down, I finished it on 12 hours of straight non stop reading, just couldn't stop until the end. I most definetly recommend this book, and would consider it as a Must read for anyone who claims to be at least moderately knowledgeable."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is my favorite book of all time.

Not the movie where they call him a dumb-ass, the other one that is based on this book, that is not very good compared to the book.

Having been thrust suddenly from a life he loved to a world he cannot call life, Mr. Edmond Dantes spends fourteen incredibly long years in a prison not fit for rats or cockroaches. While there, his mind fills with nothing but thoughts of vengeance, and even the most brutal of situations takes Edmond Dante deep into the recesses of his mind, where he recalls with hatred and and anger the bitter trap he fell into unjustly, the people behind it, and how he will avenge. No book I have ever read has expressed the soul of man with a spark of life against all odds as this one has. Edmond believes he will one day return to overtake all of his enemies, and it is that belief which gives the strength of the book real power. All Edmond has to do is wait. And hope.Don't miss this one."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I have just returned to the land of the living, having hidden from the world to read all 1276 pages of &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; in just under five days.

Revenge is sweet!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Although Count of Monte Cristo kept me on my toes wondering what would happen next, it seemed to drone on by without a certain explanation. I loved the book, it just had parts that i thought Dumas could have easily done without. Besides that, Count of Monte Cristo was a wonderfully written book that deserves full credit on itself. It had such passion and devotion inside it; it's as though Dumas himself was feeling the same imprisonment as Dantes."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Many would argue against the title I have just given this book. They would say that Crime and Punishment or even such Shakespeare plays such as Hamlet would allow further insight into the main character's soul. But these books only showed the torture, and are not complete. The Count is shown to have a very brooding conscience, and though it is tainted by revenge, the involuntary hurt he gives to the innocent brings out both his tortured soul and his contemplative soul, taking each problem as it comes instead of all at once. This is how most people's trains of thought work, for as bad as a problem may become, we are always working around it."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"when i read dumas's Count, i was enthralled by the storyline and the characters, especially the quality of Dantes(after the transition into the count)of being one step ahead of his advesaries.i only rated it at four stars because i read the abriged version, and therefore cannot judge with impartiallity."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This a really crummy translation. No one is credited anywhere, though there's some worthy who contributed an introduction."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I agree with everyone else when I say that the story of 'The Count' is gripping, exciting, etc. The translations, on the other hand, especially this one, leave much to be desired. The English is stilted and uninspiring, and many times it seems like the text was translated word-for-word without necessary changes in sentence structure.Alexandre Dumas is much better in the original French."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"What a book to cherish, this is one count who simply will not give up on what he believes is right, and what he believes is true justice, this man will do anything, and he is simply the kind of person that is so influential as his hidden self is shown, though the abbe helped him out, it was still mostly to himself. He is way too two-dimensional.Okay, that was a little fast for you, perhaps, but that is basically everything this book is amazing in, and lacking in. But you can't miss either if you want such an age--defying novel. Now, to start, I can't think of any other French novels worthy of being compared to it. Jean--Christophe, comparable if not better, The Wandering Jew, a breath--taking novel that might be the only other French novel that can say is better than this one without hesitation. Les Miserable, comparable, and the musketeers, surely rival the count. However, this novel is very singular, and though there are several novels in its class( betrayal then revenge ), this novel, in some incredulous way, pushes the rest away( sorry Kidnapped, but you'll have to understand ), and gives itself more room, more space. It deserves a genre of its own.The lenghth and added strenghth of this heavy book, both physically and spiritually, gives it more room for flourishes, for explanation, but most of all for perfection. Let's compare this book to a cake, like I normally do, and we'll see that the cake, as I shall refer the book, needs the ingredients. Add a little something not that good, the bad guys fits that perfectly. Now add something unreal, but truly something of your dreams, Edmund Dantes fits that description without hesitation. Now add the creamy stuff, for example, the romance, the ignorance, the jealousy, and the stubborness. Of course, the last ingredient, the most important thing you need on a cake, or else it's an amateur's work, is the CHERRY( if you eat yours with a cherry )! That, is the Count of Monte Cristo's ace in the hole, it's plot. This book takes a humble old--fashioned genre in fiction to a whole new level, it's got more details, its got more flavor, it's more of a good cherry. So now you see how expertly Alexandre Dumas picks his ingredients.Having the ingredients is one thing, but how to make it, I don't know how to bake a cake, so I'm just guessing, you would want to notice how the chronicle of Edmund Dante is actually an interesting one if you read it as a map, instead of reading it like: enemy beats you, face consequences, got a helper/mentor, survive, and get revenge, you read it as something like this, like on a map: face a dangerous cliff, fall, get a life--saver, with an effort climb up from the bottomless pit, seek, goal, go back to dangerous cliff, master it. If you observe it that way, you will see an even moreold--fashioned style, brought to another genre, and becomes something completely new. Thus, I conclude by saying that Dumas did something, whether he knew it or not, or did that through another pass with his genius, like that, which is kind of making a cake based on a hypothesis, using a new way with a little bit less risk, and being successful! Dumas did just that, except in literature, it's not so risky( I wouldn't do that for a cake though, one: it's too risky, and two: it might ruin the cherry! ). So Dumas successfully manuverered through the \\"baking\\" process.Alas, the cake is made! Now for the critics to make their comments/harsh and absolutely unfair remarks, or criticisms. The book might be better if Alexandre Dumas had just made the character more three dimensional and still be able to master all the harshness in his way. Then, the book will be even more the genius it is, and if Alexandre Dumas doesn't have the genius to do that, then leave it to Romain Rolland, or some other better unknown chef in the near future! And second of all, this should've been done more old--fashioned like, make the lady stay true to Dantes all the story long. If the reader look at it that way, that might be able to leave more space for stories for times gone by than before! Man, not old--fashioned when not supposed to--and old--fashioned, never!Oh, whoever said the above, and especially the last sentence, tell me, I'll go give him a piece of my mind.The text is wonderful, barely or never any spelling errors, the paper is thick for classics of its size, and it's still able to fit the entire book in one volume. Able to rival the Modern Library Giants or the company that published Harry Potter. Really!So, this review ends. I hope it's not too long for the reader, and I hope you like THIS small cake. Alexandre Dumas was a great writer of many novels, and The Count of Monte Cristo is not his only masterpiece. No doubt people at that time is calling The Count of Monte Cristo a \\"coming of age--story\\", like their calling Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix right now! He had a lot of literary friends, and many of my French favorites. So enjoy! And if you've already done that, enjoy again! Read more about his life. Trust me, it'll be worthy of your time. All in all, Alexander was a coming of age author, and he is one of the greatest novelist, etc. right now. His novels are timeless, pure arkenstones, never to be forgotten, leading leaders in literature right now, and have the words: big classics written, engraved/burned all over it.

I love the approach, but in the end, it's too durn long.

Dumas captures the imagination of his readers as he leads them through the life of Edmond Dantes. Through Dantes, Dumas relates to everyone who has ever wanted adventure, romance, and of course revenge. It seems as though Dantes is a real human. Dumas uses true tallent in the way he shows the feelings, thoughts, and actions of every character in his novel. This novel is long but never old. It captures the mind in a truly complex intertwined story of a poor young man accused of a crime he never committed. For this, his wonderful life is destroyed. He spends several years in prison. Upon his release he then uses his acquired knowledge to repay his enemies in a most interesting way. All of this leads to an ending that is as good as the rest of the story. This is truly a masterpiece worth reading. Everyone should read this novel. It's worth it."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Just finished reading this classic novel again for the second time. I read it the first time over fifteen years ago and at that time I considered it to be my favorite novel ever. Since then, I have probably read close to a thousand books (which is about as many as Harriet Klausner reads in a month) in the past decade and a half, and I still have to put this one alone at the top. It's the best! Reading it a second time made me appreciate it even more.I have seen all of the movies that have been made from this incredible book. None of them have even come close to doing the novel justice. It is great to see that most of the Amazon reviewers concur! At the time I am writing this review, there have been 80 reviews of this book and it still is able to retain a five-star rating. That says a lot. Most of the classic novels that have been reviewed on Amazon have 4 and a half stars. However, not this one!A lot of novels (particularly ones that are considered classics) take a while for the reader to really get into them. Not this one folks. From the first chapter on, the novel takes hold of you and just never lets go. Believe me, once you start reading this it's almost impossible to stop. You don't want to sleep, you don't want to eat, you don't want to talk to anyone, etc... all you want to do is continue reading on about the life story of our hero Edmund Dantes. The book may look a bit long, but believe me, you will be wishing that it was a hec of a lot longer once you are finished with it.So order this now and I promise you won't be disappointed. It's a masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Just a quick review on one or two technical details that someone might want to know who already knows what a great classic story this is. Why this translation? Why kindle if I have to read it from start to finish every time? I'm glad you asked.Pretend I've already gushed about how wonderful the book is, Dumas is, and all that. Now, let's get down to business. I first read the \\"unabridged\\" version published by Modern Library back in the mid 1990s. I thought it was unabridged because it was so long and nothing seemed to be left out: subplots, dialogue, characters, etc. What I didn't know until the Robin Buss translation came to my attention years later was that I had been reading the Victorian version of the novel. One that ranks right up there with Constance Garnett's translations of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky (avoid them if you don't want \\"watered-down\\" versions.) The point is they left out the more \\"adult\\" things that would have put off or shocked Victorian readers back then. They also side-stepped language idioms to avoid confusion.Ten years ago when I was shopping for a replacement translation, I used a little litmus test on evey copy I picked up to see what the translator did in a certain scene. It's the beginning of chapter 49 or 50 (depending on which edition you have) titled \\"HAYDEE\\" or \\"HAIDEE,\\" in which the Count enters the quarters of his slave Haydee and she asks him why did he ask for permission to enter her room rather than just come in. He says something like, \\"Haydee, you know,\\" or \\"Haydee, you well know.\\" To which she responds (in the ML edition), \\"Why do you address me so coldly, so distantly?\\" ...WHAT?!For someone like myself who had never read the original French editon this came off as a bizarre thing to say. It's like: Babe! He's only said three or four words to you since he entered the room- what are you talking about? But then I discovered the Robin Buss translation and he explains that like many romance languages there is a formal and an informal way of saying \\"you\\" to someone. In Spanish it's \\"tu\\" vs. \\"usted.\\" In French it's \\"tu\\" vs. \\"vous.\\" So in the original novel Monte Cristo responds with the formal word \\"vous\\" which causes her to question him. However, since in English there is only one version of \\"you\\" for any situation, it wouldn't make sense for her to ask, \\"Why do you not say 'tu' to me as usual?\\" Robin Buss corrects this and I am thankful for it.Finally, to address the practical problem of this version not having mobi-like chapter navigation or access. This does stink. If you're like me and sometimes enjoy rereading a book out of order because you like to revisit favorite parts, you're out of luck unless you know exactly the digit location of the paragraphs you seek. The solution is simple even though it does take a little time. I found out that by bookmarking every first page of a new chapter, it allows me to create a table of contents that I can navigate through by going to the \\"My notes and marks\\" menu. Like I said, you do have to go through the book at least once to obtain these marks, but it's worth it if you ever want to go back and refer to a chapter somewhere in the middle of this epic without going crazy.Hope this helps with customers who were unsure why they should consider this translation or were thinking of skipping it altogether because it has no automatic chapter navigation.Thank you and happy reading!March 2010 Update: Found out table of contents IS accessible on the kindle. Sorry for the confusion. Either my kindle was updated, or I didn't read the directions onscreen when searching the TOC."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas p&egrave;re. Highly recommended.As translator Robin Buss points out in his introduction, many of those who haven't read The Count of Monte Cristo assume it is a children's adventure story, complete with daring prison escape culminating in a simple tale of revenge. There is very little for children in this very adult tale, however. Instead, the rich plot combines intrigue, betrayal, theft, drugs, adultery, presumed infanticide, torture, suicide, poisoning, murder, lesbianism, and unconventional revenge.Although the plot is roughly linear beginning with Edmond Dant&egrave;s' return to Marseille, prenuptial celebration, and false imprisonment and ending with his somewhat qualified triumphant departure from Marseille and France, Dumas uses the technique of interspersing lengthy anecdotes throughout. The story of Cardinal Spada's treasure, the origins of the Roman bandit Luigi Vampa (the least germane to the novel), Bertuccio's tale of his vendetta, and the account of the betrayal and death of Ali Pasha are few of the more significant stories-within-the-novel. While Dumas devotes an entire chapter to bandit Luigi Vampa's background, he cleverly makes only a few references to what will remain the plot's chief mystery-how the youthful, intelligent, and naive sailor Edmond Dant&egrave;s transforms himself into the worldly, jaded, mysterious Renaissance man and Eastern philosopher, the count of Monte Cristo, presumably sustained by his own advice of \\"wait\\" and \\"hope.\\"This novel is not a simple tale of simple revenge. The count does not kill his enemies; he brilliantly uses their vices and weaknesses against them. Caderousse's basic greed is turned against him, while Danglars loses the only thing that has any meaning for him. Fernand is deprived of the one thing that he had that he had never earned-his honour. In the process, he loses the source of his initial transgression, making his fate that much more poignant. The plot against Villefort is so complicated that even Monte Cristo loses control of it, resulting in doubt foreign to his nature and remorse that he will not outlive.This long but generally fast-paced is set primarily in Marseille, Rome, and Paris. It begins with Dant&egrave;s' arrival in Marseille aboard the commercial vessel Pharaon and ends with his departure from Marseille aboard his private yacht, accompanied by the young, beautiful Greek princess Hayd&eacute;e. What gives The Count of Monte Cristo its life, however, are the times in which it is set-the Revolution, the Napoleonic era, the First and Second Restoration, and the Revolution of 1830. Life-and-death politics motivates many of the characters and keeps the plot moving. Dumas also uses real people in minor roles, such as Countess G- (Byron's mistress) and the Roman hotelier Signor Pastrini, which adds to the novel's sense of historical veracity.The most troubling aspect of The Count of Monte Cristo is Edmond Dant&egrave;s himself. His claim to represent a higher justice seems to justify actions and inactions that are as morally reprehensible as those that sent him to prison, for example, his account of how he acquired Ali and his loyalty. Had he not discovered young Morrel's love for Valentine Villefort, she too might have become an innocent victim. As it is, there are at least two other innocents who die, although one clearly would not have been an innocent for long based on his behaviour in the novel. One wonders of Dant&egrave;s' two father figures, his own flower-loving father and fellow prisoner Abb&eacute; Faria, would have approved of the count.The translation appears to be good, with a few slips into contemporary English idioms that sound out of place. In his introduction, Buss states that the later Danglars and Fernand have become unrecognizable and that Fernand in particular has been transformed \\"from the brave and honest Spaniard with a sharp sense of honour . . . to the Parisian aristocrat whose life seems to have been dedicated to a series of betrayals.\\" There is never anything honest or honourable about Fernand; his very betrayal of Edmond is merely the first we know of in his lifelong pattern.What seems extreme and somewhat unrealistic about Fernand is his transformation from an uneducated Catalan fisherman into a \\"Parisian aristocrat,\\" hobnobbing with statesmen, the wealthy, and the noteworthy of society. This, however, is the result of the milieu that the novel inhabits. During these post-Revolution, post-Napoleonic years, Fernand could rise socially through his military and political accomplishments just as Danglars does through his financial acumen. Danglars is careful to note that the difference between them is that Fernand insists upon his title, while Danglars is openly indifferent to and dismissive of his; his viewpoint is the more aristocratic.Countess G- is quick to point out that there is no old family name of Monte Cristo and that the count, like many other contemporaries, has purchased his title. It serves mainly to obscure his identity, nationality, and background and to add to the aura of mystery his persona and Eastern knowledge create. What is most telling is that his entr&eacute;e into Parisian society is based primarily on his great wealth, not his name. Dumas reinforces this point with Andrea Cavalcanti, another mystery man of unknown name and reputed fortune.I have read The Man in the Iron Mask and The Three Musketeers series, both of which surprised me with their dark aspects (the character and fate of Lady de Winter, for example) and which little resembled the adventure stories distilled from them for children and for film. When I overheard a college student who was reading The Count of Monte Cristo on the bus tell a friend that she couldn't put it down, I was inspired to read it. I couldn't put it down, either, with its nearly seamless plot, dark protagonist, human villains, turbulent historical setting, and larger-than-life sense of mystery. At 1,078 pages, it's imposing, but don't cheat yourself by settling for an abridged version. You'll want to pick up every nuance.Diane L. Schirf, 12 September 2004."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"For the past year, I have thought that Austen's Pride and Prejudice would remain my all-time favorite book, but now I see that I am mistaken, as The Count of Monte Cristo has DEFINITELY topped P &amp; P on my list.This book, about the transformation of Edmond Dantes from an unsuspecting, guileless, innocent young man into a vengeful, dark, and clever man, and how the newly born Dantes uses his fortune and wit to avenge his past life, is one book that I shall never forget. I simply could not put this book down, and was even scolded by my family for neglecting my meals, sleep, and work to read this enchanting story. The details, the plot thick with intrigue and secrets...all of this and more were combined by Alexandre Dumas to create a masterful work of literature that one will surely come to appreciate greatly. I urge you, READ THIS BOOK! You shall not regret it!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Novels such as these convince me that the larger the story, the more profound will be its ending. There are too many features to this book to do it justice. The basic story line follows Edmund Dantes, a young sailor accused of treason. He is sentenced to life imprisonment, but (as one can guess might happen) he manages an escape. The rest of the novel follows his plan to revenge himself. The whole while, the reader never knows how evil prison has made Dantes, and the possibility that he will spare no one in his mission is quite plausible. What emerges is a suspense in terms of plot and character intertwined.Anyone interested in reading a huge book, but unsure which one to try first, this would be my top recomendation. Dumas' style is suited to suspense, adventure, and action, but is also moving and has penetrating insights into humanity. One will also find a wealth of descriptiveness to let your imagination absorb itself into another world. It is easy to read, and easy to pick up where you left off, in case you need to take a break from it."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I had previously kept way from Dumas novels thinking that they were about swashbuckling and helpless maidens. Since I decided that I should read more classics this year, I picked up this book. Since the film should be releases soon, I figured I should read it before seeing the film might ruin it for me.That being said, this book was an exceptional story, and lives up to the acclaim. Rather than recount the plot, I will give a few reasons for my 4-star rating. The action begins immediately. While some books walk into the story, this book has significant plot development in the first few pages. Contrary to my preconception, there was really no fighting in the book. The action comes as the Count's intricate plan of revenge unfolds. Dumas does a great job of combining narration with introspection. While unraveling the plot, he provides insight into the emotions and personalities of his characters. In addition, the book isn't mired by excessive language. All in all this is a great story that should appeal to both men and women. I was able to read all 508 pages in a week of leisurely reading.On a negative point, this specific edition contains numerous typographical errors. Somone favored the letter \\"A\\" over \\"S\\" and many words are misspelled. If that is important to you, I would suggest you try another edition."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"'The Count of Monte Cristo' is part thriller, part love story and part drama. Its got alot in it, but all of it is fantastic. Edmond Dantes is unjustfully set-up and imprisoned early in his young adult life, just as things were beginning to go his way. Thus begins the plot of the transformation from Dantes into the Count of Monte Cristo after he escapes from his prison dungeon at the Chateau D'If.The story unfolds for a thousand pages about his vindication and revenge on those who mercilessly and vilely allowed him to rot in his prison over the course of many years. When he finally escapes with secret knowledge about a treasure, he uses all the means of his disposal to turn his life around as well as infiltrate the lives of those that did him an injustice back when he was Edmond Dantes. The book includes everything from islands, ships, Paris, the country, guns, poisons, chariots, wealth, poverty, and an infinite amount of intrigue. Sometimes Dumas takes a couple hundred pages to set up someone who you haven't seen in awhile in a new identity, but he never leaves you hanging without wrapping up the past, present and future of all of the players in the story. One of Dumas' greatest elements in this book is to set up story well in advance. The astute reader will appreciate his care and concern for knitting a tightly bound story.When I was given this book for Christmas, I saw the 1168 page length and thought to myself, &quot;I may start it, but I will never finish this long book.&quot; Much to my pleasure I finished the book yesterday and just had to write a review about it. I read about 500 pages and then put it down for a couple months. After picking it back up four weeks ago, I found it so interesting and intriguing that I ripped through the final 600+ pages. It really is one of the most wonderful books that I have ever read. I would recommend that you read the unabridged version rather than the abridged to gather the fullness of rich imagery and deeply developed characters in the book. Alexandre Dumas' &quot;Count of Monte Cristo&quot; is well worth the time it takes to read."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Perhaps one of the best novels ever written, the Count of Monte Cristo is a story of an innocent man that seeks to revenge his wrongful imprisonment. Dumas brilliantly confronts themes pertaining to nearly all facets of human existence including that of justice, revenge, love, friendship, greed, jealousy, etc.Despite its vivid detail and striking character development, the novel reads rather easily and quickly. This story has been the inspiration of many great movies, most notably, that of The Shawshank Redemption (1994).Truly a classic and a must read."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is perhaps one of the best literary works of all time. Riveting, it is the story of a young man, Edmond Dantes, who is falsely accused of treason by three selfish villains who each desire something different from Dantes; The story is set in 19th Century France. Dantes is a young, strikingly handsome, 20-year old newly-apppointed ship captain with his whole life ahead of him. He is about to marry the woman of his dreams, a young, vivacious, awesomely beautiful Catalan girl from France named Mercedes. For reasons unbeknownst to him he is betrayed by three cruel, evil men, accused of treason, and secretly heralded away to the foreboding Chateau de If prison where he serves almost 14 years in solitary confinement. With the help of a wise old abbe, he successfully institutes an escape plan; After a daring, nerve frazzling escape, he sets about to claim a vast, hidden, enormous fortune that is hidden at the Isle of Monte Cristo. After locating riches beyond imagination, Edmond dons the title the Count of Monte Cristo, he is a man of immense wealth, stature, class, and a man of society. But with all the riches and fame bestowed upon the Count, he must complete some unfinished business. That is, he must enact revenge upon the evil men who robbed him of his youth, the love and life of his father, the loss of his betrothed, and his prominence as a ship captain. You will find yourself seated at the edge of your seat, perhaps stopping only to take care of life's necessities because when Monsieur Le Comte de Monte Cristo enacts his revenge, he takes no prisoners. The Count of Monte Cristo captures our very essence as we watch his plan unfold before our very eyes. He carefully and fastidiously orchestrates his plan of revenge to punish the men who acted so predictably and maliciously against him. This book gets five thumbs up because it demonstrates vulnerable life experiences that happen to many of us. That is, to say it is a story about true human courage, emotion, greed, jealousy, betrayal, and revenge. And, the count makes the punishment fit the crime for each man. This book is not for the squeamish or immature at heart. One of the best novels of all time."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"A stunning book, absolutly chock full with DELICIOUS plot twists.

Accused of treason, he is betrayed by those close. Vivid characters riddle the book with personality and it's suspense and language kept me up 'til my alarm clock rang for work the next morning - I didn't want to leave the world that was made such a comfortable home for me, the world of The Count of Monte Cristo.Truly this book proves that it is not the destination, but rather the journey that makes all worth while.It is pure adventure, a hypnotic and tantalizing tale of romance and revenge and the transformation of a man.Don't settle for the movie, as the book is worth every second spent reading. My only regret is having read the abridged version."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"In my opinion The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the most riveting literary masterpieces of all time. For anyone who is looking for a novel that combines romance with high adventure will find this a highly satisfying book. The story is set in 19th century France. The storyline concerns a young man named Edmond Dantes who has his whole life ahead of him. After being promoted to ship captain, he makes plans to marry the love of his life, Mercedes. He is suddenly betrayed by three jealous rivals and arrested on the eve of his wedding, being unjustly and falsely accused of treason. He is transported to an island fortress prison where he remains in confinement for fourteen years. Dante's dying cellmate reveals to him that there is a vast, hidden treasure buried on the island of Monte Cristo. Edmond promises to escape the dungeon and seek out the treasure. After orchestrating a narrow escape, Dantes finally discovers the vast fortune on Monte Cristo. Edmond Dantes becomes the Count of Monte Cristo and returns to Paris to seek out the one he loves and also to use his new fortune to seek out revenge on his betrayors. A tale of high adventure, romance, and vengeance. Personally, I would highly reccomend taking time to read the complete and unabridged version.

Throughout this story I am constantly amazed at the insight into human emotion, pain, intricacy and joy that Alexander Dumas had. The story fills your head with another time and place- it takes you there. You hurt for the Count, begin to understand his thinking and are with him as he incredibly takes revenge on the men of his past and their families by becoming one of them, and later begins to see that vengence is, in fact, not his alone. As he begins to desire peace once again, he begins to feel again...and to weep for the love lost. This book is more than amazing - it is an experience that has put into me considerations and dreams that move me still - long after I have finished looking at its pages. The invitation? ...Come and ache and love and hate and hurt and grow and LIVE! Go to another time, another place that will effect and move you, and perhaps change you, here and now. It's worth your time."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I read the Count of Monte Cristo after the movie had already come out. As a 14 year old I set high standards for it because the storyline in the movie really pulled me in. What I got was a book that completely shattered those high standards and raised the bar still higher! The Penguin Classics version has a great translation and you feel as though Alexandre Dumas' words and lines are living. You feel as though you are living in the Napoleon era and can witness all these heart stopping adventures in the process of exacting revenge. I would highly recommend this book to action, suspense, adventure, and even romance story lovers. This book is on my top 5 list. I'm even re-reading it! I started to read the abridged version but I don't recommend this because comparing it with the unabridged you find it hasty, vague and not as engrossing. Unless you are younger or want an ok book that reads faster then you should try the abridged version. So go out and buy this book but don't be intimidated by the size because by the end you will wish it was three times as thick!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Beloved classic literature for $.99! I had already read the book at least 3 times over the last 55+ years, but I wanted it on my Kindle so that I could read a chapter or 2 between reading through other books in my library (Sort of a change of pace kind of thing). It's not like I don't know how it ends. I started reading it after knocking off 2 of Dean Koontz's \\"Odd Thomas\\" novels. Rather than starting the latest \\"O. T.\\" thing, I started re-reading the \\"Count\\", and became too engrossed in it to go on to something else.What I like most about the Kindle edition is being able to get a dictionary definition of many of the archaic and out of use words that must have been commonly used in the 19th century.The use of the word \\"Illustrated\\" is a little misleading - I've read over hallf of the book and found only 1 small drawing of the publisher's logo at the top of the beginng page. However, this edition includes an excellent foreward with numerous links to Wikipedia, that gives the reader a sense of the times in which the story takes place.

It is very long but has become one of my favorites!If you have watched the movie and thought it was just OK you definitely need to read the book because it a whole lot better!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Let me say first that this is NOT the book I read when I was in school. For years I had a vague recollection of The Count of Monte Cristo as some required reading, a tale of a man wronged and his ensuing adventure as he attempted to take his revenge and right the wrongs done to him. As a child, I knew nothing of the foreign origins of some books and the process of translation to make them accessible to me nor of the concept of abridging a document from the original form as written to a presumably more digestible, shrunken version better suited to those with shorter spans of attention or time constraints.The story, to be painfully brief: This is the story of Edmund Dantes, a man of bright prospects and on the verge of wedding the beautiful Mercedes. Betrayed by envious friends, Edmund finds himself spirited away to a prison island. Despondent and having given up all hope of his release and of a reunion with the love of his life, he resigns himself. While in the depths of despair, he meets an eclectic and learned fellow inmate. They immediately bond and Edmund's newfound friend becomes as a father to him and proceeds to teach him all that he knows: languages, culture... and of a mind-boggling buried treasure. Edmund manages to escape the island prison years later and makes his way to the island of the buried treasure, not really expecting to find it. What he finds is treasure so vast as to make a king blush. Newly wealthy, learned, and free, Edmund assumes the identity of the mysterious Count of Monte Cristo and sets in motion the machinery of revenge...I returned to this book as an adult to satisfy my own curiosity and to add flesh to my memory of the adventures of Edmund Dantes that were admittedly skeletal. Because of my previous experience, I was expecting the same stilted, simple read I remembered, a children's book. Initially I was shocked, having done some research to lead me to this particular translation, to find over 1,200 pages of text. That rivals the intimidating girth of my copy of War and Peace. I took the plunge, though I also committed myself to dropping the project once it became apparent that I'd never make it to the end. I needn't have worried. To my amazement and pleasure, I found a tale of adventure of epic proportion replete with revenge, murder, love and loss, in the best tradition of operatic drama. For those of you who love to read and shy away from this because you think you've already read it or that it is only for children... trust me: you haven't, and it's not.This review is for the particular version translated by Robin Buss. This is an excellent and modern translation, executed with an academic's eye for accuracy but the flow and readability of a novelist. Anyone who has compared different translations of novels knows how vastly different the two readings can be. It is not just a matter of age, either, where modern readers can stumble over words or stylistic cues that one may consider archaic. It has more to do with the translator's understanding of the intent of the author, of the subtleties of style, of context, both historical and within the story itself. The Buss translation is, in my opinion, THE translation to read. The beauty of it is that the translation does not get in the way, it is invisible. It is the author Dumas one hears, not the translator Buss, and that is the brilliance of this translation. As a bonus, there are fully thirty pages of notes on the text at the back which I found illuminating and useful.But 1,200 pages, you say? Don't have time, you say? I was so thoroughly sucked into this tale of revenge and adventure I completely lost track of time. By the time I finished I felt only that it was far, far too short. I suppose it has to be so that, as a child, I was offered only the abridged version; I would never have put up with a book as long as this one. As an adult who loves to read and appreciate, however, I will be forever grateful to have been let back to this rich, amazing tale at full strength. I recall turning pages by the hundreds, fully engrossed; the lawn mowing would have to wait until next weekend...Make no mistake, while reading this unabridged version will evoke in you a child's excitement and sense of adventure, this is a book for adults to appreciate. Read it, enjoy it, get lost in it. Unequivocally recommended at five stars."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"this book is one of my favorites. once you get to the action, you simply cant put it down. it is filled with something for everyone: betrayal, action, murder, romance, and even a little mystery."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I can't tell you the number of times that I have read The Count of Monte Cristo. I have studied several translations and many abridgments. Although nothing is a truly adequate substitution for the unabridged version, this the by far the best that I have read. The story flows nicely, and unlike some abridgments, there is not the feeling of having missed something. The major details and plot lines are all present, and the characters are as genuine as in the unabridged versions. I would highly recommend this abridgment over the others on the market."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Was forced to read as a teenager and just read again in my 40's. Wonderfully written (maybe a little wordy), awesome characters, love story, adventure, intrigue, etc. What more could you ask of a book?"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Unsure of what I can add I will only say that this book will stay with me for years. Read it, enjoy it and reflect on it. PS This version is well formatted for Kindles."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is the best version I have read to date. Unabridged, with good notes, and from an excellent translator - Robin Buss."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"LOVE this book. I found it engrossing. The path of revenge was great. I love how it shows that revenge doesn't necessarily always make you feel better."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The book is a little hard to follow, but the storylines come together perfectly! I was amazed at the level of detail and planning foresight of the author. I highly recommend this book to anyone looking to expand their knowledge of famous classics.Dumas is a literary genius!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Took a little while to grab my attention but once it did I was hooked. I usually only listen to audiobooks at work. I have a job in which I can listen while working but cannot read. Le Conte snagged me and on more than one occasion I had to listen on the way home in the car. Much different than the movie; better than the movie. If you have a large amount of time and want an adventure, then this book should be on your list. Predictable but also with lots of surprises."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Very well written story. Would recommend this to everyone. I've enjoyed this author for many years. You will have a great adventure with this story."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is the best book of all time! I've read other classics and they paled in comparison to ''The Count of Monte Cristo'' There is no other book better than this one in my opinion."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"My son is an avid reader and is interested in reading the classics. The look of the cover is very nice according to my son. He said he is looking forward to reading The Count of Monte Cristo! It's is the second classic I have purchased for him and will continue purchasing more of the classics to help him build up his library of classic books."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Unabridged is better and this translation is the best. It maintains the beauty of the original language and descriptive details that readers have loved for generations."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"If Edmond Dantes was a contemporary character he'd probably be running amok through France dismembering his enemies, uttering stupid one-liners (&quot;Consider that a divorce, Fernand!&quot;), carrying a big gun, sleeping with a reluctant-how'd-I-get-involved-in-this-great-big-mess-unbelievably-gorgeous-female-protagonist and heading out to his luxury, bullet-proof yacht never to be heard from again at the end of it all -- unless the gross is high enough to warrant a sequel.Luckily, Dantes is not a contemporary character and in the quite capable hands of Dumas we have one of the most hell-bent on revenge characters ever born from the pages of literary fiction. The revenge is slow, coldly calculated and deliciously deviant. It is both refreshing and encouraging to read a story that is properly developed not just a book-waiting-for-a-movie-deal plot. If you're a fan of contemporary mysteries and thrillers, do yourself a favor and read this book. You'll never look at a 90-minute action flick quite the same."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is an excellent book. I love the classics and had somehow managed to have never read this one until last year. Amazingly, it feels like a story upon a story upon a story. It has the beautiful quality of building anticipation from beginning to end and continuing the story when you are afraid it is about to end! More recent books always leave you with the feeling that you want to know what will happen next when the book has ended, this story gives you everything you could ever want and more beyond your imagination. I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The greatest story of revenge ever told! The un-abridged version is the only way to go with this book. The everyman's library hardcover is a beautiful book with very nice pages. It is a very sleek stylish looking book too when you remove the cover slip."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"If you have not read this book you are missing out. I highly recommend it to anyone. It is long but don't let that stop you from reading it. I think this has to be one of the best books I have ever read in my life and so look forward to one day reading it again!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"and Robin Buss, as others have said, is the best translation for this classic. It is a long read, but better than any abridged version. You will be unable to put this down once the story begins. Very very well written, and well translated."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"An oldie and a goodie. Thoroughly enjoyed Dumas' writing style and his incorporation of history into literature. Worthy of a re-read or two."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I read this book on a whim after seeing it mentioned in another book. I was not expecting to like it as much as I did."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This was my first E Book and figured I would start with a classic I have always wanted to read. It has been fantastic, and I never lose what page I am on!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This book and the film of the same name have very little in common. For instance, the romance is very played up in the movie and mostly incidental in the book. You'll notice that some of the villains are far more menacing in this book than you'd expected as well. I think that this book is a good book and really the movie seems as if it's from a completely separate story that just happens to have some connecting points. My only real criticism is that this book, like many from its time, is very long and you can get bogged down in details. Thankfully, Dumas' style is actually not that hard to read and the book felt worth it."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I got this because it sounded good, and how can you pass up a Kindle freebie. Besides a good classic is hard to pass up."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"When I paid for this book, I ordered the ADULT version of The Count of Monte Cristo. I was sent a copy of an illustrated children's version which is what I DID NOT order. What I tried to purchase was the exact book that fit the description I read before I added it to my cart. I still love Amazon, just a bad experience with this purchase. Oh well."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I cannot compare this to any other translations, but I imagine this to be faithful to the text. It is a great, smooth read."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is beautiful writing. I absolutely love this book, and I love the story. I'm not sure which version I read, it had a lot of French in it, and it was not an easy read. But worth it. I might get an easier version and read it again.The writing style is like poetry.Edmond Dantes\` is wrongly imprisoned from accusations made by people he trust. When he escapes, he seeks revenge, one of the best revenge stories ever written.I do have one complaint; I read this after seeing and loving the movie (2002, Jim Caviezel and Guy Pearce). The movie didn't quite follow the book. I hate to say this, because it does not happen often, I liked the movie better than the book. But definitely a must read. If you haven't seen the movie or read the book, I suggest you read the book first, and then see the movie. I wish I had gone in that order."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I read it in class. Great book! Nice story line and it caught me and I couldn't stop reading it!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This book is considered one of the best works of Dumas and is included in the top 100 novels at [...].... But, it's a very, very long read. Not that the twisted (often convoluted) story isn't intriguing. Most of us are probably aware of the story and most of us have probably seen one (or two) of the hollywood versions of the book. Just like most movie-adaptation/written-word works, the book far exceeds the film(s). Differences are as small as location details and as large as, \\"That's how it ended?!\\"One of the things a book can do that a movie can't is give you a depth to its characters. And character development is what really lets us know (and love/hate) the heroes/heroines and villains in a story. I think if you take the time to read this original version, you'll find a new side to Edmond Dantes and many of the other literary mortals described in the pages of this complex classic."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This translation has me captivated. I am a Master's student, and I find the vocabulary engaging and challenging, all while keeping the mood of each scene as Dumas may have originally written it."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I read this novel a little over a year and just realized ai never reviewed it. The version I had was the free amazon. I read another review stating that this version is a repackaged version of the gutenberg version which would be the way to go since it is unabridged and free. You can save yourself the. 99 cents if that is the case.The book itself is by far one of the best I have ever had the pleasure to read. The story revolves around Edmond Dantes and his multiple personalities (the Count of Monte Cristo to say the least) and how he embarks on a personal vendetta against those who had him falsely accused and imprisoned for some 20-30 years of his life.Even the part when he is in imprisoned is crucial to the story as that is what really sets things in motion as he realizes the true reason behind why he is there.If you have never read any classics this is the one to start with. It is a lenghty book but one well worth the experience. If possible, get the book directly from project gutenberg as it is free. Amazon's free version is jo longer available."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I'm having trouble putting it down. I know now that I will be reading more classics. Excellent stories of each character. Like reading a history and a how to on revenge. It keeps you wondering."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is my favorite book: The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas (published in 1840).This 1200 page juggernaut is a story of one Edmond Dant&egrave;s, a young sailor on the verge of being promoted to captain, and starting a life with his longtime love, Mercedes. Plotted against by jealous rivals, Dant&egrave;s is implicated as a Bonapartist traitor and thrown in prison. Revenge ensues!Dumas writes revenge like no one I've ever read. Though at times the main character seems needlessly ruthless and not particularly likeable, I just could not put this book down - well, except when it got too heavy to hold (Whew ... 1200 pages is heavy!). This is a book that will remain on my bookshelf forever (though probably not one I'd read as a bed time story to a kid).Pick it up (if you're strong enough) and give it a go - I don't think you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"It is not quite true that the publishers hide the fact that this is an abridged edition - it is printed under the title but is difficult to notice. After the 30 introductory pages you'll find a \\"Translator's Note' that tells you that \\"a distinct prejudice against length now exists\\". Well, in my view it is a poor taste to shorten a classic book. The book is excellent but get the full version."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This book proved to be a worthy companion during a battle with the flu. The magnificent story of Edmond's transformation from a love-struck innocent to a coldly calculating avenger elevated me from a sea of rumpled sheets and tissues to a place of high adventure. His story completely captivated me, and his methods of giving reward to his true friends and exacting careful revenge on his enemies enthralled me. My husband, who had read the novel, grew tired of my croaky requests of &quot;What happens next?&quot; but refused to give anything away. &quot;Just read it&quot; was his advice, and this is the advice that I give to you."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Nineteen year old Edmond Dantes is falsely accused and incarcerated by three men; one sacrifices Dantes to his ambitions, one covets his fiancee, one is jealous of the young sailor's success. His unbearable captivity in the Chateau d'If lasts until his ingeniously conceived escape fourteen years later. When he returns to wreak his terrible vengeance on the men who imprisoned him, he is no longer the naive, idealistic Edmond Dantes; he is the cunning, cynical, and fabulously rich Count of Monte Cristo.The complex plot of this book makes it slightly challenging, but the suspense and intrigue more than compensate. I thoroughly enjoyed this fictional masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"One of the best books I have ever read. It's the story of Edmond Dantes, who is imprisoned by his enemies. After a miraculous, but very believable escape, he plots his revenge. It's a page turner with action and intrigue. 150 years after it was written, it still resonates with the reader. Read this book, you will be thankful you did."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"When I was a student in high school, my English teacher attempted to convey to my class the meaning of a &quot;classic.&quot; Her effort would have been nearly nonexistent if she had only suggested we read this book. This book is everything a modern day novel dreams of being. It contains murder, mystery, love lost and found, suspense, hope, suffering, happiness, sorrow, ...the list goes on. My only fear is that I will never read an equal to this masterpiece. Now I am positive that &quot;classic&quot; is not a reference to soda, 50's rock and roll, or cars. Do yourself a favor and read this book."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is a timeless classic to be treasure for all time. I want to become one with the Count. His power and passion for revenge is heart stoping. His lust of life suckes you in and don't let go until you come to understanding of yourself. If there is one book to teach young adult respect, disapline and selfworth this is the one."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I just finished this book and I agree with all the positive comments previously posted. Just wanted to add a few thoughts.This book was originally serialized in a French magazine back in the 1840s. As a consequence, there are repeated cliffhangers at the end of every chapter. Now I don't mind cliffhangers (hey, they move the plot along) but after 116 of these it got a little old. In addition, some of the character transformations seem implausible and Dumas gets some of his facts mixed up from the early part of the novel (I probably would as well).I could pick bones about some part. What was the purpose of the whole Cucumetto bandit story? Maybe Dumas was saving him for later but he never does. They plot also needs a miraculous set of confluences to happen in say, well, every part of novel. Entertaining, yup, but at times I just said, &quot;Oh come on now!&quot; The character of Monte Cristo is a very interesting one. If he could ever hook up with Hannibel Lector, another guy who has the highest level of expertise in nearly every field and endeavor, the rest of us would be in big trouble.Buy this book and enjoy it. It's really quite fun and you'll learn a lot about French history and culture."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This book didnt seem like the type I would like, at the begining I hated it. The more I got into the book the more I liked it. I have to write a paper on it for my Honors English class, and since I loved the book I think writing the paper will be easy. Instead of dont judge a book by its cover... Dont judge a book by the first few chapters!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I am reading the original (French) version side by side with this one, and I have to say that often the translation does not capture the strength and beauty of the original text.

I love classics, but my book club doesn't necessarily - this was a big hit though.

Classics do not only thrill and teach, they also live.The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas is a classic.This tale of accusal, love, betrayal, imprisonment, redemption, and retribution, defies genre.Recounting the plot serves no purpose, so I will simply surmise that most readers focus on vengeance at the expense of reward. Edmond Dantes could not have desired living just to kill those who wronged him; he expected to return to those who remained faithful. Here Dumas, using Dantes, Sinbad, Albert and Abbe Busoni, championed a nonviolent stoicism which exposes a person to death to experience life.The Count of Monte Cristo is a vivid potrayal of French life after the Revolution, an epic account of a man's quest for closure and an inspiration for the Shawshank Redemption. It is never too late to read it."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the best books I have ever read. It was captivating.

How it consumes him every waking hour of his life. He beleves he is doing gods vengence on those who wronged him. But starts doughting it all when little Edword dies unsuspectingly. and how he realizes vengence is for god to do not him, and that this vengence has cost him his happiness all those years.

The 1000+ were well worth the read for the amount of life lessons presented. The plot builds slowly and then picks up pace - the last 300 pages were so hard for me to fully appreciate because all I wanted to do was find out how it was all going to end. Try to read this during vacation because having to put it down is so torturous - I tried reading it on my daily commute but truly enjoyed it when I was on a beach and finished the last 600pgs without any interruptions. Beautiful story about love, revenge, patience and the ability to let go."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This novel artfully provides the best elements of any story: Revenge, adventure, love, action...it's all there. A little slow to start but worth giving a try if you love an epic read."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"And yet the workout,in the way of Anna Karenina, or the whole of the Potter series like most quests for agility and strength is one well spent; what Dumas accomplishes in over a thousand pages is an epic story spanning the breath of the human experience. Drenched in the saturated sweetness of the Romantic tradition, the story of intrigue includes conjectures on things from the stock market, to immunization. Serialized, much like any rampant edition of Order and Law in an SUV, it heralds the imagination, in an age before accessibility and technology. Do yourself a favor: read it."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I have to say that I have seen all of the movies and I was skeptical that the book could be significantly different.

The book is beautifully written and this is by far one of the best books of all time!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Even in the movie V for Vendetta, V was watching the Count of Monte Cristo. It was well worth the 3 months of on and off reading. With limited time I was able to squeeze in a 1% here and there. This writing of Dumas is absolutely amazing. His ability to captivate your mind and take you on a journey that involves so many personalities is without a doubt a stroke of genius. Now if we could only get Hollywood to make a movie that follows the book even if it was in two parts it would become an instant classic."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I highly recommend reading the unabridged version of The Count of Monte Cristo. If you pick the abridged, much shorter version, then you will miss countless secrets, meticulous acts of vengeance, and a great love story.

Yes, it is a long book, but they are pages well worth reading, each and every one."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is a book so famous that almost everyone has heard of it, and many people have read it - or so they think.

Translator commentary and footnotes are interesting, rather than intrusive. It's still a fabulous read."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all times. Definitely read the unabridged version if you have the time (I couldn't imagine what they would have taken out!). A classic filled with adventure, justice, and romance.

I love how Dumas writes subplots that all get entwined all through the book. I've read the abridged version, too. It's not even close to being as good as the original. If you only read the abridged one, you'll miss a lot of the plot that is very important.

BUT, be warned, you must read the UNabridged version. I just read it and cannot fathom reading it any other way. My advice: read The Count of Monte Cristo, read it ALL."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Hi, I am from Glendale, California and I attend school at Clark Magnet High School; anways, I started reading The Count of Monte Cristo when my Mom refereed me to this book and at first I was kind of skeptical about the fact that this book was really long and was translated from French. Then really got into the book and finished reading it, in a week. This book is filled with philosophy, ideology, divinity and almost every other kind of study that has to do with our everyday life. Dante, who is the main character and the hero of the book is a mastermind of planning his attack though he waits for years and years and trusts god as his usher through the process of him taking vengeance on the people who have done him bad. I know that there are many translated versions of this book, but I have read the one translated by Robin Buss. The font on this book is very small and hard to see, but still if you can not find others, I would advise anyone to read this book. I personally think that this book is a little bit too complicated for a teen audience, but don't let my words stop you if you want to try this book. Alexandre Dumas has written many fiction novels including The count of Monte Cristo , but a think this one is his best novel and one of my favorites also. If you really want to read this book and comprehend every detail, I suggest that you take notes and write down all the names because there are people who bounce from section-to-section and some of them have many identities."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"There have been many heroes in the classics. None, however, equal Edmond Dantes. He is the most inspirational character in literature. Left for dead in a horrid French prison, he rises up and becomes a man of incredible means. Once a worthy ship captain, he comes to master such arts as chemistry, medicine, swordplay, gunplay, language, and disguise. Once an honorable young man, he now seeks vengeance from those who wronged him. Edmond is a calculating man in his ventures. However, he is not cruel. When he exacted his revenge on the lawyer who wronged him, he realized that he had gone to far in allowing the death of the lawyers child. His thoughts were &quot; God is no longer with me. I have gone to far. We shall spare the last&quot; (meaning Danglars, another man who wronged him). Noone can equal him in his prowess. His mastery of the duel is truly scary. He became a distinguished noble in French society, by using his charm. However, he always had a plan, and that plan was payback to those who ruined his young life. The Count of Monte Cristo describes his payback, in all his glory. The book shows that the world still has justice. A very thought provoking yet highly entertaining masterpiece!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"One of the VERY FEW books I've ever read more than once and still found myself drawn into.

Brilliant!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is a moving, spectacular piece. It is the greatest novel that I have ever read and I hope others will give it a try. The novel is full of twists and turns, providing for a captivating story, as the reader follows the Count through countless changes and metamorphoses. It is a wonderful, creative story that is, in my books, heralded as one of the greatest of all time. However, as it is a complicated and long story, one should not choose to read the Count if one is looking for an easy read. I read it in my freshman year of high school, for the first time, so I think that the novel is appropriate for many different age levels in all its complexity. The story, in certain editions, comes with a table of characters, which makes the comprehension of the novel simpler, yet I think that it is much more fun to discover on ones own the outcomes in the book. What a wonderful literary classic! Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I was absolutly intrigued from the very first page. The rapid sequence of events makes it impossible to put the book down. I particullarly favor the part when Edmond is in jail and befriends, and later gains immense knowledge, from the Abe. I was panicked when Dantes attempts to escape (and succeeds) after being hurled into the ocean in place of his dead friend. I love the genius character (Edmond Dantes)that Dumas has created.

You can make a good argument that this is the best novel ever written.

The Count of Monte Cristo has never had a better translation."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I'd never read it so I decided to tackle the unabridged version - all 1200+ pages. It was worth it. There was a lot going on in this book. I got tired of the revenge angle after awhile. While I could understand it, it seemed a shame that such a rich and talented character couldn't have done more with his life than getting back at those who'd hurt him. It was kind of sick after awhile."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This book has been quoted extensively and has remained a part of the literary canon for centuries and with good reason - it's simply a phenomenal work of art. The kind of dense fiction with multiple storylines and huge casts of colorful characters has sort of disappeared in this day and age, which is why works such as this one will always continue to engage and inspire us. Dumas' novel of revenge paints a wonderful picture of what high society was like in Paris at the time, all while following Edmond Dantes' plans to exact revenge upon the people who put him behind bars due to their jealosy and greed. He was simply a good man who was too trusting of those around him and this trust got him locked away for 14-years. Everything that happens in this novel flows so smoothly, and although the 1400+ pages is daunting, it is certainly worth your while. I'd love to see writers today try to write again with this kind of density. I really can't say enough how fantastic (I'm running out of superlatives) this book is and I know that anyone who reads it will agree that Dumas is a literary genius. This book is \\"Infinitie Jest\\" if Wallace's book made sense all the way through, \\"Atonement\\" if McEwan branched out and tried to fully flesh out the personalites and traits of all of the characters, and \\"The Corrections\\" if it had a more exciting plot (All of these books rank up as some of my favorites, but each succeeds in only a few ways, while I feel this book does it all).Just make sure you're ready to commit a few weeks to this one. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"dumas as evidenced by books like the count of monte cristo and the three musketeers has no peer when it comes to the adventure novel category. if you are sensible and believe that all those crappy nytimes-recommended-boring-serious novels are not all that constitutes good fiction, well you are on the right track with this one. 'made up stories' don't get any better than this."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Don't be afraid of the length of this book.By the time you are done you will be wishing this story would never end.This book will satisfy everyone,the adventurer,the romantic,the young and the old,It is everything you want in a great read."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Truly one of the great classics. I've read Le Comte de Monte Cristo 4 times now and each time it gets better. This printing was nice that it included endnotes to help explain some of the finer points of Dumas's epic tale of love and revenge. No matter how many times I read this I find myself wishing I could step right into Dumas's tale and take part. The power of Dumas's writing is best when you re-read the book and find yourself just as engaged and more than that you find yourself trying to will Le Comte to alter his course of revenge. A great book that is very difficult to put down until the final word."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"While it doesn't indicate it, this is a heavily abridged version of the story, and pretty much just deals with the elements contained in the 2002 film. It's still a good story, but gets 2 stars for not indicating that it's abridged, and because even at 1400 pages, the full unedited story by Dumas is MUCH richer and makes for a much more satisfying story. Do not cheat yourself of that satisfaction by settling for 1/3 of the story."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I started this book with some reluctance. I already read and enjoyed the abridged version and was concerned that the extra pages in the full version were taken out for a reason. I'm happy to report that the full version is even better than the abridged. It fills in the abridged version's gaps, adds some exciting chapters, and provides more background on the characters. My only quibble is that Dumas wrote the original story for a series published in a periodical. He was paid by the line and in some conversations it shows.An added bonus is the introduction and footnotes provided by Robin Buss. The footnotes explain Dumas' historical and literary references. The introduction provides good background and analysis. The book is loosely based on a true story.Those who have only seen the movie versions will enjoy the book. Because of the book's length and complex subplots the movies can't do it justice. Hopefully someone will do a miniseries based on the book. In the meantime, new readers are in for a treat."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is the best book I have read. I am young, and yes I have not read many classic novels, but the immense amounts of joy I have recieved from finishing this story is far better than any other written material I have read!!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo was a Superhero long before Superheros were cool.A 19th-century cross between James Bond, Batman, Zoro, and Dirty Harry, the title character is a seemingly all powerful and all knowing master of all trades, whether languages, art, chemistry, disguise, psychology, philosophy, theology, international relations, literature, protocol, diplomacy, or combat. But he is also deeply conflicted and brooding man who builds his life around a dramatic quest for revenge against the men who ruined him early in his life, but who along the way darkly questions his decisions and motives.As a young man, Edmond Dante had the perfect life: a beautiful fiance, a promising career, and dedicated friends. But the jealously of a few people around him combined with some unfortunate circumstances, ruined him, and he ended up jailed for life on the harrowing island prison Chteau d'lf. After an apprenticeship with learned co-prisoner Abb&eacute; Faria, Dant&egrave;s makes a daring escape from Chteau d'lf, finds millions the then-dead Faria had hidden away, and then changes his name -- Monte Cristo is the name of the fictional island where Faria's treasure was hidden -- and begins his epic quest for vengeance.It is not inaccurate to look at The Count of Monte Cristo as a novel about revenge, but it is much more than that. It is a story about love and anguish, about sin and redemption, and about light and darkness. It is also an extraordinarily captivating read, the rare example of important historical literature that is also a good fit for reading on the beach or during airport layovers, and an appropriate read for anyone in his or her early teens and onward into old age.The book is also a great conversation piece: while I was reading it, at least half a dozen people stopped me to ask what I thought of the story, often with nostalgic and wistful looks in their eyes.There are some flaws to The Count of Monte Cristo that are common with 19th-century literature: a complicated cast of characters, for example, means the reader must keep up with many names and relationships. And the reader must also employ a willing suspension of disbelief, not only to accept that the protagonist can rise from such humble origins to become so good at everything he does (this is the case with almost all Superhero stories), but also in order to believe that the cast of nefarious enemies in mostly modest circumstances who wronged him at the start somehow rose to become the wealthiest and most powerful group in early 19th century Paris. The neat ending in which no evil-doer is left unpunished and almost no worthwhile personage is not left standing seems too neat and pat, even by today's Hollywood standards. But are these really flaws in the book or of the times?I choose to think it's the latter, which is why I believe this dark and fascinating story is so important and worthwhile, a real thriller that puts modern representatives of the genre to shame."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Bottom Line: Blackstone's audio version is the Lorenzo Carcaterra translation.

However, having plowed my way to the end, I am tempted to classify this along with \\"Dracula\\" as a \\"classic\\" novel whose reputation rests more on its great beginning than on its middle and end. It was great up to about chapter 30 (describing the betrayal, imprisonment and escape of the hero, and the reward of his friends). However, once the story starts to sink in to the prolonged revenge, it starts to lose its way for me.After chapter 30, the hero becomes a sort of divinely inspired madman, who imagines himself to be, and apparently is, a mere tool and agent of God's justice. His behavior transcends moral laws, his plans transcend human intelligence, and he becomes impossible to identify with as a character. Fortunately, there are plenty of other characters, and the story, from this point on, is rarely told from the mysterious Count's point of view. If you are willing to settle in and be patient, you can have some fun watching the weaving, interacting sprawling plot threads. Even so, when it was all said and done, it was wrapped up in a way that left a bad taste in my mouth.I would not, however, recommend reading an abridged version. Too many threads intersect, and you cannot trust an abridger to like the same parts that you will like."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"In this romanitc novel events do not develop quite as quickly as in another very famous Dumas classic, The Three Musketeers. A young Catalonian sailor, Dantes, is unjustly accused an imprisoned--his enemies believe for life. However, he gets an education in prison from Faria who also reveals to him the secret of the enormous treasure hidden, of all people, by Ceasare Borgea. The young sailor miraculously survives his daring escape, obtains the treasure, and uses it to inflict dreadful punishment on his enemies and to reward those who tried to remain loyal to him. Dantes, who morphs into Count Monte Cristo and, along the way, into a cast of supporting characters, sees himself as an instrument of vengeance in the hands of God, whose name he constantly invokes (too often perhaps). But his faith is peculiarly non-Christian, since he harbors earthly hatred and a burning desire for revenge, and has no intention of forgiving his enemies, until they have been reduced to utter misery. Hence all the trappings of the Orient in Monte Cristo's retinue, his furnishings, and even his eating habits--remember he refused to eat when he met his once beloved Mercedez. He is not ready to be merciful and forgiving. Dumas mentions, kind of warily, that Dantes at one instance, toward the end of his vengeance, did reflect that perhaps he has gone too far, but overall, it's still a nice romantic story of love, hate, and ambition where God and faith intervene on behalf of Earthly justice."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Judging by the reviews here, criticizing this book is like criticizing Shakespeare -- anything less than full throated praise is dismissed. Let me be clear: I loved this book and it was well worth the time it took to read. It is deservedly considered a timeless classic.Nevertheless, it definitely has a pace that is not seen in modern books. If this had been created by a contemporary writer it would probably be about 25% shorter. I'm not saying that would make it better, it would simply make it a book created for modern sensibilities.If you like fast-paced modern writing, you will definitely need to recalibrate your expectations. Once you accept this book on its own terms, it is a very rewarding read."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"After having let this book languish on my TBR pile for over a year, intimidated by the sheer size of it, about a month ago I found myself in the mood to read a \\"chunkster\\", and so gave it a go. And now, having made my way through all 1462 pages, I can best sum up my opinion of the book by simply saying - it is very long.Alexandre Dumas' classic tale of revenge tells the story of Edmond Dantes, handsome young French sailor. The story opens in Marseilles in 1815 when he is in his early twenties; having just been promoted to captain of his own ship, and about to marry the love of his heart, his life is full of promise. But alas, in his circle of acquaintances are three people whom he considers friends in some degree or another, but who are actually enemies. Motivated by jealousy and simple, pure hatred of the enviable Dantes, they frame him for treason and he is thrown in prison for life without even the benefit of a trial. After 14 years in prison, through a series of providential events he manages to escape, finds himself in possession of a vast fortune, and begins the long, slow process of enacting revenge on all those who caused his wrongful imprisonment.The first 500 or so pages, which recount the story up to Dantes' escape, were well-paced and interesting. Likewise the last 300 or so pages, in which his elaborate schemes of revenge are finally realized and his victims fall like so many dominoes, was fairly interesting (although by then I was mentally through with the book and so sped-read much of the ending). It is the 700 or so pages in the middle where the story lags, sags, and drags on endlessly.This is not a tale of redemption, forgiveness or any other noble human trait -- although at the very end Dantes (now the self-styled Count of Monte Cristo) does feel a bit of remorse as he finally realizes he has gone too far. This is a tale of a man whose life becomes consumed with seeking all-out revenge, pure and simple. It is also a tale of adultery, murder, betrayal, depravity and numerous other ugly human traits, played out by a large cast of characters whose relationships are more intertwined than a plate of spaghetti (making the story, for me, the equivalent of a 19th century French soap opera). At the center of it all is the Count of Monte Cristo, a totally unrealistic and over-the-top character who is a master of disguise, omnipresent and omniscient, and who has a masterful command of seemingly every topic from the arts to finance to arms to soldiery to you name it. Just how he came to possess such varied knowledge and talent in the 10 years or so between his escape from prison and when his elaborate schemes of revenge began to play out is never really explained. Nor is the reason behind his vampire-like paleness and aversion to eating, although it seems to be important since the author has various characters commenting on it throughout the book.If you just want to read an over-the-top tale of elaborate revenge then I suppose you would enjoy this -- obviously many people do since it is such an enduringly popular classic. I would highly recommend an abridged version, however, since there is much that could be cut out of this doorstop of a book without losing any of the meat of the story. If, however, you are set on reading an unabridged version then I do not recommend this particular one (published by Modern Library Classics). It is full of typographical and punctuation errors and it doesn't have any annotation or notes, which I would have found very helpful in understanding many of the comments and references throughout the book.I don't totally regret having spent four weeks on this book, if only to be able to say I've read it. But this will probably be my first and last work by Dumas."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"What I'd like to write to Blackstone Audio Classic is 'why did they leave out the chapter towards the end when Edmond returns to the Chateau d'If?'

The characterization, the way that each of the \\"bad guys\\" had their own reasons for being bad, and Dumas forces us to understand, the way that the Count is caught up in being (forgive me) torn away, the way that he believes himself unable to move on without revenge, and yet he has already in body. The wonderful Haydee (who is very similar to the Haydee in 'Don Juan' by Lord Byron), both passionate and demure, both constant and painless. She gives the Count a life he lost in the Chateau D'If. (Oh, the Chateau actually exists, so look it up on the 'net while readin that part for a visual, or, I should say, a secondary one.)And NEVER forget Luigi Vampa, the lord of the Count's underworld! The embodiment of careless mockery! Oh! Even Franz could love him!DO NOT ASSUME THAT YOU KNOW THIS BOOK IF YOU HAVE SEEN THE MOVIE. Do not give credit to the terrible abridgement the movie attempted to call The Count of Monte Cristo. All the \\"bad guys\\" were all rolled into ONE person, the Count himself was not nearly so evil, and many other terrible changes that destroyed the darkness of the book... The one that takes the cake is the AFFAIR between the married Mercedes and the Count! I couldn't believe it! The Count DESPISED her after she married his nemesis!Anyway, this was a really cruddy review. Read the book!she who is no longer the Angel of Music"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I bought this book new thinking I would get a book in perfect condition, wrong.

SUMMARYI wrote a good paragraph summary of TCOMC once, but it doesn't stand up to the official AMAZON summary, shown here:\\"Imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit, Edmond Dantes spends 14 bitter years in a dungeon. When his daring escape plan works, he uses all he has learned during his incarceration to mastermind an elaborate plan of revenge that will bring punishment to those he holds responsible for his fate.No longer the naive sailor who disappeared into the dark fortress all those years ago, he reinvents himself as the charming, mysterious, and powerful Count of Monte Cristo.\\"2. MISUNDERSTANDINGSOne reviewer [PurpleKat] suggested that you should ONLY read this book if you have 3 days to spare, since \\"you won't be able to put the book down, or if you do, you'll move zombie-like through your everyday tasks while your mind stays with the adventures of Edmund Dantes.\\"...I'm sorry, but this isn't a genre piece. It's just not. You WON'T be able to skim through it like a Dan Brown or Stephen King novel.It's just not happening. Too bad, PurpleKat....I guess the main reason young people ignore this book today is because of its length - something close to 1,500 pages of small text.The length may seem daunting to young readers, since the books we read today average in the 200 page mark, if even. But step back a century and the books are a LOT longer.Think of some great novels from the 18th Century: War and Peace, Madame Bovary, the Hunchback of Notre Dame, the Man in the Iron Mask. Those books are looong.They are daunting reads. I'm sure you know the feeling of holding a 4 inch thick, 3 kilo, size 8 print, 100+ chapter book in your hands, or reading all day on your Kindle to find the progress bar reads 3%. It's enough to put off anyone.But, once you get involved in the narrative, the length won't matter. I have NEVER heard of someone not liking a good book because of its length,Basically, this is the promise that Alexandre Dumas makes to you when you start his book:\\"Are you willing to take a leap of faith [and stick with the book through the slow parts]? Or become an old man, filled with regret [for not reading Monte Cristo], waiting to die alone [in shame and embarrassment]?\\"That takes care of length.P.S. Don't even think about buying the abridged version! Trust me, I have read it by accident, and NOTHING made sense. I started to ask myself questions such as \\"Danglars - what? Who is Mercedes?\\"The abridged version is a CHOPPY, CONFUSING, mess.(Like the 3rd Pirates of the Caribbean movie!)3. SHOULD YOU READ IT, WHY?At its heart, The Count of Monte Cristo is not JUST an adventure novel. It's not JUST a love story, or revenge tale, or historical novel.It's all of these and more.Do you want me to tell what it's about?The Count of Monte Cristo is:An epic. Historical fiction. An adventure novel. A mystery novel. An escape story. A love story. A thrilling tale. A cautionary tale. A happy tale. A tale of revenge. A tale of heartbreak and loss. A tale of love. A tale of corrupt officials, innocent maidens, murderers, bandits, prisoners, priests, good men, bad men, corrupt men, noble men, sad men, happy men, mysterious men, geniuses, assassins, lovers, and the man who tried to play God. It tells us that the past is never forgotten, that good men can do evil things, that evil men can do good, that love flourishes in the unlikeliest of places, that revenge is a dangerous and powerful thing, that love can triumph over evil, that your past will always catch up with you, and finally...the thrill of Revenge is sweet!4. CONCLUSIONThree words: Read this book.Thirty-four words: The Count of Monte Cristo is one of the greatest, most electrifying books you will ever read. Full of compelling, driven, and dangerous characters, thrilling adventure, heartbreaking romance, and moving sequences. If you are an accomplished reader, it will have you riveted.5. PRONUNCIATION GUIDE:These are all the accurate, FRENCH, translations of the words. Trust me - I know French, and this is how they are pronounced in the official audio-book from Books on Tape, read by Richard Matthews.Just say \`em how you read \`em.

Reading a 700 page book in size 8 font on tiny pages is a little daunting. This is going to sit on my bookshelf until I get a real sized book."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"First I will say if it was not for the Kindle, I probably would not have attempted to read this book as I tend to stay away from long heavy books in hard to read typeface, however with the Kindle it becomes much easier to read such a book. I will not try to explain the book as many other readers have already done so. The one thing I found a bit difficult was that the same characters had different names and titles, this plus the number of characters made it a little hard to follow in some parts what was happening. Also I am not used to the French terminology which also hindered somewhat my understanding. Nonetheless it is a deep and complicated work which comes together in an interesting and comprehensive manner. It also gives a good picture of Parisian society as it existed in the early nineteenth century. I found a lot of similarity between it and Russian society as painted by Tolstoy in \\"War and Peace\\". One thing that surprised me was the Count's treatment of Mercedes, if I was in his position I know I would not have treated her as a betrayer and do not in fact think that she was. It was also surprising to see that hashish was so romanticized in that period, I would not have guessed that there would have been any great awareness of it at that period of time."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Although viewers of the various movie versions may think that they know the story, the novel takes numerous twists and turns which are far too complex to be told in a couple of hours. The subplots are as exciting as the main plot, and Dumas weaves them together into a seamless whole.The Kindle edition is one of the better transcriptions that I've seen, with consistently good editing, no typos, and the placement of the footnotes does not distract from the flow of the text."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"There are two criteria for a review here, the book, and the actual story itself.The story is 5 stars out of 5 no doubt. It's a literary masterpiece. An absolutely compelling story of revenge with an amazing character dynamic.The book, which is unabridged ( what's the difference? About 500 pages; fairly significant ), is the best. I wouldn't recommend the abridged version, you don't get the feeling of satisfaction of reading the actual book and abridged is like reading a really long summary that actually makes less sense than the book because of the random introduction of characters.So we've established that the story is fantastic and a timeless classic, and the unabridged version ( which this particular penguin classics is ) is the best to get. Now I must talk about the elephant in the room, the actual book. I have a lot of Penguin Classics, The Epic of Gilgamesh, The Consolation of Philosophy, and Sir Garwin, etc. These books are extremely short, 2 - 300 pages max. Well, As we all know, The Count of Monte Cristo is a bit longer....about 1000 pages longer to be specific. So what's the result? A publishing company that specializes in smaller to medium sized books trying to bound a 1300 page monster. The binding is absolutely terrible! I feel like every time i pick the book up it's going to fall apart. I've been a long time fan of paperback books, but I really wish I had not bought this book as a paperback. Don't get me wrong, I'm a big fan of Penguin Classics and their books, but they definitely should have used a different binding method for this particular book.Overall:5/5 stars on the story, and plot2/5 stars on the actual book and binding"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I was impressed when listening to Bill Homewood abridged version and often wished that there was an unabridged version (by Bill Homewood) and there it was. I'm very lucky as my son Darin and his wife (Caroline) gave it to me for Christmas. It was incredible. He (Homewood)does, BY FAR, the best job and although I have listened to many versions Bill Homewood does the most outstanding job. As you see I can not say enough about his presentation, I have many other audio versions of the Count of Monte Cristo. It's a great book made magnificent by Mr. Homewood.

The description on the back cover misleads the consumer into thinking that one is getting so much more than the full text (the edition includes a brief introduction of the author, critical analysis and explanatory notes). I'd rather do without the side commentary and get the full original manuscript. The problem isn't that the editor decided to abridge the book, but that they chose to conceal this fact from the reader.The removed portions are integral to the storyline and I was left baffled by how disjointed the novel seemed, so uncharacteristic of Alexandre Dumas. Then I found out it's not the author's fault.Book is highly recommended, but I would also recommend that readers invest in more trustworthy versions out there."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I thought this story was very difficult to follow. I even restarted it after reading the first hundred or so pages. Now I know why...there are several chapters intentionally omitted in this version, making it impossible to make sense of the text.

Do not buy this book, or any other \\"Enriched Classic\\"."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I strongly recommend readers to buy this version - the unabridged version with the excellent translation by Robin Buss. It was thanks to Amazon readers that I first found out about this version -> I had just read the Club Dumas by Arturo Perez-Reverte (which I also highly recommend) and I was curious to read novels by Dumas. I think I had read the abridged version of Monte Cristo back in high school (over 20 years ago) - but I learned from Robin Buss that the version most of us have read was an antiquated Victorian English translation which doesn't reflect the style of Dumas and omits key parts of the novel due to Victorian-era censorship. Here's what Robin Buss has to say on page xxv of his intro: \\"Anyone who has ever read The Count of Monte Cristo only in the \\"classic version\\" has never read Dumas' novel. For a start, the translation is occasionally inaccurate and is written in a nineteenth century English that now sounds far more antiquated than the French of the original does to a modern French reader.\\" I'd like to share that I thoroughly enjoyed this amazing tale with this excellent translation. I found it to be a gripping story and I had no problem sticking with this novel - all the way to page 1,243 - which I finished reading moments ago. Also - I found the detailed notes provided by Robin Buss to be incredibly valuable. In the notes, all the \\"nuances\\" and even \\"inside jokes\\" within the novel are explained. Some things that contemporary readers would simply understand (due to recent events, and the French revolution, etc) that are unlikely for most modern day reads to know.I whole-heartedly recommend this -and I will look for more classics that have been translated by Robin Buss, because I feel like I discovered a treasure."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is a must reading for any reading lover. It easily ranks among the best 20 novels ever in any language. Just one piece of useful information for kindle users. This is NOT the Modern Library edition. I downloaded the free sample from my kindle and I am glad I did. This is a mobile 'cheap' edition with the text only that I can get for free some place else. Amazon should be careful in listing books, because not all editions are the same. If this was the Modern Library edition, I would happily pay the $0.99 they are asking for."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Ok, so the first time I read this book was when I was a senior in high school. Being the fact that I am a sucker for those love stories where the guy gets the girl in the end, it was only natural that I would enjoy this book. But the best part about it is the twist in the plot and how eventually The Count of Monte Cristo reveals himself to those who knew him before the self-appointed title.Its a classic by Alexandre Dumas and I do believe that this is one of those books (like \\"Catcher in the Rye\\") that you just have to read in this lifetime!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"It would be a futile effort to try to express in words just how excellent this story is. Stories that have been called &quot;classics&quot; have been labeled as such for a very good reason. I think anybody who has read and liked Tolstoy, Renault, Shakespeare, Leroux, Homer and R.L. Stevenson will enjoy this outstanding tale.I highly recommend that the reader keep a couple of sticky notes and a pencil handy. Be sure to compile a list of names and a brief description for EVERY character introduced...you'll need this reference as events unfold.The book cover/binding itself is rugged and can take a serious beating. For any story that's this compelling and 1400+ pages, the quality of the book itself becomes important since you don't finish such a long story overnight. My book survived the London subways, streets of Paris, German autobahn and my luggage to/from Ukraine--all without any problems. The font is larger than any paperback (or hardcover for that matter) and is easy on the eyes. As with any Modern Library production, the quality of this book is exceptionally top notch."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I am unclear why the Modern Library version is called \\"unabridged\\".

She loved it too.Dumas makes you fall in love with his characters, with Mercedes, Edmond Dantes, Abbe Faria, Valentine, Haydee, M.Morrel.... and he makes you hate the bad guys, Danglars, Villefort, Morcef... But in the end you end up doubting just like M. Le Comte....

Edmond Dantes is a young sailor who has everything he needs in life. He has a wife and a large amount of money to start a family. He is betrayed by his friends and sent to the dreaded Chateau d'If, and is imprisoned for life. Edmond thinks his life is over, so he swears vengeance to all who betrayed him. Edmond makes a miraculous escape and puts his plans into motion. He is determined to gain vengeance and nothing thrown in his way will stop him. He adopts the name Count of Monte Cristo and becomes friends with the ones who betrayed him. He gains his vengeance slowly by revealing little secrets about each of them, while revealing nothing at all about him. This is a story of a man who was wrongfully accused, and was able to escape and return the favor to his friends. The Count of Monte Cristo is an amazing book by Alexandre Dumas, and it is also one of his best."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Alexander Dumas was an early 19th century writer who would be considered a writer of suspense novels or thrillers today. He wrote in the Romantic style of the day, but he wrote adventure novels that became popular bestsellers. The escape into the past, especially the reign of Louis XIV, or the Napoleonic Wars, was fictionalized and romanticized. One can imagine the mulatto French writer, mind off into a world of adventure and a quill pen writing endlessly as he burned the midnight oil. Escapist literature, it seemed, was well received in France. His novels enabled Dumas to live an extravagant lifestyle which resulted in his demise. He died penniless because he had spent so much of his money on women, alcohol, card games and pursuits of pleasure.Dumas most recognized work is The Three Musketeers but &quot;The Count Of Monte Cristo&quot; is his best work. It is his most well written, his most expressive, psychological and deepest work of fiction. It is not just a revenge tale. Ultimately, it sends a message against taking revenge and living a life of virtue. The hero, Edmond Dantes, is a young man in the French navy, who has jealous enemies. He is accused of aiding Napoleon's escape from his island exile, and sentenced to life imprisonment in a gruesome island prison (like a French Alcatraz). His fiancee, Mercedes, is left alone to grieve his terrible misfortune. During his imprisonment, Dantes befriends an old man who inspires hope in him and moreover, shows him a map of treasure worth thousands. Dantes escapes the prison and finds the treasure, becoming a powerful and wealthy Count.Finally, Dantes, in his guise as the Count of Monte Cristo, extracts revenge on his enemies, especially when he finds out Mercedes has married his worst enemy and birthed a son. The last parts show Dante at his most inhuman, as his revenge is manifested, he realizes he is losing his humanity, and even Mercedes no longer sees the good man she once saw. Mercedes and Dantes do not end up happily ever after, nor married, as films often portray. Their tragic parting is a reminder to Dantes of his flaw of revenge. The novel is poignant, well written, a classic sure to enthrall French literature fans as well as fans who love to curl up with a great book of meaningful adventure."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"somehow i managed to get out of school without ever having read this book. what a bummer, because i truly loved it! i couldn't put it down! i even brought it with me in the car and read it at the red lights. i started reading it because the movie was coming out and i thought i would just never get to it if i saw the movie first. but i waited, read the book and just saw the movie last nite. the book is better because it is more detailed, but the 2002 movie version is worth the [money], on its own. it's different enough from the book that those who have read are still entertained. and vice-versa to those who have seen the film...READ THE BOOK, TOO! it's wonderful and i had a lot of fun reading it."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Last year my grandfather recommended this book to me. I snorted, thinking, yeah right, I highly doubt I'm gonna read a book like The Count of Monte Cristo any time soon. But after I picked up the novel and actually started to read it, I slowly became more and more fascinated with the plot. As a 12 year old reader I struggled with parts of the book, finding them dull and tedious, but the struggle is worth it in the end!Alexandre Dumas creates a fabolous tale of revenge and hate in which Edmond Dantes, a young sailor in love, is betrayed by three men of power. Edmond wastes 13 years of his life in the Chateau d'If, a terrible prison in which Edmond loses faith and all chances of ever being with his love again. While there, Edmond learns of a treasure buried on the island of Monte Cristo, and creates a master plan to seek revenge on his enemies, if and when he escapes.I highly recommend this book, and if you're too lazy to actually pick it up and read it, at least go and see the movie!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I was surprised how brilliant this book was. After the first few chapters the story was so compelling that I could hardly put it down.

I can't say enough about this book that already hasn't been said. I only regret that I haven't read the unabridged edition yet.My only complaint would have to be the numerous spelling mistakes. Examples would be, misspelling a character's name in the character list in the beginning of the book... and throughout the book simple words such as was or house are typos. These mistakes distracted me somewhat, because I had to stop reading and figure out what the word was supposed to be... but otherwise the book is great."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Probably the best story I ever read.

The reviewer who said it's the &quot;reworking of a true story&quot; may be factually correct (I personally don't know) but it is irrelevant. The story is good but the writing is GREAT! It could have been the story of anything. Dumas' insight into the human mind and his style of writing, and his use of suspense is what makes this book a five star, not merely the story."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Truly the best book that I have read in my whole life. I have been able to have so many nights in which I would lie in bed for an hour just pondering the great ideas about the human nature that this book inspires.

Everything about it is amazing. The plot is captivating and fulfilling. Dantes's intricately planned vengeance on the men who ruined his life is so detailed and amazing it leaves me speachless. I love how the book leaves hints of future events and things which at one point may not make sense. Later, however, their purpose is revealed and they help the reader to understand the current events as well as show the how the past, present, and future of Edmond Dantes's life is connected.

Dumas brilliantly confronts themes pertaining to nearly all facets of human existence including that of justice, revenge, love, friendship, greed, jealousy, etc.Despite its vivid detail and striking character development, the novel reads rather easily and quickly. This story has been the inspiration of many great movies, most notably, that of The Shawshank Redemption (1994).Truly a classic and a must read."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is a fantastic book! It helps to have some background in French history (of the Napoleonic era, to be specific) to really understand what's going on.

I called my cousin, who suggested the book to me, every night, and we had detailed discussions of what was happening. I was highly disappointed when I discovered that it was not on my school reading list for this year. If you like dull, informative books with few characters and no suspense or mystery, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK! However, if you are normal, you should definitely read it."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The story itself is excellent and gets you involved with the first page you read. The only problem is that this translation leaves too many French words unexplained. This makes some of the sentences look too awkward. I assume these words were simply copied asis from the French version."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Yo, this book is really cool, Edmond Dantes is a man who never gives up and fights against all odds.

I'm still in love with it."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Alexandre Dumas was considered in his time to be the foremost adventure novelist. What he created in The Count of Monte Cristo is so much more. The story chronicles the journey of Edmund Dantes, a young and hopelessly naive sailor as he matures into the worldy and cynical Count bent on revenge. Had Dumas ended there, he would have written a stupendous and sweeping saga of adventure and drama. The greater relevence of the story is in its moral telling: Edmund Dantes regains his humanity and learns to live again. Here is a story of spiritual redemption, told against the backdrop of post-Napoleanistic France. It is a tale of love, of loss, of revenge, and of the rekindling of the heart. While the unabridged story is long, it is best enjoyed while seated in front of a fire, with a warm beverage in hand.

The characters seem to come to life as The Count goes thru his trials and tribulations. This has it all: Adventure,suspense,joy, tragedy ,Love , hate and Let's not forget Revenge.

You will in all probability forget about the size as you keep reading, and the Count emerges as an enigma. Also buy get yourself a decent translation of the book, and the unabridged version.

At first I wasn't too excited because I knew the book was from the 1800's and I thought it would be a difficult read. I also saw the movie made in 2002 beforehand and remember not liking it too much. None of the movies they have made to this day do the book any justice though.As soon as I started reading it I was instantly hooked. Dumas has a way with words that makes you feel like you are actually there with the count from his downfall to his eventual revenge. The story is epic in scope and the language is easy enough to understand that I had no trouble following the plot. Each of the characters is believable and the subplots fit perfectly in to the overall story. Once I started reading this, I couldn't put it down.I'm now a sophomore in college, and I've read read the book 3 times now. I suspect I'll read it many more times throughout my life.

I had caught the last part of a version of the movie with Richard Chamberlain and couldn't quite fathom why he was so bent on revenge, so I thought I would get the book and find out for myself. This is not a story of 'forgive and forget' by any means and does not teach Christian charity and forgiveness.

It's compelling, fast-paced, intriguing, romantic, heart-wrenching, and most of all -- the adventure of a lifetime. Alexandre Dumas is one of the most brilliant storytellers of all time. Just as you think you have the plot figured out, a new twist surfaces. Just when you think it couldn't get any better ... it does. Witnessing the transformation of Edmond Dantes into the enigmatic Count of Monte Cristo is both fascinating and tragic. It is, of course, the consummate tale of revenge. But how sweet is that revenge! And how harrowing. Just as fascinating as the Count himself is the cast of supporting characters. You will remember them all long after you've finished the book. Who can forget the villainous M. de Villefort, deceptive Fernand, beautiful Mercedes, greedy Danglars, mysterious Abbe Faria, noble Maximilian, innocent Valentine, loyal M. Morrel, or wise and gentle M. Noirtier? I could go on and on. Every one of them is intriguing in their own right. Just try to put this book down. It defines \\"page-turner\\". I did nothing but talk about this book the whole time I was reading it, and long afterward. I cannot recommend it highly enough. A must-read."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I think that The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas is one of the greatest works of all time. Edmond Dantes, its protagonist, experiences character change to a degree that few other characters in literature ever achieve. Set in France, near the year of 1815, Dumas sees Edmond quickly betrayed and imprisoned in the Chateau D'if. The story wastes no time. His love is married to another man and he is forgotten to all but the least few of the world. Upon escape, he finds himself the unlikely recipient of a host of wealth. A grand treasure. But Edmond seeks revenge with it.And so the story follows one of the wealthiest men in Europe, bent on gripping the last drop of revenge out of his enemies. Edmond is pleasant, affable, and wise. But his motives are dark. He feels like he is the hand of justice. He even says it: \\"Please believe I've put my task above the mean level of personal vengeance. I am exposing criminals, not for their sins against myself but for their black injustices to others... not only for what they have done but for what they continue to do. They are the ones devoid of all humanity, the ones that profited by the sufferings of others.\\"For anyone not willing to become accustomed to a book written mostly of dialogue, this book will wash over the eyes in overwhelming waves. Not a bad thing, but for those who are willing to push through the learning curve, the book is a masterpiece; it can deepen your life. The dialogue is elegant and flows out of the page and into the reader like courses in a $400 meal. Word after word, delicious.Few other novels in literature stand equal with Dumas' masterwork. This is a classic so far beyond what you will find in the Harlequinn section of your local bookstore that it is almost a must for cultured humanity. Even if the book is not to one's taste, it should be seen and admired in the same fashion that the starry night sky should not be ignored. Mankind has very rarely topped this work."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Favorite book of all time in my library. The other views pretty much sums it up. All I can add is you should read this book sometime in your life."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is my favorite book of all time and this was the first time I have read a modern translation that is unabridged. Buss does a wonderful job capturing the essence of this novel. The added scenes in this unabridged edition also adds a lot of background and clarifies many ambiguous events. This edition reads much more smoothly and coherently than the original 1850s translation and I'd recommend this translation to all of my friends and family."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I will not give a description of the book like everyone else. i am not a writer. i did however enjoy reading this book. and if you are looking for a classic novel to put under your belt, this is a good one to do it with! loved it!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Old world type thriller. Definitely better than the movie. Talk about revenge being best served cold. This is the epitomy of that."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Not your too-boring-to-read classic, this adventure will definitely keep your interest. The story line is well known. Edmond Dantes returns from a job at sea at age 19 to the promise of a beautiful bride and captainship of the vessel the next time it sails, only to have others send anonymous allegations about him to the crown prosecutor, who has his own reasons for Dantes to disappear. So, in Marseilles of the early 1800s, Dantes, without trial or due process, finds himself for reasons totally unclear to him, in the dungeons of an escape-proof prison. From his first moments imprisoned, Dantes vows to avenge his undeserved incarceration. Plot description stopped here to avoid spoilers, but be ready for a wild ride, unrequited love, riches and poverty (one or the other sometimes coming surprisingly quickly), locales primarily in France and Italy, but on the sea and in the islands, too. There are notorious bad guys, good guys who get their just rewards, and bad guys who do, too, as well as love, death, friendship, betrayal, politics at its worst, duplicity and ulterior motives, and moral goodness and, uh, not-so-goodness. There are the sticky issues of vengeance - its propriety and appropriate degree, and questions of wisdom/knowledge and divine representation Descriptions and characters are terrific. Dumas' literary references and some points of geography, politics, and monetary denominations and their relationships went past me, but those modest issues aside, I found it a truly special read for both its writing (in the Penguin Classics modern translation - easier to follow than older translations) and a story line that keeps the reader completely engaged. Is it worthy of \`classic' status? In spades. A fine addition to the short list of the finest books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"One of the best pieces of fiction that I have ever read. Maybe THE best. Involved, twisting, emotional plot with deeply entwined subplots. Exceptional character development and growth. I cannot believe how lucky I am to have received my Kindle as a gift.

Do not question...buy it!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is probably the best revenge story ever written. As the back cover of the story states, \\"On what slender threads do life and fortune hang.\\" Edmund Dantes knows something about those threads. A promising sailor, he is arrested, thrown into prison, and succumbs to hopelessness. From there, he meets a friend, gains a boundless inheritance, and soon finds himself in a position to obtain his revenge on those who caused his predicament. The tone, like most Dumas books, is simple, elegant, and witty. Why I call it the best is that it is a revenge story, but it also involves the subtle emotions involved in going about revenge. How revenge can go wrong, who revenge forces you to leave behind, who you attempt to emulate in casting judgement on your fellow man.1200 pages is quite a long novel, but it moves quickly, I'm currently reading it a second time, more to refresh background details and characters. There are plenty in this novel, who act like real people, with distinct personalities and flaws. The count himself lives a life of luxury which modern people can still be jealous of. Rome, Paris, and Marseille are visited with great detail, for those of us who like to travel on a budget. As the count begins to succeed in his vengance towards the end of the novel, you may be surprised about the outcome.Dumas, a prolific writer, wrote many novels. Those that like this would do well to move on to The Three Musketeers and it's sequel, which supply similar historical action and quick dialogue. The investment there is even greater, probably working out to 3500 total pages of narrative. Exciting, yes, but not many have that sort of time to invest. Count of Monte Cristo is self-contained. If one was to read just one novel by Dumas, this would be it. This is a famous author at the height of his powers, telling a self-contained story about destitution, fortune, and the nobility between."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"\\"Only weak minds see the future in a black cloud\\" this is my favorite Count of Monte Cristo's remark, this and other similar pieces of wisdom kept me riveted to this great long read. Montecristo is a long consectrated piece of classic literature and for me is useless to rate it as good or bad, it is better to give a personal impression about what one felt after finishing its almost 900 pages. In my opinion this novel is about personal relationships, how can be fostered and then easily destroyed due to jeaulosy and personal ambitions. The ideas of spirituality, material ambition, fair revenge and Divine blessing and punishment hover over the plot all the time. The plot begins with one focus, the transformation of Edmond Dantes into the Count of Montecristo due to misfortune arising from a personal treason, and then shatters into small stories with many different characters, each and every one of them, related one to another due to events told throughout the storyline. On the final chapters the novel recovers the single focus, the idea of justice, in order to conclude in an ending based on moral reasoning. The story unfolds at the post-Napoleonic era in France."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Among the best books I've ever read. It grabs you in the first pages and you're hooked.

Have you heard the saying don't judge a book by its cover? Well I learned that by reading this book. After picking it up I didn't really expect to like it but stranger things have happened. From the first page to the last the book is full of excitement and drama. It starts out with the main character Edmond Dantes sailing on the boat whose captain has died so he takes control till they get back back to the island of Marseilles. Dantes is betrayed by his fellow shipmate and friend and is sent to jail. After escaping he is rescued by a ship that hires him to work from them until he gets back to the island of Marseilles, where he changes his identity to the Count of Monte Cristo after unearthing his hidden family treasure on the island of Monte Cristo. Upon arriving there he finds out his farther has died his friend have left and his wife has moved on and left not to be seen again. He moves to Paris to become one of the richest men there. No longer the poor sailor he use to be leaving his last life behind him to go and do great things. Follow along as the Count lives his rich and wonderful life doing as he wishes living as he does. Learn about how rich people lived back then. Well after reading this book I was pretty impressed by it and would probably read it again some day. So if you are looking for a exciting, dramatic, romantic and adventurous book all in one the Count of Monte Cristo is the right book for you. It was very entertaining from the fist page to the last. So I would give it five out of five."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo written by Alexander Dumas. Have you heard the saying don't judge a book by its cover? Well I learned that by reading this book. After picking it up I didn't really expect to like it but stranger things have happened. From the first page to the last the book is full of excitement and drama. It starts out with the main character Edmond Dantes sailing on the boat whose captain has died so he takes control till they get back back to the island of Marseilles. Dantes is betrayed by his fellow shipmate and friend and is sent to jail. After escaping he is rescued by a ship that hires him to work from them until he gets back to the island of Marseilles, where he changes his identity to the Count of Monte Cristo after unearthing his hidden family treasure on the island of Monte Cristo. Upon arriving there he finds out his farther has died his friend have left and his wife has moved on and left not to be seen again. He moves to Paris to become one of the richest men there. No longer the poor sailor he use to be leaving his last life behind him to go and do great things. Follow along as the Count lives his rich and wonderful life doing as he wishes living as he does. Learn about how rich people lived back then. Well after reading this book I was pretty impressed by it and would probably read it again some day. So if you are looking for a exciting, dramatic, romantic and adventurous book all in one the Count of Monte Cristo is the right book for you. It was very entertaining from the fist page to the last. So I would give it five out of five."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Sitting through the sad film remake inspired me to seek out the original. How glad I am! Even if you enjoyed the recent film, I have good news for you-- buy this book and read it, for you will find riches beyond your dreams here. Fantastic descriptions, delicious characters, exquisite ironies, and more! Five stars are too few."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is and will probably continue to be my favorite boook of all time. It has got everything you could possibly want in a book. It's got betrayal, love, imprisonment, vengance, action, drama, and comedy. But you can read the synopsis for yourself.More important than the plot of the story is that the reader will learn to love Edmond Dantes, the main character. They will admire his strength, his wits, his arrogance, and the way he learnes from his mistakes.The reader will also learn to completely hate Danglars, Villefort, and Fernand. Every single horrible thing that happens to them, the reader will truly believe is justly deserved, even when Edmond believes it's too much.The writing is also wonderful. The reader will practically be transported to France as they read this novel. The word choice is so magnificent and the sentences flow so well that the reader will feel every emotion that the characters do, and will probably even taste the sweet Parisian air in their mouths.I first read the Signet Classic abridged version, and I thought this novel was great, but then I picked up the unabridged Modern Library version and enjoyed it even more. This book will change your life and I would highly suggest that everyone in the world read this book. Move over Shakespeare because you have just been dethrowned."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"All is well for Edmond Dantes life: he has a beautiful girlfriend, plenty of money, a loving father, and a good job as a sailor, soon to be captain. That is, until he is accused of being part of the Bonapartist party. On the day he was to marry is fiance, Mercedes, he was taken to the worst prison in the area, The Chateau D'If. No one has ever escaped this prison. He is sentenced to life and spends over 15 years in a cell until he plans an escape. After escaping he goes on to find a treasure he was told about from a man he met in prison. After finding the treasure, he begins helping people around the world, being known as The Count of Monte Cristo.I loved this book, although it was a bit long. The storyline was very exciting and the characters are so real. It's amazing how a man goes from sitting in a prison cell for years with no money at all, to becoming one of the richest people in France. I would definately recommend this book to readers of all ages. If you're looking for a good, exciting book then this is the one for you. The only thing I can complain about is every few chapters it starts getting a little boring, but hang in there becuase it only builds to something even better!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo begins as Edmond Dantes lands in Marseille, ready to marry the love of his life, Mercedes. Within 24 hours his world will turn upside down; punished for a crime he did not commit, he'll be imprisoned in the Chteau d'If for life, stripped of everything he held dear. And so the stage is set for the greatest revenge novel ever written.Swashbuckling novels are a sub-genre of historical fiction. Too easily, the whole genre is dismissed as juvenile reading. The Count of Monte Cristo features two cases of infanticide, a serial poisoner, a stabbing, three suicides, torture, execution, drug-induced sexual fantasies, illegitimacy, transvestism, lesbianism, dramatic soliloquies, references to classical history, the effects of hashish, all in about 1300 pages. Juvenile? I don't think so....This is my favorite book of all time. The unabridged version is the only way to go. The movies have never done it justice. I can guarantee you won't put it down!Once you've finished it, check out The Three Musketeers... the unabridged version ;)"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I would give this book 4 1/2 stars if I could. It is truly engrossing. As many previous readers have warned it WILL keep you up nights when you should really put it down and go to bed to wake up for the morning meeting next day.This story is wonderfully imaginative and intricate. One third of the way into the book (and I'm talking about the Modern Library version with all chapters intact), you wonder why there are so many chapters that ostensibly have little to do with our hero Edmond Dante aka Count of Monte Cristo. The details of where Caderousse end up with La Carconte, the chapters on Luigi Vampa, the chapter on Franz d'Epinay's first encounter with the Count of Monte Cristo? I was slightly baffled as to why Dumas would include them? But I soon understood that every character, no matter how minor, plays some role in the story -- either because they become an important instrument later on in the Count's revenge or they serve to tell us something about the Count (as in Franz d'Epinay's case).From the beginning of the book until Edmond's escape and discovery of the treasure, the reader is well-involved in his story and his life. After he finds fabulous wealth, the reader knows nothing more about this character's inner life. Everything we know about Edmond (and the Count) from then on, is through others. There is a switch in perspective that should have been effective but I found it detracted from the story. Dumas does this of course to convey a sense of mystery surrounding the Count, mystery that is absolutely crucial to his success in gaining revenge. But this sudden break from a mostly single perspective (Edmond's) to many, many perspectives about the Count is distracting, and really breaks the story into two stories rather than one cohesive long tale.The other criticism I have for this book is the amount of repetitive descriptions. I was at times irritated in the beginning at the numerous \\"tremblings\\" and \\"pale with tremblings\\" written about Fernand. Later on, Dumas drums into our heads how \\"mysterious\\" and \\"cryptic\\" and \\"indecphirable\\" the Count is. OK, we get it!!Overall, though I can't criticize much a book that kept me up till 2am for 10 solid days. He certainly did something right! The story is well-thought out, intricate as the plot and subplots can be they tie in (sometimes TOO perfectly), and the characters are well-drawn. And just when I catch myself writing the story off as an action-adventure novel, I run across some of the most exquisite and beautifully noted observations on human behavior I've ever read.So suspend your disbelief (some of the hyperbole on the superiority of the Count and the heroism of certain characters made me roll my eyes), believe in love (for Mercedes more than Haydee (????)), forgive some of the incredulous moments (agree about others' questioning of Edmond's readiness to throw away his revenge plans when he was so close to suceeding and his sudden remorse at the end is also a stretch). Put all those little criticisms aside, do NOT see the movie that just came out, read this book! It is worth the time investment and sleepless nights."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is the abridged version of the Dumas classic.Having not read the original yet, I can only compare itto The Three Musketeers. Dumas' writing style losesenergy in the abridging process. The reader ought tobe aware that the story has been simplified and summarized.If you want the true flavor of Dumas, order the unabridgedversion."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"In the \\"actual Count of Monte Cristo\\" Dumas perfectly explains all of Dante's dilemmas and how he fixes them. In this book they just pick some chapters and piece them together. So what you get is bits and pieces of chapters (and you miss a bunch of veeeeeery important chapters. Read the actual story not this thrift store jigsaw puzzle abridged version. In this book they leave out important characters like Jacapo who helped dantes find the treasure (which isn't even mentioned in this version), Danglars just magically disappears towards the end of this book but in the real one he still is quite critical to the end. I never have liked abridged classics because you never get the whole story and this is no exception."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Wonderful book, one of my favorites.Though, when I reached the end, one of the pages was ripped out - very disappointing."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"THIS BOOK IS BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!I watched the movie, and loved it, but was completely and totally bored by the book. on the other hand the movie was wonderful. lots of action and drama. it is about a young man who is framed and taken to the prison island of monte christo. he escapes and finds treasure in a hidden cove.

But then I found out why it was so long. The author was paid for each chapter that he wrote. If anyone is stupid enough to actually buy and read this work of verbose crap on their spare time, I pity that person.

This book desribes a man's life and the friends who betrayed him because of their jealousy. As he makes a &quot;comeback&quot; as a completely different and sophisticated man, the Count of Monte Cristo gives no mercy to those who betrayed him. With all this merciless revenge, Dumas shows the real meaning of love and how forgiving may be the solution to your problems. The Count of Monte Cristo is my favorite number one book and I recommend this book to people of all ages!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The depth of Edward Dantes' revenge upon his betrayers is only hinted at in the recent movie. Read the book and you'll be treated to some righteous and yet truly diabolical methods of vengance. The ending in the book is also quite different from the ending of the recent movie adaptation."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"For the shear grandeur of the story, I don't think there's a better book to read than this one. And insofar as the Count is larger than life, he simply wants his life back. Does that give him a blank check on his actions and his morality? Perhaps the urge for revenge is as crippling as the pangs of injustice."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I must admit, I first picked up The Count of Monte Cristo about ten years ago because I liked the cover art (a different edition than this one). Within five minutes of reading it, I was hooked. The next 1,000 pages simply flew by and I literally could not put the book down. For someone who's never read it before, it's an enthralling tale of treachery, despair, hope, and ultimately a quest for vengeance. After finishing &quot;The Count&quot;, I immediately sought out every book by Dumas I could get my hands on (The Three Musketeers, Ten Years After, and The Man in the Iron Mask). They were all exceptional reads, but none of them matched the brilliance of &quot;The Count .&quot;Any reader who enjoys tales of adventure and has a taste for historical novels will love this book. I thought the recent movie version was excellent too, but I highly recommend reading the book first."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Superb, what a tale, I was riveted by the fascinating story, so deep so full of the deepest human feelings. The language is sophisticated and typical of the 19th century when it was written. It is an intelligent book and far more enjoyable than Victor Hugo's masterpiece \\"Les Miserables\\". I read it quickly, it was nearly 900 pages but how fast paced it was and how well the characters were outlined. Dumas is a master storyteller and apart from the authentic retelling of the story in the TV series with Gerard Depardieu there are few stories which compare. It is remarkable by how well they stuck to the storyline in the TV series and how well the characters such as The Count of Monte Cristo, Danglers, Villefort, Mercedes etc were portrayed.The story of a simple sailor who is soon to become a captain and his love for the beautiful Mercedes who he is just about to marry and the terrible circumstances which follow with the framing of the sailor by his supposed friends Fernand and Danglers and the hellish times to follow, he spent 14 years in a dungeon. The suffering which is portrayed so well, its almost as if Dumas himself had suffered so, somehow the book actually gives an inkling of what it would be like to be trapped within a tiny dingy, dark and stinking room for 14 years with no recreation no entertainment noone to talk to and simple the inability to leave the room, madness seems inevitable. The Abbe Faria saved him this, so much love to give to Edmond Dantes, he restores his life. His subsequent enriching and terrible revenge and the need for him to free himself of the suffering of others only to find it hidden in his own depths. It just doesn't get any better than this. Its not often I give 5 stars. Its a miracle, ... To say the least worth every cent and I would have paid four times as much for it."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I read this novel a couple years ago, and was absolutely enthralled by it; Dumas' writing style is so clear and concise, and yet it still maintains the beauty of story, which is truly amazing. While poring over these fond memories, I decided I would purchase it, simply so I could keep around at my leisure; I will have to admit to you, this book only gets better the second time around (also an excellent trick any time you're reading a difficult text you can't quite get the hang of), and could truly appreciate the depth of this book. Alexander has definitely crafted one of the true classics of his time, and in my opinion it rivals any its cookie-cutter brethren that are churned out now, and I would strongly recommend this to anyone who is just starting out in classic novels, or who has yet to read it."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is the finest piece of literature I have ever read without question. Dumas has a tremendous writing style that is also evident in &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; as it is in this offering. This is an epic story of love, betrayal, revenge and perserverence. I could not put this book down at times, it kept me riveted and wondering what would happen next like nothing else I have read. You will not regret reading this novel."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"If you've ever thought life was unfair, you need to read this book. Revenge has never been so complete, and the avenger even has a spiritual awakening at the end. There's sword fights for guys and fancy clothes and romances for the girls. I first read the abridged version in the 8th grade, I read the full version a year later, and I'm reading it again right now. It's really that good. Any crime-ring or revenge themed book you will ever read draws references from this Dumas classic. And hey, there's a movie now too!(p.s. this is coming from a now 18-year-old actress with a very short attention span)"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Dumas' classic paints an engrossing tale of love, treachery, and revenge. This superb book begins quickly, drawing you in to the world of Edmond Dant&egrave;s, a world sacrificed for another's ambition. While he spent years in a forgotten cell, his lust for vengeance grew. When he finally escaped, he carefully and patiently exacted his perfect revenge.This book has many good qualities, some almost too good. Dumas created a fascinating, enthralling plot, complete in every detail. However, there were times when the plot became too detailed, and forced me to slow down and think about what went on. Also, the pace of the book is perfect: as the action unfolds, the book reads quickly, but then slows down again to give importance to the time Dant&egrave;s takes in his quest. For all this, Dumas' masterpiece ranks as one of my all-time favorite books, one I would recommend to anyone."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"A few years ago I saw the movie Sleepers with Brad Pitt, Jason Patric and Kevin Bacon. It was about a gang of pre-teens who are abused in a reform school, read Count of Monte Cristo in school and vow to take revenge on their persecutors, even if it takes years and years to put their plan into action. This led me to believe that Count of Monte Cristo glorified the concept of revenge. Dumas did so much more than that. He portrayed a life that was completely consumed by the need for revenge and in the end the true message was of regret, not revenge. For me that message transformed this book from an entertaining thriller to a powerful classic. As I have said in other reviews, I have young children and this will be a must read when they are teens. I can tell my children that I believe in turning the other cheek, but this classic illustrates why forgiveness should beat revenge on any given day."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo stirs the passions of everyone who reads it - so much so that it has been made and remade a half-dozen times in English, a fairly astonishing fact since the Dumas classic is originally en Francais. It is one of the most popular and best-selling novels of history and it is difficult to say whether this book or \\"The Three Musketeers\\" is the most popular novel by Alexandre Dumas, p&egrave;re.The story is set up perfectly by Dumas: Merchant ship \\"Phaeron\\" pulls into Marseilles in 1815. First mate Edmond Dant&egrave;s leaps onto the pier to report to owner Monsieur Morrel that although the ship has returned as planned with goods, Captain Lecl&egrave;re passed away on the journey, leaving Edmund as acting Captain.Morrel immediately promotes Dant&egrave;s to Phaeron's Captain, just before Edmund runs to reunite with his beautiful fianc&eacute;e Merc&eacute;d&egrave;s. Dant&egrave;s, the hard-working son of a commoner, can hardly believe his fortune. He has been promoted to ship's Captain at a young age and is about to marry the most beautiful young lady in town.But something is rotten in Marseilles...Jealousy prompts rivals Danglars (the Phaeron's purser) and Lieutenant Fernand Mondego (also desiring Merc&eacute;d&egrave;s) to conspire to write a secret note to the authorities accusing Edmund of being a Bonapartist traitor.Soldiers come to arrest Edmund at his engagement party. He is hauled before Villefort, an apparently sympathetic prosecutor. Villefort seems kindly until he realizes there actually IS a Bonapartist traitor around... the prosecutor's father. To protect the family name (and his career ambitions), Villefort has our hero put away.Edmond Dant&egrave;s goes from the heights of happiness to the depths of despair - without explanation he is thrown into the darkest, dampest dungeon of France's Alcatraz - the Chateau d'If.For those unfamiliar with the story, it may appear that I have given it all away, but you will find that this is only the setup for the most thrilling tale of hope and despair, vengeance and mercy, nobility and justice and revenge. The story comes complete with exciting sword fights, poisonings, secrets identities, kidnappings, last-second escapes, underground catacombs and formal balls. Especially for a character of two hundred years ago, Dant&egrave;s makes James Bond seem a dullard by comparison.If you have only seen \\"the movie\\" you have not at all had the pleasure of the layers and textures of this sublime story. The 1975 Richard Chamberlain is okay, if truncated, but the 2002 version with James Caviezel is practically an abomination.Are you a \\"book person\\"? Do yourself a favor and immerse yourself in this treasure, and perhaps no other book more deserves a reading of the unabridged version."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This was the first book by Dumas that I've read and I enjoyed it very much.

The Count could have gone around with his rapier and pistol and gotten revenge in just a few pages but instead allows his enemies to hoist themselves on their own petards. In the end, their undoing is not just the fine planning and work of the Count but French society itself in the post-Bonaparte years.

Some editions are abridged for this novel, and that truly is an injustice and the reviews show that. The Oxford Classics version - which I read - is an UNABRIDGED version, and my review is based on that.This story revolves around Edmond Dantes, a young man who seemingly has everything going for him. His employer has much regard for him and is about to put him as captain of his own ship, he is about to marry the woman he loves, all is right in Dantes world. Unfortunately, this type of happiness and success breeds jealousy and envy, and Dantes finds himselft falsely accused and imprisoned. He does escape, and therein the true tale begins.The story weaves back and forth and entangles lives - but central is the thirst for revenge. Dumas certainly has a way of telling a story, even a long one, and keeping it interesting a fresh. There are twists and turns and an entire host of interesting characters. One moment I found myself cheering for Dantes and the next I was hoping he wouldn't do what I thought he would. However, one can never be too sure of what might happen next or where the story might go.I had put off reading this novel because of the length for so long, and I now regret having done that. Although the tale of revenge is an old one, Dumas has managed to weave a story filled with mystery, adventure, and excitement with just a touch of romance - what more could a reader possibly want?"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is one of those classics that not enough people know about.

Like the whole General Hospital Luke and Laura except slightly diffferent.This is a big story and you will find it hard to put it down once you get all the pieces in motion.So, read it. If you hate it, throw the book at someone you dislike. You're sure to do some damage."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Alexandre Dumas' novel The Count of Monte Cristo tells the story of a promising young sailor, Edmond Dant&eacute;s, and his transformation into the Count of Monte Cristo after being wrongly imprisoned for life in one of France's most infamous and brutal prisons, the Chateau d'If. The bulk of the plot follows Dant&eacute;s' life after his miraculous escape from prison, as he ruins the lives of each of those responsible for his torment.The story begins with a teenage Dant&eacute;s receiving the position of captain upon the Pharaon, a trading vessel stationed in Marseilles, France. This position allows him enough money to finally marry the love of his life, Merc&eacute;d&egrave;s, which enrages Fernand Mondego, a fisherman who is also after Merc&eacute;d&egrave;s' heart. Mondego, with the help of Monsieur Danglars, a sailor jealous of Dant&eacute;s' position as captain, decides to write a letter to Monsieur de Villefort, chief magistrate, denouncing Dant&eacute;s as a man guilty of treason, as he supposedly still supports Napoleon Bonaparte's regime as evidenced by a letter he was supposed to hand to Villefort's father. Dant&eacute;s is then sentenced to life in prison, where he meets the Abb&eacute; Faria who teaches him everything he needs to know to become an aristocratic Count, enabling him to execute his revenge. What follows is an adventurous tail of one man's story as he wreaks havoc on those responsible for his imprisonment.After seeing the movie based on this story and hearing from others how influential the novel is, I decided to give the seemingly enormous 400-page book a shot. Unfortunately for me, I accidentally chose the abridged version (the normal book is over 1000 pages) and could only enjoy the book for short time, as I finished it within a week. Dumas' unique writing style and uncanny ability to tell a story make The Count of Monte Cristo an easy and suspenseful read. Dumas excellently develops each character so the reader can truly understand the motives for their actions and combines each individual story line in a way that is, albeit confusing and at times hard to follow, amazingly interesting. Every character is somehow intertwined and each plays a unique role in contributing to the downfall of others within the story. More importantly, after finishing the novel, readers come away having learned a lot about human nature and life in general.Those thinking they will find the book similar to the movie be warned: it is much, much better. Whereas the Hollywood version of the story focuses on the love between Mercedes and Dant&eacute;s, the novel incorporates no such story line after Dant&eacute;s' escape. Furthermore, the novel is much more intricate in plot, as more central characters are incorporated into the story and tons of seemingly small details and side stories come together to play a crucial part in The Count's quest for destruction. The central story line, writing style, and themes of the novel all come together to make The Count of Monte Cristo a great read."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I have no words to describe this extremely well written book. After finishing this book, you will hopefully have the same feeling. That's how good this book is.It's not a brain teaser but none the less keeps the reader engrossed until the very end with it's well narrated story. If you are thinking about reading this book, go no further on reading anymore reviews. Simply pick up a copy of your own and start enjoying this great read. You will have difficult time putting it down....this much is guaranteed!!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Edmond Dant&egrave;s, framed of treason by some people he thought he trusted, seeks revenge. After becoming promoted to captain at the early age of nineteen, Edmond is envied by many, Mondego is in love with Edmond's fianc&eacute;e, Danglars wants the position of Edmond, and Cauderousse despises Edmond and his fortune. The men plot to have Edmond thrown in jail, and so he is. There he meets Faria, a priest who teaches him the secret to a treasure, hidden on the island of Monte Cristo. When Edmond breaks free, he finds the treasure, and with it he develops elaborate plans from what he finds out about those who betrayed him, and takes away everything from them, one by one. This is an excellent book, recommended to readers who enjoy examining complicated plots.This book did indeed have a very interesting plot. Edmond first finds Cauderousse and receives important information about the other two people who framed him. He becomes a great friend of Mondego who is very powerful and wealthy by saving his son from bandits. He learns that Mondego received his wealth by betraying a friend. His deceitfulness wrecks his reputation, his wife (Edmond's former fianc&eacute;e) and son abandon him and commits suicide.The characters are also very interesting, being very unique and realistic. Edmond at first is a young man having great honesty and friendship, one you would not expect to take revenge so severely. He almost develops a complete different personality as the Count of Monte Cristo, a grudge-bearing and angry man hidden under a mask of kindness. One of Edmond's targets, Danglars, may be described as greedy and selfish. It is through this trait that Edmond punishes him and makes him bankrupt.Aside from having an interesting plot, this book also is suspenseful in many ways. When Edmond attempts to escape from jail, he is thrown unexpectedly into the sea. Another suspenseful scene is when Edmond watches as a ship is torn apart in the storm. This story may also be suspenseful in other ways beside intense action. When Edmond follows through with his plots of revenge, it is exciting to see what will happen next.This book is an excellent and challenging work, good for almost any reader who enjoys classic novels taking place in the past. This particular classic is one which challenges the work of Edgar Allen PoeI.

This masterpiece of a novel is next-to-impossible to put down. I became so involved in the book that, when I finished, I felt sort of deprived. I wished the book would continue for another 1,000 pages. By the way, if you're going to read this book, don't read the abridged version. It is NOTHING like the unabridged, original copy."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Among adventure novels I've read, CoMC stands head and shoulders above the rest. A long book, I wish it was double its length. There is romance and jealousy here, yet not a mere meringue that takes up space without offering substance, but psychologically complex relations that contribute to, and are in turn enriched by, the plot. The character who seems too good to be true is changed by the injustice that befalls him into someone more complex and real. No character is a mere set piece or caricature. The swashbuckling needs to be there, and is wittily and strategically placed to serve the plot. Here are moral lessons and character studies that could keep a book group talking for a year, but Dumas never preaches, never resorts to being pedantic. Every character is precisely etched, memorable, and as necessary to the story's integrity as any in a Greek drama. I felt toward this book like one feels toward a new love: devouring the time together, resentful of the time apart. Time was measured by how long I could read, and when, and how long it would last. I can't think of a novel I've enjoyed more, on more levels."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Some time back, a friend recommended that I read this book. I am very glad that I have that friend. This book is perhaps the best I have ever read, and I have read A LOT of books.While an extraordinarily long book, I never found myself putting it down unless I had to. It is classic example of a book with every good literary element without unrealistic plots, characters, and events. Everything that happens is plausible (except maybe the Count's money).However, the book can be difficult to understand. I would advise rereading over what you have already covered, or just skimming over the pages you already read. Also, it wouldn't be a bad idea to take notes on who is who and what is happening, because it can get very confusing.Overall, if you want to read a really good novel, this is your best bet. It has something to satisfy everyone, from action to romance to revenge. Not only that, but all of these elements are cleverly woven together in such a way that everything from earlier on comes back to be of vast significance in the later parts of the book, etc. This work is nothing short of spectacular, so get reading!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is my all-time favorite book. I've read it at least 15 times. This book has something to offer to absolutely anyone that can read -- revenge, romance, betrayal, loyalty, friendship, political intrigue, history, etc. The cast of characters is unforgettable and well developed. The depth and breadth of the revenge plot in this book is unprecedented and unmatched. I wrote a paper on this book for my Revenge Literature class in college. Whenever I have been dissatisfied with recent books and need something really great to fall back on, I pick this book up again and love it just as much."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is my favorite all time book so I was excited to see a Kindle version. After reading it I'm very pleased as I only saw one typo (that I noticed anyway). You will enjoy reading this book thoroughly."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I am incredibly picky about which version of a book I buy. When I went to the bookstore to buy The Count of Monte Cristo, I poured through the text to see if I could find any trace of the word \\"abridged.\\" Since I did not, I purchased the book (Publisher--Enriched Classic--AVOID!!!!). This quickly became my favorite work of fiction, right up there with Les Miserables, the Three Musketeers, and The Phantom of the Opera (I find it interesting that all of my favorite books are 19th/20th Century French Literature...hm.) In any case, after seeing another version of the book and reading the various reviews, I find that my world has been turned upside down because apparently, my edition of this book IS abridged (It's sneaky about it--instead of \\"abridged\\" it says \\"series edited by...\\"). I am both appalled and furious. Having said that, I am quickly going to purchase a TRUE unabridged edition of the book and reread it. Why is this? Well, now to get to my point. This is one of the most amazing stories in the history of literature (behind Les Mis, of course). Mystery, adventure, suspense, betrayal, revenge, the battle and balance between vigilantism and justice, intrigue, romance, wit... what more is there to say about this novel? You truly will not be able to put it down. Now, having said all this, I would also like to say that I, personally, think it would be worthwhile to read it in the original French text--after all, if it is this amazing after it's been sorted through and hashed and translated (which is an imperfect process, I assure you), how mind-blowingly phenomenal must it be in its original languge, with Dumas' true intention and literary style? It is for this exact question that I am going for a Bachelor's Degree in Romance Languages. My life goal is to read Dumas, Hugo, and Leroux in all of their original glory.My point? READ THE BOOK! I also recommend the Three Musketeers and Les Miserables, which you might have guessed if you actually read this whole review."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I have spent hundreds of dollars on this site and have never been provoked to write a review...until now. The Count of Monte Cristo has got to be one of the greatest books ever written. I'm telling you now, read this unabridged version, and it will change the way you look at fiction for the rest of your life. I promise. I'm an avid reader (I teach high school literature) and made it to my late 20's without ever reading this unabridged version. Man am I glad I decided to pick it up and read it. Don't be scared by the number of pages (1245). I absolutely promise you will finish it in no time. I mentioned to the person who suggested I read this version this comment, \\"there is no soul on this earth who would not like this book\\". Pretty intense I know, but do yourself a favor...buy the book, read it, get lost in it, tell other people about it, and love literature. You will not be disappointed. Have fun...I DID!!!!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Wow, I listened to the 37 CD's (47 hours) and couldn't wait for the ride to and from work everyday. Awesome, and John Lee was the BEST reader ever."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Reading an abridged book is like eating cake without frosting. You don't really need the frosting, but the frosting is what gives a cake it's delicious flavor. The Count of Monte Cristo is a book which ought to be read unabridged, if only for the richness and flavor of the text. The evolution of Edmond Dantes from sailor to prisoner to Count of Monte Cristo is enthralling. Alexander Dumas's book is captivating. It is hard to set aside CoMC, as the characters are extremely interesting and well-developed. It's not like the antagonists are straight-up bad guys with no redeeming qualities, they are just people who make bad choices and act out of self-interest.Essentially, the moral provided in this HUGE tome is that revenge is a dish best served cold. In order to understand why I say this, I shall provide some backstory. Three men known to Edmond Dantes, all jealous of him in some way, one wants his job, the other wants his girlfriend, plot a way to put Edmond Dantes in prison. Their plan works and Dantes is arrested. He's thrown in prison without a trial. Dantes spends awhile in jail and thinks of nothing but his revenge. Eventually, Dantes escapes and becomes the Count of Monte Cristo. Luckily, for the reader we get to see the entire evolution of Dantes, we see him in his darkest moments as well as in his crowning glory. His revenge is most apt.I highly recommend this book for anyone who is looking to be transported into another time as well as for someone who is looking to fall in love with well-developed characters. There are many editions out there, I recommend the Robin Buss unabridged translation published by Penguin Classics. Buss's translation is fantastic and readable, the phrasing is not awkward at all, as in other translations. Also, Buss's translation includes all of the naughty bits - i.e. one sex scene, some drug use, and a dash of homosexuality."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This review is for the Kindle edition ASIN: B002RI9KL8.

Like i said I rarely ever read books but this one I actually read twice, maybe like a year later, and if I can find it again I will definatley read it now cause its been about 10 years or so. Oh and I was so excited when the movie came out but it disappointed because it left so much out and it was not as action and suspensed-packed like the book, which is usually the case I guess but it really left huge chunks out. Anyways bottom line....READ IT!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Who wouldn't want to be The Count of Monte Cristo? A god-like creature, master of disguise, wealth beyond the dreams of avarice, extremely handsome, expert marksman, expert swordsman, philosopher, apothecary, highly moral, (carrying out God's work of vengeance, not his own) unimpeachable manners, speaks many languages, can quote both Roman and Greek mythology and philosophers from Cicero to Plato, in fact is an expert on every subject under the sun, never lies and is never wrong. (p.1027) A perfect human being who loves young girls in a fatherly way, kisses his slave on her forehead, acted as guardian angel to 17 year old Valentine and go-between for her and her fianc&eacute;.I would not want to see the film of this book, no earthly creature could match up to the mysterious, romantic, mythical figure of The Count of Monte Cristo. Imagination is far far better. This wonderful man takes on all the various shapes and forms of his different disguises, he is so clever it takes your breath away. Oh, if only we could get away with that! Oh, if only we had half his skill to get back at our enemies the way he did. It makes one's mouth water to think of it. Delicious!Men are turned on by this book because it is full of adventure, the ultimate \\"Boy's Own\\" story. Women are turned on by it not only because it is thrilling but because it speaks to the fairy tale longing, (Cinderella) of finding the perfect man..... He doesn't exist girls and boys, sad to say, it is just a fantasy.In the beginning, even though far fetched, (the escape from jail, the treasure) one goes along for the ride, but towards the end of the book Dumas gets a bit carried away. The fantasy good as it is becomes a bit hard to sustain, the magic cure-all drops, the murderous step-mother nobody suspects, the crippled grandfather blinking in Morse code, and then of course the almost Shakespearean ending of the star crossed lovers. All stretching the imagination to the limit, but loving it being stretched, and rejoicing in the thrilling ride.I enjoyed the book enormously and found it almost impossible to put down for all the same reasons everyone else did. It is so well written and the pace never stops. I particularly enjoyed the scene described when Albert and Franz came to watch the carnival with Monte Cristo and Franz asked The Count if he could obtain a window overlooking the Piazza del Popolo where there were to be two executions at the start of the festivities. The coolness with which Monte Cristo explains that the program has been changed, in a \\"tone of voice\\" Dumas says, \\"as though he were reading the personal column.\\" (p.383).\\"Hum! The first will be mazzolato, the second decapitato. Yes, this is what was originally intended, but I think that since yesterday there has been a change in the order and conduct of the ceremony. .......they were speaking of some kind of stay of execution to one of the two men...... That means you will be denied a guillotining but you still have the mazzolata, which is a very curious form of torture when you see it for the first time - or even the second; while the other, which in any case you know, is too simple, too unvaried. There is nothing unexpected in it. ..... Ah come now, don't talk to me about Europeans where torture is concerned. They understand nothing about it. With them, cruelty is in its infancy - or perhaps its old age.\\"You can imagine this man with a sword in his hand, never flinching, nerves of steel!Read it to escape, it's a ticket to a magic carpet ride. Be a little like Monsieur le Comte himself when he said \\"....chaque fois que je souhait je peux me s&eacute;parer du reste du monde\\" \\" ....whenever I wish I can separate myself from the rest of the world.\\" (p.314).Worth every one of its five stars.

My words cannot do justice! It's a shame it took me 30 years to stumble(blind luck) onto this gem."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I just finished this book as a summer reading book for school, and it was amazing. Dumas uses an incredible amount of foreshadowing in this book, but it only adds to its intrigue. The plot itself has so many twists and turns as it follows the life of Edmond Dantes and others involved in his life. The evolution of the characters is also amazing. It's almost a psychological analysis of human characteristics, with their qualities and defaults.I read this book in three days. I was hooked from beginning to end. The story simple flows together, and by the end, everything comes to a neat solution; the conclusion isn't completely definite - it gives the reader time to imagine what happens to Edmond after the book ends.I highly recommend this book to anyone of any age. The writing style is guaranteed to keep you on the edge of your seat, eager for more."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is honestly one of the greatest novels I have ever read. I absolutely loved this book. I could not put it down! This is a must read for anyone.When I first started into this novel, I had in my memory the 'movie' that was made for the big screen. So of course, I expected the book to be very similar to it. Well, I was very wrong! Other than Edmond Dantes being betrayed by his 'friends' and finding the treasure, this book takes on a different route.Believe me, the book is much more superb. The way the Count exacts his revenge is astonishing. I cannot fathom how Dumas came up with such a scheme. At times, one cringes for the those who wronged the Count.This book made me laugh and cry. There are many poignant moments throughout the book that make you feel good. Anyone who says that Dumas is not up there with the 'classic' writers, does not know what they are talking about. This book is rich in dialogue, mystery, suspense and storyline. All in all, this is an amazing classic, and I recommend it to anyone wanting a good read."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Edmond Dantes was a happy and fortunate young man, blessed with a beautiful fiance, good looks, and an upwardly mobile career. In short he had everything that a man could want. As is always the case, one man's fortune breeds another's envy. Jealous of Edmond's good fortunes three of his friends conspire to remove him from the scene. The plan might not have worked were it not for his bad fortune in chief prosecutors. His fortunes soured, Edmond is sentenced to life imprisonment.What follows along this plotline is one of the greatest novels ever written. Edmond escapes, finds his fortune, and begins a long road of revenge. Not satisfied with killing his enemies, Edmond instead seeks to do unto them as they have done unto him. Ruin their lives by taking away everything that they hold dear.I cannot emphasize enough the quality of this book. The plot is complex and intriguing. The characters are deep and fully fleshed. Always intelligent, often whimsical, occassionally romantic, and interspersed with action, this novel has something for everyone.Read this book!!!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"After watching the movie and then finding myself compelled to read the book, I wrote a review for the DVD version of this great classic by Alexandre Dumas. I did give the adulterated movie 3 stars, even with its deviation from the far superior storyline of the novel (this story does not lend itself to being told in a 2-hour movie). But rather than 3 stars, the book is well deserving of 5, and then some.The tale of the Count is one of heavy, dark intrigue. This is not light reading, and the story will tax your patience and demand of you significant time and concentration if you are to mine its riches. Those with an attention span of a six-year-old need not apply, although any person, young or old, who yields to the lessons being lived out will come away from this book with impressive knowledge regarding the pitfalls of willful ignorance, deceit, and pride; and hopefully a better appreciation for justice, compassion, and love.As for the story itself, Edmond Dantes, a young man of considerable good character, finds himself wrongly imprisoned under dreadful circumstances. He eventually is tutored in prison by a man with extraordinary wisdom-just as the reader is tutored without realizing it as he reads the unfolding chapters. Edmond loses all, gains eternal wisdom and insight, and then begins his true journey into lands where friends and foes experience his heavy influence. The story is one of desperation and deliverance, defeat and despair, and ultimately of triumph at an awful cost. Spiritual applications abound throughout as learned from within dungeons to palaces, and our notions of justice and mercy are sorely tested as a wronged man loses all and then begins to execute what he considers to be, and may well be, God's judgment.If you dedicate the time and attention that this book deserves, you will not be disappointed. If you want to speed-read and add another title to your library card, you will miss the worthwhile messages that this book can bring to the soul. I say soul, but for those with spiritual understanding, the better term is spirit, for this is above all a spiritual book. The movie alludes to it; the book embodies it. Having now read the book and carefully endured the more tedious portions to ensure that I missed little, I can only say that we do ourselves much disservice by not committing the time to study works such as this. Love, hate, revenge, mercy, justice, and forgiveness are explored in detail in the lives of Edmond Dantes (the Count) and his friends and foes. This complicated novel is unbelievably rich in its timeless spiritual lessons."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is one the greatest book ever written.I read the abridged version because it was shorter and cheaper.

I thought it was an exciting, keep you on the edge of your chair, hafta turn the page, cliff hanger. That is, until you get past the first five pages of boring mush (literally only 5 pages). It is a classic story about a man who has everything going for him; until, on his wedding day his supposed friends frame him and send him to the legendary Chateau d'If for the rest of his life. But when he escapes from prison and finds a gigantic treasure, he sets out to reclaim his lost love and exact a slow, fitting punishment on his betrayers. Will he find his beloved Mercedes and get his revenge against his enemies, or will his whole plot go ka-put?"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The author is one of the most imaginative writers I have ever come across. With one unpredictable plot twist after another, this was an addictive page-turner that had me reading for hours on end, days at a time. Despite its formidable length, you will not want this novel to end.The novel centers around Edward Dantes, who we first glimpse as a young innocent sailor about to be married. The treachery of three men results in his being sent to waste away in prison. He manages to escape after 14 years, and the remainder of the novel entails his painstaking and elaborate revenge on the villains.The author taps on every human emotion in weaving this tale - love, hate, greed, fear, empathy, pride. It reminds me of a Russian novel: it has a large cast of characters about whom the reader knows everything, an intricate soap-operaesque plot, and is impossible to put down.In my view, this is great escapist entertainment and very imaginative. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is the best book I have ever read.

I\`m not saying it\`s the greatest book on earth--there are flaws sometimes in character development, and the overuse of coincidences--but the story itself is a gem unrivalled anywhere. When it comes to weaving a complex plot rife with fascinating characters, Dumas is a master; and each scene is instilled with just the necessary amount of dramatic tension and foreshadowing. Never once does the story slow its pace, yet without once detracting from its depth and power. The characters are often thrown into situations that are literally a matter of life and death, and suspense becomes the reader\`s constant companion. But the most compelling element in the story is Edmond Dantes himself, aka the Count of Monte Cristo, looming like a spectral shadow over the bright spectacle of French wealth portrayed here--a shadow with a broken heart and needs of which he is hardly aware, so intent is he on becoming a pitiless agent of revenge. The book\`s main flaw, I thought, was the abrupt resolution of his relationship with Haydee--she seemed more like a plot device than a real person. Other flaws consist of contrived plot scenarios which would be unacceptable today, but which to me at least, with their exuberant spontaneity, make this book even more of a joy to read."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"For the price, this is a great copy of the book, however, I think 'leather bound' is a little mis-leading.

The book is HUGE, about 4.5\\" thick. Definitely the unabridged version. I have noticed quite a few typos in just my casual reading, so I wonder how well this was proofed before going to print. Overall, for the price, I think it's a good deal."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I cannot add anything new to the adulations already written about the Robin Buss translation of my favorite all-time novel.

It would be like viewing the Sistine Chapel back wall and never seeing the ceiling.Now, there is a self-serving purpose to my review besides giving Buss props. When I visited Venice for the first time in 1999 I fell in love with the place. When I returned home, I looked, in vain, for a Monte Cristo-esque story set in Venice. It didn't exist. Sooooo . . .

Through these different themes are different narratives. There is the story of wronged imprisonment, a hunt for hidden treasure and a cunning and perfectly executed revenge scheme. All masterfully intertwined. The scenes in prison with Dantes and Abbe Faria are well paced and captivating. They do much to reveal the strong character and will of Dantes.

As a result of enjoying this book so immensely, I no longer enjoy watching the movie that much, but it is well worth it.I don't think I've ever read a book with so many different faces. The story has action, romance, friendships, enemies, betrayal, vengeance, redemption, comedy... everything you can think of is masterfully done in this book.

In this complex plot with no less than 27 major characters and a dozen other minor ones, the author tests the strength of your memory and depth of your focus and you will still not stop reading the novel.For a while, my life was put on hold while the life of Edmond took over, occupying every fabric of my imagination. The beginning, the betrayal, the cursed fate, the shattered dreams, the agony and anguish of that innocent sweet soul in that dark dungeon for 14 harrowing years. How did Dumas have the heart to not only make up but also tell us such a cruel bitter tale? How could he make one single man endure so much agony?They say good writing entertains and great writing transforms. Ironically, the greatest sections of this book to me, difficult as they were to read, are during Edmond's captivity in Chateau d'If dungeon and during his relationship with Abbe Faria. Those passages are the most exquisite writing even if they recount the most agonizing period of Edmond's life. They were painfully difficult to read yet the unease lessened in knowing and anticipating the imminent revenge of Edmond.Today, I draw strength from the memory of Edmond's undying yet swaying hope in my most ordinary tasks and my humble difficulties. Perhaps, this is the definition of transformation on some level.I would read The Count of Monte Cristo again, if there weren't so many other amazing classics on my list.

The half Creole native of France wrote hundreds of books. Among the immense number are several classics such as \\"The Three Musketeer: tales and The Count of Monte Cristo. Both of these epic workswere penned in 1844!The Count of Monte Cristo is Edmund Dantes a young sailor from Marseilles. The callow sailor is in love with the fetching Mercedes but tragedy strikes1 He is betrayed by three jealous friends who send him to a dark prison cell. Edmund becomes friendly with an old Italian abbe prisoner who educates him in literature, language and history. After 14 years in a cell Dantes escaps from prison. He becomes involved with a group of smugglers. Dantes becomes a millionare many times over when he locates the buried treasure on the isle of Monte Cristo. His deceased friend the abbe had told him where to find it.Monte Cristo then begins a long series of adventures helping his friends and wrecking exquiste revenge on his enemies. He somewhat fades from view.The action focuses on the lives and loves of several Parisian families who have either helped or hindered Monte Cristo in career. Monte Cristo has Christ like qualities and is a wonderful hero beloved by the heroic age in which the novel first saw light. Everyone who clams to be educated should read this tremendous classic which is very readable.Dumas is able to portray a world through the use of his powerful pen.The Modern Library edition contain 1462 pages of print large enough not to cause eye strain! It is a feat of strength to lug the behemoth around! There are no footnotes or illustrations. Dspite its great length The Count of Monte Cristo keeps your interes.

I have no intention of broadening my literary, historical or philosophical knowledge to impress other people so here is a review from a guy who just happen to read it because this book was on sale for $1 at the local library clearance.I read a lot. Most of books I read are popular paperbacks I see on best seller list. One day I was at the library and saw this thick book for a $1 and I thought I would give it a try. Even if I don't like it, I am out of a $1 so no big deal. I won't bore you with the story or the translation because that's not why you are reading these reviews on Amazon website. You are looking for a reason to pick up this yellowpage thick book that you already know the plot so allow me to give you several.Story in this book is not what you expect as it is much more detailed and insightful to the movies and young adult versions. Story is darker than what you expect so that's a good thing. Also, finding a good book about revenge is difficult enough so stick with a proven winner. Certain lines in this book adhere to your brain like it's been spread liberally with crazy glue. I sometimes write \\".. now the God of Vengeance yields to me his power to punish the wicked.\\" on my forearm whenever I have a business meeting with some jerk I cannot stand. Lines like this sticks to your head and it lingers like a noxious fart in public toilet.Let me leave you with this. After I finished this book, I bought Les Miserables, Brothers Karamazov and David Copperfield because I finally understood why people are so high on some of these so called 'classics'."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is a wonderful edition of The Count of Monte Christo. It is abridged enough to eliminate the repetition that was in the story, written as a serial initially. Great story, and there is enough detail to get a tremendous feel for the times at the end of Napoleon's era. The bad guys get theirs in the end in spades. Wonderful tale"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Reading classic fiction entails a fascinating insight into human nature. So often, we're intimidated by the \\"classic\\" status of a book, assuming it's going to be long, dry and inaccessible. With some exceptions, what you typically find is the opposite; a book that is just as engaging today as the day it was written, something that strikes you as a piece of pop culture that has endured because it was done so well. It's a real testament to the idea that some elements of human nature transcend time and place, staying fresh across generations.So it is with the Count of Monte Cristo. Add its massive length to its classic status and you have a book that a lot of people might be hesitant to pick up. I implore you to abandon any hesitancy you may feel and read this book immediately. It is nothing more and nothing less than the ultimate tale of love, betrayal, revenge and redemption. You will find yourself wrapped up with the characters, shocked by revelations and uplifted by the care lavished on the tale by Dumas. It's really that good.This book is obviously the inspiration for many popular stories that have followed in its footsteps. The one I couldn't get out of my head was The Princess Bride, which boils the story down to some of its most critical plot points and then plays them for laughs quite well.Now, stop reading reviews, order the book and start reading it. You'll be thrilled that you did."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This book is awesome and a great choice for anyone who enjoys classical literature. The language is clear and the plot flows smoothly throughout the whole book."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I stumbled through a couple of different translations and was only able to complete a seriously abridged version. This Barnes and Moble translation was a pleasure to read.

It is now appropriate for ages 13-15, I would say, or for advanced ESL learners.The abridgment reads naturally and flows well. Extraneous plot elements that Robin Waterfield decided to leave out have been completely left out, meaning that, at least as far as I was able to detect, no vestigial traces of the original plot lingering about to confuse you.All the much-ballyhooed references to lesbianism and drugs in Dumas's original have, it need hardly be said, been deleted. Also, Dantes doesn't curse God so much in this one (in the dungeon scene, I mean)."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is a simply wonderful story that will easily keep you engaged through the entire 1,000+ pages. The setting is Europe, mostly France, in the early 1800s, and in addition to everything else, the book provides a little window into that time and place. The characters, especially the Count, are fascinating, if not realistic. I'm no literary critic, but the mixture of reality and fantasy reminded me a bit of magical realism. Finally, the writing style is both engaging and easy to read. There is a reason why this book has pleased readers of all ages for so long."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"When I first purchased The Count of Monte Cristo, I laughed to myself how long it was. Weighing in at a hefty 1200+ pages, the thickness was pretty intimidating. I thought it'd take me at least a month to finish.I ended up finishing the book in only a week and a half. What the other reviews say about this novel is true - you really won't want to put this down. Dumas may have written this book in the 19th century, but don't let time gone by deceive you - it reads like a modern day page turning thriller. Don't be surprised if you are emotionally invested in the characters and the story after only reading the first 4 or 5 Chapters. The plot is compelling, and it will keep you interested the entire time - not an easy task for a book this long.On the surface, this book is just plain entertaining. You'll have fun as you are reading. At its core, though, The Count of Monte Cristo presents insightful philosophies on human nature, revenge, and justice. It tackles intriguing questions and themes as it goes on. I think some of the more apparent ones are 'the limits of human justice' ... 'the saving power of forgiveness' ... and 'will those who are evil and selfish in the world be judged in the next life by some higher authority?'Dumas attempts to answer each of these questions with brooding, elegant passages and descriptions. Along the way, you'll meet interesting characters that you'll either really care about or genuinely despise. It was a bit tricky to keep track of all the characters and the relationships between them all, but eventually, things will lock in and you'll feel like you're a part of the story.It's a classic for a reason. Don't you want to find out why? Put this one on your list! The sprawling epic of Edmond Dantes is a spiritual journey, and it's one that is worth experiencing. It may change the way you feel about the tempting impulse to avenge, and push you towards the liberating power of mercy and forgiveness."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Edmond Dantes shows the true meaning of a superhero! Though he has no super powers, it is much more realistic than the comic MARVEL heroes such as \\"Spider Man\\" or \\"Hulk\\". He is taken away from his fiance\` to be thrown in prison for fourteen years after being falsely accused of Bonapartism during a time when Bonapart was exiled to the island of Elba.After fourteen years, however, Dantes escapes, with the help and wisdom of a supposed mad priest, and desires revenge on those who accused him of the crime. Over time, through love and wisdom, Dantes eventually finds that he not only needed to help his friends but he also needed to ask God to forgive him for possibly being vengeful.The characters are written with such emotion, the scenes with such detail, that one feels he is taking part in this cunningly written intense book. Alexandre Dumas has really done what others have not accomplished when writing such a carefully laid-out plot."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"It all begins at Marseilles on February 24, 1815. Nineteen-year-old Edmond Dant&eacute;s is a promising sailor. So promising, in fact, that he is about to be promoted to captain. He has saved up a fair amount of money and is about to make more with this promotion, enough to marry Mercedes, the love of his life. Young, vibrant, trusting and full of life, Dant&eacute;s couldn't be happier. And that is what causes his ultimate downfall. Envy, contempt and cowardice drive three men to wrongly accuse Dant&eacute;s of being a Bonapartist. For many years, Dant&eacute;s' only companions are a dungeon and a priest (fellow inmate). Dant&eacute;s has sworn revenge. The old priest and a small island called Monte Cristo will be the tools that help Dant&eacute;s become the Count of Monte Cristo, an avenging angel with a one-track mind. There are many twists throughout the novel.I read this book for the first time when I was sixteen. It had been a class assignment, and so I read it in automaton, not caring either way about the story. All I cared about was getting a decent grade on the quiz. Sixteen years later, I read it for the second time and... well, to say that I couldn't put this book down would be an understatement. The Count of Monte Cristo is a riveting tale full of history, suspense, romance and adventure. The backdrop of the Napoleonic era makes this book all the more palatable. Alexandre Dumas knew Napoleon and all of the political intrigue that went on during that era quite well. Even though I loved this book, there are some areas that threw me. Characters and storylines are thrown in without so much as an explanation at first. At times these occurrences felt like riddles or missing pieces to a puzzle I couldn't wait to complete. It all makes sense as the story progresses, of course, but it was nevertheless frustrating on some occasions. I don't know if the fault lies in Dumas' writing or in Lowell Bair's translation, or if the story had been intended to be narrated that way. In either case, it wasn't enough to keep me from enjoying the story. If you're new to Dumas, then this is the book to seek. It's one of the most popular classics for a good reason, after all!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The only way to get through a monster of a book like this is if the author grabs you by the collar on page one and doesn't let you go. This is really a unique combination of sheer size and whizbang storytelling. Otherwise you would have no chance of reaching the end.For the last several hundred pages I withdrew from the world into my den, emerging occasionally for a bowl of gruel and crust of bread before returning to the chore of finishing...this...leviathan!I recently finished A Tale of Two Cities, which though a classic in its own right of course pales by comparison to this in terms of complexity and grandeur. Though shorter, it took longer to get through than the Count. Not in number of hours, but in number of weeks. Once hooked you keep going back to the Count to get through another hundred pages.Buy it, read it, live it! But let your friends and family know you won't be around for a while."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The first week, I'm 200 pages in. Two weeks later, I'm 500 pages in. Three weeks after that, I'm 900 pages in. Another three weeks, I'm 1300 pages in. Another week, I'm 1400 pages in, and it still hasn't ended. It will go on forever. It's like a round trip from North Carolina to Amsterdam (I've never been to Amsterdam, but I'm sure it's a long trip).This is a huge book. Fifteen hundred pages: that's huge. I thought David Copperfield and The Brothers Karamazov were tomes. They're not. They're toddlers. They're babies in the shadow of Cristo. But you know something, it's a heck of a story. With the incredible girth of the book, Dumas still has the talent to keep you immersed in it. There are some 200 page books that can't hold my attention. This is why I rated it 5 stars. If you are going to write a LONG book, you better be a good storyteller who can make the reader's investment and commitment worthwhile.I originally bought the abridged version of Cristo, read it and enjoyed it. Then I found out about all of the stuff that was cut out. Entire storylines about the main characters totally discarded. So I bought the Modern Library Classics version. I guess I'll eventually have to do the same for Les Miserables.Regarding the actual plot, I don't like the Count. I like Edmond Dantes, but not his altar ego. He's evil. I know many fans may not agree with that assessment, but it's the truth. The Count of Monte Cristo has to abandon every ounce of decency and morality to exact his revenge. And is it just me or does the most despicable nemesis of Dantes get a much lighter punishment than the others? I mean, Danglars orchestrated the entire plan to bring down Edmond, yet Dumas has him redeemed and forgiven.The story is entertaining and narratively and morally complex.

Then as the Count of Monte Cristo he is able to exact revenge on those who have wrongly imprisoned him.

This truly is one of the best books I've ever read, and I strongly recommend it."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Compelling Description of Human Nature and MotiveThere is really no way to accurately review The Count of Monte Cristo. A simple review of its plot would be unfair to the genius of Dumas and to the profound insights into human nature and motivation that this book contains. Likewise, to approach this book merely for its psychological and anthropological value would be to ignore the imaginative flights of fancy and vistas for the mind's eye that this tome affords. Similarly, to approach The Count of Monte Cristo merely as a fable or a fairy tale is to forget that it is an accurate historical novel portraying the Franco-European mindset, as well as a crystal-clear exposition of the many social issues, conventions, and commonly-held fancies that characterized France throughout the post-Napoleonic era. However, for purely literary purposes, and due to constraints of space and time, a brief sketch of Dumas' masterpiece will have to suffice. Ideally, however, you will stop reading right here and get your hands on the book, thus skirting my woefully inadequate attempt to review this masterpiece fairly and coherently.Dumas' narrative follows the story of a virtuous young man struggling to come of age and find his place. However, in the classic battle of good versus evil, he is imprisoned unfairly and robbed of all that was dear to him. Eventually, he comes into great wealth and knowledge, escapes from captivity, and single-mindedly sets about to be the instrument of Divine vengeance on those who had previously denied him life and love. Along the way, he re-learns the value of friendship, and, having seen justice brought upon his enemies, finds unexpected love in an ending that is a triumphant, crescendoing testimony to the indomitable quality of the human spirit - and the mercy of God.Throughout this tale, Dumas teaches us of forgiveness, of love, of anger and hate, and reaches out to the reader with an intensity that can only come from a spirit that itself drank deeply of such emotions. Indeed, the story of Edmond Dantes - from the lowly but principled pauper to the rash, vengeful yet popular prince - smacks at times of Dumas' own rise from obscurity as an unknown mulatto to the powerful and respected literary force that he became.Granted, there are times when Dumas' heroes - like all heroes - take on superhuman qualities. However, they are not the indestructible supermen that mar much of today's literature. Instead, they are all too human - flawed sufficiently that their exploits are believable, and human enough that the reader often finds himself dialoguing with them, arguing for or against their intents and actions. In this way, it is the enduring human quality of the book - the ability for us to reach out across the better part of two centuries and dialogue freely and coherently with them, and to recognize the players and actors as fellow humans above all else - that makes it so compelling. Likewise, it is that essence of humanness that stands as the greatest tribute to Dumas.An insightful, powerful, fast-paced, and moving read, The Count of Monte Cristo is one of those books that does not end when the last page is turned and the book closed. Its imaginative power transcends the written page with timeless force, calling us to a greater, more vivid plane of existence and self-expression.Now get the book!- Benjamin Gene Gardner"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Edmond Dantes is a young sailor about to marry the daughter of the shipping company's owner. Two rascals, one for pure envy and the other because he also loves the girl, accuse him falsely of political conspiracy. The judge, a coward named Villefort, sends him to prison, trying to cover up on his father, who really is a conspirator. Edmond stays 14 years at the prison-island of If. During that time, he gets in contact with the Abbe Faria, a wise churchman who converts him into an educated man and, by listening to Edmond's story, discovers the treason and the gulity. Shortly before dying, Faria tells Edmonmd where to find an enormous treasure. When he dies, Edmond substitutes for him in the body-bag. The guards throw the bag to the sea and Edmond rips it open with a knife, goes to Montecristo and yes, the treasure is there. For ten years, he travels the world, becomes an enigmatic and cultivated man, and then sets to his goal in life: take revenge on those who damaged him, and reward the people who were good to him. And he does it in the grandest style you can imagine. The reader is pleased at the revenge and reward Montecristo brings on all the people he knew. The scenes are lush, brilliant, luxurious. Memorable ones are: the Venice carnival, where he meets the children of some of his enemies, and his entrance into the Paris jet-set. Unlike some reviewers, I don't complain about the length; if anything, I would have liked more adventures. It is hard to imagine a more colorful and brilliant novel, with a better plot and characters."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"&quot;Dantes stood up and looked in the direction the boat was moving. Several hundred yards ahead rose the steep black rock on which stood the somber Chateau d'If. The unexpected appearance of this dreaded prison, with its ceturies-old tradition of terror, produced the same effect on Dantes as the sight of the gallows on a man condemned to death&quot; (26). Just imagine the fear and loneliness that Edmond Dantes was experiencing as he looked up and realized that for no reason at all, he was condemned to a notorious prison. What would it feel like to know you may never see the people you love most again? How great would the frustration be of not knowing why you were being punished? The Napoleonic Era, an almost frightening time period to be living in, is the time in which this magnificent novel takes place. At any moment an innocent person could be convicted of a crime they did not commit and be thrown into a prison never to be seen or heard of again. Edmond Dantes, a youthful and happy man whom is soon to be married and live out a wonderful life, suddenly has his dreams of raising a family and being captain of a ship cut short by three selfish men. An oath of vengence is made on these evil men and a story of this vengence is told through such words that it seems almost as if Alexandre Dumas had experienced these events and thoughts in his own life. The Count of Monte Cristo is a novel which is so powerful, heartbreaking, and satisfying all at the same time that anyone who makes the decision to read it will certainly be changed by the time the fulfilling conclusion comes. The characters, especially Edmond Dantes who plays many different roles in the novel, are some that the reader will almost feel they could relate to or else despise in such a way that you wish you could be inside the novel to take your own revenge on them. Many of the characters, although living 200 years earlier than us, are very easy to relate to. Mercedes, who is so in love but is faced with a situation where she could either lay down and die or try and ease her loneliness, chooses the latter. Many people would probably do the same thing in this type of a situation and therefore makes this novel easy and enjoyable to read. Alexandre Dumas, as well as doing many other things, uses a very simple yet very impacting theme throughout his novel. Most everyone who reads this book has probably heard the saying, &quot;what goes around comes around&quot;. This one old sayng can pretty much sum this entire novel. It lets people appreciate the good and helpful things we are able to do for others instead of wasting our life with hatred and selfishness. Many people may object to reading this novel on the basis that it looks too long and would be too time consuming to read. If only everyone would give this book a chance they would see that this book is really a very good length in order to fully enjoy and feel the action and suspense that one should feel when reading a good book. Never in this novel is there a dull or boring moment, instead every word and sentece used is to keep the readers attention and keep them wanting more and more. From beginning to end The Count of Monte Cristo is a non-stop page-turner. If only Alexandre Dumas knew now what an extremely well constructed and entertaining novel he wrote. By the way he speeds up and slows down time he is able to focus his book on the parts that are important for the reader to know. The message that Dumas chose to get across in this novel is very important. Everyone should read this novel if not for the entertainment value then for the underlying themes of the novel. Everyone must take a chance and see what this wonderful novel has to offer."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I must say, after seeing that the length reached nearly 1500 pages, I was a little concerned about the content, however, I found this book to be the best book I have read.

I agree with all of the positives cited in the other reviews. Dumas is a master story teller, the tale is coherent and easily visualized. There are however, two drawbacks that ruined the book for me. Firstly, the story is so contrived that it completely destroys any suspension of disbelief. Secondly, the story is so predictable that you can see what's going to happen several hundred pages in advance.

But then, as I read, I began to take my own interest in it. Although I am only 13, it was easy enough to understand, and a very, very, very good book. I recommend it only to serious readers, however. I myself am a very serious reader, and was considering putting it down because I was having a little trouble getting through some slow parts in the book. If you think you'd have trouble 'getting through it' then I suggest that you don't read this book. It's a classic story about a man done wrong who comes back to wreak havoc on those who wronged him. I am dead serious that you should NOT read this book if you don't want either a challenge or a good read, or don't think you'd be prepared to deal with it. It has a complicated interworking of plots, three or four at a time. So don't read it unless you think you can deal with it.

So if you're an avid adventurer or an aspiring writer looking for ideas, tCoMC is a must-have.I'd even go as far to say this is the best book I've ever read."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is perhaps one of the best books I've ever read. I cannot say this for certain because of the doubts that arose in my mind whilst reading it; however, I felt that each chapter was better than the one before it, and the book has 117 chapters in all! That is why, even though I have some complaints regarding this book, I think it does deserve four stars, because one quality of richness is able to eliminate any deficiencies one may find.I cannot refrain from being critical of the fact that Edmond Dantes changes so drastically - from a nave young lad to a supreme being who has an \`infallible' scheming mind. Alexandre Dumas doesn't do much to attenuate the effect that such a radical change in the personality of the main protagonist may have on the reader. It is true that Dantes spends fourteen whole years in the Chateau d'If, but it is only in the very first parts of the book that this suffering is portrayed; the revenge takes many, many more pages to be effected than the imprisonment and the madness itself. It should be the task of the author to keep reminding the reader of the real internal suffering of Dantes more, or at par, than emphasising his feelings of revenge. On the other hand, such a well constructed plot is nothing less than admirable - one would think that only God could plan events so ably, making things happen to other people and being ready to see to the consequences as Dantes does. This is, according to me, the marvellous side of The Count of Monte Cristo - a character who, although quite inconsistent with the initial portrayal of his personality, has the opportunity to show his genius through such a strong feeling as vengeance.Another element I don't like in certain classics is the too-frequent mention of suicide, which is shown as something easily done or easily decided upon, just like this being the consequence of someone's whim. Maybe in the past centuries this act was more commonly done to protect one's honour, however, I will still insist that suicide shouldn't be so commonly mentioned, especially not as it is in this book, where more than one character resorts to it. It is on this point, however, that I was mostly struck in the whole load of Dantes' reflections, or more exactly, in his reflections made during the concluding chapters. He realises that life has a meaning and that it is to be preserved, so he eventually becomes a life-giver instead of a life-taker. Dantes finds true value in the words \\"wait\\" and \\"hope\\" - something that, when one reads the whole book, will understand in the same depth as Alexandre Dumas does, the latter being the real mind behind this great work."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Most people you run into say the idea of trying to escape from prison is a bad thing.

I can see all my notes in the margins from the many other times I've read it. Afterward I read the critical essay in the front, which stated that Dumas was good at plots, but not very good at character. I _disagree_. They said that the count changed, but with no satisfactory explanation of his change of character; and that the change of character (into a vengeful / resentful person) was not plausible. I don't agree. I have actually seen people in my own life who changed in exactly the same way. Also, there was certainly a satisfactory explanation!I think my favorite character is Albert. I wish there was more about him. Albert is sarcastic; has a great sense of humor; is fun-loving, intense, loyal, and intelligent. He can also be rash."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I bought this book off Audible.com and have been listening to it on my daily 1 1/2 hour commute.

It was interesting in my bookclub to hear all of the different plot lines left out of the various abridged versions. Some of them were pretty pivotal! I'd stick with this great version."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I've never been disappointed by a Dumas book, and this one is certainly no exception. With a gripping and intricate plot situated in a turbulent time in French history, THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO represents one of the the most widely recognized and important books of all time. More subtle and serious than the swashbuckling THREE MUSKETEERS, this one really speaks to the soul with highly emotional and real ethical dilemmas. Full of adventure, suspense, love, and drama, this book is hard to put down for the entire 1300+ pages. Even though you probably already know the basic jist of the story, don't hesitate to pick this one up. Knowledge of the outcome doesn't take away anything from the enjoyment of reading this top-notch novel. I can't speak to the abridged version, but I can't imagine it could be nearly as good, as the detail of this story is part of what makes it so gratifying.The best thing about this book is certainly the character of Edmond Dantes. Perhaps the best character in all of literature, the Count of Monte Cristo is a real delight. He represents everything you like about a hero to the extreme. Mysterious, powerful, intelligent, and caring, the Count is what drives this book. Watching as his absurdly complex, but brilliant, schemes for vengeance come to fruition represents one of the most enjoyable reading experiences to be had. While many of the characters in the book are great, they are all completely overshadowed by the immense figure of the Count.Alexandre Dumas makes numerous political statements in this book. Very satirical about the nobility, politics, and high society in general, this book represents the cultural tendencies of the time. Published during the reign of King Louis-Philippe, during a time of political unrest, uncertain future, and revolutionist ideas, this book was certainly well-received by some but not by others. Only a couple of years after this book's publication, the Second French Republic was founded under which Louis Napoleon Bonaparte was elected president. So, the conflicts we find in this book between the royalists and the republicans were still in evidence during its writing.I digress. This is a truly excellent book that shouldn't be missed by any fan of good literature. Don't let the length scare you away, as it is not wasted space and creates a wonderfully complex and beautiful story. Give yourself a month and read this masterpiece."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I purchased the book for a present for my son.He was very pleased with the book."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is the quitessential Dumas novel. This book is his own creation, not one which his factory of writers wrote and he flourished and embellished. He found a story about a cobbler who after being imprisoned by presumed friends brutally murdered them all. Dumas entrigued by this occurence proceeded to write a glorified version of it. The book provides the tense atmosphere of France during the Napoleonic Era, the political dealings and believable characters. From the most vile villain to the Count everyone seems human and flawed. Dumas has created a world in which one can easily delve into and be absorbed. This work is truly worth reading!!P.S. Do not be daunted by the length- after the first 50 pages or so the story truly moves!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo has to be one of my favorite novels. It's full of intricate plot twists, fascinating characters, romance, revenge, hope, despair, deception, betrayal, redemption and all the other emotions and experiences that make up life. All of the characters are multi-layered, no one, not even Edmund Dantes (aka the Count) acting out of easily-defined motives, and are intertwined in such beautifully complex ways with terrific backstories. Edmund takes revenge on these horrible people who ruined his life and took his fiance and future away from him, but one still feels a little sorry for them, because they're real characters. All in all, a fantastic book that really delves into the psyche of revenge. It's quite long, but it's worth it because it is so intricate and detailed and so beautiful."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"\\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is an intriguing tale of retribution. The complex and rivetting plot revolves around Edmond Dantes, a idealistic and principled young man who is unwittingly framed for a serious crime, and sentenced to spend the rest of his life in prison. There he meets a man who will change his life...and point him towards freedom and his means of vengeance on those who have wronged him. Without a doubt, this novel is a masterpiece, attaining the balance of true symphony between justice and revenge. The characterization and atmosphere portrayed is rich enough to evoke anyone's imagination. Dumas' attention to detail adds to the ambiance and vivacity of the tale. As a fitting testament to it's nearly be rushed, rather savored. The unabridged version (875 pages) is a must, with its banquet of flavorful scenes - it is a full course meal for any hungry bookworm - the abridged version is merely a buttered cracker. \\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is one of my most treasured novel and, without hesitation, by far the best book I have ever read! I stand by this opinion so ardently, that I always keep extra copies of it in my bookshelf, in case I meet with someone who will really appreciate it. Avid readers, enjoy!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Make sure you get the Oxford World's Classic edition, or another unabridged version. This book is too good to cut out more than 70% of the book like some of the abridged versions have done.I mean who would go to see Matrix Reloaded and be satisfied with only 30% of the movie from random scenes?! Of course not!As far as the story itself, don't try to look at the story and if its perfect or what is believable or not. Start trying to find yourself in there, because you are in this book somewhere. This is a book of human nature, not simple revenge. It explores many facets of humanity, and you need to see how you fit into them!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This book was a gift to me from my sister, and I must say it was one of the best gifts I could have received. Having recently read 'Les Miserables' (the book is so much better than a movie or play) I was primed for The Count. The stories are so similar; two men who escape prison and begin a journey towards enlightenment and salvation. The only difference being that Jean Valjean was a true criminal who redeems himself through selfless philanthropy while Edmund Dante (the Count) is a wrongly convicted man who uses his wealth for revenge. Yet both of these stories ultimately have identical moral themes.Classics such as these transcend time, and for good reason. You will not be able to put it down once you start reading it; it will give you a profound sense of humanity when you put it down, and will keep you thinking well after you have finished it."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This book is stted in Paris, France and the main actor is Edmond Dantes.

It&#65533;s about a man named Edmond Dantes who&#65533;s wrongly accused being a Bonapartist. He goes to jail and somehow becomes a count. The count he becomes is the ******************. It has a lot of twists and turns.

There was a lot of excitement and suspense. For example Edmond gets in a duel and Edmond is dragged to the bottom of the ocean. One thing I didn&#65533;t like about the book was that it didn&#65533;t start out that exciting. It is though, a book you can&#65533;t put down.I believe this book has a very good message. The message is: &#65533;help your friends and they will help you&#65533;. I think this because: Edmond helped an abbe\` and the abbe\` helped him, and Edmond saved Morrel&#65533;s and Valentine&#65533;s life and they were his eternal friends.

Whence from there he begins to revenge himself on the ones who did him the great injustice that put him through the suffering of isolation in jail.This is a brilliantly written book that only a few could even think of. Maybe the idea of a man getting revenge is common, but only Dumas could put it into words of such power, showing the cleverness of Dantes as he takes each step towards getting revenge upon all his enemies. Although it might be a bit confusing at first, with all the detail, once you understand everything that goes on in the intelligent mind of the Count of Monte Cristo aka Dantes, you will be captivated by this book."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"The Count of Monte Cristo is a great read. I decided to read the book after having seen the movie. Where the movie is an action adventure, the book is drama to its core. As always, I regret having seen the movie first and having it's characterizations impressed on me. In this case, the movie and book are so different that it didn't matter too much.The book is about a young man, Dantes, who is severely wronged. He is imprisoned and vows to get vengeance on those who caused him to suffer. He meets a mentor in prison, escapes, and then finds his mentor's treasure. With this treasure, as a older man, he is able to exact revenge on his enemies. His many twisted schemes form the bulk of the book (practically ignored in the movie). The way these plans weave in and out of each other is magnificent.The Count of Monte Cristo should be on everyone's &quot;Must Read&quot; list. It is truly a masterpiece that should not be missed."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"As a 16 year old girl, I couldn't believe how amazing this book was. I read it after watching the 2002 movie version. The book differs from the movie in the endings and most of the details, but the general plot of prison, money, and revenge remains. I liked them both in their own respect.This is one of those exciting books that you can't put down. I read this version and I am glad I did. At the book store, I compared it to the unabriged versions, and not only did this version contain more, the translator tends to use better word choice and has superior sentence fluency.The plot of the story is intriging and exciting. If you like books that make you twist your head around and think, this is for you! Also this is NOT a boring classic (like many are): it actually keeps your interest for the majority of the time.Therefore, I give the Count of Monte Cristo 5 stars and encourage you to read it. You won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This isn't a review so much as a warning; I never read the book once I found out that it is an abridged edition. It says so across the back of the book, but there's nothing about it on Amazon's page. I sent the book back and received a refund. If you want to read Alexandre Dumas's complete masterpiece, find yourself another edition."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"\\"The Count of Monte Cristo\\" is definitely a must-read. One can be daunted by the length of this specific translation and the sheer thickness of the paperback, but do not be faint-hearted! It is worth the wait and effort.The story is loosely based on a true account, but this fact doesn't take away from Dumas' genius. He not only reveals to us the eccentricities and fashionable trends of the period, but also uses the protagonist to criticize the obvious faults of the upper class Parisian society. The novel touches on the defects of the society at large, ranging from the lack of accountability in the \\"justice\\" system, which condemns him to lifelong imprisonment through trickery and cover-up, to the philandering and adultery, which are rampant and almost EXPECTED among the rich. Edmond Dantes (the Count) is an especially useful tool for Dumas' purposes, because he leads a life of many facades. At one turn, the Count seems to fit right into the gossiping and brokering of influence, but in his private moments he despises and holds those around him in contempt. And with good reason, for most of those folks are his enemies.Like Victor Hugo and his Jean Valjean, Dumas creates a protagonist who is marred by society and abused to the point of no return. The grace (or miracle) of God provides the escape from that point, and both characters use their faith to build new lives. But we see in Edmond Dantes a very different path taken, compared to Jean Valjean. Dantes and Valjean use their faith to opposite ends, one toward revenge and the latter toward reform.The greatest challenge in this book is to go along with Dantes on his quest to destroy his enemies. Edmond Dantes firmly believes God gave him a divine purpose, to bring justice and judgment, and to execute vengeance as the instrument of God. His life after discovering Abbe Faria's fortune is wholly dedicated to this goal. He is a man obsessed, to the point of losing his humanity, and in danger of destroying himself in the process. Dantes does go through at least two situations where he doubts himself, but does not relent until he goes too far; his actions lead to deaths of those who are not his enemies, and he realizes his hubris. Near the end, he is able to forgive his last-remaining enemy; in addition, he becomes a blessing to his friends Maximilien and Valentine. For a man whose entire life has been dedicated to hatred and anger, Dantes is finally able to find hope and love, again. This book is certainly about the fascinating details of vengeance, but ultimately it is about the redemption of one man, Edmond Dantes, and the realization that without mercy, love, and humility, justice cannot be meted out.Finally Dumas includes relevant historical context (such as the return of Napoleon which provides the backdrop), as well as filling out the personal history of some of the characters. This adds much to the story, literally and figuratively. One can appreciate the intricacies of family history and the flashback-style stories, and we applaud Dumas for his brilliance and hard work, but the overabundance of names and historical references can be tiresome at points. It is also slightly annoying to be constantly flipping back to the Notes section in order to find out the significance of certain Italian phrases, when it might be better served to put those references in the footnotes.Overall, this book is highly recommended! I greatly enjoyed it, cover to cover. As great novels usually are, this work is intended not only to entertain, but it also raises questions of justice, faith, and divine purpose. It achieves a balance of social criticism peppered with nostalgic and chivalric romance, perhaps the reason why this book is one of the beloved classics."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I keep hearing that The Count of Monte Cristo is a great swashbuckling book of vengeance. I keep wondering if same said \\"readers\\" actually read the book. Au contraire, Dumas' serialized story that we now receive in a 1200+ page novel is actually an intricate waltz of a character study, that when read with patience and expectation almost feels as if the reader has been supernaturally imbued with the wisdom and experience of the 24 years that the novel covers.The story opens with an innocent Edmond Dantes who is brutally betrayed by those who abuse their positions, and it continues with ever increasing progression of Dantes' understanding: his understanding of suffering, of evil; his understanding of wisdom from the dear Abbe; his understanding of the abuse of position that originated his personal hell, his understanding of others' human natures, both good and evil; and finally, his understanding of his own self. After multiple sub-plots that orbit the Count and illuminate both the characters that revolve around him, as well as himself, Dumas wraps up the novel with a fitting and satisfactory conclusion that flirts with the philosophical.The novel's pace more than makes up for its daunting length-there are rarely slow moments. If it seems like Dumas is about to do something predictable, keep reading: his follow-up is always unexpected. I can only criticize Dumas for trivial concerns, which I won't get into here, but his handling of the plot is beyond reproach.What sticks beyond the reading itself, however, is the study of people that Dumas puts forward, replete with a sweeping spiritual hypothesis on the nature of humanity itself that can only be proposed using the method of the adage, \\"show, don't tell.\\" There are so many characters that we get to know well, who stay with us, reinforcing Dumas' observations. From the evil, such as Fernand and Danglars, to the pathetic, like Caderousse, to the unexpected--in Nortier, Albert, Eugenie--and even the angelic, Morrel, Haydee, the Abbe, we see a great slice of humanity parade before us in the vivid pages. And every one of them is somehow kindled by Dantes, the sparkling youth, then the supernatural catalyst and demigod, and finally, simply and totally, the man, soul bared and naked before his God. It is a breathtaking epic far deeper than the adolescent revenge romp that its literary reputation has been reduced to.Robin Buss' translation, notes and introduction are essential and very well done, worthy of the work itself, and sure to be the preeminent English version for a very long time. In short, this is not one of those books that you check out from the library and return: this is a work to be bought in hardback, to be read, re-read, and passed down."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Nowhere in the description of this item or in the book itself does it mention that this is an abridged book with a number of plot resolving sections omitted. Amazon - you must state in the listing for these \\"Enriched Classics\\" books that they are abridged and therefore are useless as school books, etc. Very misleading by the publisher!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is getting 3 stars because the story is GREAT, but THIS EDITION IS ABRIDGED. Nowhere on the book does it say it's abridged, but it is. It is approximately 600 pages long, while the original is over 1300 pages --- that is some SERIOUS EDITING.There are some pretty important words in the half they ripped out; including some major developments for specific characters -- a murder, a family leaving one of the targets of the Count's wrath, etc.This is a GREAT story, just not this edition."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I read an abridgement of Count of Monte Cristo several years ago and enjoyed it immensely but wondered what I had missed. Later after I discovered Everyman's beautiful editions I searched their titles on their website and found they had nothing by Dumas. I wrote them a letter suggesting that they publish some.Apparently, enough people wrote in: They published what I feel to be his best novel. As soon as I was aware of it I obtained one of my own. As I expected the unabridged version was far better.Another reviewer said that the translation in this edition was one of the worst. I didn't notice it if it was. The story flowed and held my interest so that I could not put it down for the last third. It's definitely one I will go back and read again.The Everyman's edition is just beautiful with creamy paper, cloth cover and sewn binding. I carried it around with me in the few days it took me to read it.If you buy it from Amazon you will save a significant chunk of change. It's much spendier in the bookstores.I do hope they will publish more Dumas."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Listening to these 37 CDs seemed like a daunting task at first but once I started this enthralling story - I couldn't get enough. Actually, I loved the story so much that I listened to these CDs whenever I was in the car and read the bookThe Count of Monte Cristo (Penguin Classics)at all other times, by picking up where I left off with the CDs. I was able to finish the story in about a week by doing it this way, which is really something, since I had never read or listened to a book of this length before. The translations are a bit different between these CDs and the aforementioned version of the book translated by Robin Buss, but they are similar enough that it was not hard to go from CD to book and back. The man who voices this book is simply amazing. His accents, voice modulation, and pacing are all top notch and this kept me on the edge of my seat throughout the story. I would highly recommend this set to anyone who wants to really get to know this story. Be warned though, its about 40 hours long...but worth every second!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Although I have not read any other translations of The Count of Monte Cristo, I can attest that the Modern Library Classics version is one that was scripted so beautifully that I had to reread many passages twice: once for the content and a second time for how the words just flow into your mind. When I checked this book out from the library, I was completely engrossed. Upon returning it, I ventured to bookstores to find the same exact version. Many different books had another translation (I read the same passage which was vividly engraved in my memory from the first read through!) and found that other translations do not pack the same emotional energy this version has.Enough said about the translation. This book is a sheer masterpiece. I may go on to read other of Dumas's works, such as the Three Musketeers 5 book series, but upon reading varied reviews, about half of the 3000 pages in that series is a huge miss. I'm still unsure if I want to begin the series. On the other hand, the Count of Monte Cristo has no boring passages whatsoever. Every page, every paragraph, every sentence was poetry to feed the mind. Everything flowed smoothly.The romance, drama, REVENGE, religion, suspense... everything you wanted is in this book. Some pages left me heartbroken, others made me rejoice. It is truly something that can be read again and again and you will find something new each time. This is by far the longest book I have read, and I truly enjoyed every minute of it. Sometimes you empathize with Edmond, at other times you question his actions. But overall, this book just packs so much into one. Just leave some time to read it all the way in one go. To leave it to finish it later will only make you confused when you pick it up again because there is just so many key characters in the novel."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I thought I liked the movie, until I read the book. Now I realize the movie was pathetic, and that the filmmakers could not have been more wrong when they decided to make it a \\"happily ever after\\" kind of movie. The book ends on somewhat of a high note, and certainly gives you a warm, fuzzy feeling, but isn't exactly a feel-good book. But it's so much better that way, and more realistic. It left me feeling staggered.Another thing about the movie: it left out some of the best characters. Where was Haydee, Monte Cristo's slave and adopted daughter? Or Valentine and Maximilian, probably the sweetest couple in the book? I know the movie would have been more complicated if they were included, but come on.But enough about the movie. I can certainly see why this book is a classic. It's deeply moving, surprisingly easy to read for an old book, and has one of the most amazing fictional characters of all time in it: Monte Cristo himself. Edmond Dantes is the character every author wishes they could create. What else can I say? It's a thick one, but give this book a chance."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Alexandre Dumas, author of &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot; and the &quot;Man In the Iron Mask&quot;, has given the literary world the adventure novel, forever bringing it to the level of the classic. The Count of Monte Cristo is mainly a story of revenge. The Romanticism in which the novel is characterized and the Napoleonic France for the setting, sets the mood for this nearly psychologically thrilling story that only a great French master like Dumas could create. Edmund Dantes, wrongly accussed of a crime he did not commit, taken to a prison of which there is no escape by his enemies, his only love taken by his best friend, spends years of suffering and harboring hatred in a rotting prison cell. But he also plans his revenge, how he methodically desires to bring upon the fateful end to his enemies and win back his love. He successfully manages to escape from prison and discovers a vast fortune. Assuming the identity of the Count of Monte Cristo, he extracts his revenge. What moral theme does Dumas really want to convey ? In the end, we discover how unfulfilled and how miserable our hero is, even when he has had the satisfaction of punishing his enemies. Dumas should be credited for such a marvelous work. He writes in the highest French Romantic fashion, and should be hailed with as much praise as Gustav Flaubert. The Three Musketeers, the immortal adventure story that made him famous, has been made into numerous films, and even The Count of Monte Cristo has had a terrific film version starring Will Chamberlain. A new release of the novel is set for January 25th of this year. Dumas may have died penniless, and he may not have been considered an excellent voice of the romantic age, but it is 2001 and we are still enthralled with the tales of intrigue, suspense, romance and adventure that this wonderful French writer conceived.

It might be kind of hard to follow at first, but here is a little hint. The Count Of Monte Cristo = Edmond Dantes. That will make the book a little easier to follow. Now, BUT IT!!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"A very well-paced novel of classic romantic literature, the Count of Monte Cristo is yet another masterpiece from Alexandre Dumas. I have only read the abridged, but it was enough to judge by. While beautifully written and expressed with vivid detail, it was too dramatic to be given 5 stars. Dumas makes the mistake of making Dantes a god, and giving him infinite intellect. He is not a real-life character in the least! Therefore, it is hard to believe all the 'once in a blue moon' events that occur around and through Dantes.However, Dantes' revenge is so fantastic, that it is hard to discredit the book. Reverting from the classic 'kill-all' revenge, Dantes stealthily discredits all his oppressors, involving the reader with the plot. But Dantes himself knows perhaps too much, can do things that are not humanly possible... and so, I rate this book 4 stars."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I found the thought of reading this book rather intimidating as it's 1077 pages long. Once reading however, it was compulsive enough to be worth the effort (I'm a slow reader). It holds an extremely clever plot which hooked me and made me admire the author and the book but...never quite managed to make me really believe in the Count as a man; this Godlike being formerly a young sailor, wrongly imprisoned, educated by a fellow-lag into this all-knowing, manipulative and omnipotent (but sentient) creation. I had to will the suspension of disbelief and managed it just enough to enjoy the book. I liked, or rather agreed with, the idealistic themes, the lack of truly good and bad main characters - the four of Dantes targets are all very human. Some of the secondary characters seemed too good to be true though but more depth to them may have resulted in a further few hundred pages!Taken less seriously, if you just want to enjoy a book, it's a compulsive, fun read with not too many frustratingly long-drawn out parts- though there are some."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This book was specifically required by my daughter's 8th grade English teacher, in the version obtained from Amazon.

Didn't know until I finished it's 1312 pages! Started out fine. but really bogged down. Dumas kept dragging in so many characters, it was hard to keep them all straight.Part of the problem was that, if I read wiki correctly, it was originally written as a serial - you know, like soap operas that never have a conclusion. There really wasn't a conclusion, in my mind, to this book.Bought free from Amazon and downloaded to my BlackBerry and read a chapter a day for 3 months. Since I always have my phone with me, could read it while waiting for a plane or on a plane at home and abroad or in a line etc."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Although the story is well known to me, the editing of this audio book was so confusing. I absolutely could not follow it. Too much is cut out."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I ordered this book 8 days ago, and finished it today, so i read the 1462 pages pretty fast you could say... But i was very taken into the book and enjoyed it until i got near the end.... Where it just collapsed.Dumas built up way too much on the characters, like Albert and Franz to let them have such a poor ending, or NO ending. I found myself getting bored sometimes when it seemed like the story was going nowhere since so many pages were wasted on meaningless parts like the whole \\"italy carnival\\".The Story seems to distant itself from Edmond and get into the sub-plot \\"romances\\". I found my self feeling less sympathetic towards Dantes as the story progessed but more sympathetic towards Albert, Mercedes, Valentine and... Where is jacopo?Dumas leaves out far too much, after spending far too much time building up the story, to let it just die at the end. We all know Valentine is alive, why waste page after page Edmond and Morrel talking about it.. WHEN he could be talking about Haydee more or Franz or albert or Better yet, re-joining mercedes instead of deserting her and finding out if albert is really his son or not. I couldnt understand why Dumas makes you wonder by hints that maybe albert is Edmonds son but does nothing to confirm it. Was this clever in some \\"analyzing way\\"(cant stand analyzing books like this) or was it just a mistake?Ending with Morrel was far too expected(all that build up for what..) and really wasted to much time with the whole \\"wait longer\\" part so it would be clever in someway with his father's waiting. Give me a break. Last chapter made me wonder what made Dumas give up on such a good book. Maybe his publisher was pushing him, or he wanted to just finish it or his reader's were losing interest... Honestly though when i got to the last 2-3 chapters i realized there wasnt another 100 pages and was disappointed after allllll that reading.I wanted to read the unarbridged to know the real story(because i usually prefer the original of books) but when i finished i realized i was better off just reading the abridged because so much of it was meaningless and the ending was horrible to spend so much time on a book to be disappointed.Great Start to a book, not so great halfway in where he is in Italy but it soon picks up to tell of his new fame by doing good acts and becoming friends with his enemies who he is slowly(really slow) making plans to ruin. I thought the Andrea part was pretty smart but it drags on too long. Getting to the end of the book, i thought the ruin of Morcerf, danglars and Villefort's family were genius, but the ruin of Albert and his mother was pathetic and undeserving.Being that Edmond never did trully marry her, i dont think they were in the whole \\"Love till death\\" situation. Would have been better a romance had they fell in love in the end... but I guess the Moral of the French in 1800's regarding \\"Forgiveness\\" is much different than that of our modern time \\"Christianity\\" views, which dumas loves to bring up. I dont see how he could call Edmond a Christian or any the other characters(the bad ones who claim they are) such as it is disgraceful towards the religion.To much Emphases on Edmond being \\"Angel of Revenge\\" and his so called philisohpical views...Book has many Flaws to it, but thats to be expected in such a big book. Cant say its the Best book i ever read but its up there. Have to say \\"Les Meserables\\" was a better french story. Doesnt need 1400 pages to be good... and that story was sad but uplifting as it has good morals to it, while Count of Monte Cristo had very few... unless you think playing God is ok and deciding for yourself the fate of others, who really didnt deserve to suffer but did.... Also thought the \\"wisdom\\" at the end wasnt to smart. ;oOverall i give it 4 stars, since it had a pretty good story and was interesting. Lacked a good conclusion after all those pages.. but makes up for it with the justice right before it. These are all my opinions and im sorry if you dont agree, but i spent too much time reading so carefully in such a short time and so willingly to be disappointed by the lack of another 4-5 chapters to explain the \\"other characters\\" he forgets about, but has so much emphasis early on in, So i cant give it 5 stars. :(IF you had the patience to read Counte of Monte Cristo, read the bible even if you dont believe in it but.. to at least read the interesting stories. IF you Ever hear of Joeseph and Technicolor Raincoat, a play well known, adapted from a bible story) That story is so close in so many ways to this book, i think you get the picture... (and people wonder where such great stories come from... writers have a Sub-conscious too.)Recommend Reading: The Devil's Advocate(not the movie, and has nothing to do with it), By Taylor Caldwell. Les Meserables(unabridged), by Victor hugo. \\"THE BIBLE\\" .... it has sooooo many good stories which Books like THE COUNT OF MONTE CRISTO originated from. The bible is almost the same size and you get much more from it(story and morality wise)."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"It is rare to find in modern writing the wonderful complexity that exists in this book.

Terrible formatting will not let you get pleasure from reading this book."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"I didn't think I would add another review to the already 8,000 + out there. But, while reading the final pages of this book, I found myself overcome with emotion. When a book can do that, it deserves a little notation.Most everything has been said about this towering classic. I particularly liked Joel's review, complete with pictures. However, when I picture The Count, it is a mix of Edmund Blackadder and Orson Welles.In any case, what I have taken from this book is a lesson in the law of unintended consequences. While everything (sort of) falls into place for the Count's well-planned revenge, one cannot escape the myriad of tendrils that effect so many other people. Edmond realizes that perhaps he had gone too far in his scheme, but yet those guilty parties most likely deserved their comeuppance.Other lessons are learned through these men (Danglars, Villefort, Mondego, and Caderrouse). One cannot escape one's sins forever, greed has no happy ending, and desire for power will rot your soul. Though the style of this book, and of the time, is one of exaggeration and over-the-top emotions, the story is timeless. When we step on the backs of others to reach the top, is it not inconceivable that one of those broken bodies will rise again and pull us from our pedestal?Davis' translation is wonderful and the notes are extremely helpful in understanding the time frame of the story. I can only imagine Dumas' readers, waiting expectantly for the next installment, talking in cafes excitedly over the latest \\"episode.\\"There isn't much more that I can say that will add to the discussion, except that this book should be required reading for everyone.There are very few books I re-read, and this will be one of them."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"While the Three Musketeers is better known, Dumas treatment of The Count of Monte Cristo is exceptional. His character development is excellent and puts one into the scene. An excellent read. One classic to be revisited."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is my third time reading my favorite novel, The Count of Monte Cristo. It was an easier read, I think because of the translation as well as because I paid more attention to the characters in the early part of the book because I knew they'd be playing their roles again later. The first time I read it, sometimes it was a strain to remember later who had done what back in the beginning.What was interesting was to see how my feelings about some of the characters was different with this reading than in the past. I could see how I have evolved as a person and in my philosophy about life as I reacted differently to how the book unfolded. That was unexpected, and it was satisfying.I bought this to read on my Kindle. Was going to get the free version but saw another review that said this translation was better. So I read the first three or four pages of each edition free online, and easily saw the difference in the translation. It's worth paying a few bucks for this translation.The story is as gripping as ever. Whether it's your first time or third time, prepare to be mesmerized!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This book has it all.

This 300-450 page novel does not do it justice. A lot of passages have been edited out and in some way translated extremely poorly. As a fan of Dumas or just a reader I would NOT recommend this book, instead go and get the 1000-1100 page version, idk if they make it in a softcover though, but that edition is EPIC.This is like watching a movie in fastforward, you miss a ton of the most important vital conversations/scenes b/c you're only skipping through for the action, and then just as you're about to get interested it'll end.Great for highschool book reports terrible for people that actually enjoy reading."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Again, classic Alexandre Dumas and a great story.

I WAS a bit curious though..All in all, I found it an amazing book. I especially love how Dumas protrays each character--true, they can get a bit mixed up at times, but it didn't deter me!--with deep thought for each of their personalities and proper actions (At least, I thought their actions were very appropriate in proportion to the descriptions of them).Also, the plot is interesting and intense enough to keep you immersed. Sometimes Dumas explains things a bit too much, but skimming through those parts hasn't damaged the story (for me, at least). I highly recommend The Count as a leisure book, or for anytime, really.

This tale of adventure, vengence, and romance is one all should read."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"This is such an awesome book with quite an extraordinary plot. It's rare that I've read books this long--even for my classes in school. There's so much drama, so much suspense, so much awe, mystery and sophistication in detail that makes this book a true masterpiece, indeed! I couldn't put the book down and finished it all in a few days.I really don't want to ruin the plot for anyone, so i'm not going to go into any details. It's just amazing how a character can be at a new climax in life, fall to great depths, and then rise again.There will always be parts of the book where you might say or think things should have been different. But that's what happens when you watch almost any drama movie, for sometimes we don't want any sadness directed towards characters we grow to love. But sometimes that makes you appreciate the plot even more.Believe me, you really will love some of the characters in this book. Just give it a chance.I have to admit that I read the ... edition of this book, and I'm not sure if it is a different translator or if it is abridged to a different degree. I looked up the translator, but the book didn't say, and it's not for sale here on Amazon[.com], which is why I'm reviewing this book.Sometimes it's hard to pick out the right edition for a translated book. But I've asked so many people about this book, and all that I've known to read it have unanimously praised it. I don't think you can go wrong, but make sure you do the research before picking one specific book.And finally, I'd say don't pick a book with an ugly picture of the Count on the front. He's supposed to be a relatively good-looking guy, and an ugly picture on the cover can psychologically influence a partial opinion towards him contrary to the descriptions of the text. ;)"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Please don't let the length of this book scare you!

And the bast part is that all the villians get their just what's coming to them, making it a most gratifying reading experience.I have friends who refuse to read this book because they already saw the movie and think their is no point. I have seen multiple film adaptations of The Count of Monte Cristo and none come anywhere close to the original story.I urge you to read this book. It is an absolute must for anyone who loves adventure. The only disadvantage, if it is a disadvantage, is you won't be able to accomplish anything until you have finished the book. You simply won't be able to put it down!"},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"Everything in Edmond Dantes' life is going right-he is about to become the captain of a ship, and about to marry his true love, Mercedes. All the good things in Dantes' life are wrenched from his grasp in an instant, due to the betrayal of men he once considered friends. Dantes is unjustly thrown into prison. In jail, the kind, friendly Dantes the reader is introduced to is transformed into a merciless conspirator, bent on extracting revenge from those who betrayed him.Dantes comes upon a fortune that he would never have even dreamed of, and with its aid, is able to hide behind the mask of the Count of Monte Cristo, a mysterious, brooding man with a huge amount of power. Dantes slowly and subtly begins to ruin the lives of the men who ruined his own life fourteen years ago.Alexandre Dumas' tale is thrilling, full of excitement and surprising twists and turns. His writing style is hardly ever slow. In the middle, it seemed like he was abandoning the main story line, but by the end the author cleverly ties all the loose ends together to weave a fantastic story. This book is sure to please anyone who enjoys reading about love, betrayal, revenge, adventure, action, romance, and most importantly, self-discovery and change. Dumas shows the reader, through Dantes, how pain and anguish can change a person so extremely.I highly recommend this book. Dumas' writing is so good; I was caught up in the story of Dantes instantly. I felt horrible when he was thrown in jail, and triumphant when he finally extracts revenge from his enemies. Though, in the middle of the book, is seems a little slow, the author soon picks up the main plot line again and all the subplots make sense again. The characters are well-developed, and the story, though not quite plausible, is full of exciting and delightful surprising."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"So much has been written about &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; that it is well nigh impossible to add or subtract to the opus of literary criticism (including all that has been written right here on Amazon.com.) So, rather than trying to provide a plot overview, or extolling the virtues of Dumas' story of injustice, obsession and revenge, I would like to take a somewhat contrary stance and point out that this is a literary masterpiece with a few &quot;classic&quot; flaws.The first is the narration. Undoubtedly, it suffers from the fact that Dumas wrote this story in serial form. That's a fair excuse, but what is troublesome is his abrupt shift from the Count's rescue of the Morrel family shipping business, to his 100+ page Italian excursion, including the chapters on, &quot;Roman Bandits&quot;, &quot;The Carnival At Rome&quot;, etc. I suppose one could argue that we are introduced to the Viscount Albert de Morcerf and Baron Franz d'Epinay in Italy, but surely these two secondary characters could have been just as easily place in France where all the action is. I guess I'm left with the gnawing suspicion that Dumas once filled his travel journal with numerous observations and insights about Italy, and decided it was a good time to spill them all out about a quarter of the way through &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo.&quot; Unfortunately, his Italian excursion (artfully rendered in its own right) throttles what was a driving, haunting compelling narrative, which reaches a wondrous climax when the Count mysteriously steps in to save the Morrels.My other issue is the sheer improbability of coincidences that pile up on one another. The artist is entitled to ask of the reader to engage in a certain willing suspension of disbelief. But I think Dumas has asked the reader for a bit too much. We know the Count, bent on retribution and revenge, is an outright control freak who obsessively manipulates Caderousse, Danglars, Villefort and Fernand. He's got them on a string. But the circumstances that tie these four together go far beyond the Count's machinations. Dumas has entangled them all in a spider web of relationships that is entirely contrived.With that said, who, today, would like to challenge Dumas to a creative writing contest? Most assuredly, not I. One of the reasons &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; is such an enduring classic is that any criticism is overwhelmed by the sheer literary virtuosity of Alexandre Dumas. One reviewer said that, &quot;....you just don't find novels like this anymore.&quot; There's a very good reason for that. No one alive today can right like this!One last observation. I read Sir Walter Scott's &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; shortly before picking up &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo.&quot; In some way, I got the feeling that Scott portrayed Medieval Englishmen the way 19th Century Englishmen would have liked to have thought of themselves. Dumas has rendered a national portrait of his countrymen as well, but I don't get the sense he cared whether or not they liked the image."},{"Title":"Monte Cristo,","review":"THIS IS THE BEST BOOK EVER. THE STORY IS INCREDIBLY LONG BUT INCREDIBLY INVOLVED AND INTERESTING. THE WRITING IS CLEAR AND UNDERSTANDABLE, AND EVEN THOUGH IT IS REALLY LONG, IT IS REALLY WORTH IT.

The rest of the book is where the whole story unfolds, etc. etc. etc.You MUST read this book. Don't miss it!

On the whole, a cool little book which I quite enjoyed perusing. Three and a half stars."},{"Title":"For the Love of Children","review":"BOOK REVIEW By Maryanne Raphael, Writers WorldFOR THE LOVE OF CHILDREN is an inspiring treasure of quotations, poems, and anecdotes that celebrate today's children and the child living within each of us.

Robin Casarjian's amazing work facilitates this transformation to occur within the intense setting of a prison. I have facilitated the twelve week Houses of Healing course based on the book within prisons as well as in a 400 level university course where future counselors in criminal justice experienced it for their own personal growth. Because of the universal application and appeal, Houses of Healing resonates and supports emotional healing in both venues."},{"Title":"Houses of Healing: A Prisoner's Guide to Inner Power and Freedom","review":"I have been a teacher of the emotional literacy course that has evolved from this book at a NYS prison for women every year since 1999. In the Introduction to the accompanying TRAINING MANUAL, Casarjian writes, \\"At a time when many prisons are cutting back on treatment and counseling services, it is particularly important to find ways to offer help to those who want it. Too many prisoners are being released without being offered opportunities to face and heal some of the core issues that got them to prison in the first place.\\" And that is exactly what this book/course does: encourage inmates to face and heal themselves. The power of the book/course is extraordinary. As one inmate wrote at the end of the course, \\"I am not the same miserable, hurt and lost soul who was first incarcerated three years ago. I have learnt so much about myself that I don't think this would have been possible had I tried this self-discovery on my own.\\" I cannot think of a better book to give a friend or relative who is in prison and looking for hope and healing."},{"Title":"Houses of Healing: A Prisoner's Guide to Inner Power and Freedom","review":"As part of my job, I read this book because I had heard so much about it. It was not only a disappointment, but also a waste of my time. I could not believe the drivel it contained. The writing is so poor that the text is actually difficult to follow, and, to top it all off, the concepts are so trite, hackneyed and saccharine that following the text yields nothing. No insight, no information, no enhanced awareness. Nothing. I am at a loss to explain the good word of mouth this paperback has received except to suggest that perhaps the people who order it for prisoners don't actually read it before ordering. It's a waste of paper, newsprint and glue."},{"Title":"Houses of Healing: A Prisoner's Guide to Inner Power and Freedom","review":"This frank and loving guidebook provides a rare ray of hope to people who might otherwise remain stuck in a pattern of self-defeating behaviors. I have personally observed the changes in prisoners who have used this book with the corresponding workbook as a guide for personal growth groups. The results are nothing short of miraculous. The book is clearly written and easy to follow, making it accessible for people with all levels of education. The case examples that Ms. Casarjian uses to illustrate her points are at once deeply personal and universal. I recommend this book to anyone who is in prison or working with those who are in prison."},{"Title":"Houses of Healing: A Prisoner's Guide to Inner Power and Freedom","review":"I am the mother of an inmate who is doing time on Collins Correctional Facility on NY.

The program is evaluated by the participants at the end of every 10 week/30 hour program. I have yet to be aware of one participant who has not found the book or the program to far exceed their expectations in terms of relevance and helpfulness. Further, many/most claim that it is 'THE' most powerful book/program they have ever come in contact with for life-changing understanding and practical tools to effectively deal with difficult issues and to move forward in healing, positive ways. The program is found to be gentle, respectful, inspirational and most of all powerful. Many find that for the first time in their lives they gain awareness and clarity on the impact of abuse, grief, loss, addictions, etc and are able to 'connect the dots' of past and present; change ineffective behavior with tools learned; embrace forgiveness; re-parent their inner child; accountability for crime; make better choices; enter into a more peaceful, empowered life. Participants also find that the program dovetails beautifully and supports other learning. Houses of Healing is a respected program among professionals in chaplaincy, health care, parole and management. Evidence of this was that author Robin Casarjian was invited to be a keynote speaker for The Canadian National Chaplaincy Conference (federal institutions)last spring in Vancouver, BC. I would encourage ANYONE (on both sides of the fence and over all boarders)who wants to be 'set free' to read Houses of Healing."},{"Title":"Houses of Healing: A Prisoner's Guide to Inner Power and Freedom","review":"I found it insightful and championing my own beliefs; i.e., institutions of incarceration need to be environments of therapeutic change and healing rather than warehouses or worse yet, graduate schools of crime.

Robin truly understands what keeps people stuck in the revolving door of offending behavior. She clearly presents how anger, grief, anxiety, low self-esteem, and lack of self-forgiveness and the ability to forgive others keeps people from changing unhealthy behavior, growing emotionally, and finding peace. Ms. Casarjian clearly and compassionately explains ways to move through these issues. She also guides her readers through taking full responsibilty for their actions and shows the personal freedom that can ensue from such work.My students often comment that the Houses of Healing book helps them identify the missing link between there past life and their current situation, that makes all the difference in moving forward.There is always a waiting list for this course at my jail.

Michael Himes reflects in his introduction to this book, it is essentially a synopsis of a series of videotapes compiled as a \\"Mystery of Faith\\" lecture series.The book contains ten concise chapters covering the following topics: Trinity, Grace, Incarnation, Salvation, Church, Baptism, Eucharist, Sacraments of Vocation, Reconciliation and Tradition.Each of the ten chapters concludes with a series of insightful questions for reflection. Whether for use by a group or for personal study and reflection, this book contains many interesting insights. Although the subtitle indicates that the book is an \\"introduction to Catholicism\\", I would recommend the book to anyone interested in a further examination of the faith."},{"Title":"The Mystery Of Faith: An Introduction To Catholicism","review":"Nothing I write will come close to the appropriate praise that this little book deserves. Michael Himes, a professor of theology at Boston College, known for his excellent video series from which this book was derived, does an amazing job at summarizing the essential elements of what it means to be part of the Catholic Christian community.This is as fun a book to read as it is informative. Having looked at many \\"Introductions to Catholicism\\" in order to better recommend particular books to inquirers, I would not hesitate to endorse this book."},{"Title":"The Mystery Of Faith: An Introduction To Catholicism","review":"I have found this small book to provide a wonderful introduction to Catholicism for my RCIA group here at Cornell University. It offers a broad and easily understandable look at Catholicism and leaves our students hungry for more. The questions at the end of each chapter are particularly helpful."},{"Title":"The Mystery Of Faith: An Introduction To Catholicism","review":"Michael Himes provides a very different approach to understanding the basics of Catholicism. A provocative and nontraditional approach yet faithful to the Tradition. The style is conversational which makes it easy to read. The author intertwines Scripture, classic literature and human experiences as he probes the mysteries of the Catholic faith. The reader is plunged into the meaning of the mystery of God, the Incarnation and Salvation,the Church,the Sacraments and Tradition. A stimulating resource for readers who would like to revisit these fundamental topics. And an interesting first look to introduce a reader to the basics of Catholicism."},{"Title":"The Mystery Of Faith: An Introduction To Catholicism","review":"Michael Himes writes just as he speaks, that is to say, in a deeply theological yet easy to read and clear style, avoiding theological jargon. The book is based on his excellent video series of the same title. The ten chapters of 7-9 pages each cover the essential foundations of Catholicism, including concise presentations on Trinity, Grace, Incarnation, Church and the sacraments. The book also includes a topical and scriptural index."},{"Title":"The Mystery Of Faith: An Introduction To Catholicism","review":"I am only halfway through this book and I am so in love with it that I called it up on Amazon to purchase it for a few people I know would love it, too. It's a brief, concise discussion about some basic philosophical tenets which have grown to be included in the religion of Catholicism. As a recent student of Fr. Himes, I would like to address a previous reviewer who is made uncomfortable by language like \\"God emptied Godself.\\" This is the way the man speaks. He uses all of the phrases written in that book. He says, in his lectures at Boston College, \\"I would suggest to you...\\" as if his point might be something you would like to consider. It is a wonderful, inclusive manner of speaking/writing. And, as a side note, if something philosophical/theological makes one feel initially uncomfortable, I would suggest that one give it a little more mulling over in the heart; perhaps there is growth and learning just around the corner...?"},{"Title":"The Mystery Of Faith: An Introduction To Catholicism","review":"Although cleverly written and interesting to read, I would not recommend this book for a person who is not already well grounded in their knowledge of the faith. I found myself growing in disquiet with every chapter I read. While not directly espousing error, it came sufficiently close to be disturbing. I will give some examples to illustrate:1) Chapter 3 on the Incarnation discusses how the Incarnation shows the essential dignity of man and even quotes Pope John Paul II on this point. Yet the way the point is made comes close to idolizing man - going as far as saying: \\"From all eternity God has wanted to be exactly like you and me\\" and that this was God's \\"secret ambition\\". To me, that comes uncomfortably close to saying that God wants to be in our image whereas the bible tells us that we are the ones created in God's image! This is accentuated in Chapter 4 on Salvation when it frames the original sin as the refusal to believe in the goodness of being human. Yes, arguments can be made to explain what the author really means but the risk of misleading the uninitiated is too great in an introductory book!2) Chapter 7 on the Eucharist, goes to great lengths to discuss how the Eucharist brings about the unity of believers who share in the Eucharistic banquet. While this is true, the first and most important aspect of the Eucharist is that it is the re-presentation of Jesus' sacrifice on Calvary. Unfortunately, this essential element is not mentioned. This emphasis on the communion aspect at the expense of the sacrifice aspect drains the Eucharist of its meaning and value.I could have given other examples but these should be enough to make the point. If this is truly your introduction to Catholicism, all I can say is BEWARE. BTW, an irritating trait is the use of 'inclusive language' resulting in ridiculuos sounding expressions like \\"God emptied Godself\\"."},{"Title":"DANTE: INFERNO (Dante's Divine Comedy) (v. 1)","review":"Lindskoog does an excellent job with the translation and analysis of this book. This would be an excellent version of The Inferno for anyone not familiar with Dante's prolific use of analogy and historical reference. I recommend this version with my full confidence that any reader will find it enjoyable and informative."},{"Title":"DANTE: INFERNO (Dante's Divine Comedy) (v. 1)","review":"I'm sure I must have given up on my original copy of DIVINE COMEDY after &quot;Inferno.&quot; But the lucid editing of this edition, with abundant footnotes, make clear and easy that which I could never decipher. With Virgil, Beatrice &amp; Kathryn leading the way, the trip through Inferno, Purgatory &amp; Paradise was a thrilling excursion."},{"Title":"DANTE: INFERNO (Dante's Divine Comedy) (v. 1)","review":"Lindskoog's Dante lacks the majesty of other translations - especially verse translations - but its easy-to-follow prose-style and explanatory footnotes are boons for younger readers, and this isn't meant pejoratively. (NB: The footnotes do rely rather heavily on the work of Dorothy Sayers.) A good place to start. Not for the seasoned Dante-lover."},{"Title":"Women From Another Planet?: Our Lives in the Universe of Autism","review":"The first part of this book was extremely difficult to follow at times, because of the nature of formatting of the discussions. Having said that, what was interesting in that section was the way in which the discussion developed and the many varied ways the women expressed themselves. As a woman diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome, I read this yearning to hear how other women on the spectrum thought. It is brilliant for that.The second part of the book is where people have written aspects of their stories and poems. This is for reflection. It is quite amazing and many parts of it, showed me glimpses of how I thought. I was not alone! I was 'normal' like these women.This book was a godsend! Thank you."},{"Title":"Women From Another Planet?: Our Lives in the Universe of Autism","review":"To say I truly love this book would be a vast understatement. Instead of presenting one theory or the \\"Procrustean Bed\\" approach of painfully forcing people to support a certain finding, this book provides a myriad of insights into autism among women.I am good and tired of the Rain Man stereotype that protrays people with autism has having savant abilities and no viable social skills; I am equally tired of the \\"rocking and staring\\" stereotype of autism as well. Sadly, stereotypes are so often applied to any population and this book unfortunately has passages wherein other groups are painted with the Stereotyping Brush. That is the only drawback.Since this book contains a myriad of descriptions, it provides the much needed service of explaining that autism and its related neurobiological condition Asperger's is as unique as there are individuals who are on the spectrum. As the NT (neurotypical) population recognizes and claims individuality, the same applies among the a/A population.How wonderful to find a book by people with autism about people with autism. This is the only work I am currently aware of that is concentrated on women who have autism. The fact that the authors come from all walks of life is representative of the multi-cultural/multi-ethnic world we all, as people live in is a very powerful statement. Autism does not discriminate.I also like the way the authors describe their individual needs in coping with a largely NT world; the voice for accessibility can be seen, heard and felt throughout this work. The authors are not reluctant to challenge stereotypes and make individual claims describing how they are personally affected by having autism.What makes this book so unique is that it is connects feminism and autism. NT issues are also addressed in this work as well. At no time did I feel these roads diverged; rather I felt the NT and a/A road converged frequently throughout this book.A wide range of issues are discussed such as the spiritual aspects of people's lives; their core values and beliefs; their work experiences; things they do on a routine basis. Indeed, it is just this wide range that speaks even more to the diversity of the Autism Experience and encourage people to celebrate that part of their lives. Readers will come away wanting to wave the Autism Banner with Pride!This book is a masterpiece. Like the Autism Ribbon made up of multi-colored, interlocking pieces, this book puts together a beautiful mosiac of the Autism Experience among a diverse group of women. The image as a whole, prose and poetry combined with each individual voice makes for a very unique work of art.This book is for everybody. NT readers will come away with a greater understanding and appreciation for autism; readers on the a/A spectrum will feel this book speaks to some aspects of their lives. It contains a fresh set of perspectives about human lives and how autism is a part of those lives and not the sole focus. This is a book I'll keep banging on the drum for because I think the messages it imparts need to be heard by all, and not just the seemingly intended audience.A good companion book to this one isAsperger's and GirlsThis is certainly a book that will leave readers deep in thought for a very long time."},{"Title":"Women From Another Planet?: Our Lives in the Universe of Autism","review":"Disclosure - I received my copy of this book as a gift from one of the contributors, who has been a personal friend of mine for years.As a woman on the spectrum, I am used to our views being constantly ignored. The female experience of autism is qualitatively different from that of the male. If we don't talk, we are \\"shy\\". If we don't socialize with others, or need to watch what they are doing before we can attempt to join in, we're \\"not socially adept\\". If we don't join in the backstabbing and constant talk about makeup, sexuality, and clothing starting in junior high and high school, we're downright weird.It is both easier and harder to be a woman autistic. People who think we are just shy frequently try to find ways to encourage us to \\"join in\\". And a lot of behavior that people find threatening from males on the spectrum, while not precisely acceptable in us, is less socially inappropriate. If one of us likes someone and doesn't know how to approach them, but constantly hangs around that person, someone might find a way to introduce us, if the person doesn't notice us by him or herself. In a male autistic, this same behavior could lead to stalking charges and restraining orders.The fact that so many different women contributed to this book is a big factor in its success - at least one voice in there is likely to speak to someone.And as for being self-diagnosed and \\"trivializing\\" autism... it is very hard to get diagnosed as an adult. Most of us, even those who have documentation of our severel language delay, are either \\"too successful\\" to be diagnosed (i.e., we have a relationship, employment, or advanced degrees and doctors dismiss our concerns about ourself), or are just diagnosed \\"Asperger's\\".Personally, I spent much of my childhood echolalic and couldn't speak in sentences until I was almost 8. I still flap, rock, and enjoy watching spinning objects, and am extremely auditorily hyper-sensitive. I can still heard dog whistles. Bright colors disturb me, and I still can't drink out of cups that are colors other than clear, white, or blue without throwing up.My childhood \\"diagnosis\\" was elective mutism (now called selective mutism) with autistic features, because I could read and answer yes/no or multiple choice questions. At the time, to be called autistic, you had to be mentally retarded. Learning disabilities (such as my inability to do even the simplest mathematical calculations) do not count. As an adult, I am labelled Asperger's, even though I STILL meet the DSM-IV-TR criteria for autism, since I have Semantic-Pragmatic Language Disorder, and the speech of people with Asperger's is supposed to be intact.I work with children on the spectrum. I love most of them very much, and hope that they can become at least as high-functioning as I am. But I cannot understand their parents (other than a few who are actually on the spectrum or close to it [ADHD, etc]) to save my life. I have a very succesful history of being able to connect to autistic children, including ones who \\"don't like strangers\\" who were climbing all over me within moments of being introduced, and even occasional words or eye contact from children who otherwise live in their own worlds. People on the spectrum recognize each other, and these children seem to mostly realize that I am like them on some level. At least one of the other women whose writing can be found on this book shares this kind of relationship with these children, and works in the caring professions.Open your mind, and at least read what some of us think. For people who are supposed incapable of thinking about ourselves or others, or of empathization, I find that most of us actually do better at these things than at least some neurotypicals (people who aren't on the spectrum)."},{"Title":"Women From Another Planet?: Our Lives in the Universe of Autism","review":"I loved the multiple-writers approach of this book. Many of the stories were similar to my own experiences as an Autistic woman, some were different. it helps me to understand the variations within our variation. Jane Meyerding's \\"Growing up Genderless\\" essay summed up for me a lot of the insidious problems faced by autistic women: as females we're supposed to be the socially adept gender: smoothing the way and facilitating the school dance, the weddings, children, family, school, church, husbands' career, etc.. When (because of autism) we don't act or look like \\"real girls\\" we are subjected to extreme ridicule and abuse and a feeling of not belonging anywhere.These stories from women outside the box are and important part of Autistic culture; both to serve as solidarity literature for other mature AS women and hopefully give today's AS girls some more accurate pictures of how we really are and how we navigate the world.the essay format is easy to read in chunks and the variety of voices make it a broader overview than any single-author book. I recommend this to Autistic women of all ages, especially if you've just learned that your \\"weirdness\\" is really called \\"autism\\". You're not alone, let these sisters share their stories."},{"Title":"Women From Another Planet?: Our Lives in the Universe of Autism","review":"Women From Another Planet knocked my socks off, enlightened me and gave me insight into the lives of autistic people. It also points out how we neurologically typical people often treat autistic people as if they are worth less than we are, sometimes with absolute cruelty. It was quite ironic to read about the \\"normal\\" persons insensitivity, lack of imagination, and selfish selfcenteredness (all supposedly autistic traits) around many of these women. I found the whole book marvellous and fascinating. Since there are 19 contributors, the variety of experiences and traits is huge. A good read!"},{"Title":"Women From Another Planet?: Our Lives in the Universe of Autism","review":"This fascinating collection of writings by autistic women is perhaps the best value read for women wanting to find out what they have in common with others on the spectrum, but could still be interesting for anyone wanting to get an insight. Sharing experiences, feelings, conversations, and poetry in a frank and thought provoking way, this book has a charming and refreshing honesty that perhaps autistic people are best capable of and most likely to appreciate. I really enjoyed this book and found it to be a very worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Women From Another Planet?: Our Lives in the Universe of Autism","review":"This book is written by autistic women with all different backgrounds and experiences, so it helps even people that have no contact with autism to learn about how an autistic person lives and the sort of experiences that that person has, but in more depth than simply a description of characteristics that is typically found when researching a developmental disorder such as autism online or in the library. The best part of this book is that all of the stories and poems are real; they are real experiences and real thoughts and feelings told by real women. It is an invaluable resource both for people simply willing to learn about autism and for people living with autism, perhaps undiagnosed, and especially for friends or family members of autistic persons.Personally, I am very close to two people with Asperger's Syndrome and at first, it was very hard for me to relate to either of them. I think at first, people often misjudge others' actions as being rude or cold just because the way they act is different from what &quot;society&quot; is used to. However, that is not fair. There is no &quot;normal&quot;. We are all different and that's what makes us interesting. If I had judged the two people I know that have Asperger's, I would have missed knowing two extremely intelligent, interesting, and inspiring individuals who mean more to me than I could have ever imagined. We all adapt to our environments in whatever way is comfortable to us. As I have learned more about Asperger's Syndrome and autism, I notice that I can relate quite a lot to the actions and feelings typical of these disorders.I think this book helps people understand what it is like living with a developmental disorder and also makes both diagnosed and undiagnosed people say, &quot;Hey, there are others out there kind of like me!&quot; The stories and poems are honest and interesting and provide an excellent resource for anyone.P.S. My favorite story in the book is called &quot;'Cause It's Friday&quot; (219) because it's so honest, funny, and well-written... and shows how sometimes, people have to make the most out of life at even the worst of times. The author, Kimberly Tucker, is one of the best non-fiction writers I've ever seen, so if anyone ever gets the chance, read more of her work!

I know what it meant to me when I was younger and I don't want any of that junk to happen to her.Jean Miller and her contributors know and (thank goodness) they share what they know.You cannot imagine how relieved finding this book made me."},{"Title":"Women From Another Planet?: Our Lives in the Universe of Autism","review":"I am very excited about this book! Years ago there were not enough books on ASD and now there are too many to choose from. This book is now on my must-have list, for female or male readers.The many voices represented make it clear that ASD is not a one-size-fits-all description; each contributor is a strong individual, an interesting person, and a poet at heart. The personal stories are fascinating; the poetry is beautiful and pertinent. This is book of revelations and the reader will have many &quot;I never thought of it quite that way&quot; moments no matter how much they think they know about ASD.There are also many excellent references, which I happen to think is very important."},{"Title":"Women From Another Planet?: Our Lives in the Universe of Autism","review":"So often we stereotype autistics as being very limited in their ability to do basic functions of daily life. While this is true of some autistics, this book reveals that autism is not a single,universal condition, but a spectrum with a wide range of abilities as well as disabilities (the book's editor, who is autistic, is a college instructor). This book opens both the mind and the heart, enlightening readers about the variety of people who fall under the umbrella \\"autistic\\"."},{"Title":"Women From Another Planet?: Our Lives in the Universe of Autism","review":"This book is all written by women with Asperger syndrome, divided into sections. If you start it and find the first section of discussion random and therefore not very gripping go and read the autobiographical pieces either topically from front to back or by author as I did. Then continue with the first chapter which you will find meaningful. Your eyes and heart will open up! Not that we can fully understand what another person experiences, but this remarkable book undoubtedly goes as far as any, particularly because there are many different writers.I have a friend who is self-diagnosed with Asperger syndrome. She and I do not meet one on one very often, nor communicate very often. When we do I have a good time. Still puzzled as to why she doesn't communicate often and some other slightly puzzling behaviors, I decided to try to find out.EVERY TEACHER should read this book as girls with Asperger's often are not readily identifiable without insight into how they feel and act. I think a person with Asperger's would also relate strongly to this book and feel comforted and less isolated. Parents should read this if their daughter is noticeably quirky.This book is extremely helpful. It would also probably be helpful in understanding men with Asperger's, too. But women have different social expectations and roles, such as being a mother, so this book is of inestimable worth for a \\"neurotypical\\" (NT) person whether parent, classmate, doctor, or sibling, etc. to empathize with someone with Asperger.It is not clinical. Clinical books have their uses no doubt, but you cannot experience many feelings with clinical descriptions and treatment protocols.

His tragic life, disillusions, convulsions, mental illness and steeled conviction.Within the short span of ten years (1880-1890), van Gogh created an unknown -by then- pictorial universe, paving the way to fauvism and countless painters visibly influenced by his inimitable style, where the intensity of color was the pivot to carve in relief an expressive rank of unseen landscapes.The deep imapct of his craft was extremely close to the advent of the well known German Expressionism movement at the treshold of the century.Beaujean not only limited himself to write an intense biography, besides he gave an abundant information about diverse painters who accompanied him through his troubled existence. It includes also an invaluable information about until this date has been the most complete van Gogh's retrospective in Bernhelm Jeune, 1901.You will be able to watch a brilliant compilation of his most famous works as well as neccesary biographical aspect that conform a full-rounded book.Indispensable in your library."},{"Title":"Vincent Van Gogh (Art Treasures of the World)","review":"Vincent van Gogh is one of the truly influential painters of his day and painted art revealing complex spirituality and intense emotion that continue to impress art students, connoisseurs, and artists today. He was able to imbue his work with his own psychological presence as is especially evidenced in his many self-portraits. In Van Gogh, art historian and Post-Impressionist expert Belinda Thompson has assembled his paintings and works drawn from the archives and collections of the Art Institute Of Chicago including such famous works as an 1887 Self-Portrait, The Bedroom, and Madame Roulin Rocking the Cradle. Thirty of the images are reproduced in full color, together with another twenty-two duotone comparative illustrations. Van Gogh is further enhanced for the reader with an informative account tracing the great artist's development as a painter in Holland, England, and France in a career that was to last less than a decade. Van Gogh is a very highly recommended addition to any personal, academic, or community library Post-Impressionist art history reference collection in general, and to Vincent van Gogh enthusiasts in particular."},{"Title":"Letters on England","review":"I'm starting to think that there is a certain clique of authors, to wit, Machiavelli, Nietzsche, Swift, and Voltaire, who have developed a popular perception that tragically limits or constrains their legacy in the world of to-day. For Voltaire's part, when he is spoken of, it is generally in regard to &quot;Candide,&quot; certainly a great work, but not the be-all or end-all of his particular genius. &quot;Letters on England,&quot; a series of musings on his exile in England from 1726-1729, is a work which gives a much different perspective on Voltaire from the cynical, suspected atheist we've all come to know and love.The primary focal points of the &quot;Letters&quot; are comparsions of England and France in the realms of religion, politics, and the arts and sciences. While Voltaire clearly criticizes the French institutions of his day, he does not intend us to look at England as the ideal society. In religious matters, Voltaire derides the monolith of French Catholicism, acknowledging the relative harmlessness of English sectarianism - saying &quot;if there were only one relgion in England, there would be danger of despotism...but there are thirty, and they live in peace and happiness&quot;. Politically, Voltaire admires the progress England has made since the Magna Carta, even though it means limited enfranchisement, and division of legislative power. In the arts and sciences, Voltaire examines the ingenuity of philosophers like Bacon, Newton, and Locke, and the ability of authors like Shakespeare, Pope, Swift, Wycherley, and others, to make their reputations and livings largely independent of a feudal patronage system.Throughout the &quot;Letters,&quot; Voltaire privileges common sense, forward thinking, and right reasoning. As I understand it, the main purpose of satire is as a social corrective. Voltaire points out the flaws in both the French and English nations, not to be simply critical, but to encourage progress in thought, in science, and the institutions that govern civilized countries. Voltaire was no revolutionary, mind you, but it is obvious throughout the text that he cares deeply about France and its international relations. Voltaire looks so far ahead in his writing to anticipate our own current debates over health care (the availability of infant innoculation, and euthanasia), equal opportunity regardless of faith or race, and so on.For such a brief work, Voltaire covers a lot of intellectual ground in &quot;Letters on England&quot;. His style, enthusiasm, sense of wonder, and incisive commentary makes this a non-fiction counterpart to Montesquieu's fictional &quot;Persian Letters&quot;. While Voltaire himself dislikes and distrusts translations, I've always thought that if you can read a translation, react strongly to the material, and get the basic points, then the translation must be counted as successful. Leonard Tancock's translation in this Penguin Classic edition must be counted by me, at least, as successful. My admiration of Voltaire has been enhanced, and I feel just a little bit more enlightened. &quot;Letters on England&quot; is an excellent work in any language."},{"Title":"Letters on England","review":"Letters on England is enlightening on several levels and a very interesting description of the society politics and science of England in the mid 18th century from a French point of view. Voltaire being profoundly interested in all aspects of life and all types of knowledge provides an astounding account of sundry aspects of England from his patently Voltaire style. He makes the book interesting by including his take on some of the peculiarities of English life. Many of the letters are rather short and they need not be read in any particular sequence. The style is strait forward and they are relatively objective for Voltaire's work. I think these letters are indicative of Voltaire's style and provide a unique glimpse of many often overlooked aspects of English culture in the 18th century.He is particularly interested in the Quakers and devotes several of his letters entirely to their customs and beliefs. Yes these letters are certainly interesting. For anyone studying religious toleration (or intolerance) in England these letters may be of certain value.My favorite and possibly the most endearing letters is the one devoted to Francis Bacon. He alludes to the fact that Bacon was involved in an embezzlement scandal for which he was removed from office. Of course this is certainly true but he, as many others have, forgives him for this since he has provided so much for mankind. I feel that Voltaire saw much of the same in Bacon that he saw in himself. We must remember that Voltaire too was a fantastic speculator (investor) and many accused him of possibly crossing into the realm of less than legal activities.Voltaire's Letters on England are wonderful to read and after breezing through this book you will probably wish, as I have, that there were more to read. That being said I will note that I believe that had anyone else written these letters (except for maybe Montaigne) they would be in some academic library but not published widely. We can thank Voltaire for achieving the fame he did because having such immediate access to these letters is great for students historians and curious readers alike.-- Ted Murena"},{"Title":"Letters on England","review":"This is one of the most entertaining books I've read in a long time. Voltaire's (mostly complimentary) commentary on the English spans religion, government, philosophy, and science. It's always interesting to read a great thinker's take on other great thinkers. Most of Voltaire's subjects will be familiar to modern readers (e.g. Quakers, John Locke, Francis Bacon, Isaac Newton, Jonathan Swift, Alexander Pope, Shakespeare...) which makes the book easily readable by a contemporary audience.The humor is sharp and the observations are keen throughout.

This book is part of his trilogy over the parables and as such one expects to find many of the same ideas articulated in this book that are in the other two. This expectation is fulfilled and amplified in this work. In reading the other two books, I remember thinking to myself, &quot;Well, you have a point, but what about the parable about so and so?&quot; In this work, those so and so parables that were my wall of defense to Capon's arguments became transformed into his coup de grace. This work is not one to be read -- it is to be ingested and thoughtfully considered. One cannot assume that reading a work like this leaves one unchanged. I can honestly say that Capon's work with the parables of judgment has helped me see that there is not a Marcionic dichotomy between YHWH and the Abba of Christ Jesus."},{"Title":"Parables of Judgment","review":"Having heard of \\"Capon\\" for quite some time among the pastoral circles I frequent I finally determined I had to order some of his books. This is the first one that arrived, so I read it first. I am converted. Some tell me he is a universalist, and that is the only caution they give to reading this man's work. Having read this book I don't see him as a universalist, and if he is maybe I am too. He sees that hell is a reality, and will be a reality for many, just not for the reasons that many think. He draws the line at faith those who refuse to believe are the ones left out of the party.It is a great book. The exegesis is superb, the writing brilliant. Robert Farrar Capon communicates grace in the midst of judgment. I can't wait to read the other two books in this series, and the many others available by this author. His way with words is astounding.

There are also 3 Magnus Ridolph tales. Contents include:\\"The World Between\\" (1953): Blue-Star explorers have claimed a potentially habitable planet, and seek to terraform it, while a rival space empire, the Kays, engages in ecological sabotage.

(28 pages).\\"The Moon Moth\\" (1961): The misadventures of Edwer Thissel, Earth consul, and his bumbling efforts to adjust to the strange society of the planet Sirene, where the inhabitants all wear distinctive masks, and communicate by playing musical instruments. Unique, atmospheric and highly memorable. (36 pages).\\"The Brain of the Galaxy\\" (1951): A contest to determine the succession of a galactic ruler. I liked some of the little contest episodes, but I was not wild about the central premise, and found the whole to be less than the sum of its parts. Author's title: \\"The New Prime\\".

Born into a poor family, her mother deceives her father and the village by calling Grey a boy. Grey spends her youth believing she is a boy, deformed and must keep her identity a secret. The time is during the 12th century when England is beginning to take over parts of Ireland. Poverty is rampant and the English are gobbling up villages and property and claiming them as their own.When Grey discovers her true identity, she embarks on a strange journey trying to reconcile the years she spent as a male to the truth of her sex. She goes from being used, to being loved, to becoming a mother, and then continues to change throughout the book.There were some sections of the book that where I thought \\"typical - woman is the victim\\". However, when I put the book down and began to think about it, Grey was a victim according to today's way of thinking. The author does an amazing job at presenting Grey as anything BUT a victim. She is more than just a woman, mother, wife, Irish, peasant, lover. Grey's character shows that there is more to a person then their sex. Someone isn't defined by their \\"station\\" in life - wife, mother, woman. Rather who they make themselves.Great read. Fast paced and well written."},{"Title":"The Changeling: A Novel","review":"Kate Horsley has never failed to astound me with the books of hers I have read. \\"The Changeling\\", I feel, is an excellent follow up to her acclaimed novel, \\"Confessions of a Pagan Nun\\".The setting is the 1300's in Ireland. Grey is a peasant girl who has been raised as a boy. When she realises her womanhood, it takes her on a journey of discovering an identity. As Ms. Horsley breaks it up for us, \\"Son\\", \\"Whore\\", \\"Warrior\\", and \\"Mother\\". Each of her identities and phases teaches her different lessons in life until the end when she realizes that nothing can exactly define her. The themes of the novel are the search for identity and in a stange way glory.Through Grey's eyes, we see all the problems of the age. Including the residing of the Pope at Avignon, the corruption of the Catholic Church, and the smiting Black Death.The characteristics Horsley gives to Grey lets us experience what is it to be a woman. I believe this is an important message for not only women all over the world, but men as well. Horsley, through Grey's various identities, gives us the complex psychology of a woman.This is a beautiful story and just as incredible as \\"Confessions of a Pagan Nun\\". Once again, it is about discovering who you are.

I was interested in the novel's premise. I've read a few stories about women masquerading as men, but Grey is raised to believe she's a boy. And I do enjoy the idea that this gives her resourcefulness and strength throughout her life, instead of being the occasion of a mental dislocation so severe that it drives her insane (I want to mention a title here but never want to ruin that book by Ian Banks for another reader). But I felt the plot missed the mark.Better fed, better rested and better loved than her useless sisters, Grey has advantages that lead...nowhere. As soon as her femininity is discovered, it is exploited, and it runs and ruins her life. From boy to whore to mother, this is a predictable path and this is my disappointment. She wanted to be a warrior! I don't know. It seemed like a great opportunity squandered.Also, though I had to constantly remind me that the pleasures of sex were free and therefore quite important to the peasant class of the 1300s, I got a little tired of the conversations, descriptions and activities always circling back round to the crudest of terms. It seemed like such a shortcut. I wanted to read more about the vagaries and duplicities and possibilities of gender, and less about parts."},{"Title":"The Changeling: A Novel","review":"Very interesting book about an unwanted daughter from a poor family who is made to pretend she is a boy.

Perks supposedly include bed, breakfast, and THE SERVICES OF A FEMALE.Anthropologists (and many Arabists) swear the custom was not a myth -- up until about the 1960s, when television helped to unify the country's mores, bringing them more in line with those of Riyadh.Naturally such a free-love custom is directly contrary to Wahhabi Islam, of course.Anyhow, Walker, the narrator, has been hearing about this custom for years. His students from the Asir (privately) swear to him it's not a myth, and students from other areas of the Kingdom angrily deny that such a custom ever (or could currently) exist.Well, on his last tour in KSA, Walker resolves to make an odyssey from Jedda down to the Asir, ostensibly to visit a former student but really to see if he can work himself into a situation where he is a recipient of this fabled \\"sexual hospitality.\\"In other words, he spends the book basically trying to get a free ride on a Saudi chick.Well, I won't tell you how it ends, but that plot line is what Walker uses to hang his observations about the Kingdom, about Arabs, Muslims, Saudis, and the rapid modernization of their world -- and what it is like for a Westerner to live and travel there.Most of the books about Saudi Arabia are either about how the Kingdom supports terror, about the coming revolution, about the oil wealth, etc.Not this one.It's witty, amusing, and incredibly well-written. What Walker was doing spending his time as an ESL teacher is beyond me.It's neither overly-sympathetic to the Saudis, nor uselessly over-critical.In fine, a balanced, insightful, and deftly-written book."},{"Title":"Let the good times roll: Mobile, Mother of Mystics","review":"Suddenly, what seemed a secretive, even a sinister, alien civilization became comprehensible and human.\\" (p 174)What a wonderful maxim Mr. Walker used, which aptly describes his entire book. As the only other reviewer, \\"Freston,\\" of this gem of a book said: Most of the books about Saudi Arabia are either about how the Kingdom supports terror, about the coming revolution, about the oil wealth, etc.\\"... in other words, so many books that theorize, and depict the \\"other\\" in negative terms, often by individuals who have never been to the Kingdom. Much that is written is also shear fantasy, masquerading as insight. But this book has the authentic ring from one who places his own culture's faults on an equal footing with those of others.There is a tongue-in-cheek quest that ties together Mr. Walker's tale, his journey across the Kingdom from West to East in the early \`80's: a search for the custom of Arabia which predates Islam, from what is considered the Jahaliya, \\"the time of darkness,\\" when a widow was given to a male guest for three nights. Was there still a place so remote, so high and wild in the Asir, where this might still be possible? In this pursuit, as the guest of one of his ESL student's, to attend his wedding, he did things that probably only 10 other Western expats had ever done - such as ride in a crowded Toyota land cruiser, with the Sudanese and Egyptians, on a long journey from Jeddah high into the Asir.With the exotic backdrop of his tour, and the cast of characters that he meets along the way, including old Saudi acquaintances, Walker makes numerous original philosophical observations on the respective cultures. He savagely and very wittedly skewers the foibles of Saudi society, which certainly would ban the book for sale in the Kingdom. But his strength is that he invariably compares their faults with the West's own, and sums up his agnostic position: \\"Don't get me wrong. I do not consider Islam any more a threat to mankind than Christianity or Judaism; in my view, no religion has the edge, in either absurdity or potential for mischief, over any other.\\" (p 190) Another comparison is the relative merits of \\"repression,\\" as espoused by Freud, and the sickness it brings on in society: \\"In Arabia the Repressed an unbalanced person is a sight so rare as to be shocking, whereas in permissive New York you are afraid to meet the eyes of half the people on the street for fear of encountering unrepressed madness.\\" ( p 196)In drawing his honest portrait, he aptly indicates the central reason why much of the West has a negative image of the country: \\"... just as it takes no Goebbels to appreciate the value of a propaganda so effective the before I ever laid eyes on an Arab, I despised them. It helps, when you take someone's land, to picture the owner as undeserving of it anyway.\\" (p 135) (the American Indian would fully appreciate this sentiment)As a weakness, I think of the authors of yore who visited Arabia, Walker placed too heavy a reliance on Charles M. Doughty, a crotchety traveler from whom Walker extracted the book's title. Walker repeatedly quotes him, yielding limited insights, burnished slightly only due to their age.Towards the end of the book, his \\"quest\\" still unfulfilled, he is rather provocatively challenged by a woman who says: \\"You weren't looking in the right place.\\" Likewise, if the slew of Saudi-bashing books has left you unfulfilled in your search for the real Kingdom, perhaps this is the right place to start.

But, not to worry, Mr Tusky, the very able substitute, is here. And with the help of the children, Adam the alligator, Brenda the beaver, Christopher the cat... and the rest of the alphabetized named class, they don't miss a thing...show and tell, drawing and painting, singing...Unfortunately, with each day, another student falls victim to the flu. That is until Friday, when everybody is back for a full day with Miss Bindergarten. On Saturday and Sunday, everyone gets to stay home, especially a very sick Mr Tusky! Joseph Slate has written a very gentle, rhyming story about the joys of kindergarten, even when the flu hits. Ashley Wolff's, expressive, detailed illustrations, compliment the story perfectly as you watch the class play, learn and even fall sick. Together, they take some of the mystery and fear out of kindergarten life. A wonderful, delightful story all kindergarteners will love and want to read again and again."},{"Title":"Miss Bindergarten Stays Home from Kindergarten (Miss Bindergarten Books)","review":"Poor Miss Bindergarten gets sick and needs to stay home.

I read this book to my four year old, and he loved it. After we were done reading the book he hugged it and smiled really big. The book is intended for an audience of 4 or 5 year olds (maybe even the first graders). There are 38 unnumbered pages in this book. This book is illustrated by Ashley Wolff, and she does a brillant job. I usually don't like to pitch authors and illustrators, but there was a lot thought and care put into these illustrations so I just have to say something about this illustrator. At this age -- illustrations are everything. We spent about 10 minutes reading this book (5 of those minutes were me trying to get to the next page). Then about 45 minutes looking at the pictures and naming the different little animals. My son wanted to look at and ask questions about each page -- very stimulating for his little mind.

Malthus' rejection of the new claims for progressive amelioration and the possibility of social progress, timed with his appearance in the reaction to the French Revolution made him a pivot of conservative propaganda. Drawing almost all the major figures of cultural life from Godwin onward into its orbit the debate seems hard to take seriously now,one winces at some of the absurdities here, but makes positive definite as a test case the process of ideological propaganda. The brief victory of Malthus in the period of the Reform Bill proved in fact his gradual undoing, and yet his influence conditioned even Darwin's theory of evolution and the issues remain thus concealed in in less blatant or better disguised forms even to this day (witness George Bush on Social Secuarity)."},{"Title":"God-Fleshed: A Chronicle of the Comings of Christ","review":"Roy Varghese, in his previous works, has successfully been able to interface science, philosophy and religion; he has combined history, myth, and theology and proved that faith and reality can walk hand in hand.In God Sent, Varghese showed us the Virgin Mary in words and art through the historical and approved apparitions of the Catholic Church. That book is a picture of the Mother of God few have seen before.In God Fleshed, he chronicles the comings of Christ. He draws on the rich content of the scriptures, tradition, and recorded history. He outlines the Jesus of history, the Christ of faith, and portrays, through the mystery of the Eucharist, a man-God who is incarnated and dies in ignominy for humanity. Varghese draws from the New Testament narratives, including present academic discussions, the pre-Christian universe with a focus on various traditions, the wisdom of the great Councils of the early Church, the accredited visions of Jesus to the saints of the Church, and the mystery of Eucharistic miracles where the bread of the altar takes on provable characteristics of flesh and blood.Color illustrations of some of the famous Eucharistic miracles baffle us. Tempted to scoff, our disbelief encounters the scientific and rational discussion Varghese provides and comes out of the fray a poor contender. The incarnation did not take place in a vacuum. Then as now there were a multiplicity of religious beliefs; we face the question of reconciling what our senses tell us with the claim that Jesus Christ is the definitive revelation of God in history. In God Fleshed, Roy Varghese writes a map for us to explore, and invites us to attempt this reconcilliation. If nothing better, he has presented us with a \\"good read\\" and an opportunity to \\"think\\" about the known and the unknown."},{"Title":"Starting and Managing a Nonprofit Organization: A Legal Guide (Wiley Nonprofit Law, Finance and Management Series)","review":"I will begin with two disclaimers: I do not work for nor have any affiliation with the publisher, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc (I am not a \\"corporate shill\\").

Yet this book, which is stamped with a 2005 copyright, contains information for the outdated, pre-2004 version of the 1023.For example, the advice is given that one can attach a form SS-4 (request for EIN) with the form 1023, and in the form 1023 state \\"SS-4 attached\\" when it asks for an SS-4. Wrong. The IRS now requires an EIN be registered prior to submitting a 1023.Likewise, the hints about \\"Part this\\" and \\"Question that\\" are completely out of sync with the actual application.Grudgingly, I give the author credit for the other parts of the book. But 1023 is so important, that it would be terrible to let anyone rely on the information in this book.A good source of detailed, up-to-date information on the 1023 is \\"IRS Form 1023 Tax Preparation Guide\\" by Jody Blazek.

The main character, K, is a young lady with a tortured past who is an agent for the governemnt -- sort of a mix between guard, police, detective, spy & low level diplomat. K and two fellow agents are sent to investigate a series of magical, ritualistic murders. Their investigation will bring up unpleasant memories from K's past; and surprising revelations about K's mystical/magical tatoos.Overall, this is a fun book, with plenty of action and surprises. Friendships are warmly presented and well rounded, which is a joy to read. The interplay between races enjoyable and, refreshingly, slightly different from the usual fare. K is skilled/powerful, but not out of context -- her coworkers and enemies are powerful, too. The \\"tortured past\\" bit is overplayed, and not revealed to the reader (or K's supervisor!) until long past the point where it ought to have been. This is obnoxious, like a small child singing \\"I've got a secret\\" every few chapters, but overall an ignorable complaint. This is a very long novel (see the page cound) because the author is quite verbose, dragging out sections that would have been better if a third the length -- I found myself skimming occasionally, and felt no need to go back to read the details. As another reviewer mentioned, don't expect much personal growth. The plot concerns some dark elements (e.g., murder) that sensitive readers may find inappropriate. The overall plotline is well developped and closes nicely.Overall, enthralling and enjoyable. I look forward to seeing if Sagara has another stand-alone book in her (bravo!); or does she fade like too many authors into a series of copy-cat sequels."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"I recently read this again. It's just as good a second time. Kaylin Neya is a complicated, interesting character in a well developed plot. The City is believable with its different races working together, most of the time. There is magic, but Kaylin doesn't really understand hers, nor anyone else's. Michelle West doesn't try to explain it all at once, which would bog the story down to a crawl. (Hear that, Stephen Lawhead?) the story draws you into her world and drives along at a fast clip.

The death of the children was a little hard to take sometimes. I never really got to like Kaylin. She just didn't seem real for some reason. If the author works a little more on Kaylin, makes her more likable, i mean she does care about the children and does heal them but something is missing."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"First in the Chronicles of Elantra fantasy series. It's thirteen years since events in \\"Cast in Moonlight\\" a short story in Mercedes Lackey'sHarvest Moon, (Chronicles of Elantra, #0.5), and Kaylin has been a Hawk for a few years in the city of Elantra.My TakeThis really is good. I'd love it even more if Sagara would be a bit more clear as to who is doing what to whom for what purpose. It is at least a tiny bit more clear than the prequel, \\"Cast in Moonlight\\", and does leave us with more of a sense of ending this particular adventure. Although, Sagara is wicked with leaving hints for the future. It's creepy, fascinating, intriguing, and I can't wait to get my hands onCast in Courtlight (Chronicles of Elantra, #2)to find out what happens next!There is so much that occurs within this story...I'm feeling breathless just thinking about it! Sagara provides us with a backstory on Kaylin as well as Severn, and she doesn't hesitate to create yet more drama and tension for future installments. Nicely done.Arghh, Sagara is making me crazy, teasing with the bits and pieces she's dribbling out about the markings on Kaylin! She gives a little and teases more. It's going to be a long, slow road to finally learn everything I need to know!I like Kaylin. She does her best to do right by everyone. She's willing, for the most part, to be polite, but she definitely forges her own path in some very trying circumstances.The StoryIt's a flashback to the horror of her childhood. Children being marked. Killed horrifically. Worse, Severn is back. He's a traitor. A murderer and the Hawklord is forcing her to partner up with him to investigate this fresh spate of murders that bring it all back.The CharactersPrivate Kaylin Neya, the former Elianne, was adopted by the Hawks some thirteen years ago, when she was thirteen. Her abilities are still kept secret to keep her safe. That side job of hers could see her dead.The Hawks include:Iron Jaw, more formally known as Sergeant Marcus Kassan, a Leontine Hawk. Tanner and Clint are Aerians (Kaylin loves touching Clint's forbidden wings); Sesti is Clint's wife and they've just had a baby. Tain and Teela are Barrani. Red---never call him Reginald---is their medical examiner. Moran, an Aerian, is one of the Hawks' medics.Corporal Severn Handred has transferred to the Hawks from the Shadow Wolves, and it's only the Hawklord's disapproval that keeps Kaylin from killing him. Steffi and Jade were part of their family.Lord Tiamaris will be their third partner in this investigation in the fiefs. A dragonshifter with high-level magic and access. A powerful being with whom Sergeant Kassan has issues. Lords Diarmat, Emmerian, and Sanabalis are all Dragons. Maukron the Black is the only outcaste Dragon. Ybelline is Tha'alani, but one that Kaylin could be comfortable with. But she is the emperor's.Marrin is Leontine and she runs the human orphanage in Elantra. Catti is one of her young charges and desperately ill. Dock is another. Amos is the foundling home's guard.Callantine is one of the powerful pompous, and arrogant Imperial mages who shows up for the autopsy. Burlan Oaks runs a tavern that Severn frequents. Lord Evarrim, an Arcanist, is a Barrani lord who takes an undue and threatening interest in Kaylin.Lord Nightshade is an outcaste Barrani fieflord who has lent his name to his fief. Where Severn and Kaylani once lived. Brecht is a drunk and a pub owner, used to catch the Hawks' attention.There are three peacekeeping forces and three Lords of Law: the Lord of Hawks, Lord Grammayre , the Hawklord, heads up the Hawks which are the city's eyes and ears; the Lord of Swords and his men are the peacekeepers; and, the Lord of Wolves and his people are its hunters and killers. Think of the Aerians as birdmen, not shifters. Barrani are the upper class in this society. Vicious, cruel and seem to have the appearance of what I would consider Fey. The Leontine are lion shifters. Tha'alani, a.k.a., Truthseekers, are mind readers. Their touch is NOT delicate. Arcanists are mages who work independently of the Dragon Emperor.Fieflords are independent rulers of large neighborhoods outside the city proper. Theft and murder is a way of life in the fiefs.The CoverIt's a cold turquoise cover with a bricked floor under roomy arches forming a tunnel into the light, an entire city built atop it. It's a serious Kaylin all dressed in black with her tattooed arms (kind of looks like brown and turquoise plaid sleeves).I suspect the title refers to Kaylin's past, Cast in Shadow, with her interpretation of events."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"Interesting characters with good background stories.

I find that the side characters are what really make this book. There are a lot of side characters and it is sometimes difficult to keep everyone straight, but most of them are interesting. I find that in many books, a number of the side characters seem to be there for the sole purpose of making it possible for the main character to say or do something. Not so with this book! The side characters are unique and glimpses of their personalities leave me wanting to know more about many of them.The setting, various races and castes are all interesting and unique.At times things are not spelled out as clearly as I would like them to be, but I find that it makes me even more interested in the world of Elantra. There are many unanswered questions and they serve to highlight the complexity of the world, rather than just being an annoyance. I hope that some of them at least will be answered in the other books."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"I have read every book in this series at the library and have enjoyed every one.

Did this one somehow escape the editor's desk? There were so many fragmented, choppy sentences that I'd have to re-read entire pages to understand what was going on. The author was overly descriptive in the thoughts and perceptions of the characters, but left out the necessary facts to pull the scenes together. I had to make assumptions all the way through the book so it would make enough sense to continue on. It was beyond \\"leaving it up to your imagination\\".In the end, I am at a loss for words about how I truly felt while reading the book. I guess just didn't like the writing style and the story itself wasn't anything spectacular. Was it supposed to be a suspense? If so, I was never on the edge of my seat. Romance? No. Crime drama meets fantasy world? Perhaps...???Read Karen Marie Moning's Fever Series instead. Many similar aspects but from a much better storyteller."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"Chalk one up for the strong young woman hero in Michelle Sagara's Kaylin Neya. Kaylin Neya is a fighting young woman from the wrong side of the tracks (not that there are trains in \\"Cast In Shadow\\"). She has made a place for herself in law enforcement, but holds some big secrets about her past. As the book begins, Kaylin learns she can't leave her past behind, and that the horrific ritual child murders of seven years ago, that she is somehow linked to, have begun again.Michelle Sagara depicts a rich and fascinating fantasy world in Cast In Shadow. Humans and humanoids coexist. Kaylin speaks the languages of the bird people, the lion people, and the beautiful immortal Barrani. She meets her first dragon people in this story. Sagara shapes each race cleverly, and the individuals from each race are a realistic mixture of racial traits and unique personality.What I liked about Cast In Shadow is the way Sagara rings changes on a familiar pattern. Kaylin's secrets don't win her a princess crown. Nor does tapping into what she can do bring her joy. It just brings new challenges to add to the ones of assimilating into a new culture and becoming and adult.Fantasy readers, both young adults and the other kind, will enjoy meeting Kaylin in this first installment in a new series. I'm on the hunt for the second book,Cast in Courtlight (The Chronicles of Elantra, Book 2), right now."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"I'm really torn here. I wanted to love this book, and there is so much about it that is interesting, but I feel so underwhelmed after finishing it. I loved the different races and types of creatures and their mannerisms, but I felt that they were not really explained very well. From the opening pages certain people are labeled as a specific race, yet we don't know much about the races. Sure the Leonites resemble lions, but that's all I got. I felt from very early on that I was missing something. I didn't skip a sentence or detail yet I felt completely lost the entire time. Just like the main character. Everyone knows what is going on except for her. It makes her come off as childish, immature, and stupid, but she is not. She can't be because I understand just as little as she does. Other characters continuously call her little, child, clumsy, and assume she isn't capable of understanding anything. I must be incapable of understanding as well because I finished the novel and I'm still lost. It seems the book is about solving the mystery of the children dying with marked skin. There isn't much detective work going on, and everyone seems to already know who is behind it. It's like they are putting the main character through the motions just so they can laugh at her when she comes out more confused at the end. As a mystery I don't think this novel works. As a straight fantasy book and an entrance into an interesting world it succeeds. I wanted to know more about everything. What do the mysterious markings say, what is up with the creepy nightshade guy, what isn't everyone telling us? Sometimes I am happy when an author leaves some details behind and leaves some questions unanswered, but in this novel I was more confused than anything else. The world presented is very interesting and there is definitely room for improvement. I get a feel for society as a whole, but I want more information. I see the word caste come up often but I don't really see the system in place. If I could sum this book up in one word I would call it confusing. I will continue the series in hopes that things will make more sense the more I read. A decent novel overall, but could have been much better if presented more clearly. I also hope the main character grows and people trust her with more details in the future."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"This was a very interesting book with detailed characters and a creative new world to explore. The biggest issue that I faced with this novel was that it was very confusing. Some of the explanations for things are unfathomable; I would find myself re-reading the section multiple times and still be unable to understand it. I think it's a very unique and different new world, but Sagara sometimes puts the reader on overload with too much information to absorb or understand at once. Having said this, it was an enjoyable read, but not something that I can see myself reading over and over again. Borrow it from a friend, or check it out at the library, but don't take it home expecting to get multiple readings out of it.

I'm always careful with what I want to read since I get emotionally involved. I tend to write off anything else the author puts out just because of the one book they made me mad with. This is one of those books.I think that this book was trying too hard to not be long. Or to not bore us. But it lost the magical touch when I sort of had to figure it out on my own. There are different creatures and types of humans, but I didn't get it. I thought that maybe I had missed the description of the history of the Barrani or the Leontines. But no, it wasn't there! I found it awful. I want to know about the peoples that I am reading. I don't know what it means when a lion's paw pad is dry, I don't have cats. I don't know what it means when the whiskers are this way or that, again I don't have a cat. But the author made it seem like it was common knowledge and she had no time to explain it. With the Barrani, again the same thing. They had no emotions but there was always some kind of inner turmoil going on in there. They were perfect, but where did they come from? What is their past about. There wasn't even a clue about it. No inclination that I would get the answers in the future.Now, Kaylin. Ugh. If I had to hear just one more time what an awful student she made, I was gonna hurl. She wasn't a strong heroine by any means. She was an awful student (yea, the book does it like that too) who wasn't able to pick up on any of the lessons she was taught. But the bad words, oh yea, she got those. I can't be supportive of a character that has no redeeming qualities. I only get the feeling that she's pretty decent with her daggers, that of course, she loses right before she truly needs them. She's not a strong character. She's lived in turmoil over something we learn about later, but it seems like she hasn't done anything to be better than that. Sure she joined the Hawks, but it doesn't seem like it was because she wanted too.Severn. I'm leaving it alone. He's so mopey and haunted. I can't stand him. He has no redeeming qualities.The only reason I finished this book was because I paid for it. It would have been such a waste if I didn't. The only reason it's 1 star is because at the attempt of at creating a new world and because I have too."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"Because this book was endorsed by Tanya Huff, I was expecting a generic, run-of-the-mill urban fantasy, but what a pleasant surprise is this world created by Sagara!Cast in Shadow (The Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)was deliciously uncomfortable to read, dark and gritty but not lurid for the sake of sensationalism, suspenseful enough to devour in a day, and so captivating I had to overnight the next few books in the series. Sagara has created strong, realistic, multi-dimensional protagonists with faults and tempers and very UN-Disney-princess-like appearances and personalities, multiple fascinating races (complete with culture and language details) written consistently and cleverly enough to inspire a Tolkien-type following, enticingly dangerous bad guys to whom the reader can't help but be drawn (and root for?), and a painfully realistic pre-story character history that, once finally explained, is immensely satisfying. In fact, Sagara is brilliant at enticing the reader with hints of the characters' secret pasts, and successfully toes that line of un-put-downable suspense without going too far and becoming outright annoying. The city of Elantra itself (perhaps more of a city-state or mini-nation) is fully fleshed-out with a highly plausible setting believable enough to make readers wonder if an Elantra-type place could be the future of our own world, and the extensive underworld is beautifully complex, consistent, and darkly alluring.My favorite plus: it's unpredictable! NO CHANCE of knowing where this book is going in the first few chapters because of a sloppy, spoon-fed plot, and thankfully no obvious and inevitable, sappy romance. Thanks for giving the reader the benefit of the doubt, Sagara; I'm so tired of books where the author writes as though we're all too stupid get the plot without the writing on the wall.This is no common waif-turned-heroine sword and horsey book either. If you're looking for sappy, predictable, easy-to-read drivel, you're in the wrong place. All in all it is was a blessed reprieve from all those popular urban vampire fantasies. Fantastico!Cast in Shadow (The Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)"},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"The story is about a young girl who grew up a street orphan with another older child. At age thirteen she ran away from all she knew to join an elite organization part of a triad that protects the outer city. The Hawks teach and train her in the art of, well, watching. (Swords are the fighters; Wolves are the hunters)Unfortunately, what Kaylan is running from returns seven years later. You see, over 30 children between the ages of 10 and 13 were butchered when she was young and every one of their bodies had the same strange tattoos that are also present on her own body. She knows she is a part of this horrible crime, but does know why or how. When the Lord of the Hawks has her team up with her old orphan buddy (whom she want's to kill--you'll have ot read to find out why) and a dragon person, they have to return to the mean streets of Nightshade to solve the crime.Great story, but the writing definitely does NOT flow. I had to read over passages over and over again to try to visualize what the author was trying to say. Many times she left me completely baffled. I'll most certainly try the next one because it's a great story idea and I'm hoping she'll work out the kinks in her writing."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"The story was interesting enough but was often confusing. I didn't like that several times something would happen and, at the end of the scene, you wonder why the author just wasted your time with that. Much, much later you realize what she was trying to establish with the scene, but I really would have liked it if the author had made the point of the scene clearer at the time it occurred.Also, the author attempts to create a mystery (as if there wasn't enough) by withholding from the reader information that the view point character knows. Kaylin knows what happened in her childhood that makes her attack Severn several times during the book, but the author deliberately keeps what happened very vague, even when Kaylin is directly thinking about it. It remains a mystery until the middle of the book, but hiding it doesn't add anything and only makes Kaylin's motives more confusing. Whenever an author hides something about the main character like this, it has the side-affect of keeping the reader at a remove from her so it is harder for the reader to really care about or bond with the character.Also, I liked Kaylin well enough, but it's more firmly established that she's annoying and exasperating to everyone around her than it is that people are fiercely loyal to her (rather than simply affectionate) so that they would risk the fate of mankind by leaving her alive.The heroine's poor grammar made the story a bit confusing at times and got downright distracting if I was tired while reading. I was also a bit annoyed that the author felt she needed to repeat minor points than had no direct bearing on the story (for example, she makes the point several times that Aerians use stools because a chair with a back doesn't work for them). Another annoyance was her repeatedly saying that a lifted chin was a universal sign of submission only to later have Kaylin wonder if the Dragon race also used this Leontine sign of submission. That's not exactly 'universal' then, is it?On the other hand, I appreciated that Severn steadily shows Kaylin his love throughout the story, even though he knows she doesn't understand and isn't ready to accept it. That's a better romance than having two strangers jump in bed together, in my opinion."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"Absolutely loved the book!

Michelle Sagara writes the most awsome books ever, ingenious, adventurous, real people but heroes and heroines. When you read them , they can't be put down. The readers read them again and again. Some people may think they are romance, but they are really adventure and fantasy. Excellent for teens and adults.

This book stands out as being one of the most original forms of the genre that I've read in a long time. Congrats to the author!"},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"While I don't regret purchasing this book, I found the writing style very claustrophobic. It was sometimes unclear what was happening and how everything worked. The drawback to such a finely detailed world is that it's difficult for the author to introduce all the content we need to know in an interesting way. I found the characters actions somewhat unrealistic, perhaps because I didn't know enough about the class and race dynamics involved. The author is a perfectly competent writer, but I just didn't like her style. I'd recommend reading excerpts before buying to see if you have the same reaction."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"First off, I want to say that I tried very hard to like this book. Very hard, but in the end I just couldn't do it. I applaud the author's attempt to inject the novel with mystery and intrigue, I really do, but her effort, I'm sorry to say, fell flat to the point of becoming pretentious. The writing style was jerky and hard to follow. It took me twice as long to read this novel as it usually does others of this genre because I kept going back and re-reading passages hoping to make sense of what was happening. My extra effort was wasted. And I just have to say, while I do enjoy novels that make me think, I do not enjoy novels that increasingly confuse me as I read without any evidence of an explanation that makes any sense. I ended up being more confused than the main character (which I'll admit without giving too much away) is a HUGE feat. That was another thing, the heroine became downright annoying early on in the novel, without any indication of true growth of her character or redeeming quality; what little growth was achieved only seemed to be transient and ineffectual. However, there are good elements to the story, particularly the author's rich attention to the land and people of her world; well, people other than her main characters.So would I recommend this novel? I'll let you decide for yourself whether to read it or not. Just don't buy it, borrow it from a friend if you can."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"In the Kingdom of Karaazon, in the capital of Elantra, the river Abalyne separates the fiefs from the rest of society. In the fiefs, warlords rule over their own domain and have their own laws and armies. Surprisingly, the sentient species on both sides of the river, human, avian, immortal, etc get along with one another. Now there is a crisis brewing that has it roots in a series of killings that happened in the fiefs years ago when children were killed over a period of three years.Now the killings have started only this time there are only three days between killings and the victims, like the ones three years ago have strange tatoo like makings on their bodies. Kaylin, who originally came from the fiefs, also had the mysterious markings on her body before the killings started. Now she works on the right side of the law and is determined to find the killer before the magical ritual is completed and more lives are lost.CAST IN SHADOW is a magnificent fantasy filled with plenty of suspense, a terrific who-done-it, and a wonderful heroine sacrificing her own needs to provide selfless service to end the killing in the fiefs. Michelle Sagara provides a fantastic realm in which the audience will believe that diverse sentient species exist and live and work in harmony at least until the murders occur leading to everyone pointing fingers at anyone different. Ms. Sagara smoothly has combined mystery and fantasy in this terrific tale. She has the talent to become a star in the fantasy genre.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"I'm with the other reviewers. Confusing, needing to reread pages because of the choppy writing and the heroine is not very likeable. Keeping the reader in the dark about what's going on made it hard to read, I almost gave up on it. I certainly didnt hurry to finish the book. At least I got more done around the house because it wasn't hard to put down."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"I picked up this book looking for a fun, quick read. And that was what I got. So the three-star rating is a compromise between my level of enjoyment while reading it (4 stars) and my thoughts on its actual quality looking back (2 stars).The plot centers around Kaylin Neya, who's a Hawk, i.e., a cop, in the city of Elantra. She's assigned to investigate some child murders in the slums where she grew up, which seem to be somehow linked to the mysterious tattoos that have appeared on her body. But she hasn't been back to the slums since she fled 7 years before, and it quickly becomes evident that there's a lot she's hiding from her friends and from the reader. (The book is written in third-person, but from Kaylin's perspective.)This review is going to seem weighted toward the negative, but before I get into that I'll reiterate that I really did enjoy the book. It was just what I needed at the time, and my id was all over it. Beyond that, a couple noteworthy things Sagara did well: Kaylin seems to have a life more than most protagonists do, rather than simply existing to fulfill her plot functions. And the relationship between her and Severn pushed my closet-romantic buttons. (I don't have very many of those buttons, so that's always nice. It is the sort of relationship that only works in fiction--in real life I'd probably be helping Kaylin get a restraining order--but like I said, this book is all about the id.) And I will grant that Sagara does a decent job with the moral dilemmas presented.Now, in retrospect, for the more analytical side of my reactions. The following is a bit spoiler-ish, but I've made it as vague as possible.Other reviewers have mentioned a variety of problems with this book. There's the plot: the mystery seems less fulfilling when you find out that several of Kaylin's most important allies, including her boss and both of her partners, have known the causes of the murders--for years!--and nobody has bothered to tell Kaylin even though she's the person who most needs to know. Now granted, a couple of these apparent allies are so enigmatic that when they go to a restaurant, they probably make the waitstaff choose their meals for them to avoid disclosing something so personal as their food preferences to a stranger. But as soon as Kaylin figures out what questions to ask, she gets answers. So the whole thing doesn't make much sense and feels cheap.Then there's the characterization: very broad-brush. Granted, this is standard in thrillers. And the writing. For the most part, it's.... okay. It's written in the breezy style common to urban fantasy. But sometimes it's just plain confusing--there's unattributed dialogue in conversations with more than two people, and confusing magical events that aren't explained. In some places words are left out, which is the editor's fault. But then characters do things like \\"nod quietly\\"--as opposed to what? nodding loudly?Finally, the book left me with questions--which may be answered in future volumes, but are basic enough that they should've been addressed here. For instance, Elantra's police force is divided into the Hawks (investigators), Swords (peacekeepers) and Wolves (thugs)--why? The Hawks seem to do everything themselves anyway. And speaking of the Hawks, if you were a police commander and had an officer whose immediate, knee-jerk response to her new partner was attempted murder, would you really deal with this by just telling her to behave and sending them on their way? And the slums are home to noctural man-eating monsters--so why does anyone still live there? And if they've got to stay, why does nobody hunt down and kill these creatures during the day? And what's stopping the creatures from crossing the river into the better parts of the city anyway? I could go on, but that's probably enough.In conclusion, this book is great brain candy, but probably not for the analytical reader. I may pick up the sequel next time I'm in the mood for this sort of thing--but let's be honest, knowing the potential love triangle is going to be in the same holding pattern for the next several books doesn't help matters."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"When I first read this book I thought Michelle Sagara was a new author, because this first book reads more like a rough draft than a finished novel. There were a lot of confusing \\"plot twists\\" that just made things drag, and some dead ends along the way that made you go \\"...okay?\\" I wasn't too sure of Nightshade at first, some of the things he did just didn't seem to fit his character. I also found Kaylin Neya to be a bit on the immature, drama queen side. I just didn't think anybody but a newbie with lots of room to grow would write like this....But, and there is a big one here, I usually like to give writers a second chance, and I was very happy I did with this series. The later books, if you can drudge through this one, are much better, and they just keep improving along the way. You learn more about why Nightshade did a lot of the \\"uncharacteristic\\" things he did in this book, and Kaylin (Thank the heavens) matures a bit. (How she ever survived on the streets I still have yet to deduce; even with the help of Severn and others.) She actually grows in every book, while still keeping her personality intact, which is always nice to see in a book.I have read every book in this series, excluding the last one (Cast In Ruin; waiting until I get my Kindle.) and have been pleased with all of them except this one. This is an amazing series, as long as you can make it past this first \\"rough draft\\" of a book."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"Couldn't put this down. Non stop action and plot really pulls you in. the only downside is that in my opinion the author is not very good at describing things in a way you can visualize (IE, people, landscapes, buildings, etc...)"},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"I am a little behind on reading, and reviewing, this one as it has been out for a handful of years. I am happy I waited until now to read it, as I can now plow merrily through four more books rather than waiting for them to be written and released. I am unhappy I skipped over this one so many times while it sat, waiting for me to notice it, in my store as I really enjoyed reading it.Cast In Shadow read like an excellent juxtaposition between traditional and urban fantasy. It had the fantastical world, peopled with a fun and interesting mix of peoples and cultures, and then the plot had all the overtones and quirks that usually trigger the urban designation. It was an intriguing read as a result.I read some reviews that knocked the book for not spelling everything out for the reader, and all I can say is yes, the reader is expected to pick things up as the read and learn things on their own. If that does not appeal to you, this one will not tickle your fancy like it did mine. The reader does not get an introductory description/explanation of the world and its races. It is all revealed through events and interactions. There is enough to go on, and I was never left confused or foundering, so I am content with this method.The protagonist is enjoyable and human. The series of murders that take up the bulk of the plot are distressing and weave and excellent sense of urgency throughout the book. I am very much looking forward to reading the rest of the books in the series.The blurb on the back does not do it justice. Dont do what I did and pass it by initially. It was a quick, good read.

The author has great skill. Usually I can figure out the plot of any book I read. This book kept me reading because I wanted to know what was going to happen next.

The recent deaths of local children hit entirely too close to home as she becomes involved with trying to discover who/what is causing them. Although I haven't exactly come to expect greatness from Luna books, this was disappointing. I spent most of the book confused -- not only about the immediate goings-on, but also about the entire plot in general. I didn't feel I had enough information or understanding about the world the protagonist lives in or even about Kaylin herself for the story to come together and make sense. Fans of other books published under Harlequin's Luna imprint will be disappointed in the absence of any romantic element to the book whatsoever."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"Kaylin is a Hawk, one of the servants of the Lord of Law.

I thoroughly enjoyed the story, the mix of fantasy and reality, and the complexity of the characters. The only thing I did not like about the book, was the way the entire story was told from Kaylin's point of view. It has been a very long time since I have read a book told from only one character's point of view. In my opinion, a story is much more interesting when told from the point of view of the main characters- in this case Kaylin, Severn, and Tiamaris. You only get an inkling of other characters' thoughts and emotions through Kaylin's (often narrow-minded) interpretation.While I look forward to the next book in this series, I hope the author will broaden the scope of the book by showing perspectives of Severn and Tiamaris (even if the majority is still shown through the eyes of Kaylin)."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"I honestly don't know how this book earned so many 4-5 star reviews.

Cast in Shadow did not spell out anything....I'm still trying to process it several days later.

It should have been easy. While the general theme and setup are pretty basic and pretty much what you'd expect, she does a good job of developing characters and themes that are not run of the mill. The plot chugs along and the various plot revelations are suitably gripping.Alas, several things spoil this book for me. First and foremost, the ending is very much a copout. The setup of SHADOW is as a mystery---Kaylin works for what amount to the police, she is investigating various crimes: she's solving a mystery. Yet the actual villain at the end is completely out of left field, not even hinted at until the climatic battle. It is very vexing and violates the reader's trust in the worst way.Given this, the books other flaws, mostly minor, are much harder to swallow. The main character is given a variety of traits that are supposed to make her endearing. The backstory is recycled. The milieu is unoriginal. There are some very good things here (Nightshade, Kaylin's childhood story, etc.), but I don't think I can swallow more. Still: good beach fare if needed. And I may be being a bit unfair: I'm reading Jack Vance's Suldrun's Garden (one of the Lyonesse books) behind this one."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"Young Kaylin left her home to find protection in the ranks of the Hawks, a type of peacekeeping, almost police-like force in Elantra. Sadly, she finds that she's not very good at magic, generally fails classes and is cursed with a strange gift that ties her to the past she tried to run away from. When the Elantran authorities investigate Kaylin further, her past returns and Kaylin is forced to unravel the mystery behind her strange past.Cast in Shadow sounds like a typical high fantasy novel with a butt-kicking heroine -and it pretty much is. The story, overall, was enjoyable and entertaining; I kept reading up until the very end. While the plot itself and characters are hardly original, the world of Elantra was really interesting to learn about and I enjoyed some of the secondary characters quite a bit. Sagara has a gift for fun, believable dialogue and has a great writing style that captures just enough of the novel to give the reader a picture of the world without overdoing the detail.So, with all these glowing remarks, why not more stars? Well...Cast in Shadow was \\"good\\" not \\"great.\\" The originality was a little lacking for me and at points it felt like the characters sat around and talked too much. I was also was hoping that Kaylin would get a little more interesting, but she ended up being one of my least favorite characters in the book.I think this series has great potential to be even better in future installments.

As much as she tries to forget her violent and painful past she can't escape the mysterious marks on her body, and when she is assigned to investigate the murder of children bearing similar marks Kaylin is forced to draw on strength and magic she didn't know she possesed. Complicating an already complex situation, her new partner is not exactly new to her. He's from her old neighborhood and was like a brother to her until a startling act of violence forever ended her childhood. Through the course of the investigation Kaylin will encounter magic and ancient races that will help her realize she might of escaped her past, but it will still affect her future."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"It isn't a literary masterpiece, but if you enjoy something light in between heavier reads (as I do) you will enjoy this book. I felt like I understood the characters, they (especially Kaylin) were well-developed. Sometimes I felt like I was missing certain details, and sometimes the dialogue was hard to follow (like I didn't understand what Sagara was trying to convey). Also, often- I think the author let too many lines of dialogue go without pointing out who is saying what and I often had to go back to find out who saying what lines. That is pretty much the only peeve I had with this book. Other than what I have pointed out- this was an excellent light read and I am looking forward on starting \\"Cast in Courtlight\\" when I recieve it."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"I loved this book, particularly because it has a strong, independent female character.

(You don't find out until middle end)She's strong magically but they don't explain how until near the end.Book was too long.Plot line was BADLY developed.The main character was not as described, changing back and forth.The world built was thin at best- attempting to do what Mercedes Lackey did in regard to religion- not having a specific one.Characters spoke other languages but she didn't even attempt to make up words other than \\"wife\\" or \\"child\\".Liked:That it finally ended with some sort of conclusionThe use of tattoos in mainline fiction. A huge piece of culture finally employed-just not well.I hope that in later novels I won't incessantly hear of the Lords of Law, her hate of the bracer, how she feared but loved her Lord Grammarye..

Written with humor, the characters bring the imagination to full alert. Looking forward to seeing the heroine grow to her full potential in future stories."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"The cover and description on the back of this book made me think thiswas an urban fantasy. It's not. There is nothing urban about it.That's not to say it's a bad book, it's not, but it is straight upfantasy.The author tried very hard to create her own unique fantasy world fullof magic and otherworldly creatures, but the result is a bitconfusing. Even after finishing the book I'm still a little confused.This book is also way too long for the story. It could have been halfas long and had a much better pace. I found myself getting frustratedas Kaylin was called before her superior's for the twelfth time andyelled at, threatened, and given no explanation for her repeatedquestions. It felt very, very, redundant.Also, this is nothing romantic in this book. Nothing at all. Iprefer some romantic elements in these kind of books I felt it'sabsence here."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"I had to read this 2 times to catch on to what was going on (I don't think I was paying enough attention). It's wasn't one of those books that I couldn't put down although it was very good."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"Cast in Shadow is one of the better Luna books that I have read. The premise and plot are great. However, the writing is a bit chopping, and I was very disappointed at the use of stream-of-consciousness (a-la James Joyce in Ulysses). Sagara uses this technique when the action rises in the book, especially at its climatic end. I'm not a fan of that style. So, I was very annoyed during the last few chapters. This world has the potential to be very rich. There are a number of settings as well as a mix of race and politics. Kaylin is a magically gifted, human, orphan that works for the branch of the Law called the Hawks. She currently lives in the capital city, but was born and raised for the first few years of her life in the outlaw fiefs. When she was young and living the fief of Nightshade, mysterious marks appeared on her body that coincided with a strain of brutal child murders. Now, the murders are occurring again and Kaylin is sent in with a team to investigate. The investigation, along with one of her partners on the assignment, bring back memories from her unfortunate past that she doesn't want to deal with now or ever. Since this is a Luna book, the currently known romance \\"interests\\" are the aforementioned ghost from the past named Severn and the mysterious Lord of Nightshade."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"Anyone who has read Michelle Sagara writing as Michelle West, will see some strong parallels between two of the main characters in that series and her new heroine. Kiriel has a ring; Kaylin has a bracer. They both roar, create darkness, and are referred to as daughter of darkness. Jewel is marked as Avandar's consort; Kaylin is marked as Nightshade's consort. They both come from the street, lived with a den, have unruly hair and tempers, and live far too firmly in their childhoods. Though, at least Kaylin has an excuse at 20. Why Michelle doesn't let Jewel grow up at 30+ is a quandry.I definitely enjoyed the book. It was one of the first I've read in a while that I didn't want to put down. I would highly recommend it to others, even with the higher price of the oversized paperback edition. I just hope that this doesn't mean that all of her books will be double the price from now on. Also, if Michelle wanted to write a Kiriel-Jewel book, why couldn't she have given us House War a little earlier? I wish that she had finished her previous series before starting a new one."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"Very intriguing plot line, but very badly delivered. If I had a dollar for every time the word \\"Hawk\\" was used, I'd be able to pay off my new car! Geez, I understand the character was a member of the Hawks, I don't need to read \\"I'm a Hawk\\" on every other page! Whomever edited this book should be fired. This reads like a first draft dictated to a typing program. It's really sad because the story idea is very good, but its buried under so much unnecessary stuff. Save your money and treat yourself to something better."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"I really wanted to like this, but it's one of the worst-written fantasies I've ever read. Apparently little money is expended on editing at Luna Books. The writing is so awkward, repetitive and dull that much of it simply wastes space and insults the reader's intelligence. It's about what I'd expect a talented eighth-grader to write. There are multiple incomplete sentences on every page, the descriptions are lackluster and cliched and the dialogue is dull and staccato.It's so disappointing that this book wasn't edited adequately. If the author had been challenged to tighten the writing, it could have been turned into something readable, if not actually good. I'm astonished at the positive promotional comments on the jacket and wonder if the reviewers actually read the book."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"I read A LOT off books. I mean, 3-4 per week. I thought this book would be something a little different than the typical urban fantasy books I usually read. I really enjoyed the different \\"races\\" of beings but where is Elantra supposed to be on this planet? World? Alternate reality? Micro-cosmos? I can let that slide but the characters seem one-dimensional and hollow. There was no real connection between them and the reader, like the author was entirely too interested in setting up extraneous details to really get us, the reader, to care about the heroine/heroes of the story. Man, did it drag! I felt like I was picking up Gretel's breadcrumbs, it moved so slowly. The characters get through one crisis and then there is no explanation given for the events and they have to fumble around with no information until the next major crisis. Choppy and confusing, I found myself re-reading pages just to see if I missed a key sentence that would bring the plot to life. Very frustrating. I just downloaded the next book in the series, hoping that I can get \\"sucked in\\", something this book neglected to do."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"This book would have been much better if it had been half the size and focused on a cohesive storyline. I am partial to urban fantasy but also enjoy the creativity required for a completely new and unique fantasy world. However, this book does not deliver on the promise of five intelligent species plus humans. (You can decide for yourself if humans are intelligent or not). There's a lion species that growls a lot, hawks that can fly, some weird psychic species with squid-like appendages, a group that resembles Tolkien's elves, and dragons. For some reason it is a great secret that dragons can actually turn into ... (wait for it) ... dragons. If that was not enough, the author felt the need to include the possibility of vampires, angels, and space aliens. And while this may seem like a large fantasy world, all of the action takes place within easy walking distance. Even the lawless fiefs, where children die on the streets and monsters roam, are across the bridge from town.As other reviewers have suggested, you don't learn enough about any of the characters to care what happens to them in the end. Since the entire story is told from the perspective of Kaylin, I don't know why it is told in the third person. It can be very distracting as can the author's tendency to emphasize phrases by separating them into sentence fragments. \\"There was great sadness. In his eyes.\\"My greatest complaint, and the reason I rated the book so low, was nothing was resolved. The book is over 500 pages and it is all set up for the next book. What I find inexcusable is that the reasons for all of these events are not explained and you are made to feel stupid that you don't understand. There is a great deal made of the fact that Kaylin didn't pay attention in class so is missing much of the knowledge that would ties the pieces together. Is it going to take three or four more books before the framework is built or will the author just keep dabbling out secrets here and there? I, for one, will not be finding out."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"What no other reviewer has mentioned is the humor and byplay between characters. Without this, the storyline of children being ritually killed would be too incredibly dark and depressing, but Kaylin's love and protectiveness for children helps drive the storyline and the humor about everything from betting on Kaylin's arrival time at work to \\"going Dragon\\" makes this an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"My first thought after finishing this book was \\"Well, it was good but not great.\\" At least I didn't think \\"What a waste of my time,\\" because the author is basically a good writer. The characters and the world are interesting and I'm left wanting to know more.I've tried to define for myself why I wasn't as enthusiastic as other reviewers, and I think it's the details that overwhelm you while reading but don't add up at the end. The one nagging flaw to me is that the whole premise that drives the \\"suspense\\" is not really a mystery to Nightshade, Severn, the Lord of Hawks, or the Dragons. They don't know literally who is the culprit, but they all know what Kaylin should be told ASAP - yet the story drags it out to the bitter end. I think this would have been a better story, and the author is good enough to pull it off, to reveal the truth about Kaylin up front and then tell the story about how she solves and/or deals with her dilemna. I was also annoyed with the attempt to be humorous about Kaylin's chronic tardiness and perpetual circles under her eyes. Is this to establish Kaylin as an antihero? Inept? Lovable and cuddly? Every other Hawk's fledgling? I would rather know more about Kaylin's thoughts and history and less about her laundry, too. (The laundry, hunger, tardiness, and lack of sleep are examples of too many details that don't really add to the story but stood out and distracted while I read the story. I can't help but wonder how Kaylin can function if she is so challenged about clothing, eating, and sleeping. According to the details, this is a serious problem for her. The author is good enough, though, that I can almost smell K's apartment.) I also think the relationship with Severn could have been developed better and that there should have been more interaction between them.I admit, I HATE stories that just have one crisis after another that drive the supposed plot, and this book has that problem. I just think this world, the characters, and the underlying story are far more interesting than the final story that was written. I am going to read Cast in Courtlight soon and hope it delivers better than this one.This author has a lot of potential and I'm looking forward to her future efforts. I hope she can avoid the lucrative formulaic plots because she's better than that."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"Tolkein, Sagara is not. You won't find pages and pages of description about the history and races of the Empire the story takes place in, and characters do use curse words and phrases like \\"cool\\" as easily as modern people do.I like Tolkein. However, I also count Cast In Shadow as one of my favorite fantasy books. I read it very quickly, drawn in by the main character, the world, and the witty writing style. Kaylin is not the perfect fantasy female I'm getting tired of. She complains, comes in to work late, has messy hair, hates the magic her life is full of, and still holds her own with magic and muscle like the less well-drawn heroes. I think she manages to be likeable because of her faults and quirks--they're realistic. Her past was also unique, and, although I don't want to spoil anything for those who havn't read the book, I must say that I was very pleased when the relationship between Kaylin and the Mysterious Man From Her Past which is revealed two-third of the way through the book did not turn out to be a jilted lover story. In fact, although Luna is an offshoot of Harlequin, there's little to no acknowledgement of romance in Cast In Shadow.There isn't that much world-building in terms of the races, but I stopped caring about that when I realized how cool they were--and I think that's a main thing to realize about this book. It's to enjoy, not to think about. Read it if you like furries--there's bird people (Aerians),cat people (Leontines), and Dragons which are most often in human guise. The Barrani are sort of demon/elves, immortal and stuck up because of it, although Sagara does do a good job of making some of them likeable while retaining the racial traits that annoy Kaylin. I thought these races were enjoyable, but rather typical. Luckily there were also the creepy Tha'alani, who read thoughts via tentacles on their heads. These, as far as I know, are quite unique.I do have some negative comments: The entire world, geographically, is not explained; Elantra is apparently one city in the domain of the far-off Dragon Emperor, and I couldn't get a feel for what was outside its walls or how its government really worked. As another reviwer noted, Kaylin's superiors are supposed to be intimidating, but although Kaylin's Leontine superior Marcus shows Kaylin his claws he is on very friendly terms with her, and the lofty Hawklord actually gets some hugs. I liked Marcus and the Hawklord, but also got the feeling that the author hadn't really intended me to, but had liked them too much herself to keep them intimidating and aloof."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"Michelle Sagara also writes as Michelle West (the Hunter and Sun Sword series, which are effectively one super-series, still incomplete), and some of her characteristic plot elements appear here, together with the romanticism of her writing style. I was pleased to find that this book is much shorter and faster-moving than the Sun Sword books, and somewhat less mannered. The plot is an interesting variant of the Chosen One motif, and it is left mysterious who exactly chose the heroine and for what. It was also pleasant to find that (a)her appalling childhood trauma involving one of the male protagonists was, when revealed, actually traumatic; and (b)Ms Sagara does not try to say that because the deed was necessary it was also right.The ambiguous demon-lover figure who has appeared in all of Ms Sagara's books (both as Sagara and as West) also appears here. The worldbuilding and characterisation are sketchy but adequate for the purposes of the story, and the heroine while irritating on occasion is at least shown as making an effort to behave like an adult. I do not know how Ms Sagara will end this story, which is nice and lets me look forward to the next book."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"Okay, let me start off on all the things that I am not... I am not a fan of romance novels, I am not a great fan of Michelle Sagara's (West) Huntlord books (which were the first ones I ever picked up by her). I am not at all crazy about this recent melding of the paranormal and the romatic to the point that most of the woman who are the leads in most of these books I personally would either avoid or smack around.That said, I liked this books a lot. (No apparently I wasn't aware that Luna as an offshoot of Harlequin, I haven't read a Harlequin book since I was eleven years old.) I love feel of the characters and how well they interact with one another (even with the cursing in multiple languages. I know three or four in which to curse in and I switch as well) I wanted more though. It is great that the humans are not the top of the food chain here, that way you either make it or you don't and it isn't because of the opposable thumb, its because you can.The plot is thin, it is very convoluted and the way that NO ONE wants to explain ANYTHING to Kaylin is to much, honey if you want to know bad enough improve your reading skills and look for the information yourself. That and holding a grudge will only hold you back, (this I know from personal experience.)Yes the writing is choppy at times, yes Kaylin can be frustrating enough to strangle but it will get better. At least it looks as if it is... I had the new Kim Harrison and Kelly Armstrong books waiting for me to pick up and devour but this one held my interest, this one made me want to finish it... I've already ordered the second and pre-ordered the third of this series. That will be the litmus test, if this keeps my attention then Ms. Michelle Sagara (West) will have found a new (old) reader."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"The killings stop when Kaylin runs from her past. Seven years ago, she fled the fiefs of Nightshade and joined the Hawks, part of the triad (Swords, Wolves, and Hawks) that protec the City of Elantra from crime. Since then, she's learned to read, write, and fight---she's so secure in her job she can even show up late without too much fear.Then one morning, her mirror awakens her with a message from her Sergeant. Kaylin's late to a summons to the Tower of Justice and her boss, the Hawklord.When Kaylin gets there, she discovers that children are again being killed in the streets of the fiefs, children bearing the strange whorls and tatoos Kaylin herself developed just before the first killings started.Kaylin is teamed up with a Severn, a man she doesn't trust from her past, and a Dragon Lord. Plus, the Hawklord has placed a containment on Kaylin's magic: a device that no one clearly understands the use of.The worlds Sagara has created is fascinating and well realized. She handles the inclusion of separate races: leonine, avian, and draconian very well. Overall, a good mystery within a fantasy plot. Also, while the book is a serial, enough questions are answered about this present plot to not leave readers dangling til the next book comes out."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"I have to wholeheartedly agree with E. Llado. I picked up this book because it seemed like something I would enjoy. The premise was promising and the world Sagara created had so much potential. I started to worry when I realized I was two thirds of the way through the book and still waiting for a moment of clarity -- the moment in a book where everything you've read so far comes together to give you a clear picture of the world the book is set in. My impression of the setting and the people is fuzzy, at best.I found the character development weak and I didn't empathize with the main character at all. The writing was choppy and I found it exceedingly difficult to focus on the story as random, tangential comments seem to pop up and throw me out of the story as soon as I got into it. I was left wishing the characters were developed more: who are these people? I know almost as much about the characters around Kaylin as I did when the book started and only slightly more about her.I'm hoping that the next book in the series is better. I'm a firm believer that you should always give a series a second chance - especially in this case because there were, throughout the book, flashes of what it could be."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"Finally, a fantasy & romance publisher risks publishing a book which involves the winding path a young lady walks to realize her potential and save her own life. Michelle Sagara blows a much needed gust of fresh air into the paranormal romance genre which usually involves cookie cutter yes-boyfriends (or alpha-mates) and stubborn women who burn up the sheets. As other reviewers have mentioned, the reader gets occasional glimpses into Kaylin's personality and growth. Kaylin, Severn, Tiamaris, and Nightshade all offered interesting glimpses into their personalities which makes me hunger for the next book so I can get to know them better. Personally, I liked the gradual character reveal as I've come to grow tired of the standard romance formula of giving a character's elevator pitch in the first paragraph, mission statement in the first five pages, and summation in the first chapter. Such upfront first impression characters always tell me everything about his/her character in the first half of the book and you can easily predict what will happen after that. Also, while you can usually smell the love interest from two chapters away, Sagara deftly handles the possible suitors in this book so the reader is always mentally assessing Kaylin's changing moods and feelings.Disclosure: I only read the first book after finding out that the second book was published, so I knew the story would continue. Had it only been a single book and not part of a possible series, I would probably want more closure at the end of Cast In Shadow."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"The world in which the author writes is very interesting. All the races are intriguing. The heroine - Kaylin starts off fairly interesting and goes downhill from there. I can't understand why the other characters think so highly of her. She is frequently terribly annoying. Another difficulty is the writing style. It is somewhat confusing. Several times I had to go back and reread a sentence. The book is not worth that. If Michelle Sagara can make her main character more interesting, the setting of this world shows considerable promise."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"Wow, Kaylin, neither did I!I really wanted to enjoy this book, but I feel like I've been left scratching my head. Several times in the book, the heroine says \\"I don't understand.\\" or others ask her \\"don't you understand?\\" And she doesn't understand anything going on, so how am I supposed to understand? And the worst part is that after they ask her that, THEY DON'T EXPLAIN!Kaylin is a \\"hawk,\\" which means she part of law enforcement. She was born in the slums and left at 13 after some traumatic event. Children were being slaughtered in the slums and it's happening again. Now she's been assigned the case and must revisit her past in order to stop the killings and come to peace with who she is, her magical gifts, and the people who surround her.Sounds good, doesn't it? I thought so.Good points of this book:1. Entertaining--Even though I was lost for a lot of the story, it was an entertaining read. I kept reading because I wanted to know the secrets, understand the tattoos, and mere curiosity.2. Different plot line--not too strong and a bit confusing, but it was different.Annoying points of this book:1. Kaylin--We never get a description of her other than her tattoos. She barely passed her exams to become a hawk, so she doesn't seem to understand anything in the world around her that includes multiple species. She isn't a very interesting character. I really didn't care what happened to her, she was very flat, ignorant, childish, and untalented.2. Elantra--Too confusing. I don't know if it was because the story was written from Kaylin's POV who didn't seem to know anything, but this world she lived it didn't make any sense. There are multiple species, but they all seemed to fall in some sort of clich&eacute;. We were never given any clear description of what the species looked like so it was hard to imagine this world. Not only that, but she seemed to have different names for each species which made things all that more confusing.3. Too secretive--This was the MOST annoying. Kaylin states that the immortal species know how to keep a secret and lie more than they state the truth. OK, so how am I supposed to believe anything they DO say, which isn't much. Everyone around her is content to make a small comment in passing that makes no sense and then say, \\"I won't tell you anymore.\\" ooooooooooooooookaaaaaaaaaay? Because of this, it's not a mystery that she's solving, it's some random events that seem to happen because there are no clues to follow.4. Too secretive Part 2--This book is 507 pages. We learn in the first chapter that she has some magical abilities....that's all, that she has \\"some magical abilities.\\" We don't learn until page 132 what the gift is, and it's just lamely stated \\"I can heal.\\" Then, we don't learn until another 300 pages or so that she has another ability and what it is. Not only that, but even though she tries to kill Severn in Chapter 2, we don't learn until page 279 why she hates him. It's fine to hold out on the readers (you know, to create tension & have twists, etc.), but when you keep referencing it and don't explain it? VERY ANNOYING.5. Grammar--So, this is just a minor annoyance, which others have already pointed out. The grammar and sentence structures were pretty poor. It was easy to overlook.All in all, I don't think I'll ever pick this one up again. I might for curiosity's sake read the next in the series to see if it gets any better, but I'm not holding my breath. I'm just glad that I picked this up at the library. Read before you buy."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"The tale is not the smoothest of telling...

She has survived, and is now a proud member of the Hawks who patrol the streets of her new home. Unfortunately, the odd, tattoo-like markings on her skin that first appeared during the past killing spree have never faded. Now, more young children are being brutally killed once again, their bodies adorned with tattoos much like those on Kaylin. Kaylin finds herself reunited with her childhood friend-turned-enemy, Severn, and her new compatriot, the Dragon Tiamaris, as they must investigate and try to put an end once and for all to the murders. Secrets can be deadly in Nightshade, however. Will these secrets destroy Kaylin?CAST IN SHADOW is a phenomenal fantasy tale and one I've found myself rereading simply because it is so enjoyable. Michelle Sagara has crafted a very complex, but believable, fantasy world chock full of intrigue. The various castes and their rules and languages are all clearly laid out as the intricate details begin piecing together to form one fabulous new fantasy world. This is a tale that only gets better in the retelling!Michelle Sagara's character development is superb. Kaylin makes for a great heroine as she is both noble and flawed. Who can't help but love a heroine who is perennially tardy? Her conflicted relationship with Severn adds an aura of mystery as one wonders exactly what he did to destroy her friendship with him. The unfolding of this mystery, along with the secret behind the killings, is carefully done as Ms. Sagara balances out the tension so that it doesn't become overwhelming.CAST IN SHADOW is a book that easily deserves a place on the keeper shelves. Michelle Sagara is to be commended for writing such a multifaceted and entertaining story. CAST IN SHADOW is easily recommended, both for the depth of the character development and for the outstanding world building.COURTESY OF CK2S KWIPS AND KRITIQUES"},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"Kaylin is a member of the Hawks (the city of Elantra's police force).

I can honestly say that this book is better than 80% of the other science fictions I have read and I believe this author will be very sucessful if she can just simplify her stories and eliminate some of the unnecessary characters."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"Great story and characters...

She's not smart, organized or even clean. 2. I have never been called slow and there were several times that I had to look back after reading a section to understand what the heck just happened.

(If you don't believe me, see the cover for Cast in Courtlight.) However, it was poorly edited, especially in comparison with the Sun Sword series (with another publisher).I really liked the many angles of the plot line, however in the sequel Cast in Courtlight, Kaylin starts to morph in Jewel, the heroine of the Sun Sword series.

This is the first book of hers that I have ever read and I was pleased that it kept my interest through the whole thing. The writing style was unique and quirkie in that you really have to pay attention to every word or you really become confused.

And there is so much wrong with it that it is hard to know where to start. The plot is at least interesting but everything else about this book fails. From characterisation, which is embarassingly one dimensional, to world building, which is nonexistant. The main character is supposed to be tough and independant, yet she swoons, whimpers or shudders on nearly every page. Even though it is stated at least twice she was in danger of losing her life by simple murder at the hands of her superiors, these same people spend an incredible amount of time protecting, coddling and fighting over her. As for the world she inhabits, all I can tell is that it is non industrial and the slums are so deadly and so simply evil, that it is ludicrous to believe that anyone actually lives there, or that a small group of children could survive on their own for several years.I really love fantasy novels and I have read an inordinate amount in my 57 years, from Tolkien to modern urban fantasies. Almost all have flaws of one kind or another but each has strengths that overcame the weakness of plot, or of characterisation or of description, but not this fantasy."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"Cast in Shadow by Michelle Sagara is in essence about a tough, capable police detective who wields a sword in a fantasy world populated by lion-people, hawk-people, elves, and others. This would normally be an ideal style of story to me. There's a lot of good to this story, as well as a few issues.First, the good. I enjoy the mix of races and characters that Sagara has created. Heroine Kaylin isn't a perfect, always-do-right heroine that you often find in stories like these. She's got flaws and issues. She's messy. She's always late. She's not good with holding her tongue. Still, you also can see where all of this came from. She grew up an orphan in the slums. She had no parents to guide her. She hides from patrols as a matter of course; it's built into her soul. The rough childhood creased her actions in ways it's hard for her to now even realize.And, as often happens in these stories, \\"just as she thought she was out\\" ... she gets pulled back in again. Her police leader orders her to go back deep into the slums to figure out a string of murders. She has to take with her the one man she hates with all her heart - the man who had been by her side in the slums and who then betrayed her.The world is a mix of magic and medieval, a world where dragons exist and Kaylin wields knives with great talent. It's not thought of as \\"odd\\" that females are capable warriors. In fact, in the lion race it's assumed the women are the ones with power. There are both women and men serving side by side equally on the force. I appreciate all of this greatly. It's only a few decades ago that this would have seemed \\"unusual\\". Now it seems normal and natural. I'm thrilled by that.So there's a lot of good here that I appreciate. Now to the issues.There should have been polishing work done by a good editing team. The writing, while generally decent, has some issues. The author is very, very fond of the phrase very, very and it gets very, very annoying in a very, very short period of time. Some sentences are unnaturally convoluted and leave the reader wondering just who is talking and who they are referring to.The world many times seems to exist in a certain way solely for plot reasons. Few areas are fleshed out thoroughly. We know there's a city, and that it has some slums, but we never get a sense of how this relates to the rest of the planet. Is it the only city? Are there other lords in other places? There's a Dragon ruling this city - is he a dictator? Does he simply rule \\"forever\\"? There's no context for the story and that detracts from it. It's like reading a fairy tale, \\"once upon a time there was a city ruled by a dragon ...\\" But at least there you make the assumption it's on a planet like Earth with lots of other cities and people and there are other cities around it. Here we have no idea at all.I found the premise a bit shaky. I don't want to give away spoilers, but the issue the plot revolves around seems far-fetched to be kept a secret this whole time. It would have made far more sense for it to be discussed and known about, for all sorts of reasons. I think the story would have benefited from that as well. It would have made the progression of events \\"make sense\\" rather than seeming to happen to keep the plot moving towards what the author wanted to happen.I found the ending unsatisfying. It's as if the author knew up front she was going to write a series and this was just the introduction to the \\"real story\\". So we invest the time and energy into the plot and then at the end it doesn't feel resolved. To go with that thought, some listings have this in the \\"romance\\" category and traditional romance readers will find the book unsatisfying. It's more of a drama that has men and women in it who are sometimes interested in each other. If a reader is looking for an ending that wraps everything up and gives a sense of completion, they won't find it here.So with that all being said, I do think this book has its audience. You have to be in it for the fun fantasy-romp, not for romance. You have to be prepared to have multiple books in the series on hand, and know things don't \\"wrap up\\" in this one. You have to be tolerant of a loose writing style that has challenges. You have to be willing to ignore greater issues of why or where or context and just go with the flow in this particular little mini-realm. If you can read from that mindset, there's fun dialogue, intriguing characters, and a female lead who can hold her own. Except of course when she's crying in a man's arms, being carried by men, being saved from herself by men, and being lectured to about her mistakes by men :). I didn't say it's perfect."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"~* 4.5 Stars *~She is a Hawk, one of the three branches of the Lords of Law for the city of Elantra. The branch most adept at solving crimes in the city, though members of the other two may disagree. Regardless, Kaylin Neya has been a Hawk for seven years.Seven years, since she fled the fiefs of Nightshade as nothing more than an illiterate, orphaned waif. Seven years, since several unspeakable crimes created a noxious cloud of horror that slicked the streets of the fiefs with misery and terror. Seven years, since the horrific betrayal of the one person who had been her whole world. Seven years, since the mystical markings on her arms and thighs had mysteriously appeared...since each brutally murdered child was found with the same marks on their tiny, eviscerated bodies.And now the murders have started again in Nightshade.The Hawklord has put her on the case because of her familiarity with the fiefs. Also because of the marks on her arms, she's sure. She won't, however, be investigating alone. With her will be a member of the Dragon caste, Tiamaris, a learned male familiar with Nightshade and more than familiar with the string of murders in the past. Also at her side will be Severn Handred, new Hawk and former Shadow Wolf. Also formerly of Nightshade.But those are pitifully few words to describe Severn. There are none that fully encapsulate the man or their past. The rage that he incites in Kaylin is only held in check by the slimmest of margins, but ending the ritualistic homicides and catching the serial killer who is marking and slaughtering children in her old stomping ground takes precedence. She has no illusions. She'll need Severn, Tiamaris, and a whole lot of luck, to have any hope of doing so.~*~I'm a little late in starting the Chronicles of Elantra series, but now that I have, I'll definitely be sticking with it. This series opener was a hell of a read. Sagara introduces her complex and layered world with an intense, plot-driven story, a heroine with a pitch-perfect blend of strengths and weaknesses that appealed, and a fabulously diverse cast of secondary and ancillary characters. I got dragged into the melee that is Kaylin's life and was swept away by it all.I have to admit, there's a lot of information to absorb. Sagara doesn't hold back when sketching out a pretty large and comprehensive world full of several different races, their diverse traits and cultures, and a surprising number of unique and complex characters. Secondary and ancillary characters included. Throw in an intense and sometimes painful plotline full of mystery, danger, and action, and all the sundry details surrounding it, and you've got a book that requires you to keep a lot in your head as you go along.Personally, I enjoyed it. It was a lot, yes, but I really liked how Sagara blended the world-building and story. There wasn't a bunch of exposition front-loaded in the book, or doled out in a quagmire of info dumps that slowed down the pacing. Instead the world was introduced and fleshed out, and the various characters and cultures explained and expanded in bits and pieces as they pertained to the storyline as the story evolves. It was nicely done and provided a lavishly authentic world of vibrant depth and dimension.Kaylin was a delight for me. I'm not always easy on my heroines, I know. I'm picky. Kaylin, however, was a very endearing mix of curiosities, confusions, and competency. She was a hot mess in some areas, a soft touch in others, and always she was full of gritty determination with a passion for justice. She's a haunted girl, sure, but also a fearless Hawk and a dedicated young woman.There are moments when she's not the most mature character (by far), the smartest, or the most patient. Lots and lots of moments. Just about every moment, actually. But instead of that annoying me as it has with other fantasy and urban fantasy heroines in the past, Sagara uses Kaylin's flaws to help define her and make her believable. She tends towards insubordination, is physically incapable of being on time for anything (I can relate to THAT), and she isn't the most educated kid in class by far, but she has a gift for grasping obscure connections and seeing intricate truths. She's unpolished and unvarnished, streetwise, and loyal to a fault. She's not stupid, she's no one's damnsel in distress, and she'd likely kick the ass of anyone who suggested such a thing.I sorta loved her a little.I also loved her and Tiamaris and Severn together. They were fabulous fun, and the contentious history between Severn and Kaylin packed a powerful punch once revealed, one that added a tension to their relationship that was keenly felt throughout the book.There's no romance here, per se. Not at this point. The vibe was such that it will probably happen some time in the future, but after everything that happened seven years ago, I have to be honest, I don't think I would have been ready for something to develop between Kaylin and Severn. That's a lot of baggage. For both of them. And much needs to be healed between them first.The narrative of this story has a couple of quirks that bear mentioning. Many of the conversations and informational scenes are written with a wealth of subtext, allusion, and half-spoken truths versus the more traditional plainly stated ideas, thoughts, and actions. That can be frustrating as hell when you feel like a bunch of stuff is flying over your head in what should be a simple conversation. Oddly enough, in this book and this world, it worked for me. It seemed to fit the characters and the situations and added a layer of intensity to the intrigue that kept building throughout the book. I just didn't mind biding my time until things were made clear.Without doubt, this series debut excited me. There's so much there, and because of everything it contained, it's easy to imagine limitless possibilities for subsequent books. Of course, that's the bright spot to being so late in starting this series. There are plenty of books to read before I'm caught up, so all that potential is just a few clicks away. I have to admit, that's a pretty sweet consolation for my tardiness. I can't wait.Quotables:\\"History is not our guide, it is not our friend.

It's been on my recommendation list forever, so I checked it out from the library but was put off by the lame synopsis on the back of the book. When I finally picked it up, I had a very hard time putting it down again. As some other reviewers pointed out, the details of the book aren't very fleshed out. You have to slowly build a picture of the different races in your head as you read through the book. This could be off-putting, but there is so much going on in the book that the main characters' races are less important than their personalities, which are well developed. It is an interesting and unique world, with an exciting and different plot and heroine than I have read recently. I could hardly put it down!"},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"And today we have the first in yet another series I had heard much good about but avoided picking up for a variety of no good reasons. I think my reluctance stemmed somewhat from an uncertainty as to just what kind of series Michelle Sagara's Cast series was. I think at first I had the impression it was a paranormal romance, possibly an urban fantasy (the covers influenced me this way). A few chapters in I was surprised to find CAST IN SHADOW much more a mix of dark and high fantasy, peopled with a smattering of solid gold, humorous, and truly sinister characters living in a fully developed, layered, and fascinating world.Kaylin Neya is a Hawk. The youngest of that number, in fact. In the city of Elantra, the Hawks are charged with policing the streets and guarding the citizens. They share that responsibility with their sibling organizations the Wolves and the Swords. Together the three forces are headquartered in the Halls of Law. Elantra's citizens are made up of a mix of humans like Kaylin, winged Aerians, furred Leontines, and the immortal Barrani. Seven years ago Kaylin left a life of squalor on the streets of the fief of Nightshade, gave herself a new name, and made her way to Elantra in search of a fresh start. Now her past has caught up with her as a series of murders takes place in Nightshade. Disturbing in their own right, they also bear an eerie resemblance to events in Kaylin's past she thought for sure she'd left behind.CAST IN SHADOW starts at a good clip and doesn't slow down once. The writing is uncluttered and engaging and Kaylin is an extremely likeable heroine. She runs from a past so dark she has avoided revealing it to her closest friends. She has a gift for healing and will drop everything at a moment's notice to deliver a baby or rescue an orphan in trouble. It was actually kind of refreshing to read about a kick-a** heroine with a soft spot for children. So often they have an allergy to kids or have issues with some of the \\"softer\\" emotions and I loved Kaylin because she was both fierce and compassionate. I cheered her on when she was fighting and I wanted to help guard her secrets. Of which she has many. She has friends, enemies, comrades, and those who would use her for her unusual abilities, yet Kaylin remains a little aloof from them all, determined to make her own way. She's my kind of girl. Only a handful of pages into the book and I was completely invested from that point on. I loved this story and can't wait to move on to the next installment--Cast in Courtlight (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 2)."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"The story line is very good, and captures your interest immediately. I would give it 3.5 out of 5 stars, but my only real negative is that this author has a habit of splitting thoughts and occasionally you have to backtrack in order to understand the statement. For example, \\"She snapped him a salute - which, given his rank didn't demand it, was only meant to annoy - and stood at attention.\\" This particular sentence is easy enough to read by itself. However, this type of sentence can be found every few lines, and sometimes several are present in the same paragraph. It becomes annoying at times, especially when the sentences and thoughts could so easily be reconfigured to flow much more easily. I've always been taught that if you have think about the sentence to make sense of it, it needs to be restructured. Sagara's work has a lot of those sentences. Otherwise her story is good and imagery is great. Recommended read."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"I bought this book a while back but just now got around to reading it. I'm a fan of luna but I wonder what they thought when they were reading this. Its really confusing in the beginning throwing characters in there that dont have much of an explaination since they aren't human. It would have been better for me if there were more details about their society since its other worldly like, to be honest I dont feel anything towards the characters. If one of them died, I'd be like oh well I guess. The main character is double sided, like she wants to still be friends with Severn, yet killing him at the same time?? Its mainly lacking alot of explaination. But I will trudge on and finish it and probably read the others since I already bought them, which I know regret.

This is one of my favorites. I've just finished reading this book for the fifth time. I'm an avid reader, but rarely read something twice because there are so many new books out there. However, this series has something so beautiful about it, I just can't stay away. The characters worm their way into my heart so that I worry about what will happen next and am so relieved when they are ok. The plot, pacing and storyline in the series are all top quality, but that's not what keeps me coming back. There is something so beautiful in the writing. Whether writing as Michelle Sagara, Michelle West or Michelle Sagara West, her books are worth picking up. She reminds me of the first time I read Wuthering Heights and Ms. Bronte blew my mind with the beauty of her words. This book is not light or frivolous reading (which I also enjoy at times), but is rather something that was crafted by a master. I will continue to enjoy this book and the rest of the series for many years."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"I admit it. Dark fantasy is one of my favorite genres. And I am always happy to come across a new series. This one does show great promise. I do feel that there was a bit too much time spent on Kaylin's faults such as her untidiness and her constanst lack of promptness. However I feel that the character of Kaylin herself is interesting enough to ignore the harping on her faults.The characters that I found to be most interesting are two of the secondary characters that are shrouded in mystery. One is the Fieflord Nightshade in whose territory Kaylin ends up working. The other is a figure from her past, Severn. She has mixed emotions about both and I am looking forward to how that plays out in future book.I did listen to this book in audible format and I do have to say that I was impressed by the narrator. There are a lot of characters in this book yet she managed to ensure that each character's voice is distinct.

Then Audible released a free short novella that acts as a prequel to this novel. After listening to that book I thought I would give this one a try. As I listened to the book I was at some points enjoying the novel and at others irritated.In short, the author could have cut out a quarter to a third of the book because of the repetition. How many times do we have to know that \\"shrugging with the eyes\\" means they made a face signifying that. That explanation is fine once, every time someone \\"shrugs\\" like that however got old after the second use. The book is also a \\"bit\\" melodramatic in several places. I started feeling like I wanted to strangle the author in some parts... I'm not stupid, I can come to my own conclusions about how dire the situation is, ect. It felt like the author was writing a book for teens/adults, but felt the need to lead me through the story as if I were a child.That said, there were enough good sections to keep this review at a three star. I don't know that I would listen to this book again because it is so painfully long (long books = good, long books that don't need to be long = bad)There isn't much sex in the book, a few innuendos, but that is it. Not much romance either though it seems the author left it open for more romance later.There was violence and death, in some parts pretty descriptive, though not in the autopsy thankfully. I wouldn't necessarily call it \\"graphic\\" for anything but the blood, in which case, this author really likes blood... blood on people after getting wounded, blood all over the ground after a fight. It was a bit over done for the content I felt like.Language I thought was a bit excessive as well. I'm not a fan of cursing, etc, but if the words are well placed its not such a big deal. It felt like this book just had swearing thrown in \\"just because\\". It didn't really serve much of a purpose other than to make the main character seem crass, or to fill in blank spaces where the author couldn't think of anything else to have her say.Overall, the story concept was interesting, and I was disappointed in the book. It wouldn't have been so bad if I had a real version because I could have skimmed the excessively long parts. Part of me wants to read the second book in hopes she will have improved (because the story is interesting) but I don't know that I can take the rest of the flaws."},{"Title":"Cast in Shadow (Chronicles of Elantra, Book 1)","review":"Cast In Shadow by Michelle Sagara is the first book in an intriguing series. I have never read anything like this before. The world she brings you into is very different. When I first began this series I really had to think to read it because it was a completely new world. With a new world I had to learn a lot. Now I know the world and it is easier to sit back and read without as much thought. Don't be discouraged though. Cast in Shadow is a really good book and so is the series.Kaylin is a strong female character. She ran away from her past years ago and devoted her life to work for the law in Elantra. Now she is being confronted with her past and all the questions that come with it. One of those questions is about the marks that cover her body that have been there since she could remember.This is a wonderful world holding plenty of action and adventure and even some mystery.

As a nation, we seem satisfied with our utter lack of reliance on anything near creative thinking to solve the problems that face us as a nation.de Bono shows us the route to a new paradigm of thinking: as he sees that with global problems crowding in on us, failing to change and failing to begin to adopt new more creative ways of thinking and solving these deep and intractable problems, increasingly is ceasing to be a discretionary option. Sooner, rather than later we will have no option but to give up our almost total reliance on absolutes, and begin to deal in \\"grays.\\" That is what this book attempts to do: teach us that the brain is more comfortable thinking in \\"grays,\\" and that many of the solutions to the problems facing us as a nation and as a world, lie in this realm of creative thought. In is a somewhat vain but very sober attempt to shake us out of our comfort zone.

This book has a few gem in it but it takes too much effort to dig them out. Dont get me wrong, I think highly of De Bono's thinking tools but this book failed to deliver against the expectations he never stop building up through out the entire book. AND he came across as a really insecure person because he constantly need to give himself credit for ideas he has already established as 'his' - which is irritating.He did a pretty good job of explaining why the current system of thinking is archaic but he failed to explain in a simple and clear manner the solution that he is proposing - that is because he only made references to them - you wont find them in the book, you need to go out and buy more of his books to learn about those methodologies.So, this book ended up sounding like a really long brochure on why you need to use his thinking tools and methodology. Save yourself the time and money. Just go out and buy Six Thinking Hats and the other books. He does a pretty good job in explaininig why the tools work and why you need them there again."},{"Title":"Structural dynamics division research and technology accomplishments for FY 1990 and plans for FY 1991 (NASA technical memorandum)","review":"This review is from: I Am Right You Are Wrong: From This to the New Renaissance: From Rock Logic to Water Logic (Paperback)Reading this book in 1992, I found I liked the fact that the author criticized the fatuous book \\"Closing of the American Mind\\" by Alan Bloom, knocking it for its stodgy, traditional conservativism and its outdated ideas, ideas, De Bono asserts, will have no bearing on the future and will only serve to make the future worse. ( Here it is 2012, folks, and Edward DeBono was right!)DeBono's got this idea, however, about a New Renaissance that he writes about in the Introduction, and this reader could not help compare De Bono's vision with Ayn Rand's vision of a New Renaissance and comparing their ideas with New Age cults' visions of a New Renaissance (for example, the cult known as The Fellowship of Friends led by Robert Burton) -- all of which have, over the years, proved not to amount to much -- in a positive way at all.DeBono's New Renaissance would be based on self-organizing systems of thought, he says, operating much like how the brain actually works, not \\"rock logic, but water logic.\\"On page 85, in a chapter called \\"Trigger and Reconstruction,\\" De Bono makes this horrifying statement: \\"The phenomenon of triggering and reconstruction is natural behavior of any patterning system. On the whole, it is immensely useful and life would be impossible without it. Nevertheless, triggering is one of the factors that insures that THERE CANNOT BE ANY TRUTH IN PERCEPTION.\\" (Emphasis mine.) While De Bono warns the reader to avoid absolutes, here's an absolute -- and a false one at that! Where does De Bono get his justification for such a false absolute?On the other hand, De Bono says, \\"There is a reason for this poverty of definition in English. English is a richly expressive language and is a process-description language. This means that we can adequately describe by means of a combination of words, phrases and adjectives a very sensitive spectrum between hate and love. This is fine for literature and poetry but absolutely useless for perception. Description is one thing but perception is another. Description describes perception that has happened. Perception is when it is happening. We need rich and subtle patterns at that point, not ways of describing nuances of feeling later. So English speakers are actually cursed by the rich expressiveness of their language and also the way the language is so proudly defended. The static language of Germany and the richer codes of Japan are crude at first but actually allow a subtler perception. The result may be a greater pragmatism. The point here is that descriptive ability is not the same as the instant of perception.\\"On page 102, in a chapter called \\"Cachment,\\" a passage by De Bono reminded this reader of Gerrude Stein, also a pragmatist interested in perception. \\"Whatever you do, you will always end up with a repeating circle occasionally too. All other states will feed into this stable state. There is no magic about this. It is the natural behavior of self-organizing systems that they move from unstable states to stable states. The result is that a wide variety of inputs may all come to stabilize as the same established pattern. That is the wide cachment area.\\"And, again, a passage by De Bono on the English language that I liked: \\"We do not have that richness. The English language, like many others, is extraordinarily poor in this respect. We have love, hate, like, dislike, distrust, trust. We have friend and enemy. We have to make do with these crude patterns and so each has a very broad cachment area. The problem is made worse by the problem of centering which I shall describe shortly.\\" De Bono says we need many, many, many more new words. Description and perception are different. \\"Train\\" is fine, but \\"iron railroad\\" is absurd.On page 125, in a chapter called \\"Context,\\" De Bono writes, \\"Traditional table logic [AS OPPOSED TO WATER LOGIC -- my comment] simply does not allow for context. A thing is a thing is a thing. A criminal is a criminal is a criminal.\\" What De Bono says is largely true, but such a thing is not true in the context of the philosophy of Objectivism, a philosophy I think De Bono has either not encountered or has avoided.But in a chapter called \\"Making Sense,\\" Do Bono makes another horrifying statement: \\"Cause and effect is a grouping across time.\\" This is just Humean/Berkeleyan nonsense!De Bono also says that many different belief systems put the truth below surface appearances and asks why this is so. Perhaps, he says, \\"only the surface is the truth.\\" That is a very Wildean supposition, and I enjoyed it.I've concluded that Edward De Bono's philosophical perspective is entirely Pragmatistic."},{"Title":"Structural dynamics division research and technology accomplishments for FY 1990 and plans for FY 1991 (NASA technical memorandum)","review":"Interesting read.

De Bono is a genius at making a complex subject completely accessible to the average reader. For example, he avoids involved anatomical terminology altogether by using the metaphor of an octopus in place of a neuron. Learning how the brain works by imagining a beach full of glowing, smelly octopuses is a more efficient mnemonic device than a dry, &quot;scientific&quot; treatment. The rest of the book addresses the problems we humans have in trying to deal with everything &quot;logically&quot; without real logical tools, and thinking that everything can be &quot;solved&quot; through language, analysis, and confrontation. My way of thinking was enriched by De Bono's introduction of paradox, humor, and intuition to provoke creative thinking. And he takes on more than a few of philosophy's sacred cows while he's at it. The idea of &quot;catchment&quot; as a model of our automatic compartmentalization of new data is alone worth the price of the book."},{"Title":"Structural dynamics division research and technology accomplishments for FY 1990 and plans for FY 1991 (NASA technical memorandum)","review":"I found this book to be extremely useful to my understanding of human behavior. I have been reading extensive psychological literature in order to formulate a useful model to understand how humans in organizations react to proposed change. I want to use that model to help them create positive change. Most of the literature on organizational change is anecdotal support of an approach that once worked somewhere. (Exception: Chris Argyris) DeBono starts with the fundamental mechanism of how the brain works to understand the behavior people exhibit. This understanding has enabled me to formulate much more effective approaches to individual and organizaitonal change. You do have to think hard to understand deBono's underlying messages. It may be difficult if this is the first deBono book you read, or if you have not been digging for a solution to a specific problem.

He destroys in a few paragraphs a lot of deeply entrenched misconceptions that western society has been operating under for centuries.

It's densely packed with concepts, each touched on just long enough to give the reader the main points, without all the flowery self-indulgent nonsense that so many other writers of books for the lay person love to fill their pages with.

The author shows the importance of the kind of thinking that generates new ideas. And, while these new ideas are subject to critical thinking, it takes a very different kind of thinking to create them.I was disappointed with the relative lack of tools to use in what the author refers to as &quot;lateral thinking.&quot; While the tools were not the subject of this book, I believe the author could have included a number of the tools he uses and teaches. (I felt as if the author chose to omit the tools just so that readers would need to buy one of his other books to get that information.)A worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Structural dynamics division research and technology accomplishments for FY 1990 and plans for FY 1991 (NASA technical memorandum)","review":"This book opened a lot of doors in my mind that I've been trying to get through for a long time.This book is a great mix of topics that helped me gain a different understanding (several mental models are proposed in the book that offer a mental paradigm shift) of the relationship of emotion to thought to psychology, philosophy, belief, truth, etc. and helped me gain a historical and cultural understanding of the belief structures I have working in my life.In this book, De Bono proposes that critical thinking is powerful, but less than perfect, if it is the only thinking we use. He proposes that Critical/Rational thinking as developed by Socrates/Plato has provided the means for our technological success today, but has also blocked our progress as humans because it is only one kind of thinking (black or white, right or wrong). There are other ways of thinking and when they are used in conjunction with rational thought we have a better chance at improving our human interaction and the world we live in.I have a true, good friend who recommended this book. I had asked him for his opinion on why I feel the need to \\"evangelize\\" other people. \\"Why do I feel this need to convince other people that my beliefs are correct and that theirs are somehow flawed if they don't match mine exactly?\\" I've observed how this practice has had poor effects in my own life and also how similar practices have not had good effects in the world e.g. War, Politics, Religion, etc. On a technical level we've made all kinds of progress, yet on a social level we are still acting like cavemen!So, anyway, this year I've been studying motivation, behavior, psychology, belief, various religions, etc. attempting to understand myself and how/why I interact with other people in the way I do even though I know my confrontational approach is less than Ideal. This book gave me some breakthrough thinking on this subject and I'm still sorting through the debris of my former beliefs on human motivation as a result. This is why I feel like I will give this book 5 stars in a few months after I've had a chance to study it more. Right now, I'm wondering if I've been logically tricked...One thing is for sure, I didn't \\"get\\" De Bono's 6 Hats until reading this book. I bought \\"SIX THINKING HATS\\" at the same time I bought \\"I'M RIGHT, YOU'RE WRONG\\" and it seems like these two books together offer practical approaches to revolutionize our thinking patterns and improve our human interactions.Do these ideas result in practical change and improvement for myself and world I live in? I will need to report on this later. As a intellectually stimulating book I give it 5 stars. For pragmatism, I give it 3 because I haven't tested it yet. So, for today, I give it 4 stars overall.Note: This was not an easy book to read. It seemed like de Bono took forever to get to his points. In fact, at one point, I skipped a few chapters and then found I had to go back and make them up. His teaching seems so simple in hindsight! But de Bono is building a logical argument throughout the book and while it seems like he is taking too long to get to his points, the points are WORTH IT! This is NOT a book on practical tools. He has written other books about practical tools (of which he reminds you quite often). This book provides a foundation on which to develop practical solutions."},{"Title":"Structural dynamics division research and technology accomplishments for FY 1990 and plans for FY 1991 (NASA technical memorandum)","review":"Perhaps I have read too many book dealing with similar topics but I found this book \\"underwhelming\\". This book lacks substance; focusing more on pseudo-academic referencing and plugs for the author's other books, workshops, and CDs. Perhaps if he were truly blazing new ground this might be acceptable. Unfortunately much of the information is \\"old hat\\" if you have read the far superior \\"How real is real?\\" by Paul Warzlawick, \\"Quantum Consciousness\\" by Stephen Wholinsky, or even the works of Robert Anton Wilson (Fiction or Non-Fiction). That said, the best part of the book, in my opinion, was his explorations and anecdotes about humor. In the end, unless you are a nut for this subject or looking for a second tier reference I would try other books. I freely admit that I have not read Edward De Bono's other works and would still consider reading them after a good browsing to make sure they do not resemble this book. Sorry Edward; nice concept but poor execution."},{"Title":"Structural dynamics division research and technology accomplishments for FY 1990 and plans for FY 1991 (NASA technical memorandum)","review":"For the most part, this book seemed contrived and impractical. There are a few good ideas in here, but they are buried. It takes a lot of effort to sort through and pull them out. I have three main beefs with the book:1) The author refers to himself and his works WAY too often. There is definitely more than Narcism there, I think maybe he is his own hero. But I don't find lateral thinking to be that fascinating. He satkes his reputation on this concept. &quot;Lateral Thinking&quot; is the same thing as &quot;mechanized creativity.&quot;2) There is a fundamental flaw in the book that shoots itself down. The entire book is about how we should avoid absolutes and deal with perceptions instead of concrete facts. Then it proceeds to claim that the author was &quot;right&quot; about this and that in previous works and it makes assumptions like that more food production is a goal to aspire to. Ultimately, this is a good &quot;exploration&quot; of a subject the author has not applied to himself. As such, I don't feel he should be regarded as speaking with authority.3) It is about 200 pages too long. There are 3 redundant forwards, followed by a lengthy introduction (32 pages), followed by a redundant introductory section. On page 110, the author is still referring to things he intends to do with the book. Don't talk it up, just do it.There are more than 70 pages building up what the book will do, and the rest of the book just fails to live up. ONE of the THREE Forwards says that the book is in simple terms because De Bono is a master and can dumb it down. Not so. It is in simple terms because it is not a complete concept and the whole book is filled with testaments to the author's lack of understanding of his own concepts.All that said, I actually do enjoy the &quot;lateral thinking&quot; exercises of De Bono. I suggest spending your reading time there instead of here."},{"Title":"Structural dynamics division research and technology accomplishments for FY 1990 and plans for FY 1991 (NASA technical memorandum)","review":"Edward de Bono is a pattern-interrupting Savant Provocateur!As a preview, here's an interruption of a pattern (of expectations) for you: de Bono - throughout the book - promises to go into some detail to explain the term \\"hodics\\" (which he conceptually previews as a shift in inquiry from \\"is\\" to \\"to\\"). As you reach the last page of the book, you finally see a paragraph long C-level section in which de Bono excuses himself from his own mandate: he explains that he - \\"upon reflection\\" - decided not to \\"burden\\" the reader with too much about \\"hodics.\\" End of story. The modern-day Diogenes of Synope has left the building, with the unabashed spontaneity of a Zen master that just cut a whole cat in half (just to make a point about the dangers of dichotomous thinking)!Don't get me wrong: the book more than meets its lofty mandate (to herald a renaissance, no less!) - it's panoramic, it's thought provoking, it's original, it's \\"meta\\" in more way than one.Reading De Bono is a kind of fun you get from watching Rubick's cubing on You Tube. There's the circularity all right. There are brilliant revelations as pseudo-chaos of pattern interruptions suddenly comes into crystal clear focus. The result is a contagious desire to try out the water logic yourself, to discover this amazing thought style that allows one to maneuvre around the unnecessary rapids of the false dichotomies and the situation-independent absolutes.I love de Bono's pushy paradigm-shifting style. I enjoyed his \\"Lateral Thinking\\" and I really liked this work on \\"Water Logic.\\" He is right. We are wrong. No \\"ifs, ands or buts\\" about it - just a neologistic pattern-interruption word-cue \\"po.\\"In sum, the \\"I am right you are wrong\\" is a must for psychologists, comedians, marketing/advertizing folks, politicians, scientists, and poets.

He puts forth many interesting ideas about how we think and how we can improve our thinking. If his ideas were adopted, I believe they would have a great positive impact on humanity. In an odd way, the non-application of his ideas confirms his theories about why old style thinking prevails and better design thinking remains the bailiwick of artists and visionaries, and out of the realm of the common man.His basic premise is that traditional logic, analysis and judgment thinking are not good enough to move us forward to where we need to be. This thinking by its nature relies too heavily on existing frameworks and therefore does not lead to the kind of creative approaches required for breakthroughs. Instead, we make improvements at an evolutionary pace, complacent with the way things are (unless prodded otherwise by a crisis), and waiting for a creative genius to lead us forth at some future place and time.De Bono argues that thinking is a skill that can be taught to anyone, particularly how to change perceptions. He developed the concept of lateral thinking, which works to help design new ideas by working with what he terms self-organizing patterns, as opposed to externally organized systems. This is actually, for me, the hardest concept to grasp, which is the idea of what a self-organizing system is. His main - and most important - example of this is how the brain works: it receives information which forms patterns. Future input follows these previous patterns so that we can only see what we are prepared to see. To see something different and new, or come up with a new idea, the brain needs a provocation to jolt it out of its previous patterns. This is how humor works: the punch line is unexpected, but follows back logically in hindsight.De Bono's theories about thinking and how to improve it challenge the status quo and can be threatening to existing institutions, particularly education which, according to him, do not teach students how to think; instead schools and universities fill students with information to which they then react. They are left without the thinking skill he refers to as operacy, or the ability to come up with workable ideas. Perhaps his strongest case is in the observation that humanity has progressed significantly in technical matters, where analysis and logic are key, but barely in human relations, where more than just traditional thinking is required. He even proposed the creation of new words that will capture meanings that are not currently expressed in existing language.There is some irony in De Bono's claims and approach, as he uses logic and criticism against logic and criticism; uses language, which he criticizes as constraining, to criticize language; provides a history of thinking while condemning the focus on history; and, in my opinion, one can claim that he applies a different philosophy to thinking while also declaring an end to philosophy. None of this is a condemnation of his work, but rather and acknowledgement that, ironically, any revolutionary thinker can only inherit for his work the very same tools he seeks to change.I Am Right/You Are Wrong is a good explanation of his basic theories. It is worthwhile reading for anyone seeking to understand the foundation of De Bono's thought."},{"Title":"Structural dynamics division research and technology accomplishments for FY 1990 and plans for FY 1991 (NASA technical memorandum)","review":"I've read this book first time almost 20 years ago and enjoyed it then as much I did now.

Even though this book seems geared toward the public on understanding their relationship with law enforcement, it does an excellent job of cheerleading those in law enforcement who are still committed to doing police work. Every city manager, county commissioner, council member, etc. should read this book to see why they should stand behind their law enforcement agencies if they want to improve them. It's hard to hit a home run if the home team fans keep 'booing.' As Americans we need to cheer the everyday heroic acts of law enforcement officers, not just when it's politically correct. Dr. Blum explains why the 'occuptaional bigotry' against police by some in the media creates a lack of spirit in officers that causes them to hesitate to do their jobs, which may cost them or other innocent people their lives.

This book was a mental saver for me as I had to endure nearly four years of public and departmental scrutiny for my actions with a life or death lethal encounter with a suspect. I have had 7 years of law enforcement experience with the Chandler PD in Arizona and was the first officer charged since Wyatt Earp in the state of Arizona with an on duty shooting. I was crucified in the media, by my department and city and was laid the blame for all that was wrong with law enforcement in the state. A jury trial and acquital as well as a state police board review proved that the only wrong doing was actually from my peers in the department, city as well as the county attorney who made my case a platform for political endeavors as well as media's facination with categorizing which case they will champion and who they will make a scape goat. In Arizona, a good cop is a dead cop, which makes for good press. I have suffered tremendously and have found little support in attempts to get a law enforcement career again due to the politics. Lawrence Blum's books (Force Under Pressure and Stoning the Keepers Gates) have been a blessing only second to reading my Bible that have helped me make sense of my emotions, tribulations and my future. I use his material when I speak to other officers, church groups and even prisoners to help them understand the same things I now do.

I had high expectations for this book, to get a better feeling of why society does not, in my opinion, properly support officers involved in deadly force encounters.Unfortuantely, all I learned from the book was what I already knew. Society as a whole does not support officers in deadly force encounters, nor do their law enforcement managers in many instances. What I still have failed to learn as much as I would like is why. This book fell very short is exploring non-law enforcement views toward the police or analyzing why there is a lack of support. Is it a liberal media bias? Is it more concern for risk management and lawsuits? Is it a perception that law enforcement got away with too much in the past, and now they are not believed or supported? Is it a concern that by speaking up in favor of the police you could be subject to social criticism?I just don't know, and this book failed to help. I much preferred reading \\"On Combat\\" by Col. Dave Grossman. At least in that book he attempts to explain the relationship between law enforcement (sheep dogs) and society (sheep) relative to criminals (wolves)."},{"Title":"ABOVE AND BEYOND","review":"This was one of Sandra Brown's best!

Trevor, also a marine, survives the bombing losing his left eye as well as his left side being crushed.

Kyla's loyalty to her late husband is frustrating because this is a romance novel and she's one of the obstacles to the HEA the hero and heroine are seeking, but her reluctance to move on is entirely understandable. Everyone grieves at her own pace and Trevor is incredibly understanding, despite how hard Kyla makes it for him.At first, Trevor's obsession with Kyla was a little creepy, but, under the circumstances, believable and after Kyla finds out who he really is, Babs does put a positive spin on it and shows that he hasn't really done anything all that awful. I think it's more complicated than that, but this is one of Sandra Browns earlier books and she was restricted by the limits of a category romance.It was interesting reading this reprint nearly twenty years later and seeing the way the military and the Middle East were presented in popular fiction after the Marine barracks bombing. It wasn't the thrust of the book, but for me it was enticing.The only thing I didn't like about this book was that Trevor's injuries were never an issue. Yes, superficially they sort of affected the plot. There were a couple instances where people stared and he was a little self-conscious with Kyla about the damage to his leg. But Brown presents him as just so sexy that it's not really an obstacle for him. I think I would have liked him more if he had not been a ladies man suddenly changed by this terrible tragedy into a one-woman man but who still has all the charm and charisma and sex appeal that make him the town's most eligible bachelor.

Distraught, she vows to honor his memory and remain in mourning.Trevor is devastated when he discovers that the only reason that he survived the bombing is because he passed out in his best friend's bunk. While recuperating in the hospital, his personal effects are delivered, including heart-wrenching love letters that Kyla wrote to Richard while he was stationed in Egypt. With each letter, he finds himself more and more attracted to Kyla and the life that Richard was not able to return to.Now disfigured (and wearing an eye patch as a badge of honor), former womanizer Trevor returns to the US and rather than work at his father's law firm, decides to become a building contractor, seeking out the widow he has fallen in love with. After watching from afar, he finally introduces himself, and slowly chips away at Kyla's armor. Through the letters, Trevor knows just how to get to her.Brown does a good job with the material, but I would have like to have seen more of his recovery, particularly since his personality took a 180, as well as reactions of others to his supposedly disfiguring injuries which never seemed to bring negative attention to him.

When she finds out about Trav's lies, she then turns into giantic, rightous bitch.This book would've been half way decent if the heroine could've been more lovable or more reasonable.. her love for her dead hubby came across as unbeliveable.. if she did love him al ALL at any point in her life.Get ready to spend your afternoon annoyed to all hell, if you do decide to try this book. Not one of her better books, at all..."},{"Title":"ABOVE AND BEYOND","review":"Sure, the story sounds like the replica of Message in a bottle written by Nicholas Sparks. However, Ms. Brown who remains as one of the masters in romance genre ,who has the foresight to concoct an original and refreshing plot before Sparks.The emotional intensity in the romance drama is palpitating and Kyla Shroud as the widow who misses dearly her husband is sympathetic yet resilient. Trevors is most scorching as a hero, for beyond his looks lies a tender heart for her.The moral dilemma is well-handled; he has to decide for himself whether to treat Kyla with honesty about his identification, but when love swarms to overwhelm him, he takes care of Kyla and her baby. It is altogether an uplifting tale that soars with the emotional intensity."},{"Title":"ABOVE AND BEYOND","review":"This book had a great storyline. Guy falls in love with girl through letters to her husband, who is guy's best friend. Of course he feels like it's his fault his best friend died. The letters get him through two years of recovery then he goes to make girl fall in love with him. It was a really sweet story. They only thing I didn't like is how Kyla kept saying to herself that she promised her husband that she would be faithful to him until she died. If she honestly asked herself if her husband would want that for her she would know the answer. I thought that was the only thing that went a little too far. Overall, worth reading."},{"Title":"ABOVE AND BEYOND","review":"Like most people who has read this book, I, too, liked it a lot. The characters altho not thrilling were however very likeable.

This book is classic only in the Harlequin Romance sense. The premise could have been interesting if the story itself wasn't so annoying.

Trevor falls in love with Kyla the first time he sees her and pursues her effections. Trevor does not tell Kyla who he is for fear that she will reject him do to his connection to her late husband. When the truth comes out, it causes a big blowup between Kyla and Trevor. The end of the book is dynamic."},{"Title":"ABOVE AND BEYOND","review":"I enjoyed the novel, but Kyla's behavior became very frustrating after a while. Her undying love for her 1st husband was beautiful, but even after poor Trevor managed to marry her, it was about a month before she'd get close to him. And after he slavishly did all she could dream of, she still said some really wretched, ugly things to him when she found out the truth (which of course she does). Personally, I'm dying to find out what happens to Babs. Is there any hope Sandra Brown will write a story about Babs, a woman who is not strictly chaste like all of Brown's heroines, but still has a wonderfyul heart?"},{"Title":"ABOVE AND BEYOND","review":"One of Sandra Brown's best love stories. I absolutely fell in love with Trevor Rule. He overcame the loss of an eye and the scarring of the left side of his body thanks to the letters that his dead friend Richard's wife sent to him. Richard Stroud was killed in the same bombing where Trevor was nearly killed in. He accidentally comes into possession of Richard's letters sent to him by his wife. He finds comfort in reading them. Her letters help him with his recovery. It takes him over a year to recover from his injuries. He decides to make a new start for himself. Where does he go? Texas. Why Texas? Because that is where he'll find Kyla Stroud, Richard's widow. Kyla, who is still trying to cope with her husband's sudden death, is hard at work running a business and raising their son. When Trevor meets her, he doesn't introduce himself as Richard's friend &quot;Smooch&quot;, his old nickname . Through her letters, Trevor knows that Kyla thinks &quot;Smooch&quot; is a jerk. Kyla only knows that Trevor Rule is new to the area and is trying to make a success out of his construction company. She's immediately attacted to him but is afraid to love someone other than Richard. That doesn't keep Trevor from trying to get close. Will he succeed? Read the book and find out. You'll love it almost as much as I did."},{"Title":"ABOVE AND BEYOND","review":"I have to agree with the reader from West Texas, a good book but not her best. I was really frustrated with Kyla and her desire to be faithful to her dead husband. Trevor was a wonderful guy and she kept resisting him. After a while of this it got quite old. Trevor should have let her go and let her be miserable alone. I think her friend Babs had the right idea. I also liked Kyla's parents and even Trevor's dad. The ending was good and I didn't regret reading the book but again, I've read much better books from Sandra Brown."},{"Title":"ABOVE AND BEYOND","review":"I picked this book up at the airport to kill time. The book was so bad that I threw it in the trashcan to make sure no one else had a chance to waste their time. Kyla's irrational attachment to her dead husband was increadibly annoying. She needed counseling and it doesn't look like she had any. Someone else mentioned to skip this book and go to another. I will read another Sandra Brown book, but if the next one is as silly as this one, then I'll be through with her."},{"Title":"ABOVE AND BEYOND","review":"I loved the book from the first tape to the last.

The first time I read it I thought that it was too sad and I didn't really like it. I read it a second time because Sandra Brown books are usually so good, and I decided to give her book another try. This time I liked it better. It has romantic parts in it like no other book. Still I think that Sandra Brown's other books are better. (Just my opinion.)"},{"Title":"ABOVE AND BEYOND","review":"Being a huge supporter of military families and the life of sacrifice that they live, I was hooked by this story from the first line. I always fear for my guys when they get deployed and leave behind their families, especially those with pregnant wives. I pray for a safe return and for them to be blessed with the chance to hold their unborn babies upon their return.In Above and Beyond, Sandra Brown writes about the reality of life when that loved one does not return from deployment because the worst has happened, he's lost his life.Kyla Stroud is the pregnant wife of Army Sergeant Richard Stroud. While she is in the hospital giving birth to their son, Richard is involved in an explosion at the US Embassy in the Middle East that takes his life and mortally injures his best friend, Trevor Rule aka \\"smooch\\". When Trevor comes to, he is given all of Richard's letters from Kyla by mistake. So what does he do? He reads them, and finds himself falling in love with the woman who wrote them.Every line in this book sucked me in more and more. At times I wanted to jump through the story and tell Kyla to stop being such a butt and let Trevor in. At other times I wanted to sit down with Trevor and tell him get his head out of butt and be honest with Kyla if really wants a life with her.All in all I thoroughly enjoyed this book. My only issue was that after all of the build up with the relationship and Trevor's fear of Kyla finding out the secret of his connection to her dead husband, when it finally hits the fan, the outcome just seemed a bit rushed.Narration:Jack Garrett narrates this story and it was kind of funny because sometimes he sounded like Casey Kasem from America Top 40 and then he would get all manly and seductive and I just wanted to take him home. Being a man narrating a romance novel I was a little worried that he would not be able to carry the female voices well, but he nailed it. - Lisa"},{"Title":"ABOVE AND BEYOND","review":"The book was very good and I would recommed this book to my friends.

After an attack on their Marine barracks leaves Trevor critically wounded and Richard dead, just one day after Kyla delivers their first child, the story jumps ahead many months. As Trevor recovers, he discovers that he has accidentally become the recepient of a box of love letters from Kyla to Richard.

It was written under a pen name by Roger Poidatz, a Frenchman who lived in Japan for a time between the end of World War I and 1924. Donald Richie, the American writer on Japanese subjects for more than 60 years, has called it one of the most observant and honest novels ever written on the nation, as well as the best novel on Japan written by a foreigner. Little information is available in English on Poidatz, but it appears that he published very little besides this book.It was set in Japan in the early 1920s. It began in Tokyo's Ueno Park, where a young Swiss man with seduction on his mind invited a local woman to accompany him on a daytrip to Enoshima, a seaside resort to the south. He intended their trip to end up at a local hotel. (The author's pen name--which sounds in Japanese like \\"Shall we stay the night?\\"--was a play on this invitation.) Unfortunately for the seducer, a Japanese acquaintance invited himself along for the day and things snowballed from there, as more and more people were drawn into the excursion.Each chapter of the book was written from the viewpoint of a different participant, all but one of whom were Japanese. There was the local girl, who was concerned almost entirely with how best to show off her clothes, in minute detail, and who took along a girlfriend, a mother and a baby. The foreigner's Japanese acquaintance, who invited several business connections he wanted to impress with the foreign presence. The pathetic foreigner himself, who knew nothing of what he'd set in motion. The stationmaster at a rail stop near Enoshima, who together with the local police was tasked with monitoring the foreigner for security reasons. The mother invited by the girl, who was concerned most of all with decorating her new baby with good luck charms. The owner of the hotel in Enoshima where everyone ended up, who sought to use the Western presence to her lodging's advantage. A geisha at the hotel, who observed the evening's festivities with boredom and disdain for the foreigner's boorish ways. (For instance, he quickly spit out the local version of \\"Bordo.\\") And finally, a local student who encountered one of the characters late at night along the beach.The humorous ironies in the book were many. Although the foreigner had started things off, he rapidly became little more than a bystander, a footnote, as everyone else used him for their own purposes. He was ignorant of and entirely uninterested in the local culture. His only concern, sex, was far down the list of everyone else's priorities: enjoying a change of scene, displaying one's clothing, spying, advancing a business, and so on. Not that they didn't have a place for sex. The foreigner could've saved himself much trouble by just checking into a hotel and making a private arrangement.Most characters were mocked, together with local and foreign ways, but it was the Japanese who received the bulk of the author's attention. In abundant display were an obsession with keeping up appearances suitable to one's station and making the right impression at all costs. Rounds of elaborate gift-giving. The frequent expression of the opposite of what was felt. The lack of what a Westerner might call a sense of proportion. A focus on minute detail--the right color for a kimono sash, the best lucky charm to buy--to the exclusion of all else. Undertakings that grew to require the planning of campaigns. Authorities' over-riding concern with the nation's honor. Frequent misunderstandings of foreign ways, combined with a search for differences over similarities. And mixed feelings of superiority and humility before the foreigner--the former thought, the latter expressed.The details certainly attested to the author's power of observation in a place he knew only briefly, and to his ability to write beyond race-based stereotypes of his time. gift for impersonating characters from a culture not his own. How much the book is enjoyed, on the other hand, might depend in part on how closely you're attuned to his depiction, funny though it often was. For this reader, it was difficult to care much about any of the characters, they served mainly as butts of the author's humor.Most of the book was written as farce, with a surprising twist in mood at the end. Was the twist intended to deepen the reader's appreciation of the local people and values? And how affectionate, ultimately, was the author's mockery? In the end it seemed unclear, and maybe this ambiguity was another of the writer's achievements.The novel was a very early attempt by a foreign author to describe Japanese characters' points of view. Later ones included Richie's Companions of the Holiday (1968) and Audrey Hepburn's Neck (1996) by Alan Brown. Depressingly, it was only in Brown's work that a Japanese and a foreigner succeeded eventually in finding common ground.Excerpts:\\"Comparatively I ought to wear a costume today twice as pretty as the one I wore for the Exposition. But when I dressed to go to the Meiji Temple, I had put on the only costume that would do. And I could not wear that again since the foreign gentleman had seen it. What was I to do?\\"\\"Now there remained only my friend the foreigner, who was the pretext for our outing, to wait for . . . . To while away the interval we exchanged regards, and to dissemble our increasing uneasiness we displayed a gaiety more and more lively.\\"\\"In addition it is always pleasant to play host to an eminent foreigner; one is enabled to show him that we are no less Europeanized than he, that we understand as well as he the cusoms and etiquette of his continent. The pleasure is enhanced when other friends witness the scene . . . . Why do they not come to study our social system in detail? Why do they not emulate us? The Occidentals are too proud of themselves.\\"\\"It was His Lordship, the Occidental professor! I stretched out my arms toward him and burst into tears.\\"\\"Infinitely honorable-excellence, pardon pray my grave importunity, but I made bold to hope that you might have the kindness to have the benevolence to have the nobility to have the munificence . . .\\"\\"Here was the downfall of foreign science! An unbounded triumph for the science of Japan! A glory for my hotel!\\"\\"[Westerners] are reluctant to show themselves naked. Why? Out of shame, they explain. What childishness! All bodies are fashioned alike and everyone else knows without looking how yours is made. On the other hand, they disclose to the first comer their affections, their emotions, their most profound sentiments, all that which far more than their bodies constitutes personality . . . . Loudly they parade their happiness, deplore their grief . . . . Even more sensitive than they are we Japanese. But our smiles and our gestures . . . never reveal our innermost hearts. Within ourselves we cherish our emotions.\\"But never do you give your seat to an old woman [on the train], because she can get along by herself. Craftily she turns around and as soon as she sees the least little space, into it she drops like a flash of lightning . . .\\" [Reader: Truly, some things haven't changed since 1924]"},{"Title":"The Honorable Picnic","review":"The novel begins as a parody but achieves objectivity by equally ridiculing all of its (strong) central characters. The author was a French-speaking Swiss diplomat living in Tokyo in the 1920s at a seminal time both politically and socially. He depicts a society caught between modernity and tradition, an apparently complex, inter-related society in which most of the characters in fact merely pursue their own selfish ambitions, oblivious of the effect on others. The novel proceeds through a series of chapters, each depicting events from the perspective of a different character - the majority of them female. The ending is tragic and achieves a high degree of realism, doubtless due to its being based in part upon the author's own personal experiences. It is such a pity that the novel is (presently) no longer in print."},{"Title":"The Christian doctrine of justification and reconciliation,","review":"Albrecht Ritschl is arguably the most important Protestant theologian of the latter part of the 19th century. In fact, many scholars deem him second only to the peerless Schleiermacher, who was, quite simply, the theologian of the 19th century. Ritschl, almost single handedly, dominated the liberal wing of the Protestant Church at the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th. His knowledge of Luther was extensive and profound and in learning he surpassed all other theologians of his day. Unfortunately for Ritschl Barth, who was usually charitable to great theologians he did not agree with, unleashed an attack on Ritschl's theology and his school that caused Ritschl's star to gradually dim during the middle of the 20th century. Lately, however, there has been a revival of interest in Ritschl. The great Church historian, Alisdair McGrath, has noted that Ritschl's own review of the history of the Christian doctrine of justification and reconcilliation (the topic of the first volume or Ritschl's magnum opus) was simply the most learned and penetrating that has ever been produced, and other theologians have recently praised the rigour and power of Ritschl's own postive theologcal system, a system that is carefully unfolded and skillfully defended in this, the third volume, of Ritschl's vast work. One might not always agree with Ritschl's positions (I do not), but no intelligent reader can come away from a careful study of this, his masterpiece, without the impression that it deserves a place on the short list of truly great works of Christian dogmatics. Make no mistake, the Christian Church (or at least the liberal wing of it) simply cannot ignore the thought and scholariship of this 19th century master. It is a very good thing that his towering work, so long out of print, is once again available for readers who have the interest and intelligence to study it with the care it deserves."},{"Title":"Jeeves takes Charge","review":"Wodehouse's famous Jeeves and Wooster series comes to life wonderfully in this reading of Jeeves Takes Charge. The reader gives character and adds humour to Bertie and Jeeves that makes an outstanding addition to this fabulous collection of stories. Wodehouse's parody is constantly hilarious and the hijinks and faux pas Bertie find himself in get funnier all the time. Highly recommended for both the J&amp;W expert and novice."},{"Title":"Jeeves takes Charge","review":"If you do not know the Jeeves stories, you are in for a wonderful treat. If you do, your appreciation will grow with the witty reading in this unabridged audio cassette version.This is a series of short stories that make for nice listening and are just the right length for short car trips. I found myself sitting in front of the store or in my garage several times laughing and smiling as a story wound to a close. I think you will, too.Bertie Wooster is the narrator, and he is longer on connections and money than brains. Seldom out of bed before late morning, his idea of a busy afternoon is watching the cars go up and down Fifth Avenue from a window in his club. He is English, but is residing in the United States for many of these stories. These stories take place in the early part of the 20th century.But the hero of every story is Jeeves, his man (valet and butler). Jeeves is one of those brainy chaps who can always find a way. He tries to save Bertie from himself (especially when it comes to unsuitable fiancees and clothes), and always succeeds. Sometimes Bertie feels rebellious and indulges himself anyway in his taste for &quot;far out&quot; clothes or even a mustache. That can put a dent in their relationship, but Bertie always repents and does it Jeeves' way in the end.Bertie has two redeeming qualities. He loves to help his cronies, who are usually subsisting off some distant aunt or uncle or other. Disaster is always pending should such distant relative stop sending money or write the pal out of the will. In a flap, they come to Bertie for help. He summons Jeeves.The resulting schemes are always full of hilarious plot complications. Bertie may be off pretending to be someone else while the crony is in jail. Or Bertie may be loaning Jeeves, his apartment, and his clothes to someone else while Bertie unhappily skulks in a hotel room. He does his best to entertain a lot of very conservative people, whom he mostly alienates.Bertie's other redeeming quality is that he sincerely appreciates Jeeves. To which Jeeves replies, &quot;Thank you, Sir.&quot;This reading beautifully captures the flightiness of Bertie and the subtle nuances in Jeeves. You'll feel like you are in the room as unexpected events intervene, and you can't think of what to do any more than Bertie can. Thank God for Jeeves! The reading also makes wonderful use of the dated language and customs to give the listener a sense of a distance time. They become very charming in this context.After you finish enjoying these droll tales of witty satire, I suggest you think about all of the places where working together can achieve more. You may not be able to find Jeeves, but you may be able to accomplish more by allying with others whose strengths complement yours and fill in for some of your weaknesses.Top hole, old chap!P.S. I was also glad that the recording included a little about P.G. Wodehouse's espousal of the Nazi regime around the time of World War II, for which he became quite unpopular in England. Wodehouse eventually became a naturalized American citizen. The stories do not allude to facist causes or ideas, but even when reading popular fiction it is good to know all about the author's background. Some may wish to boycott the stories on principle, and I can't say I blame anyone who does."},{"Title":"Santa Ana (An Illustrated History)","review":"Diann Marsh is one of the best modern-era historians of Santa Ana history.

If you want to know about Santa Ana history, you'll want this book to start with."},{"Title":"Designing for the Homeless: Architecture That Works","review":"To my knowledge, this is the first book which addresses how architecture plays a key role in any long-term solution to the complicated urban phenomenon of homelessness. The author, an architect with deep experience in designing shelters and transitional housing, provides an explanation of how the \\"continuum of care\\" (from emergency shelters thru assisted housing) and the integration of services and community are the key factors in any solution. He then covers the practical difficulties involved in building or renovating structures for the various homeless populations, including why \\"low cost housing\\" ends up being a misnomer. The well-researched case studies of successful shelter and housing projects from around the country will help architects, service providers and municipal agencies with their own planning.This book packs a lot into a relatively short 145 pages (including a brief but cogent history of the problem), and I would recommend it as essential reading to anyone tasked with addressing homelessness in their own community. Architecture students interested in designing \\"real world\\" solutions would profit as well. They might well wish the illustrations were larger, but the black-and-white photos and drawings are helpful in udnerstanding the concepts and examples."},{"Title":"Designing for the Homeless: Architecture That Works","review":"There are a lot of good myth-busting facts in this book about homelessness.

These 81 poems are non-fiction, composed over 32 years, half his lifetime. They are based on extraordinary powers of observation, linked with a great skill in combining words, and the emotions and effects are wide ranging, including being remarkably blas&eacute;, to sweet-and-sad sentimentality, to life perspectives, to impressionism, to earthiness and shock. Among the topics are nature, art, poetry, naivet&eacute;, sex, gambling, alcohol, war, death, and love. This is not a poetry book you should plan to read from cover-to-cover in one sitting, but rather it should be waiting on your night-table, where you can ingest it in portions correct for your mood of the moment, and that you will savor, and reflect on, and dream about."},{"Title":"Universal Father: A Life of John Paul II","review":"This particular book was well researched. The author spent a great deal of time speaking to colleagues and family acquaintainces. The historical and personal accounts made this book a fast and very enjoyable read. I would recommend this book to everyone. This book is spiritually uplifting and provides the reader an insight to Poland."},{"Title":"Universal Father: A Life of John Paul II","review":"If you asked me \\"why are you writing this in the context of \`Book Review\\" about the late Pope, I wouldn't be able to answer you, because I don't know. I simply felt here is an extraordinary account of blessed faith on the one hand and plagued by questions over political acrimonies blended together to clone a \`man's world of power', on the other.Perhaps the latest comments made by his successor about \`Islam' prompted me to write this review.Such comments could have far reaching consequences if not handled with equanimity and self-restraint.Pope John Paul II: we are missing your equanimity and self-restraint.Unfortunately our planet is already full of mental and emotional instabilities from groups living in different and dissimilar countries that many will not accept, by their own interpretations, the statements recently made by Pope Benedict XVI after a speech about the concept of holy war.For instance, how will the \`large' Muslim communities in France, England, Germany and Holland (even in Italy) react to the Pope's statements? Notably by those too many who, after the second or third generations, could not mix.Nor could they have any sense of connection (speaking the language is not enough) with the local common tradition and usage so long established and became the force of practices followed by the \`real-ethnic-group' French, English, Germans, Dutch and Italians.In fact, on face value, I cannot see much of a rationale in the Pope's remarks.Why should it have come from the Holy See at all?By reasons intrinsic in their faith-and-glory filled history, coupled with feelings of disparity and local inequities, many Muslims in Europe and America are much given to ritual customs.On the basis of personal experience and perception, and for its very natural importance, this episode tends to be one of those moments in history for which no record, written journals or even first-person reportage should reasonably be able to describe the actual events that would soon be unfolding.The word \`soon' in history does not necessarily mean \`promptly or quickly'.\`Without hesitation' is, perhaps, more appropriate.This book about the late John Paul II may be the end of an era. No book has so far been written about the beginning of another."},{"Title":"Gilbert's Living with Art w.

I contacted Amazon and was told it was too late to cancel either order - that they were two seperate shipments but they would deduct the shipping charge.

It's in good condition and useful.But it is not specifically what I had in mind. Apparently there's another book by the same name but with a subtitle that says something like \\"for young people\\". That one contains more graphics, and it is what I was seeking."},{"Title":"What the Bible is All About","review":"I didn't care much for this book but have to say that that's probably because it didn't take the path I'd assumed it would.I picked it up thinking that it would be a somewhat disinterested look at theology, historical events and so on, and an even-handed look at Judaism and Christianity.It isn't. It's a book for believers, specifically, Christians, which is fine if that's what you want. The author, Henrietta C. Mears, is clear on her own beliefs and what she and the reader should believe. She's a little more fond of !!!!! than I care for, and there's a kind of a see?-I told-you-so kind of tone to it. Have you ever seen those bumper stickers that say something like, God Said It/I believe it/That's It! ?That's how this book reads. Now, having said that, here's the general direction of the book.Mears analyzes every book of the Bible. Every single chapter of her book starts out with the word Understanding, then names that book, from Genesis to Revelation. She reels off details and assessments of each book, with the underlying assumption that the reader agrees with what the Rev. Billy Graham says in the foreword to this book: \\"The Word of God is the only real authority we have.\\"So, for example, in her chapter on Genesis, she writes: Satan appears to have special enmity for the book of Genesis. No wonder the Adversary has bent his attacks upon it. It exposes him as the enemy of God and the deceiver of the human race; it foretells his destruction; it depicts his doom.\\" A few pages later, we get this sentence Remember, Jesus Christ is the center of the Bible.She also gives us such tidbits of information as this: there are 31,102 verses in the Bible, using 775,693 words*; Psalm 119 is the longest chapter; Psalm 117 the shortest. Ezra 7:21 contains all the letters of the alphabet except J (I don't know how well this fact stands up in translated versions and a conspiracy theorist could have a field day with the source J!); the longest book in the Old Testament is Psalms, the longest in the New Testament is Luke.This book is probably best used in an adult Christian education class or something similar. I don't see it helping much on an ecumenical or evangelical level. Perhaps it works as a self-education tool, for someone who's arrived at Christian belief and wants a wider understanding of the sense of the full Bible.*In English, I assume."},{"Title":"What the Bible is All About","review":"The cover was almost ripped off. I didn't see that in the description. The book returned on time,so I'm thankful for that."},{"Title":"What the Bible is All About","review":"Overall, the book is well presented and breaks down not just each book in the Bible, but also the topics or teachings from each book. I found it very thorough (though this is not to be confused with a Biblical history text) with enough information to keep perspectives of timelines and order of events in our history. Specifically, she explained very well the times of the prophets and possible relationships to one another. Mrs. Mears is clearly a dispensationalist regarding eschatology (study of the end times). Meaning, she believes that prophecy is interpreted in a specific way with which I disagree. I do not think this detracts from her Biblical knowledge or that she has a saving faith in any way; I just want potential readers to know this in advance that her book espouses a specific view of prophecy and the end times. I find the book very good and helpful overall."},{"Title":"What the Bible is All About","review":"I never found a book that was clearly descriptive to understanding the bible. Ms. Mears uses many examples in life that weaves the threads that formlate an exquisite pattern of bible times. There is more to just knowing things exist, but another to know how they relate.

Such fact attests that this book was divinely inspired. When one begins to read through the text, they'll sense that divine guidance!The book is &quot;a broad overview to help the reader see the Bible as a cohesive whole... how the books of the Bible fit together to form the entire Word of God.&quot;If you're a bible student, brand new to study or seasoned, this is one of those must-have study titles for your library. Mears systematically walks through the Scriptures, giving a history of the times covered in the writings, spiritual insights and interpretations into the text, and application for everyday living. Her easy writing manner and style lend an exquisite charm and engages the reader to have interaction with the scriptures being dissected and discussed.Not sure you should sit 'under' the teachings of a woman?

People of all faiths and no faith will find inspiration and insight in this marvelous book"},{"Title":"The Song of the Bird (#6 in Series VII: Pastoral)","review":"We meet this work and no way remains to urge its praises highly enough.Having wasted five stars on far lesser works, what meaning do five stars hold here? It is like making so many people saints these past decades, hand over fist, and now we encounter a true saint . . .Not five stars, but nine to the power of nine to the ninth power of stars, for this simple text.I really, really love this book, and am so very grateful to the late and very Reverend Father Anthony de Mello for having compiled her, and to the mainstream Roman Catholic Publishing House Image Books for having published it in 1984, with the 1981 Imprimatur of Bishop Gomes and Nihil Obstat of Jesuit Father Edwin Rasquinha.This is the one work to carry in your pilgrim pocket for the long journey ahead to peace, to enlightenment, to ultimate justice, to incarnating truly God's loving and merciful compassion, to the Omega point.But do not let me make this simple book too complicated, nor embarrass you from reading it with too high a praise.It's just that I really love this book. Does it show?During my canonical year in Solesmes in 1974 and 1975, I discovered the wonderful works of the prior there, Dom Lucien Regnault, who did heroic labors in compiling and translating the sayings of the early Christian Desert Fathers, and Mothers, contemplatives monks, hermits and nuns living in the Egyptian desert. Most of these works are now out of print, tragically, and no longer even found through the Solesmes website. We fortunately yet may find here upon the amazon hisThe Day-to-Day Life of the Desert Fathers In Fourth-Century Egypt: In Fourth-Century Egypt., but his collections of apophthegmes may simply gather dust upon some monastic shelf, such as those in our desert hermitage. This book reminds me strongly of those wonderful works, as each page bears a tale from various traditions which lead us to enlightenment, grace, peace and compassion.Consider this commentary by Father de Mello to one of the brief tales in which God is shown to be the friend of an infamous sinner. -God, the friend of a sinner! A statement as dangerous as it is effective. I tried it on myself once. I said, God is far too forgiving to condemn me. And I suddenly heard the Good News - for the first time in my life.We also meet this Sufi tale -A dead man suddenly came to life and began to pound on the lid of the coffin. The lid was raised. He man sat up. -What are you doing? he said to the assembled crowd. I am not dead! HIs words were met with silent disbelief. Finally one of the mourners said, 'Friend, both the doctors and the priests have certified you as dead. So dead you are.' And he was duly buried.We too are not dead. This book has power to return us to life in its fullness. Read this book until it falls apart in your hands, and grows in your heart. This is a great book, which I truly love.See as well the thoughts on the Samaritan woman, our first Christian preacher, and of course on Saint Ignatius Loyola. And please read as much as you can of this great and Reverend Father Anthony de Mello, if ever you should find that you feel you have actually finished this one book!

Sandra Burton who was with Ninoy during that flight provides us with first hand accounts of Ninoy's assassination, the failed coup that brought about People Power as well as Cory Aquino's presidency.More significant in this book was Burton's own take as history was unfolding. Particularly poignant is her analysis of the Filipino psyche. I came across these lines which described squabbling within the opposition ranks after the Aquino assassination in p. 314.\\"Both sides (Aquino and Laurel) knew unity was essential if they were hope to beat Marcos, yet neither could overcome its own prejudices or rise above its petty interests to compromise.

Lucy, a successful editor of a major publishing company was shocked when her seemingly normal husband, Larry, shoved the the tray of their Thanksgiving turkey off the table in front of their family members. She was even more shocked when she realized Larry's one New Year's resolution was to leave her. Lucy's sister, Miranda was dumped by her boyfriend Gabriel after she suggested that they might get married someday. Unable to accept Gabriel's decision, Miranda hoped that he will changed his mind. Christopher, Lucy's colleague, was recently dumped by his wife who left him for an older, richer man. Not to mention, Christopher had to share their only child, Ava, with his former wife's beau. The last individual, Roxy, left her husband to be on their wedding day and went to Manhattan (from Brooklyn) as she decided that she could not be the person her husband, family and friends wanted her to be; a suburban wife. All four decided to form the \\"Breakup Club\\" to share their problems and woes.This was an okay book as the individual stories were somewhat interesting. I think the whole idea of the \\"breakup club\\" was kind of lame and the author did not really expand on that. As this is not the author's first attempt at a novel, the writing was quite good and the pace of the book was fast, so there aren't many slow, and uninteresting moments.

I was a little disappointed by this book though. It didn't quite meet my expectations compared to her previous books. One thing about this book that I think didn't particularly work was that it's the views of four different people. If it was just one person it might have been better."},{"Title":"The Breakup Club (Red Dress Ink Novels)","review":"Breaking up is the catalyst that will transform the lives for four people. Lucy Miller-Materson finds that her husband, who has recently flipped out in front of their family, has made one New Year's resolution, to leave her. Her sister's life of serial monogamy's most recent break up has left Miranda with many regrets, and what if's. Miranda's new room-mate and the girl Lucy has recently hired as an assitant, Roxy, walked out of her own wedding, and Christopher, the single father competing with Lucy for a promotion, faces the challenges of being a noncustodial dad on a daily basis.Told from each of their points of view, this story often seems very disjointed. However, the fact that each does manage to make a comeback from disaster is noteworthy. Yet, a cleaner ending without more resolution would have been appreciated.Amanda Killgore"},{"Title":"The Breakup Club (Red Dress Ink Novels)","review":"The Breakup Club by Melissa Senate is one of those novels that is told from multiple viewpoints. The interesting and unique thing about this book, however, is that a lot attention and detail is given to each chapter, and each viewpoint is told from a first-person narrative.The key characters are: Lucy, mother of a preteen who is happily married until she discovers her husband is planning to leave her for New Year's; Roxy, a woman who hops a train to Manhattan after leaving her fiance at the alter; Christopher, a single father who has to deal with the crazy playground-mommies and fighting for custody of his baby; and Miranda, Lucy's younger sister who seems to only get dumped time and time again and can't figure out what she is doing wrong. (And is waiting for her ex-boyfriend to crawl back to her).The Breakup Club deals with heartbreak, and what happens to the heartbroken ones once they've been dumped. In each of the characters, Melissa Senate explores the various scenarios that can take place. Miranda has to go through pining for her ex-boyfriend who has clearly moved on with another woman. Lucy has to deal with her husband of 10+ years deserting her, while trying to placate her very angry and upset daughter. Roxy must decide if her ex-fiance, who is determined to win her back, is truly the right guy for her since he seems to care so much for her. Christopher has to put his life together being a single father while fending off one of his neighbors.I loved this novel and how it explored so many angles of heartbreak and moving on. Despite there being four characters and four viewpoints, Melissa Senate managed to give them all enough time so their stories were well-developed. Having a male character in there was also fascinating. This novel was funny, touching and down-to-earth all at once. I really couldn't find a thing in it that I didn't enjoy! There is a touch of both single city-girl lit as well as marriage lit and mom lit.Overall, I highly recommend The Breakup Club to all Melissa Senate fans, and to anyone who enjoys a truly good novel."},{"Title":"The Breakup Club (Red Dress Ink Novels)","review":"I really think that Melissa Senate is one of Red Dress Ink's best writers, so this book was disappointing. On the plus side, I really enjoyed the story and -- real love and real loss, and, as a refreshing change, the longevity of romantic love, as opposed to the theme that tells women that if you can just find your prince, everything else will fall into place. The people in this story are all trying to figure out what it means to be in love and stay in love -- and to fall out of love. In that way, this is perhaps one of the more substantive chick lit love stories out there.On the other hand, the writing is rushed and sometimes too superficial. The plot has everything necessary to go just a step or two deeper, but does not follow through. Why did Larry really leave his wife? Other than missing his wife, how did Chris feel about her decision to leave him? The real motives and emotions seem to be skipped over. And some parts of the plot seemed to get skipped over too. For example, it just seemed that all of the sudden Roxy was a brunette, and I thought maybe I had skipped a page. I hadn't -- there was no paragraph explaining that she had changed her hair color and her clothes, or why. I actually think that Roxy's conflict could have carried the whole novel -- her family, her search for herself were really compelling, and seemed to steal the show.Overall, a fun read, and it walks the line between fun, light reading and thoughtful, insightful romance. I'll still read whatver Senate writes next. I think that this will also make a good movie, like See Jane Date."},{"Title":"The Breakup Club (Red Dress Ink Novels)","review":"I always enjoy Melissa Senate's books, and The Breakup Club was no different. Once again Senate brings us characters and situations you can't help but be drawn in to. Her writing style keeps the story going so you're never bored, and the ending is always worth waiting for."},{"Title":"The Breakup Club (Red Dress Ink Novels)","review":"Meet Christopher, Lucy, Lucy's sister Miranda and Roxy. Each has experienced some type of breakup in their relationship. They form the Breakup Club as a way to help each other cope. I liked that the author allowed each character to have his or her own chapter. What disappointed me was the ending. It was to open-ended and I wasn't sure where the characters were in their lives after the breakup. I immediately thought the author purposely did that as a way to continue the stories of this group of friends."},{"Title":"The Breakup Club (Red Dress Ink Novels)","review":"Pros: I read other reviews and I was amazed that anybody could possibly NOT like this book. I thought it was fabulous! The only Red Ink books I'd read were by Lynn Messina and from that alone, I realized that I might like this publishing line a lot. It's always interesting to read about people my age who are trying to figure out their career, their future, their family, etc. so I connected with Roxy the most, who absolutely did not want to fall into the normal \\"marriage/kids/cooking/gossiping with female relatives.\\" It entertained me that she was the \\"guy\\" in the relationship, because I'm usually accused of the same thing. I thought Christopher's character was interesting because it is so rare to read a story about a single dad whose wife left HIM behind, and who is turning women down instead of humping everybody. I thought Lucy was a realistic portrayal of how a married woman acts when her husband is a lunatic, without being stereotypically desperate. Miranda couldn't have been more different from me, but she reminded me of friends I've had over the years, who are constantly chasing love. Basically the book is about four people who have either been the broker-upper or the brokee-upper, and how they deal with each of their situations. I liked how the story was told from different perspectives so we got the chance to learn more about each charactersCons: It seemed like everybody in this book looked alike, minus Roxy when she died her hair. Blonde hair and blue eyes throughout the whole novel--no variation. With all of these different characters, I'd have been content if the characters had more stand-out features."},{"Title":"The Breakup Club (Red Dress Ink Novels)","review":"The Break Up Club is 4 people who work at the same company who find themselves single and start a support system to get themselves threw it.Lucy has been married for 12 years and has a 12 year old daughter.

Many of the characters outside of the 5 main characters were disgusting, rude and downright evil yet NOBODY cussed them out. I didn't understand why they were swallowing such hateful behaviour. Lucy's husband Larry was childish and immature and the second time he asked her to take care of Amelia's emotional needs while he ducked responsibility, Lucy should have told him off. Yet she didn't.Miranda took abuse from her ex-boyfriend's GIRLFRIEND and then some so called friend whose wedding she was ousted from for no real reason. Yet again, Miranda shows up at the wedding and the bride is disgusting to her even then. Why were they friends in the first place?Christopher should have called a lawyer the first time Jodie freaked out at him but he still let her boss him around in the meanest possible way. I understand that his motivation was to stay connected to his daughter but he is the father, he could tell the wife to stop bossing him around. And then the turn around after her new boyfriend asks to adopt his daughter was ridiculous. It just didn't hold up.The only storyline that seemed to make a little bit of sense was Roxy's. I wish the book was about her. I liked the other characters but I didn't like how they behaved or let others talk to them. The book felt disjointed. I didn't believe that they needed a Breakup club. That seemed like a last minute way to connect all the stories. Then the ending was too pact and I didn't feel like much was resolved. None of the characters (except Roxy) grew or changed or learned anything from their experiences. They just went on with their lives.The characters deserved better.I really wanted to like this book but I just flat out didn't."},{"Title":"The Breakup Club (Red Dress Ink Novels)","review":"I thought the book was pretty good.

It's one of those books where each chapter is dedicated to a different character in the book... so you are constantly switching back and forth between each person's life, and then from time to time, their paths cross and you see how they relate to one another. I liked it. I was entertained by all of the characters' stories. I probably liked Roxy's and Chris's storylines the best."},{"Title":"The Breakup Club (Red Dress Ink Novels)","review":"I am usually a fan of this author. However, I am giving this book three stars because it is not up to par with her last book, at all.The premise of The Breakup Club is fairly standard chick lit stuff. While the story is midly entertaining, I felt as though some pages just dragged and dragged. For example, the opening chapter in which the author sets up the entire premise (yes, I agree it is important) but she just went on and on describing in minute details the Thanksgiving scene.There were too many exchanges describing \\"lifted eyebrows\\" and \\"food being removed from clothing\\".So, basically, this is not a horrible book, but it is way too slow.I have mentioned this in the past.

I don't usually go for the photo gift book, but this is like nothing I've ever seen. Each photo captures some wonderful moment of the French landscape, whether it be a natural or built one. I loved the way Krohn understands the color and shapes of any one of his photographs-they really become a bit like abstract paintings at times. The section of quotations by a variety of authors (from Robert Stevenson to MFK Fisher) placed at the start of the book is a wonderful treat. A perfect book for the holiday season."},{"Title":"In the South of France (Imago Mundi Book)","review":"Photographer Don Krohn's rich palette and unique vision are highlights of this volume. From abstract landscapes to witty village scenes, he reveals an intimate knowledge of this legendary place. His preface demonstrates a sweeping knowledge of the history of Provence and also reveals something of how an artist approaches a new subject. His generous selection of quotes by various artists and authors adds to our appreciation of the many qualities of this beautiful spot. A great gift or mini-vacation for the coffee table."},{"Title":"In the South of France (Imago Mundi Book)","review":"In the South of France, by Don Krohn, is so much more than a book of beautiful photographs. I was drawn into the book by the luscious color plates, eager to see what this famous land - the south of France - looked like. Page after page, rolling sunlit landscapes and intimate private moments delighted my painter's eye and wanderlust! But upon entering into the narrative that accompanies the photographs, I became enthralled with a sense of the day-to-day life there as it was revealed in the pages, and I found many passages that went from poetic to descriptive to profound. I had a lot to ponder as I again meandered through the photographs, choosing a few favorites that still beckon me to the south of France.

With _Five Doubts_ she has nuzzled herself a spot among the contemporary greats.

Buy this intoxicating book. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Five Doubts","review":"Another wonderfully imaginative collection from Mary Caponegro. Caponegro's stories recall the work of Robert Coover and Italo Calvino, while she creates an entirely unique literary voice. It is fiction, poetry, art... it is &quot;poetics.&quot;"},{"Title":"Five Doubts","review":"Five Doubts, Mary Caponegro's latest book, contains five complex and powerful pieces, unconnected narratively, but interdependent in subject, technique, and theme. Each piece is inspired by a different work of Italian visual art from a variety of time periods, Etruscan to the present, and each inspiring doubts--many more than five--about art, culture, truth, life, and death. &quot;Il Libro dell'Arte&quot; takes us inside a Verrochio painting where the seeming abundance of vegetable and animal life serves only an artist's programmatic attempts to make his art a mirror of the world while his real opportunities for living are ignored and lost. &quot;The Spectacle,&quot; based on a mosaic depicting a Roman entertainment, shifts focalization from individual members of the crowd to the animals on display, breaking down the boundaries between spectators and spectacle. &quot;Tombola&quot; uses the form and illustrations of a game board to collapse the past and future of one man's life and introduces translated passages from popular Italian magazines to collapse the distinction between the individual and the surrounding culture. &quot;An Etruscan Catechism&quot; takes illustrations from a tomb painting and the catechism form to explore truth and doubt and the deaths of individuals and cultures. Finally, &quot;Doubt Uncertainty Possibility Desire&quot; (a title suggested by the Italian subjunctive mood) juxtaposes passages from Leonardo da Vinci's notebooks, passages from contemporary works on virtual reality, medical technology, cancer, and AIDS, and fictional narration by Salai, one of da Vinci's apprentices, to bring together ideas on love, the body, and illness, and most important, to suggest connections between life and art far more significant and vital than those lampooned in the first story. Caponegro's writing is intelligent, exciting, moving, and always surprising; it combines a keen awareness of the postmodern challenges to narrative fiction with a profound sense of art's ability to speak to human conditions.

McLaughlin, The Review of Contemporary Fiction)"},{"Title":"The glad season;: Boyhood in the Cariboo of British Columbia","review":"Juvenile fiction about a child whose parents had died and who went to live with relatives in the frozen north (British Colombia).

In focus we find the warrior monk Jebu, who serves the Muramoto samurais and who loves lady Taniko of the Takashi, Muratomos' enemies. Forced into exile the Muratomo get involved in the mongolian army's invasion of China. After their return to Japan Jebu later on plays a crucial part in the defence against Kublai's fleet. But this is of lesser importance; what is most important is his relation with lady Taniko, who is married away with an old nobility. The story takes many turns and there is a lot of tragedy in it, as the different characters are often forced to endure great ordeals and miseries -but also victories. The book also describes the old Ninja order (not the black-clad assassins you see on TV) that was dissolved in the 13th century; their monestaries, training and philosophy. A diversed book indeed, and one that I recommend with warmth."},{"Title":"Shike: Time of the Dragons","review":"Jebu, warrior monk, fated to fall in love at 17.

It's hardly a coincidence, that the second book of the author is also targeted at the professionals, or, to be specific, professional traders who can enjoy systemized training/mentoring offered by their institutions. For traders like me who dont have such priviledges, nearly half of it became quite irrelevant and remote.

He and I became aquainted through my editorial work with Trade2Win. When my book was near completion, I asked Brett to give it a look knowing that he was involved in trader training and development. The forword followed from that.Brett's new book, Enhancing Trader Performance, is his second, following on the heels of his extremely successful and worthwhile initial release, The Psychology of Trading. I would not, though, call it a sequel. While the latter part of the new work does bring in major elements of what the first book covered, the majority of it has a quite different focusEnhancing Trader Performance is primarily about developing trading expertise. As someone who has spent his fair share of time teaching and coaching on a variety of levels and in different theaters of pursuit, some of which were extremely competitive and performance oriented, I was immediately grabbed by Brett's presentation. And it never let me go - literally pages of notes later.This book may not be for everyone. It clearly has a bias which leans more toward the full-time and/or short-term trader than someone who traders longer-term and/or on a more part-time basis. This is a natural function of Brett's work helping professional traders with their development and to overcome performance hurdles, along with his own personal efforts in the market, which are short-term in nature as well.That said, there is still a ton of extremely useful material for any trader, new or experienced. Enhancing Trader Performance provides a sort of roadmap toward developing trading expertise. This isn't about the mental part of actually making trades and managing positions. Rather it is more a discussion of how one becomes more than just a competent trader.Coaching is a major theme, with Brett clearly being a proponent of traders having coaches who can assist them in their development similar to the way they would an athlete. I personally tend to disagree with the way he uses \\"coach\\" and \\"mentor\\" interchangably as I consider the two to be different, but that does not detract from the overall message. Importantly, since it can be difficult for the individual trader to get in to a good coaching relationship, Brett shares plenty of tips and advice for how a trader can be their own coach.The one major carryover from The Psychology of Trading is the use of the stories of actual people - either real or composite. They really help to drive home the points Brett is making, and in a fashion easily relatable by the reader.In short, read this book if it is at all your objective to excel at trading. More than that, take your time and really absorb it. Read it once, then read it again. I know I will."},{"Title":"Enhancing Trader Performance Proven Strategies from the Cutting Edge of Trading Psychology","review":"The key point in this book is that expertise is different from competence. This is obvious, but you will still learn from this book. Brett provides references to elite sports research as well as examples from daytraders. Since Brett is bridging two worlds he can add something very unique.How does this book compare to his earlierThe Psychology of Trading: Tools and Techniques for Minding the Markets? That book was focused on emotions and trading. The current book focuses on learning and trading. If you sometimes get emotional in front of the sceen, I would recommend that you start by reading the first book. If you like it, then you can also read this book.Personally I find that Brett is hammering on the same point a bit too much in the second book. The point is useful, but not sufficient for five stars. Still it is a helpful book.Finally, if you are looking for anything like a quick solution, you will find this book useless. The book asks certain questions relating to yourself that you need to think about. If you follow Brett's advice you are in for a lot of work.I have written several short reviews on trading books. The best way is to compare the score on the books I've read. Many reviews on amazon.com are just glorious 5 star reviews. I use all five categories; sorry but everything isn't \\"great\\". Books rated 5 are very good. Books rated 4 are good solid books well worth reading. Books rated 3 can be bought by some people who read a lot or have very specific needs. Books rated 1 or 2 I would not recommend buying or reading. Naturally all in my humble opinion."},{"Title":"Enhancing Trader Performance Proven Strategies from the Cutting Edge of Trading Psychology","review":"Greatest StrengthsThe greatest strength of this work is the authoritative combination of theory and practice. Dr. Brett draws upon a body of theoretical literature showing a logical progression from building competence, moving from competence to expertise, and using that expertise to become successful. It is the whole package presented by a great writer who understands the theory.Unlike many works where the strictly academic approach renders them inaccessible to most readers, this book is fun. Each theoretical step is salted with examples from those who have achieved great success by implementing the principles. The reader learns about how noted athletic performers like Dan Gable, Wayne Gretzky, Muhammad Ali, and Lance Armstrong employed the specific methods described. This does not mean, of course, that these athletes had all read the relevant literature. Instead, they learned or developed key methods on their own. Nonetheless, their success demonstrates the power of the theories.For traders, another great strength of the book is the application of theory to practice. Because of his personal work in observing and helping traders with their problems and methods, Brett's writing really comes to life. Anyone has done some trading will recognize the characters in themselves or someone they know. Any trader has experience many of the same foibles as the featured characters, who are all real traders. The reality of the examples gives the lessons and advice the ring of authenticity.Wider ApplicationsWhile the book is aimed at a trading audience, it is quite useful for anyone engaged in competitive activity where performance is measured. This is not just about trading. Those competing in athletics or games of the mind will find the work most helpful. Our own experience involves competing and coaching people in competitive activities like bridge, backgammon, chess, sports handicapping, poker, and debate. Nearly every chapter has lessons for those striving for success in these fields.An Important LessonThere are also important lessons for the individual investor. So much of today's marketing makes it seem easy for anyone to beat the market. Enhancing Trader Performance shows that learning the key lessons to become successful is hard work. It requires a level of commitment that many would not have. It is better to know this before starting, than to learn the hard way.SummaryBriefly put, this is a must-read for traders and for system developers. It is also recommended for those engaged in any competitive activity. Finally, it is useful for individual investors. Taking the time to understand the problems faced by top traders is the first step. Those unwilling to make the time commitment to read and learn are unlikely to achieve long-run success. Read this book first!"},{"Title":"Enhancing Trader Performance Proven Strategies from the Cutting Edge of Trading Psychology","review":"As a former professor of mathematics and futures trader for the past 25 years, I would strongly recommend this book to anyone considering trading on either a part-time or full-time basis. Most people assume that the way to make trading profitable is to find the right trading model. In my own experience, pyschology contributes 60 percent to the outcome, money management 20 percent, and one's approach or model 20 percent. Get any one of the three wrong and you will lose, but concentrate first on trading psychology. Brett Steenbarger does a masterful job of teaching the willing student much that is crucial to successful trading. I would rate this as one of the ten best books on trading for people with any level of experience."},{"Title":"Enhancing Trader Performance Proven Strategies from the Cutting Edge of Trading Psychology","review":"I would with out a doubt rank this book in the top ten most helpful trading books I have read. (I have read over 130 books on trading). This book is on trading psychology, written by a Clinical Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences who also trades his own account. It is a look at the winning psychology of top performers in all fields, art, sports, business, chess, music, and others. He delves into the fascinating study conducted that shows that what separates competent performers from the best performers is time spent in focused practice with feedback that enables the performer to adjust to be more successful. Studies show that 10,000 hours of correct training with proper form and helpful feedback leads to mastery. Usually this takes ten years, very bad news for those that want to trade for a living next week. However, the book shows how it is possible to short cut this rule if you watch the market intensely every day, day trade a tremendous amount for experience (only if your style is day trading),or you can incorporate similar skills for trading that you may have from other fields.I like that the book explains that you must have a trading style that fits your personality and talents. He advises trying all styles to see which one clicks for you. If you grow bored with analyzing fundamentals and sitting on positions for months, then you may need to be a day trader or swing trader. If day trading stresses you out and you have trouble making quick decisions you may be a position trader in the wrong style.The author discusses how traders may traumatize themselves by trading before they are ready. Or trading with to big of a position, this can scar you whether you win or lose because of the level of stress you are under. The book discusses how markets are continually changing and traders must change with it. Whether keeping their trading style and finding a different trading vehicle or changing their style to match the overall market, it is psychologically tough for a successful experienced trader to become a beginner again and retool their trading methods.The book's best material is its dive into why discipline breaks down and a trader just starts trading crazy either trying to get back their losses or because of arrogance after many consecutive winning trades. This book really goes into the mind of the trader and where bad behaviors come from and what to do to change them. It also profiles hugely successful traders that make millions or six figure incomes. That was very informative seeing that the best are human just like us but have a consuming passion for trading and they rage to master their skills in the greatest game on earth. I highly recommend this is THE book on trading psychology and a must have for any serious trader, even the most experienced professionals."},{"Title":"Enhancing Trader Performance Proven Strategies from the Cutting Edge of Trading Psychology","review":"Great for beginner and advanced traders.

I loved the author his writing style, his insights on how or psychology reacts on trading, the numerous stories of his counseling conversations, his trading experiences, ...I started reading this book with similar expectations. The beginning part was still quite promising, but after being on page 100 I still had the feeling he didn't go toward his point. He kept hammering on the importance of learning, learning experience, being motivated, analyzing your own actions/feelings, ... Also something I found irritating were all those examples and comparisons with sport examples and highly trained athletes. Most of those examples didn't help me at all, I just didn't see the similarities with my own trading.After reading this book I don't think I'm better at counseling myself, nor will I be a more disciplined trader. Nor did I read a lot of advanced stuff on psychology.

But it has one major flaw.At one point it says \\"competence precedes confidence: winning mind-sets result from mastery, not the reverse.\\"I will quote Albert Bandura:\\"When experience contradicts firmly held beliefs of weak efficacy, people resist changing their views of themselves if they can find grounds to discount the diagnostic value of the success experience. In such instances, producing enduring, generalized changes in personal efficacy requires powerful confirmatory experiences in which people successfully manage, under diverse conditions, task demands that far exceed those commonly encountered in their daily lives. (...) As they gain increasing ability to predict and manage potential threats, they develop a robust sense of efficacy that serves them well in mastering new challenges.\\"Does it sound similar or richer?One is surprised to see how the author completely ignores the remarkable and mainstream research on human performance set by Professor Albert Bandura of Stanford University, in special his self-efficacy theory. In a book dedicated to enhancing human performance, this is a great void. The book, its theories and ideas, would enormously benefit from the very active and solid research done on bandura's self-efficacy, a vast body of research that has in itself defined a new field in human performance research.It is an irony, but you can find Bandura in so many places in this book, yet Bandura's work is never acknowledged!The author does not seem to be entirely familiar with the current research in human performance and competency, despite the fact that he is (or was) an academic.From the point of view of self-efficacy theory, some ideas in the book actually show a weak side and a certain distored view of human performance achievements: contrary to what is stated above, very often perceived self-efficacy precedes competence!Albert Bandura's excellent book \\"Self-Efficacy: The Exercise of Control\\" is highly recommended. Bandura's book is supported by the citation of 47 pages of references, a large body of research and study on human performance under different situations.It is certainly a shame. Add Bandura's theory to this book and all the ingredients could be there: you might have an outstanding book destined to become a classic.To write a book on human performance and to ignore Bandura's work is somewhat similar to write a book on quantum mechanics and to ignore Bohr's or Heisenberg's work. Or to write a book on the stock market and to ignore Wall Street.Enactive mastery experience, sources of discordance between efficacy judgment and action, multidimensionality of self-efficacy belief systems, self-affirmation versus self-deception. Bandura's work is a major achievement that readers of this book can't benefit from.Hopefully the author will bring a revised edition with the due changes. Until then, this book suffers from major flaws and you should read Bandura's work for a better understanding of human, including trading, performance.This difference can cost you a whole lot of money."},{"Title":"Enhancing Trader Performance Proven Strategies from the Cutting Edge of Trading Psychology","review":"1.

This isn't theory in the sense of being useless insights and suggestions, though, but theory in the way that a trader needs to learn about how different securities work before trading them. From this roadmap one could construct a sort of trading curriculum that would help the trader to continually enhance their performance. I write that it's not for beginners because one of Dr. Steenbarger's primary insights is that a trader needs to find his/her niche and 'fall in love' with trading before beginning to worry about enhancing performance. For serious traders, I would say this is a 'must-have' to add to your library."},{"Title":"Enhancing Trader Performance Proven Strategies from the Cutting Edge of Trading Psychology","review":"I read Brett Steenbarger's book \\"Enhancing Trader Performance\\" with mixed emotions. After having read the first ten pages I wanted to return it to Amazon for a refund. On the first pages the author describes two traders, Al and Mick. Al was emotionally balanced, honored his stops, and did not become irate at losses. Mick was not balanced, took losses as personal affronts, and violated his risk management guidelines. Yet Steenbarger tells us that Mick was the better trader which is contrary to what all other trading psychologists tell us, and contrary to what experience tells me.Well, I hung in there, and after the first pages the book covered the importance of finding one's trading niche. You need to discover your niche, the trading style you feel comfortable with, in order to be successful. This makes sense, and this I fully subscribe to.The next 150 pages are interesting from the psychology side and they might even help you be successful in general life, but they are only of limited value to a trader. He gives examples of a wrestling coach (Dan Gable), a cyclist (Lance Armstrong), elite troops, and excellent chess players, and describes how they improve their performance. In my opinion, these comparisons are not valid. Drilling exercises are useful in sports and the military where you do the same movement over and over again, but not in trading. The problem in trading is not the mouse clicks, the problem is the mind. Even chess is not a good comparison because in chess there are no feelings like fear or greed involved which are the two main human drivers in the markets.The chapters on cognitive techniques and behavioural techniques for enhancing performance are somewhat useful again for traders as is the afterword with the biography of a trader.I was swaying between giving the book three or fours stars. Three stars would be justified because the book is not fully relevant for traders, it is tough to read, and it is printed on cheap looking yellow paper (especially considering the price of the book). In the end I gave it four stars because it is well written (demanding which at the same time makes it tough to read), and it has what you can expect of a good book: A conclusion, a summary, a bibliography, and a list of valuable internet resources."},{"Title":"Enhancing Trader Performance Proven Strategies from the Cutting Edge of Trading Psychology","review":"Finally abook about trading that expresses the thought that you should consider the trading method that suits you ..... not try and fit into a trading method.

What's amazing is that his analysis holds up after 100 years. Wilson believed that &quot;separation of powers&quot; did not exist, and that the building impenetrable walls between the Executive, Legislative, and Judicial branches produced abdication of responsbility. Wilson held up as a model the Westminster cabinet form of government as a model of clarity, openness, and responsibility. You can read Wilson's 1884 pages as if he wrote them today. The style is pure Victorian -- run-on sentences galore -- but the analysis is rapier-sharp. My opinion -- get this book, and have your mind changed. You will never see American government the same way again.PATRICK McGRATH The Campaign for Responsible Government Stony Point, NY"},{"Title":"Congressional government;: A study in American politics,","review":"This book is a classic. As a young academic with a keen interest in national politics, but without any experience, Wilson critiques the American governmental structure on a number of points, examines all of the branches (except judicial), the inner workings and character of each branch, and their inter-workings. Wilson is mostly critical of the system's deficiencies and has few words of praise for Constitutional government. Instead, his ideal model is the British system, with which he is constantly comparing the American. He also touches on the model of French government to provide a broader basis of comparison. The world's other great model Republic, Switzerland, is given passing mention. A broader discussion of the diversity of foreign models, including more discussion of the brilliant Swiss federal system, but also including the German system, would have added much to this book.Wilson's principal complaints with the shortcomings of American government can be summed up with one word: disjoint. He states that there is no structure in the Congress that can be described as \\"leadership\\" in British sense, meaning that even the nominal \\"leaders\\" of the parties cannot claim to speak for the rank-and-file members, who may act on their own initiative, through committees, in the process of drafting legislation (instead of having legislation crafted by a central administration and having members vote or reject it). The result is that there is no cohesive policy, as the various committees draft legislation within their own domains that in the end can be contradictory or mutually abrasive.Wilson also states that there is disjoint between the executive and Congress, largely due to the executive being independent from the legislature. This is almost unique to the American system; in most systems, the functions of administering law are subordinate to those of making law. The independent executive leads to a disconnection between the making of law and the making of policy, which makes forming a cohesive policy quite difficult.Wilson offers more such examples of disjoint in the American government, including the disconnect between those who decide how to tax and those who decide how to spend, but the logic is similar. If one extends the line of Wilson's thinking, the implication is simple: the concept of checks and balances in our Constitution has been a failure. This conclusion harkens back to the spirit of Centinel, who in 1789 condemned checks and balances as snake oil, contending that human intellect is not equal to the task of checking the various interests through an elaborate counterbalancing system. A more effective alternative would be a simple and transparent system (the American system is not transparent but quite obfuscated) in which any attentive observer could determine the chain of events that produces results, and act directly to indicate his approval or dissent of that result. In contrast, Wilson states that in the American system, \\"the voter has no way of knowing how his ballot can any effect on the government or policy, even an infinitesimal one.\\" Wilson's thesis is similar to Centinel's sentiment in his famous letters.Noticeably absent from Wilson's dissertation is any mention of the judiciary (typically presented at the most basic educational level as one of three coequal branches), which in the United States, takes a role in crafting policy through the concepts of judicial review and the setting of precedents that are similar to legislation in effect. One may conclude that this absence is because the judicial branch has only become so prominent in the 20th century, but such a conclusion would be misinformed; the Supreme Court has been crucial to policy in America, since John Marshall. The absence of the judicial branch in this analysis is a minor deficiency, but an intelligent reader should be able to extend Wilson's logic of disjoint to the judicial branch. Nonetheless, it would have been interesting to see his thoughts on the matter.In all, this book is quite informative, insightful, and worth reading. On a lighter level, it is interesting to see how some of Wilson's observations on government hold just as true 125 years later, and to see how some that he states as essential have come to change."},{"Title":"Congressional government;: A study in American politics,","review":"To correct the previous reviewer - Wilson did not think separation of power didn't exist, but that in reality they shouldn't exist. If you favor a historicist government unlimited in size and scope, and reject the universal truths espoused in the Declaration of Independence, then this is your book and Wilson is your man."},{"Title":"Margaret Ogilvy (The works of J.M.

The gaming spectacle of blood theatre playingout in the style of an ancient roman Colosseum arena with gladiators, but now elegant sportsmen fighting animals to the death, is brought out in modern times to its raw and brash honesty as an echoing from the past. In this post dark ages blood sport a tragedy plays out in the bullfight, metaphysically representing the first time in history a dismounted man came face to face with a blood drunk king of beasts at the top of the animal kingdom, one that had only furious jungle murder in its sights.When I first began reading this book, I found myself becoming stuck in the first chapter, reading and re-reading it, until I had to make a decision whether or not to continue with it or put it down, indeed I find this sport inhumane and yet tantalizing on many levels, primarily because Hemingway's writing style has a way of bringing you down to cold reality in touch with that lucid and unforgiving matter of fact universal cosmos that seems to manifest itself in us - you and me - as nothing more than dances of birth, blossoming, and death, all of it mortality repeated forever and ever in the context of an echoing and rhyming immortality.There is a distinctly Judeo-Christian paradigm to this triumph over uncertain danger by man in this sometimes contrived flamenco dance of death between the flamboyantly dressed killer and wild beast, reflected in its bravura and sometimes cowardice of individual men, but in the triumph as sword plunges into the bull's jugular vein, mankind ascends upward in his own evolution as a species. The death of the beast enables civilization to occur as the Judaism-Christian God intended man to have dominion over all animals as stated in Genesis and practiced philosophically by these this religious symbiosis. In a clear sense then, to fail in a bullfight is to fail God in a devout Christian society. When a Matador is gored in the arena, killed, fully disabled or minorly injured, the crowds often turn against him as if he were a cowardly heretic.A symbolic transformation occurs after the matador kills the bull, he becomes more than a man and less than a god, representing the turning point when mankind ascends to the highest rank over the untamed world, that is when he conquers -- without strength, but intellect and ballet elegance -- the king of aggressive big game beasts with its two big thickly solid and razer pointed horns, attached to a testosterone surging 1500 lbs tank of raging-rippling muscles on galloping hooves. With blood lusting dark eyes, snot spray and a thick neck that is physically stronger than an Olympic powerlifter, the beast now charging you at full speed with its head down for the undivided intention of cracking off its invincible horns in your chest and skull cavities, zigzagging them and breaking you up like a clay flower pot (H, 1932) packed with dark soil and blooming red flowers - then tossing your corps in the air like a swinging-spinning rag doll. This is how fast this choreographed drama can change on a dime as the stadium crowd goes berserk, jumping into the arena en mass, police out numbered, the bull is ripped apart savagely by rioting mobs, as it sadly falls to its humble knees. It is here we learn the truth as mankind descends, returning to the subhuman and uncivilized animal kingdom."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"A lot of times people end up hating something because they cant understand it.

I can imagine no book being a more thorough explanation of the tradition of bullfighting and a discussion of the men and animals which are brought together in the ring.Hemingway is here too, with his thoughts on death, writing, and life; wine and women. He pours disdain on the cowards of the ring and shows his love of life and the bravery of the great bulls and the men who understand them. The book transcends its subject in the hands of this master."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"One of my favorite pieces of writing--by Hemingway or anyone else--is the last chapter of Death in the Afternoon, where Hem laments all the things about Spain that are NOT in the book. And then, in naming those things, he creates a fantastic mosaic of keenly observed, beautifully described aspects of Spain. You don't even have to read the rest of the book or care about bullfighting."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"Hemingway was young when he wrote this, about 30. However, he would have had to be a man of 70 who had devoted his entire life to bullfighting to have written this in the way he would have wanted us to believe.He had lots of help. The book is chockablock with bullfighting history, and Ernie would have us think he was there during most of it. Sure, that's a bit of an exaggeration. But he had others weigh in with information in this book, which is okay. But believe it.Now the bullfight:Three matadors per afternoon. Each matador faces two bulls. So, that makes six fights.There are three acts to a bullfight.1. After the bull charges into the ring, he faces the picadors, the guys on horseback with short-tipped lances. They are short-tipped because they are not for killing but for injuring and weakening the bull, softening him up, so to speak.In olden times, the horses were routinely gutted by the bulls, leaving them stumbling around, trailing their guts. Yuck. That was ugly, and they finally quit doing that. Now the horses wear padding. No more guts.2. After the picadors, the bulls must face the banderillas, which are shorter sticks, also with points, which are stuck in the bull's back in pairs by somebody on foot. This is a tricky operation, and it serves about the same purpose as the pics, to wear down the bull.The matador may place the banderillas, or may have underpaid helpers do it.Wearing down the bull is good for the matador because these bulls are nasty customers. They are not simply big domestic bulls. They are fairly wild animals, or they were in Hemingway's day and before. Today? Who knows?The female of the bullfighting bull hardly has a visible udder, which may go to explain in part the hellacious disposition of their husbands.3. Okay, so now the bull is getting a little winded and disappointed because the fight is not going his way. Let's kill him.The matador does this on foot with the cape in his left hand (usually) and the sword in the other. He misleads the bull with the cape, perhaps with some flourishes to make himself look good up in the stands, and while the bull zips by, he sticks the sword into his back, severing his spinal cord or aorta.The bull doesn't last much longer.This happens in an ideal world. What really happens can get messy, especially the last part. Sometimes the bull wins, not the matador.This will delight vegetarians, tree-huggers and others of their ilk.Hemingway can't punctuate worth a flip, and his sentence construction often leads much to be desired. He also slips into purple prose on occasion. To wit:Speaking of bullfighter Alfredo Corrochano (perhaps you know of him), Hemingway says this:He had \\"a rather Bourbonic face a little like that of Alfonso XIII as a child.\\"This is silly because it tells us nothing. Who knows what Alfonso XIII looked like as an adult, let alone as a child? Not you. Not me. Not anybody.This is a fine book if you want to learn about bullfighting. If you want good sentence construction and punctuation, go elsewhere. Almost half the book is given to photos and a glossary.All told, it serves the purpose. Now I have to go to Mexico City to see a bullfight in person.And don't forget: This is not a sport. It is a tragedy. For the bull.But sometimes for the bullfighter."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"At the time that Hemingway wrote this book the rather exotic art of bullfighting was fairly unknown to English audiences. Hemingway almost single-handedly drove many expatriate Americans and Europeans of the \`lost generation' to the corrida. Some of his novels and short stories also have the bullring as a backdrop. This book is an interesting combination of Hemingway's literary flair and a how to book on the art of bullfighting. The bullfight experience (watching, that is) became a mandatory exercise for later, mainly American, male writers and formed a rite of passage for manly writing. One thinks immediately of Norman Mailer but there were others.Having watched a bullfight in Mexico I find it hard to see the interest that Hemingway and the others had in the sport. I do not care for prizefighting either. I will admit to having spent many a fruitless hour watching the 'bullpen' of the beloved home town Red Sox at Fenway Park blow a lead that would make any bull see red. On its own terms, Hemingway surely had more than an amateur interest in describing the ritual of the fight and grading the performances of man and beast. That part, in essence, the literary part is what held my interest. If one suspends a certain disbelief about the obvious surface brutality of the event and rather delves into the \`man against nature' and \`dancing with death' aspects that is where you will find Hemingway. Ole"},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"It is a good book to get some background information about what you will see when you enter the bullring. It isn't 100% interesting in that some parts of it are off the subject, but for the most part it is great because I promise that going into a bullfight with no advance knowledge is a bad idea. Also, remember that it was written in 1932 and is maybe not 100% up to &quot;the times&quot; in a way, but it shows Hemingway's style of writing which for the most part is an excellent style. I think that you should buy it because it has some helpful things in it about everything relating to bullfighting from where to sit, to what to what, to where to go, to how to tell if a bull is brave or cowardly, etc. Again, for the most part, it is a great classic novel about a great classic sport (but &quot;not in the Anglo-Saxon sense of the word&quot; (from the book)). So if you are going to have something to do with a bullfight you should read this book."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"Ernest Hemingway brings a unique and interesting perspective to any subject which he writes on, Death in the Afternoon is no exception. Hemingway does not follow any set pattern in the way he examines bullfighting, but the first few chapters describe his early experiences with bullfighting and the mechanics of a bullfight. Later he analyzes different bullfighters' techniques and their own personal styles. Some fighters he likes much more than others, for various reasons. Throughout the book their are anecdotes about the author's own experience with bullfights as well as stories of many famous matadors' triumphs and tragedies in and out of the arena.Although bullfighting seems like an obscure and insignificant topic on which to write a book, Hemingway describes it vividly and with enthusiasm. He is very obviously in love with the world of the matador. A bullfight is a complicated affair involving many people. It is dangerous and that it what draws many of the spectators to the sport. Hemingway looks past most of the brutality and danger, he writes about the pageantry and culture that has evolved to make the bullfight what it is today. It is difficult to read about a subject that you have little or no interest in, it is far more difficult to write on a subject which most people have little or no interest in. The author avoids droning on about the minutia of bullfighting but still manages to teach the intricacies of it to the reader. He does this by adding first hand accounts of bullfighting and how it affects all aspects of a person's life who is involved with the sport. Hemingway also adds anecdotes about the towns and cities that host the fights. These stories help immensely in holding the reader's interest.Some people might be so disgusted with the idea of bullfighting that no matter how well it is written about, they will still hate it. But it is not as cruel and archaic as it seems at first glance. Bullfighting is a Spanish tradition and like many things it has become an art form. It is more of a play than a sport and unfortunately, it is a very dangerous and bloody production. But no matter what you think of the sport itself, no one can deny that any book more aptly depicts bullfighting than Death in the Afternoon."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"I got this book for Christman two years ago. At that point in my life I was infatuated with everything Hemingway and assumed that this was a novel about bullfighting. Well, it's not. But, if you read it with an open mind, you just might want to see a bullfight for yourself. Good style, reminds me of Mark Twain's &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot;."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"This is the only book I found written in English that describes the Bullfighting with great detail. I do not consider it to be a great novel but it is closer to be a &quot;text book&quot;. The art and technique of bullfighting is explained to you in a warm, friendly and casual way, just likes your grandfather or a close friend would."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"Hemingway was a genius, who's produced timeless works of art, but that doesn't make him a nice person.He liked travelling to Africa with big guns in his suitcase to shoot at animals who never hurt him, he presented women as cold-blooded beaches, and loved watching Spanish gypsies playing around with 'harmless' bulls for a few minutes before killing them. Notice the word 'harmless': the reason why most matadors get gored is that they challenge fate and practically throw themselves in the horns in the name of breathtaking performance, not because bulls are dangerous in the ring; the whole game has been so carefully arranged that the bull stands no chance, it is absolutely helpless; the casino always wins; this is what I had to say about Hemingway's statements of 'honor' of the bullfight.I'm supposed to review the book, and not the ethics of bullmurders, but when Hemingway says --I'm sorry, but I don't have the book in front of me to cite-- that watching a man killing a bull is a deeply spiritual experience, I don't get what he's talking about.He doesn't disregard ethics. He acknowledges the validity of people who view bull-murdering as disgusting. To them, he has two things to say: First --quote not taken from the author, but implied by him, or so the reviewer understands the book-- \\"be open minded, see what a fine art this is, with so many small details, high technical skill, aesthetic considerations, and see the beauty of this splendid art\\". Second, --and this quote I remember quite accurately-- \\"ethical is whatever makes you feel good afterwards, while unethical is whatever makes you feel bad. Since bullfights leave you with a pleasant feeling, then they're ethical.\\" I'm not kidding: that's what he says. (... and Hitler says that turning Jews into soap is ethical.)Now let's try to make some more objective comments, about the book and not bullfighting. This book is like an ultra-exhaustive documentary of bullfights, trying to explain EVERY single detail and minutaea of this elaborate, more-than-meets-the-eye performance. Every aspect of it, from the breeding up to the killing of the bull, gets its own chapter, heavy on details. It gets really anal, ie boring sometimes, and combined with extensive details about the lives, careers, and specific performances of many matadors, makes for a pretty tiring reading. Don't take my word for it. Hemingway admits it, too, and finishes most chapters with random snippets to break the pattern of boring, technical information; and fails. Some chapters end with imaginary dialogues between him and an old lady who claims the book is boring, to which the author replies:\\"it's a technical book, these books aren't meant to be interesting.\\" In one chapter the old lady is bored to death, so Hemingway adds the short story \\"Natural history of the dead\\". The story is irrelelevant to the book, and to the corresponding chapter. He admits he just adds it to spice up a boring book. Other chapters finish with the author's meditations on various subjects such as authorship --from the 400pgs, no more than 3-4 pgs speak about writing-- and other topics, and these are interesting and the only reason why I don't give the book one star. Also there are a couple of interesting paragraphs with great descriptions, written with ingenuous prose, but nothing more.I already knew I hated bullmurdering but since Hemingway is one of my favorite authors, I decided to read it just for technical, prose-studying purposes. I found myself skimming a lot. Then, I found myself skimming much more. The good news is, the book made me hate bullmurdering even more, exposing the hypocrisy of the whole thing, speaking of 'honor' when there is clearly none, uplifting murdering of helpless animals into an intensely emotional, spiritual, even religious experience.(if I remember well, he does say it's almost religious.)I'd recommend this book only to die-hard aficionados of bullfighting and people who intend to seriously study Hemingway's writing style. Those with only a mild interest in fiestas, and those who aren't writers and see no reason in studying Hemingway's prose, would waste their time. If you read Hemingway for entertaining reasons only, stick to his novels: he didn't write this book for people like you."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"If you are looking for informative stuff on bullfighting then there you go: this book will do. Now, if you plan to read this book because you're into Hemingway and have no specific interest in bullfighting, then you may get bored. I personally have no interest in bullfighting and despite all the explanations and understanding I got from this book I still consider the corrida a thing that should not exist, simply because inflicting pain on beings who can feel it is plain wrong no matter how sophisticated you make it, no matter what Nobel prize winner praises it.The thing to know is that this book is not solely about bullfight. That's where those of you really interested in Hemingway will find their interest. There are a couple of things in this book that you'd not expect, such as some short stories and some dissertations on art and what it is to write. Hemingway compares bullfight to writing in some passages and the area of death in relation to people is dealt with to some extent.I would not recommend this book unless you want to know about bullfight. I read it because I HAD to, if you ask me."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"I found this book fascinating. I am not a big Hemingway fan, but I am a fan of bullfighting, and it was great to read of the Spanish history of the sport. The only complaint I have is that at times he tends to ramble...however, this book is a superb starting point for any who are intersted in bullfighting...and it has great photos too!!"},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"It was hard to believe I was reading Hemingway - but then again, not really. His style of rambling sentences and thoughts was there. But he jumped around a lot. And the subject matter (an insider view of bullfighting) was despicable. Most of the book was spent trying to demonstrate that one was close-minded if one did not appreciate the art of the bullfight instead of getting hung up on the petty issue of the goring of the horses and the killing of the bulls. It was the first book in as long as I can remember that I did not finish. I kept saying it had to get better, since this was Hemingway. Instead, it kept getting worse."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"I read this book for the literary circle at my high school, and we unanimously declared it the worst thing we had ever read. It had no structure, so it appeared to be a mixed-up jumble of thoughts. Since there was no structure, the author strays off the \\"topic\\" (supposedly bullfights) quite frequently into little discussions about \\"venereal diseases\\", which he claims are relevant as they are a cause of death to many bullfighters.Perhaps if you have a Spanish background or love bullfighting, or possibly Ernest Hemmingway, it is possible you could relate to this book and enjoy it.Please note that our lit. circle read other books by Ernest Hemmingway. Those books, including \\"A Farewell to Arms\\", \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\", and \\"The Sun Also Rises\\", are definitely worth the read. Just because you liked other books by the same author, please do not assume you will like this one. I LOVED \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" and \\"The Sun Also Rises\\", but I couldn't stand this book."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"First time reader of Hemingway, thought it what have some merit; disappointed."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"Hemmingway may be a classic - but that doesn't mean this book has any place in literary history.How can an intelligent person defend a blood sport between man and animal that is unfair from the get-go? In bullfighting, the bull, whether he wins the fight or not, will always be sent to a gruesome death. It is a hideous, cruel sport that every Spaniard and supporter, should be ashamed of. Why it has not been outlawed, is a disgrace.Burn this book!"},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"I am a bullfighter fan ( I am Spanish ) and in my life I have taken to bullfighting to many foreign friends, I know well their point of views about the fiesta in the beginning but when you explain what's all about and the so many rules and regulation a corrida has, and the so many things that are happening but you don't see, they absolutely enjoyed.I wanted to read this book in English because I would like to know the english vocabulary of the fiesta and how the fiesta was in 1931 that my father used to tell me, after finishing it I have to say that this is absolutely the best book about bullfighting I have ever read so far!.It is awesome how this american could achieve so vaste knowledge about this matter.I love the enthusiastic way he describes all the aspects of the fiesta,the bullfighters and their different technics,everything is here, even the two roads which existed in the age to get from Madrid to Seville.I like very much the comparision he does at the beggining of the book between wine and bullfighting.I thought I knew a lot about our national party but after reading this book I realised I was partially wrong.And what to say about the way Hemingway writes... It is absolutely phantastic, pure magic and amazing...My advice is if after reading this book you want to assist to a corrida do the possible to go with an aficionado you will enjoy the triple!!."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"This book is for those who love bullfighting, those who loathe bullfighting and those who would like a few writing tips from a master.I read this book while I was in Spain, but I did not see a fight until I had finished. Going to a bullfight without knowledge or someone to guide me would have been overwhelming. But seeing the details Hemingway descibes come to life made it that much more exciting.For those who object to bullfighting you have that right. But don't object without knowing the how's or why's of what goes on. The most eye-opening thing you will see at a fight is the crowd getting upset at a fighter who takes liberties with a bull. Hemingway descibes in detail the purpose for every action taken in the ring, which gives clearity to what looks like cruelty.And finally, Hemingway gives advice on writing no writer should ignore. &quot;When you write, don't write characters...write people.&quot; If you are a writer, whether interested in bullfighting or not, you should read this book for the invaluable advice of a master.I can hardly think of a better way to spend an afternoon than hanging out with Papa Hemingway."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"Hemingway is at his best when discussing the fine art of bullfighting. He demonstrates a great appreciation for the bloodsport without romanticizing it. However, the writing is uneven. He throws in incidental pieces such as his running dialog with an old lady which only serves to detract from the subject. I suppose he was having a little fun with his publishers who probably thought a book on bullfighting wouldn't wash with the general readership, but the old lady becomes a nuissance and I was happy that he dropped her a little over half way through the book.At the time, bullfighting would have probably seemed foreign to most American readers. But Hemingway notes the handfull of Americans and other expatriates who took part in the corrida. He laments the modernization of the sport in which the art of killing seemed to be lost. He provides an excellent description of the disciplines of bullfighting, the way in which it plays out like a three-act tragedy for the bull.The time frame is ca. 1930 but it doesn't seem the sport has changed much since then. It is one of the many traditions in Spain that has survived the upheavels of the 20th century. The Socialists tried to eradicate it but failed. Bullfighting takes on a metaphysical aspect in some of the matadors and bulls he describes. It is wonderful reading and a great introduction to the subject."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"Hemingway loved bullfighting. And Spain. His affection for these comes across in this book. Death in the Afternoon is also infused with Hemingway's personality, which has been called his greatest artistic creation, and that makes this book especially personal and interesting.This is a great book to read on a flight to Spain, particularly if you plan to see a bullfight. With your newly-minted expertise in bullfighting, you'll apreciate the pageant much more.But Death in the afternoon is not just about bullfighting. Hemingway discusses such topics as death, often death, war, writing, art (a comparison of the painters Goya, Velasquez and El Greco), love and Faulkner. This book is more than a guide to bullfighting -- it is good literature."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"I don't approve of killing animals for entertainment, and this book did not change that disapproval. I endorse this book because of its qualities as a model for introducing a subject to a new learner, rather than for its subject matter.If you like bullfights, you will like this book because Death in the Afternoon will expand your understanding of what you see. If you want to go to bullfights, this is a good book also because it will tell you how to do so in the most enjoyable way for you.Most people will never attend a bullfight, because of ethical concerns, some personal dismay about their potential reaction to the violence and horror of the event, or due to lack of opportunity (bullfighting is mainly done in Spain and Mexico). Many of these people will have some interest in understanding more about bullfighting or the appeal and spectacle of the event. Death in the Afternoon provides you with a thoughtful way to satisfy any curiosity you may have.Hemingway set out to write &quot;an introduction to the modern Spanish bullfight and attempt[ed] to explain that spectacle both emotionally and practically.&quot; I think he more than succeeded.As a child, my parents sometimes took me to Tiajuana in Baja California where bullfights were regularly held on the weekends. We all agreed that we did not approve of killing bulls for sport, and never attended one. But my curiosity was aroused by the sight of the enormous crowds that regularly attended. Until reading this book, I could not understand the appeal. Now I do. I know that bullfights are not for me, but I now know why some like them very much.Hemingway leads you gently into the subject as though you were chatting while seated at a comfortable table in an outdoor cafe on a pleasant afternoon sipping your favorite beverages. In fact, for part of the book, he invents an &quot;old lady&quot; whom he converses with for comic effect.He tells you about his own experiences throughout beginning with, &quot;At the first bullfight I ever went to I expected to be horrified and perhaps sickened by what I had been led to believe would happen to the horses.&quot; It turned out that this was not his reaction at all. He liked the bullfight, and saw 1,500 bulls killed before writing this book. He also reports that many people he took to fights often experienced different emotions than they expected. Women who disliked violence did not automatically dislike bullfights, and macho men did not necessarily like them.The central emotion that &quot;good&quot; bullfights create is of grace in the face of death which is inspired by &quot;the closeness with which the matador brings the bull past his body and the slowness with which he can execute the pass.&quot;In the period about which he writes, the 1920s into 1931, bullfighting was in a &quot;decadent&quot; age brought about by a fascination with coming ever closer to the bull's horn and doing more and more elaborate cape work. In addition to the death of many bulls, this also brought about horrible injuries and death for virtually every bullfighter mentioned. That brings special meaning to Hemingway's assertion that bullfighting &quot;is not a sport in the Anglo-Saxon sense . . . .&quot; &quot;Rather it is a tragedy, the death of the bull . . . .&quot; But you will also come to know the tragedy of Joselito, Manuel Granero, and Maera.Despite my objections to bullfighting, I was tremendously impressed by Hemingway's powers of observation. You will learn about so many miniscule aspects and details of bullfighting, that it will leave your head spinning. For example, a bull that erratically charges to one side or another has to be handled much differently in each pass than one who is like a mechanical bull and is very predictable. Bullfighters prefer the latter, but some of the best work is with the former if the bull is malleable. Does the bullfighter try to teach the bull, or simply survive the experience? The reaction of the bullfighter tells much about his character. The reaction of the fans tells much about their knowledge and character. You feel like you are looking at the world through many revolving kaleidescopes as images are considered in the context of other images, like an unending house of mirrors.The book says a lot about character -- the character of those involved in bullfighting and the fans. Although Hemingway admires the &quot;honor&quot; of those who face death bravely and act properly in the bull ring, he also points out that too much &quot;honor&quot; is dangerous. In essence, he makes an argument against the values of bullfighting even though he is an aficionado.He is honest with us, by also sharing his own failed experiences with trying to learn to fight the bulls.The book is greatly aided by many detailed and impressive photographs that illustrate the points in the book that would otherwise be lost on the reader who has not attended a bullfight. There is also a 61 page glossary of terms to help you handle all of the new concepts he throws at you.There are some incidental benefits for those who decide not to attend bullfights. Hemingway provides many detailed descriptions of the geography, weather, and characteristics of the people in different parts of Spain. I got several ideas for places I would like to visit on future trips as a result. At the end, he laments that he could not work in the rest of Spain into the book beginning with the Prado. I shared that lament, because a similar book on Spain by Hemingway would have been even more interesting and valuable to me. I can only imagine what his other wonderful descriptions would have been like.I suggest you take this book and outline it to see the process by which Hemingway takes you from being a neophyte to a quite well-grounded person about bullfighting. How could you do the same for a subject that you need to introduce many people to? If you learn from his story-telling skills, you will be well-rewarded for your experience."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"Many years ago, I watched a debate on TV in Spain. The debate was on bullfighting. The opponents of bullfighting, who would like to see the spectacle outlawed, declared that &quot;No good intelectual approved of bulfighting&quot; &quot;What about Hemingway?&quot; asked one of the proponents.What about Hemingway. He has simply written the best book I've ever read on the event/show/tradition of bullfighting. He loved it dearly, and this love permeates every page on the book. His descriptions of the corridas, of the cities where the &quot;Fiestas&quot; are held, although quite dated by now, hold an everlasting charm, that illustrates the scenes, with an expert palette of colors.Are you going to Spain? Are you planning to see a &quot;corrida de toros&quot;? If you read this book, you will know what it is about, and you will be able to appreciate it. The only thing better than this, would be to have a seat next to an &quot;entendido&quot; who would explain the whole &quot;fiesta&quot; to you.I read this book in high school, and reread it now, 27 years later. It is still enthralling, and its charm has only gotten better over the years.Hemingway saw the bullfight as a stylized tragedy; his understanding of the bullfight, mixes with his understanding and love for Spain. At the end, he cannot escape the conclusion that Spain would not be Spain, withouth the bulls and the bullfighting. This even though only a minority of Spaniards go to bullfights, or are even remotely interested in the &quot;fiesta&quot;It's a pity there is no one now who could develop an updated version of this classic."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"Death in the Afternoon marks Hemingway's first major experiment in style and genre. While it is about bullfighting, and a marvelous one at that, this book is equally (and perhaps more importantly) about the art of writing as well as the writer himself, or more specifically Hemingway. When viewed in this context Death in the Afternoon reaches a much more complex structure and one demanding closer attention."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"Though at the end of the book Hemingway states that his book is in no way intended to be an all inclusive book on bullfighting, it is considered by many to be \\"the\\" best book ever written on the subject. A literary triumph for those interested and those opposed to bullfighting, filled with details of what goes on before, during, and after the fights both from the matadors' and spectators' point of views. If you've never been to a bullfight, this book will put you ring-side to the artistry that is bullfighting. (It is easy to see why this book is so well esteemed, Hemmingway's writing is an art all its own and this book is his fiercest ever.)Al fin del libro Hemingway dice que no lo debemos considerar el libro todo inclusivo de tauromaquia o corrida de toros, muchos lo consideran el libro definito en el tema. Un triunfo literario paro los interesados y los opuestos a las corridas, lleno de detalles de lo que susede antes, durante, y despues de las corridas en los ojos del matador y los espectadores. Si nunca ha ido a una corrida, este libro lo pondria pormedio del matador y el toro en el arte de la tauromaquia. (Es facil ver porque este libro es tan bien estimado, el estilo de Hemmingway es un arte enteramente suyo y este libro es su mas feroz.)"},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"I am an aficionado of the corrida and, almost necessarily, loved this book. It is the best thing every written on the subject and, although I don't agree with Hemingway's every point, I still enjoy it. The book was written in 1930 and, even then, he decries a certain corruption in the spectacle. He maintains that the bulls have been bred down in size to make it easier for the matador to work and ultimately kill the bull. Maybe, although I haven't seen this tendency during my lifetime.He also decries the fact that the emphasis is less and less on the killing as opposed to pageantry and hot-dogging [read Mitchener's \\"Mexico\\"]. There is some truth in this but, even back in 1930, Madrid was becoming a tourist mecca and, to a certain extent, the matadors were and are playing to unsophisticated audiences. On the other hand, my experience in less touristy areas has been the opposite. The kill, although not the total point of the fight, is definitely the most important part. Pity the poor matador who has a perfect fight only to have his sword, at the \\"moment of truth\\", glance off a rib. He won't get two ears and a tail. He'll be lucky if he gets one ear.I think Hemingway should have more emphasized that the corrida is NOT a sport. It is a tragedy which appeals to the Spanish [and some non-Spanish]mind. It is not meant to be \\"fair\\" in the Anglo-Saxon sense of the word. A brave beast rages courageously only to be bloodied, broken and killed. The matador, on his part, needs to be just as brave. If you don't think so, just try to face an enraged 1500 lb beast with a cape and a flimsy sword. To go to a bullfight hoping the matador will be knocked down and gored, would be like going to a ballet and hoping the prima ballerina fall on her face.It is a deliberate tragedy where sometimes the dead bull gets a bigger hand than does the matador. It appealed to Hemingway's fatalism. Most of his stories, if you think about it, mirrored the corrida. \\"All true stories end in death.\\" He said. If you read his tales most end with defeat and death. The Snows of Kilamanjaro, The Old Man and the Sea, The Short and Happy life of Francis MacComber, A Farewell to Arms, For Whom the Bell Tolls and many, many others. I wonder if he was thinking of the wounded bull when he loaded his shotgun that day...Ron Braithwaite author of novels--\\"Skull Rack\\" and \\"Hummingbird God\\"--on the Spanish Conquest of Mexico"},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"Being a bullfight aficionado for many years has thought me something: one never ends learning about the &quot;fiesta&quot;. So eaven if you are a great aficionado or if you are just courios, this work will teach you how to see the bullfights from another point of view. Hemingway first introduces you to understand what happens in the mind of those who take part in the world of bullfights, then takes you there, with found and tender descriptions of everything a newcomer to the bullfights should know and many things the old aficionados should remember allways. I belive it's the best literature available in english about the subject. It's eaven better than most serious books about bullfighting written by spaniards, mexican or latinamerican experts through out this century, and the Hemingway style is good as ever."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"As I die hard fan of Hemingway, I found this one rather mediocre compared with such greats as A Farewell To Arms and For Whom the Bell Tolls. It is not his finest work. Even still, it contains curiously interesting tidbits of information about the nature of the bullfight, though it seems needlessly lengthy at times. At least worth a look."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"A disclaimer really needs to be made in regards to this book. It is not a work of fiction. It is not a traditional non-fiction book in that it cites a bunch of facts and figures from well-known sources. It is grusome in some regard. It will make you think. It may even make you cry.Now...I have seen just one bullfight in my life, and for some strange reason I had enjoyed it. I didn't understand it, but I got caught up in what was going on. I read this book because I am going to Spain and was thinking of possibly going to a bullfight and wanted to know more about it. This book has really done a lot for me - including to help change my mind!This is not a typical Hemingway book! The reader gets the feeling that Hemingway is sharing a table at a Spanish taverna, sipping wine and eating tapas, while sharing his thoughts and views on bullfighting. There are no sources. Hemingway is his own source. He outlines and describes the tragedy (as he calls it, for bullfighting is not a \\"sport\\" as Anglo-Saxon people understand the word) to those who have no understanding. At times, he does ramble. Just as some one who is truly sitting next to you talking to you would likely get off topic at times. It makes it more real. Much of the material is dated, but the book was written in 1931!However, the basic principles of bullfighting remain the same. It is a tragedy that has continued since Roman times, and with just a few changes over the centuries. Hemingway does a terrific job in helping readers from countries who do not have this tradition try to understand this play of life and death.If one is looking for a book to entertain and escape, this is not it! If one is looking to understand what bullfighting is, from some one who admired the play of tragedy, then this could be a very helpful read. But do expect this book to change you. For me, I once supported bullfighting wholeheartedly. After reading this, I find it disgraceful. Your mileage will vary. This book packs influence!"},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"The beauty in reading something by a writer such as Hemingway is that apart from the actual topic at hand, in this case bullfighting, there is much to be read between the lines about important items in the grander scheme - life, death, and everything in between. In The Green Hills of Africa, Hemingway talks about the writer's use of rhetoric, and his ability, or lack there of, to incorporate it into the fabric of whatever account he may be working on. He uses Melville's Moby Dick as an example of mastery of the technique, while he, in The Green Hills of Africa, is talking also of the grand pursuit of artistic success, it's relation to luck, and of course, how only through experience can one gain an edge and catch that at which he aims.So although one might never have the chance to see a bullfight - although he may never have an interest in seeing a bullfight or knowing of bullfights at all - there is a lot to be gained by reading this book. Like most great writers, Hemingway's principle focus is not that of what seems, at the outset, to be the topic of the book. He writes of humanity and honor in this book, using bullfights as a mere lens through which to view these things and their related counterparts. And he does it with the verdant love of the written word that has so much been a characteristic feature of his work.If you are a Hemingway fan, this is a must read."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"Should have read the product description a little more closely. I did not realize that I was purchasing the book without its normal illustrations, and with numerous typos. The typos interrupted the flow of the text greatly - I would say there were probably three or four significant typos per page. Not just misspelled words, but words that had numbers or other characters in them. The stars I've listed above are for the story and the substance of the book, not for the quality of the particular copy that I bought.I thought the substance of the book itself was fascinating. I'm a little late into the Ernest Hemingway game having never really read him in high school. His writing style takes some getting used to. His knowledge of bullfighting, however, is astounding. I can understand why some people are so adamantly anti-bullfighting, and I do believe that in my lifetime bullfighting as it exists now will be outlawed. But Hemingway really does a good job of relating much more than the gruesome death of the bull, and takes you into the subleties and intracacies of what makes a bullfight interesting to watch.I highly recommend this book for anyone who is interested in bullfighting. Its fairly involved, however, so if you're just passingly curious about the topic it may not be for you. It is fairly dense, and there are some portions of the book where he strays from the topic entirely, but the book as a whole is incredibly informational. I would recommend that you not buy the General Books OCR Reprint Edition."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"I am a huge Hemingway fan, perhaps one might call me a Hemingway aficionado because I have been taking enjoyment in systematically reading everything the man wrote. The man's style is incomparable. He never gets feigns, gets fancy, or tries to show off. He just delivers results time and again.I see that the average rating of this book is four stars, and I think that this is a fair rating for the book. Since I have been reading the book and I am nearly finished, I thought that I would take the opportunity to chime in, and I will tell you why I think this is a four star book.1) If you are just reading Hemingway for the first time, this should not be the book that you choose unless you are personally interested in bullfighting. This is a non-fiction work and is not characteristic of Hemingway. So, if you read this as his first book, while you will get an idea of his writing style, you will not have a representative work of his. Instead, read some short stories or perhaps \\"The Sun Also Rises,\\" also published as \\"Fiesta\\".2) Hemingway wrote this book when he was about 33 years old. As an young American who was fascinated with bullfighting and very knowledgeable of the subject, he decided to write a book for the English speaking world about bullfighting, and this book was the result. As a non-fiction writer myself, I learned a great deal from reading Hemingway's non-fiction style. One can also see at parts in this book Hemingway's treatment of death, his unwillingness to turn away from it, but his desire to courageously describe it in detail as a fact.3) There are certain beautiful passages and, on the whole, the book is very well written. That said, the book can seem repetative and perhaps not organized in the best possible way. Hemingway knows that he is indulging himself in writing this work, and he has fun with it. He introduces an old lady into the book as someone to bounce ideas off of and has an extensive dialogue with her. He includes a couple of semi-humorous and entertaining short stories. The talks about technique in writing.4) Of course, the \\"repetative\\" quality of the book must also be taken with a grain of salt. Writing a 300 page book on an event that usually only takes a few hours to complete will seem repetative to the non-specialist. Imagine, for example, reading a 300 page book on baseball. It might seem repetative, but the truth is that one must get into detail if one wants to treat one's subject fully.5) All-in-all, I would recommend the book to anyone 1) who had already read a lot of Hemingway because it is fascinating to hear him speaking so frankly, 2) Anyone interested in traveling to Spain or in seeing a bullfight, 3) Anyone who wants to improve their style at writing non-fiction, 4) anyone who likes non-fiction and who is looking for something to read in the summer time. The bullfights take place in the summer, and so this is good summer reading."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"Hemmingway's typically aggressive approach to life and morality is applied to bullfighting in this manual of how man and beast can compete for the ultimate prize. The book must be a psycho-analyst's dream as Hemmingway disposes of all moral considerations on bullfighting within a few paragraphs but continuously makes parallels with WWI slaughters and references to the Spanish civil war. Is there any such thing as a fair fight? Is the bull really the hero or is the bull a beast to be &quot;corrected&quot;? It is a cleverly written book which is on the surface a treatise on a very basic and earthy subject but which requires a deeper consideration of its moral aspects. The book is without a formal conclusion but invites the reader to decide if bullfighting is for them or not - to question why and to apply that logic to larger questions. The details of various matadors are interesting and may be the author's tribute to an art but might just be Hemmingway blurring the challenge with detail, much as in real life.It is an interesting book, quite different to his novels but with the typical robust challenge from Hemmingway to rebut his point of view or just close the book!"},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"Even Hemingway was wary of bullfighting when was first introduced to it by Gertrude Stein in the early part of the 20th century. He tells of his suspicion in the first pages of this book and invites the reader to join him in his exploration of this old Spanish tradition. I have enver been to a bullfight, but after reading Death in the afternoon, I am curious to see at least one now and feel that I will have a better than average understanding of what is happening in the ring. While it may be somewhat outdated, as the book describes many of the matadors that existed at the time of writing... there is enough real description of the ceremony and the outcome of many matches that it makes no difference.The theme is interesting and as with most hemingway books is found in a title with more than one meaning.A&quot; death will occur this afternoon, will it be man or animal?&quot;That is the question to be answered with each and every bullfight. That is the reason millions of people attend every year. That is the reason Hemingway became and aficianado of the sport. Read this book and fund out what bullfighting is really all about. No sugar coating here."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"This work is poetic in the way all Hemingway is poetic--the simplicity of the prose understates the immense themes at work. His terse, athletic prose creates an air of energy around the bull-fight. The work is pathetic in the sense that the bull-fight is pathetic, eliciting emotion (pathos) and a severe kind of involvement in the moment for the reader. A wonderful read, but be warned that Hemingway's own aficion de corrida may seduce you as well. The nearly violent prose making the ritual of violence as grand and beautiful as possible."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"A friend pressed me a while back to read Hemingway. I hadn't touched him since Freshman English--getting to be a VERY long time ago. I was most impressed by \\"The Undefeated.\\" It's a world class short story, but I knew I was missing parts of it. This is the explanation--enough about bull-fighting as Hemingway understood it and as it was practiced between the wars to let us who have not grown up in the culture understand it.For that reason, it's earned a place on my shelves.In other ways, it's outdated--reviews of the style of bullfighters dead 50 years or more--or self-indulgent. (\\"The Natural History of the Dead\\" is thrown in for reasons comprehensible only to Hemingway.) Be prepared to skim.But when you read Hemingway with a bull-fighting setting, have this book handy."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"Death in the afternoon is a lucid account of the Spanish bullfight which is one of Ernest Hemmingways fine books that he released i would recommened this book for anyone looking for a cultural diverse book and to people who like looking at things that at first they dont have a clue about (like me and bullfighting). When i picked this book up all i knew about bullfighting was the blindingly obvious facts such as the matadors and how bulls are attracted to red alone etc... but you would be suprsised as to how detailed the sport (if you could call it that) is, and how brutal the consequances of bullfighting may be. I've only ever read this book by Ernest Hemmingway but was impressed by what it had to offer, Hemmingways passion for bullfighting is clear in this novel and the detail and focus on Spain involved is always prevelant so this is a book thats definatley worth the read an empathic book that should not really be missed."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"I liked this book! Trying to defend &quot;Death in the Afternoon&quot; in these politically correct times is like trying to argue that Hitler was just a misunderstood guy with some unconventional ideas. Oh well, here goes. Let's start with the basics. The book is largely non-fiction. It deals with bullfighting. It is written by Hemingway. And it goes into considerable detail about actual bullfighters who by now must certainly be dead. What possible &quot;relevance&quot; can this book have today? The answer: &quot;plenty.&quot; What I like most about &quot;Death in the Afternoon&quot; is Hemingway's honest (and I think genuine) attempt to explain --not defend -- the appeal that bullfighting has to its followers. Hemingway nowhere claims to be unbiased. He enjoys bullfights and doesn't pretend otherwise. Nor does he apologize for its harsh realities. His honest assessment, for example, that padding the horses has far more to do with protecting Anglo-American sensibilities than the flanks of the horses -- and that the pads, therefore, are themselves dishonest -- is refreshing and too little seen among today's writers. So too are his frank admissions that the bull doesn't have a chance, that a bullfight is not a &quot;contest&quot; in the usual sense, and that it is really &quot;a drama carried out in three acts.&quot; What writer today--regardless of his views--dares speak with such honesty? Hemingway's honest comments regarding the different styles and abilities of actual bullfighters are something few, if any, of today's writers would attempt. (Admittedly, libel laws might have something to do with this.) The &quot;anti-esthetic&quot; and &quot;praying-mantis&quot; manner of Nicanor Villalta is contrasted with the &quot;grace&quot; of Cagancho. After ridiculing Villalta's cape work and praising Cagancho's, Hemingway points out Cagancho's cowardice and redeems Villalta with the observation that, &quot;Villalta kills though in a way no gypsy ever killed and it would be unfair to show how silly he looks with his feet apart and not show him leaning in after the sword.&quot; Who writes like that nowadays? For a work of non-fiction, &quot;Death in the Afternoon&quot; is a rich source of those thoughts and phrases that have a kind of universal truth to them beyond their literal meaning and that stay with you long after the book is finished. Some of my favorites: &quot;Ver llegar: to watch them come; the ability to watch the bull come as he charges with no thought except to calmly see what he is doing and make the moves necessary to the manouever you have in mind.&quot; (This one even found it's way into Gerry Spence's book, &quot;How to Argue and Win Everytime.&quot;) &quot;THE SEED BULL. At twenty-two years the horns are splintered; the eyes are slow and all the weight has gone forward and away from where eight hundred and twenty-two sons came from to the ring....&quot; (Is this the fate of most men, too?) &quot;And finally El Gallo in one of the seies of delicate formal compositions that the happier part of his life in the ring consisted of. The bull, as he should be, is dead. The man, as he should be, is alive and with a tendency to smile.&quot; I dont' know about you, but I like stuff like that. If you find yourself saying things like, &quot;I just don't understand how anyone could possibly enjoy...,&quot; -- and you are in fact someone who genuinely WANTS to understand -- do yourself a favor and give this book a chance. Just as Moby Dick is about more than a whale, this book is about more than just bullfighting."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"An epic tome on the art and grandeur of Spanish bullfighting from one of America's greatest aficionados, Ernest Hemingway, who explicates the craft and spiritual intensity of this ancient European ritual through terse, journalistic, prose and rigorous scholarship. Not surprisingly, Hemingway is not terribly perturbed by the grotesque barbarity of the violence of bullfighting; Hemingway was an enthusiast of hunting and had little to no moral qualms about killing animals (and sometimes people). Yet he is not totally insensitive, warning the reader that most spectators of bullfighting are normally disgusted by the killing of the horses more than anything else.For Hemingway, the bullfight is not meant to be understood as an equal battle between man and beast. Rather, it is a tragedy, and the tragedy is for the bull who ought to be killed. He writes, \\"The best of all fighting bulls have a quality, called nobility by the Spanish, which is the most extraordinary part of the whole business\\" (113), yet Hemingway does not provide any comment on the utter absurdity of the whole business. Hemingway was a writer obsessed with, and in search of true courage in the face of natural danger and fate, and he found it most explicitly in war and in bullfighting.However, some readers will be surprised to find that \`Death in the Afternoon,' is not simply about bullfighting. Hemingway also expounds quite at length about his views on art and the craft of writing. He says: \\"When writing a novel, a writer should create living people; people not characters. A character is a caricature\\" (191). Unfortunately, Hem was never fully successful at creating a living woman, but every writer has a weakness. \\"A serious writer may be a hawk or a buzzard or even a popinjay, but a solemn writer is always a bloody owl\\" (192).Also included in this altogether excellent volume is a collection of stunning photographs depicting various stages of the bullfight and various matadors of fame; there are also fascinating portraits of the running of the bulls in Pamplona (echoing those fabulous sequences in \`The Sun also Rises'). Additionally, Hemingway has provided the reader with a detailed glossary of important bullfighting terms for true aficionados. Originally published through Scribner in 1932."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"Probably the best English language book on the subject. Although the book deals with bullfighting as it existed during the 20's and 30's in Spain, it's observations about the art are still valid today. A must read for anyone who wants to understand bullfighting or Hemingway's facination with the subject and Spain"},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"This book is a treatise on the appreciation of a bullfight; Hemingway's guide on how to become an aficionado. In addition to the excellent text, the book includes pictures, a glossary and commentary from those who have attended. One wonders how many bullfights over how many years were attended by Hemingway in compiling both a snapshot of the history of bullfighting at the time (1930s) and a full discussion of the intricacies of a bullfight that determine the quality of the performance.As someone who has never seen nor read about bullfights, the detail laid out within was both captivating and compelling. The book starts at the beginning laying out the places where bullfighting can be seen, the organization and tradition of bullfighting in Spain, the physical layout of the ring, the breeding of bulls, the training and evolution of matadors and ultimately the phases of the fight itself. While reading the passages I found myself both not believing what was actually being done to the bull and wondering why the toreros put themselves in the ring at all given the risk. This duality of both cruelty and bravery is the kernel of what makes bullfighting so compelling to not only the Spanish but the millions who attend each year. It makes this book a page-turner, despite the odd, and in my mind, useless intra-chapter dialogues between author and non-descript \\"old woman\\". Hemingway builds on this basic draw to the spectacle, evolving the sensibility of the aficionado to both the science and art of the bullfight and the dependence of greatness on the two primary protagonists. One cannot have a good bullfight with a mediocre bull, nor can one expect a great fight with an ill-trained and less courageous matador. Through the final stage of the fight, bull and matador connect on the nexus of death. The punishment preset on the bull before the introduction of the matador is not always effective and matadors suffer repeated horrific injuries from the bull and sometimes death. In nearly every case however, as so perfectly described by Hemingway, the 3-4 year old colossal fighting bull dies. A methodical ballet of spears and capes wears down the bull through three stages of the fight until he can be impaled through the shoulders with the sword of the matador ending his life in the ring that he was bred for. Death in the Afternoon provides a dramatic and thorough description of this tradition penned by a master hand."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"One thing that Hemingway clears up is that bullfighting is not a contest between man and beast. It is a tragedy; no matter if the bull succeeds in killing the matador, and all the picadors and bandierros for that matter, he will still be executed after the fight. This is pure art, and nothing more. I can't explain why to you, but Hemingway says that it is very Spanish, and to understand it you must understand the Spaniards.This is just a general overview of bullfighting. The book is very descriptive and very much more worth your time. You will find that there is something of the bullfight and the muleta in all of us.The three steps of the bullfight are clear and showcase the bull. (It is worth mentioning that these are not just any bulls: they are finely bred fighting bulls that are too agressive to be good for anything else.)One: the bull shows his strength and bravery in the killing of the horses in the first stage with the picador. The picador pierced the muscle on his shoulder, therefore showing the bravery of the bull if he continues through the pain to gore the horse. After this stage, the dead horses are covered and the bandierros enter the ring.Two: The bandierros use small spears with hooks on them so they stay in the bull's hide. They are 'set' in pairs in the large hump of agrivated muscle over the withers. These are used to raise the neck of the bull and therefore weakening it so the matador can do his work. In this stage the bull is confused: he cannot (if the man knows his work and is not unlucky) catch the man as he did in the last stage. His courage is useless.Three: The matador enters the arena (or barrera, I believe...it's been a while) to finish the bull. At this stage, the bull is tired and his head is beginning to droop. His shoulders are covered in blood but he stands there arrogant. The matador cannot rise over the horns of the bull to kill in his origional condition; therefore, he must tire him over the course of the three stages. The matador does his part with the muleta (cape) and then kills the bull by stabbing him with a sword to his heart. It is here, Hemingway will tell you, that the bull is either said to be killed or assasinated. If the matador is competent, his body will come over the top of the horn. If the bull lifts his head, the matador is gored. Thus, in a proper kill, the bull in the end had a chance to kill again. If the matador pulls back at the last second and just stabs the animal without the threat, he is said to \\"assasinate.\\"This is excellent. Your friends might look at you a little funny for reading about \\"killing bulls\\" and not understand that it is...well, an ART. This is just plain wonderful. Hemingway again does a terriffic job, showing more of his journalistic side than in For Whom the Bell Tolls.Excellent read, but not for everyone. Get it from the library and read the first few chapters. If you still feel sorry for the bulls after that, you're on your own."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"I'm glad to see a reissue of this classic in hardcover.If you are interested in bullfighting, Hemingway or Spain you should find this book interesting, enjoyable reading.It is a playful introduction into bullfighting and at the same time a reminiscence of Spain and bullfighting.The book deals with the art of bullfighting as it existed in the twenties.That said, most of the passes, techniques, tricks, foibles he describes still exist in bullfighting as it is practiced today. And while not extremely deep on the technical side of the subject, this is the most readable of any book on the technical aspects of bullfighting I've come across. If you want to understand the basics of bullfighting, this would be an excellent place to start.Hemingway profiles a handful of matadors. They are all from impoverished backgrounds, basic peasant stock, that despite the fame and money they never can quite leave behind this past. It was a much more dangerous profession then, before the advent of antibiotics when death from a septic wound was a risk from even a minor goring.Hemingway is unrestrained in his love of Spain and this shines through the book."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"\\"Death In The Afternoon\\" is Ernest Hemingway's tribute to the bull fighting. Here Hemingway shares with the reader his insights gleaned from years of intense study of the art. This book covers the terms and actions of the fight along with the author's personal evaluations of what makes a bull fighter great and what makes a great bull fight. He also explains the inner soul of the matador and how it connects to the soul of Spain. Much of the content is devoted to his own observations and the stories of individual bull fighters.I have never seen a bull fight so I started reading with a fairly neutral curiosity. I was quickly drawn into the story. At time I had trouble following the individuals, equipment and the stages involved in the bull fight, but I still found the book to be enjoyable. At the end I felt that I had a much better understanding of the lure of the bull fight and what to watch for if I would ever see one. I had no background into the history of bull fighting or those enshrined in its pantheon. To reader interested in the history and art of the bull fight, this book would probably be an indispensable tome. To me it was a very enjoyable read. Hemingway has a way of telling a story that is entertaining, word after word. Even the seemingly endless narratives of the heroes of the rings held my attention due to the skillful writing employed throughout. I ended up with an openness to attend a bull fight, if the opportunity presents itself, and questions in my own mind about how the sport has evolved since the original writing in the 1930s. Whether you are a fan of the bull fight or merely enjoy a story skillfully told, \\"Death In The Afternoon\\" is a classic to be savored."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"For Ernest Hemingway, a fiesta wasn't a fiesta until someone got killed, preferably a 1,400-pound male bovine, horns dripping with horse blood, legs up in front of thousands of cheering Spaniards. That was the world of the bullfight, a world Hemingway discovered by accident while on a break from mingling with the Lost Generation in Paris, and made his own with the help of this book.First published in 1932, \\"Death In The Afternoon\\" may be what separates Papa's truest fans from mere admirers like myself. Most people who value writing understand that Hemingway wrote very well, but many like me would go on to say we wish he spent less time on attitude and posturing and developed a surer sense of focus, in line with \\"The Sun Also Rises\\" and \\"In Our Time.\\" But for those who drink and fish and grow white beards in emulation of their hero, \\"Death In The Afternoon\\" is THE book precisely because it so messily captures Hemingway's self-image of the macho artist.\\"Death In The Afternoon\\" starts out with a rambling chapter that deals with American attitudes about bullfighting rather than the thing itself. It finishes with a self-indulgent one where he outlines all the things he left out as if giving a long-winded Oscar speech. In between is much to admire, for bullfighting aficionados and vegetarians alike, including some of the most arresting passages in American letters.\\"Someone with English blood has written: 'Life is real; life is earnest, and the grave is not its goal,'\\" Hemingway writes. \\"And where did they bury him? and what became of the reality and the earnestness?\\"Hemingway's theme, here and throughout the book, seems to be that death and suffering are the things of life, its essence and only ultimate truths. Only art lends them meaning. Of all art, Hemingway finds bullfighting the truest and most inspiring because of how close it is to the bone of the matter, to death, and how transitorily it is experienced. All art, even the most lasting, ultimately fades, but only in bullfighting is that impermanence accepted and understood.Hard words, hard philosophy. But Hemingway works hard too at entertaining the reader, often quite successfully. He tells of one matador's farewell performance where he dedicates the killing of his last bull before the fact to first one, than another, and then a third person, so caught up is he in the moment and his own eloquence. There is an ongoing discussion with an old lady frankly curious about the sex habits of both bull and bull-killer. He extols Faulkner, has at Huxley, and fesses up to how he must come off: \\"The fellow is no philosopher, no savant, an incompetent zoologist, he drinks too much and cannot punctuate readily...He is bull crazy.\\"The book comes with a generous number of photographs with Hemingway-written captions that are works of art in miniature. Under a photo of a dead matador surrounded by people, he notes: \\"Only two in the crowd are thinking about Granero. The others are all intent on how they will look in the photograph.\\"I didn't really buy Hemingway's take on some things, especially the issue of the horses. He opposes padding their undersides to protect them from bull horns as it violates the aesthetic of the performance. Then he writes of how the picadors riding the horse will use the horse's horning as a way of artificially tiring the bull to give the matador an easier time. Doesn't padding then produce a better bullfight?Hemingway also loses his train of thought, in ways that impair rather than enrich the reading experience. One moment he's talking about the handling of the muleta or the politics of the cuadrilla, the next he is talking about a pair of homosexuals or how langostinos are best enjoyed.It's really about a man discovering a country he loves, and in that sense, the Spanish backdrop is the best thing about \\"Death In The Afternoon.\\" It's a love letter with more than a touch of sadness; the Spain Hemingway knew was about to be lost, to civil war and Franco, for the rest of his lifetime. But nothing was forever to Hemingway. In the world of the bullring, he found the closest thing to perfection he could believe in. Believe it or not, you have to admire the result."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"I am a big Hemingway fan, but had put off reading this one because of my lack of interest in bullfighting. However, this book amply confirms the idea that if the writer is good enough, he/she can make anything interesting. I have never seen a bullfight in my life, nor do I intend to, and yet I loved this book. The descriptions of the bullfighters' motions and the art of bullfighting is poetic in its simplicity. My one caveat: be ready to get a lot of bullfighting terminology thrown at you. Pay attention to the explanations early on or you won't know what he's talking about later."},{"Title":"Death in the Afternoon","review":"In Death in the Afternoon, Hemingway describes the sport/art of bullfighting. His knowledge of the bullfighting is extensive enough to show the writer's passion for his subject. He discusses many of the greater Matadores of his time (most of these figures are from the twenties and thirties), and explains what seperates one from another. He describes the Matadores in such a way as to show them as either dynamic, courageous figures, despicably cowardly men (who only fight in order to fulfill contracts), or as tragically deficient faliures. It is a pity that none of these people still fight, for Hemingway gives you such insight into their personalities and styles that it would be wonderful to actually see them in action. That is one major stregnth of this book, it connects the reader to the men in to ring. Hemingway's passion for this sport, as well as it's performers, is transfered to the reader. In that sense, it's a very personal book. Hemingway also goes into detail as to the structure of bullfighting. He discusses the roles played by the various figures (the Picadores, bandelleros, and the Matadore himself) within the arena. With great lucidity, he goes through the process of a bullfight: From selection of the bull to it's death at the hands of the Matadore (or the Matadore at the horns of the bull). Thorugh anecdotes, and frank discussion, Hemingway lays out the foundation of how a bullfight is properly performed (by every single member of the bullfighting team). He also points out the consequences, and disappointment, of a poorly performed match. Overall, this work is very enlightening in terms of the structure of bullfighting. The only negative aspect of this book is that Hemingway wrote it so long ago. Thus, his encyclopedic knowledge of the bullfighters is almost wasted (for none of them fight today). That's not too much of a negative though. In all, I would recomend this book for anyone who is interested in learning more about the structure of bullfighting, and also anyone who is interested in Hemingway (it gives you a certain amount of insight into his beliefs, and character)."},{"Title":"Love on Call","review":"After defusing a rather volatile situation in the emergency room of the hospital where she works, Dr. Mallory Russell is pleasantly surprised when fellow physician Bradley Clayton takes a sudden interest in her. She is a little leery of his intentions, though, and refuses to believe that he sees her as a desirable woman, and not just as a fellow doctor.Known as the hospital recluse, Bradley doesn't have time for anyone, unless it's the children he is determined to save. When he sees Mallory in trouble, his shell is cracked, his interest is peaked, and he decides to take a chance on love. Will true love prevail, or will the secrets that each of them harbor destroy any chance they might have at that once in a lifetime, all encompassing love every person so desperately seeks?True to form, Shirley Hailstock has created another good story in LOVE ON CALL, but this one seemed to lack that extra flair that her previous works have included.

Drama in the ER and he is there to help her after it is over- they get to know each other- they are both cautious about entering into a relationship but they fall in love. However, the book did not live up to its promise and it was very disappointing adn frustrating.Dr. Malllory Russell is an ER doctor dedicated to her work with little time for friends. The book does little to explore her solitary life and other than mentioning that she has a sister, the book does not go into their relationship.Dr. Brad Clayton is a pediatric surgeon who seems to be more of a regular pediatrician than a surgeon. The back cover describes him as wounded and lonely but there is little done to explore this. He did have tragedy in his childhood but the book does not explore how this shaped his inability to maintain a meaningful relationship with a woman.It was very frustrating to read this book not only because it did not fit with the descriptions but also, it was too disjointed. Often the author would throw in facts that the characters were aware of but there would be no led up to them. For examples, the characters would reference conversations or events that supposedly occurred during the character's involvement, but these did not occur in the book. Also, when Mallory was talking to Brad about his family in their second conversation, she knew all of his family details which he had never told her before. It was as if the author was rushing and there was too much editing so alot of details were cut or left out. I found myself having to reread the book several times to find out when something occurred or if I missed something.The book also took alot of liberties with time lines and hospital administration matters. Brad is supposed to be a pediatric surgeon who is the head of his own unit. However, he is only 30 if you believe the time line that the author puts in the book. Mallory states that she is 32. Yet she is only a first year resident. Even allowing for the time that she was out of school- 2 years, this time line is not consistent with reality. There were also alot of other inconsistencies which made reading this book very frustrating for me.Also, the appeareance of some of the family members seemed forced and unnecessary to the story. The appearance of the sister Rosa seemed to be in the book solely to set Rosa up as the heroine of the next book. I found two of the scenes with her to be annoying and totally a waste of page space. Should have cut these scenes and used the space to flesh the story out better.Normally I love medical romances. I love the drama and romance in a hospital setting. And like I said, this book started out with a lot of promise. However, it did not live up to it. I kept hoping it would get better but it did not. While reading this book, I kept feeling like it should be dark outside instead of daytime and reading it actually pulled me down. I knew it would have a happy ending because it is a Harlequin after all but frankly, I stopped caring whether they lived happily ever affter and I only finished it out of respect for the $4.99 I spent.I hope this author's other books are better but I will only find out at the library."},{"Title":"Gift from the Mikado","review":"I read this book several times when I was young, I am now nearly forty years old. This book belonged to my mother and it was one of several I read that I believe, she received as part of a young readers' progam in the late 1950's to early 1960's. In reading this book, one must keep in mind that it is written at a simple level, appropriate for a young reader. There is not much character development or a complex plot, which would be difficult for a less advanced reader to follow. As a young boy, I was fascinated by the adventures of this family in a foreign land. The family's religious/Christian nature is all part of the story. It is always sincere and tied in with the narrative. Their interactions with the Japanese do not strike me as being inappropriate, there is nothing mean spirited about them, and they seem in keeping with the setting and time. I am almost tempted to give this book five stars, for the joy I got out of every reading. However, it is not great literature and might not even be a three star book for most adults, but there's something to be said for a nice book with a pleasant story that can bring so much happiness to a child."},{"Title":"Gift from the Mikado","review":"This was an excellent read. There were many stories that gave an idea of Japanese culture and customs. Heartwarming stories of serving God and the many adventures along the way. This was a book that held my 5, 7, and 9 years old captive. They were begging me to keep reading and reading. I really enjoyed the tender lessons of trusting God and seeing his faithfulness. God worked in miraculous ways during their time in Japan. Very entertaining for younger readers especially."},{"Title":"Gift from the Mikado","review":"In the 1890s, an American missionary family from Ashtabula, Ohio is living in Japan, where the father teaches English and works with a committee that is revising a Japanese translation of the Bible. Other members of the family include the mother, Fred (who is eleven when the book begins), Ernest (nine), Daisy (six), Elizabeth (nicknamed Baby-san), who is born during the course of the story, and Cherry the dog. The family lives outside of Tokyo, and Father has a daily commute there, but he is invited to move to Morioka, in the country's interior, to teach English at the university there. It's a unique opportunity, as the missionary society that sponsors him has never ventured outside of the port cities, and the family moves with him.This book is short (176 pages) and plot-driven, but it's also episodic, and not terribly memorable, with barely any character development. Each of the twenty-two chapters describes an incident in the family's life. Some of the anecdotes include meeting and befriending new people, learning more about the Japanese culture, and the various domestic adventures of the little household. A few minor misfortunes befall characters who are warned they are about to do something dangerous, but persist in their folly. Everything always comes right in the end, and God is given the credit.I have mixed feelings about this book. For the most part, it tries to be respectful of the Japanese culture (unlike some virulent tomes that were written during and after WWII), but there are some passages that give me pause, such as the part where Father says, \\"...there are so many disasters in Japan---earthquakes and tidal waves and volcanic eruptions---that poor, ignorant people think evil spirits must bring them. So they believe in ogres, and tengus, and fox gods, because they have never been taught any better.\\" Not an unusual viewpoint during the 1890s or the even the 1950s, but this is not a book I'd give to a child nowadays without explaining that having a different belief system is not a sign of ignorance.It's also remarkable how whenever Father suggests there might be a natural explanation for an allegedly supernatural phenomenon, the Japanese within earshot say, \\"I see.\\" The young reader is left with the impression that Father has educated his audience, but it's just as likely that the listeners were too polite to contradict him or suggest that he had lost his mind.The author was born in Morioka, Japan, of missionary parents, and was the first foreign baby in that region. The book is apparently based on actual incidents that occurred when her family lived in Japan, and had been passed down in her family's oral history before the author wrote them down.It's an okay read---nothing I'd dissuade anyone from reading (after issuing the above caveat), but not something I'd go out of my way to recommend, either."},{"Title":"The New Now and Zen Epicure: Gourmet Vegan Recipes for the Enlightened Palate","review":"This is one of the very best vegan/vegetarian cookbooks I own, and I have well over 20. I've made a number of recipes from it, and all have come out superbly. The dishes are imaginative, and some, like the tofu bourguignon, are good enough facsimiles of the traditional version to satisfy carnivores. I'm especially fond of the roasted red pepper soup and alwys try to keep some of the cashew-tofu-based sour &quot;cream&quot; on hand. Best of all, most of the recipes aren't fussy, requiring hours of preparation. If you're an established vegan, just starting out or simply want to incorporate more vegan dishes into your diet, I can't think of a better book to begin with."},{"Title":"The New Now and Zen Epicure: Gourmet Vegan Recipes for the Enlightened Palate","review":"I had never heard of this cookbook until I stumbled across it at my local library. Having read it, I'm surprised that isn't more widely known and used. Every recipe I tried worked as promised (that doesn't happen too often) and was delicious (that's even rarer). Even better, she doesn't focus on one course- soups, dinner, desserts- or even just the food you're going to eat. She offers recipes for everything from breakfast to dinner, desserts to vegan kitchen staples.Because of this book, I was inspired to make soy yogurt- no problem. And once you have soy yogurt, you have the making for soy sour cream- strain the yogurt as you would dairy yogurt. Save the whey, and then use it for your breads. Because of this book, I have also been using agar to make custards I've missed since giving uo dairy and eggs, and they are so delicious. This book inspired me to make tofu cheese (tofu fermented in miso), and while it doesn't work as a cheese replacement for everything, the flavor has been a welcome addition to my table. Finally, and most importantly, this book inspired me to make my own soy milk and okara, the left overs from the soymilk process. Okara is amazing in your baked goods- they add so much fiber, but they also give a delicious nutty taste. You could buy soy flour, but okara is so much cheaper. It can also be used in vegan patties or vittles- so delicious and moist.Here's the thing- I've seen recipes for all of these ingredients in other cookbooks. However, other cookbooks make it sound like there is a deep dark mystery surrounding their preparation and that you have to observe the utmost care- blah blah blah. The author seems to be aware of that attitude, but she's also shaking her head while she tells you how easy it is to do. And if you follow her instructions, it is.If you're a vegan, this can expand your capabilities in the kitchen."},{"Title":"The New Now and Zen Epicure: Gourmet Vegan Recipes for the Enlightened Palate","review":"Miyoko Nishimoto Schinner has some stunningly wonderful recipes in this book.

But shortly after Sebastian's too-early death, a biography, \\"The Tragedy of Sebastian Knight\\", appears that V considers a \\"slapdash and very misleading book.\\" In response, the strangely loving V commences to research his own book about Sebastian, THE REAL LIFE OF SEBASTIAN KNIGHT. Problem is: V doesn't know Sebastian well. There are a few memories of childhood and the occasional interactions of the distant brothers. Otherwise, V has to rely on Sebastian's five novels, and some gumshoe work, to \\"bring up his life bit by bit... soldering the fragments with my inner knowledge of his character.\\"Basically, Nabokov splits this quest, V's effort to capture his brother's real life, into two narrative elements. The first element, insightful commentary on Sebastian's five novels, is probably a bit of a stretch for many fans of The Nab. Here, V highlights passages from Sebastian's novels and then surrounds them with amazing interpretation, which V says illuminates Sebastian's talent, values, and character. This is certainly an opportunity for Nabokov to offer brilliant fragments. And, this reads like a dazzling spoof of literary criticism and connoisseurship. (Are you reading this, James Wood?) Still, there are moments when V, darting from fragment to fragment in his outpourings of enthusiasm, is hard to follow. Sad to say: but for this reader, this element of the quest is overly literary and I didn't quite get the jokes. Even so, Wikipedia says Edmund Wilson enjoyed this playfulness immensely.On the other hand, V's investigation of Sebastian's personal life is touching and magical. Here, V's learns that Sebastian, despite his rich literary sensibility, lived a lonely and unglamorous life. But in this narrative component, V's social interactions, especially with Mr. Silbermann, are fun and wonderful and sorta like magical realism. The Nab put this in for non-professors like me.As usual with Nabokov, the writing is absolutely great. Here is one of numerous examples, with V describing the burning of Sebastian's letters, which occurs in Chapter 4. \\"But as I was burning them in the grate one sheet of the blue became loose, curving backwards under the torturing flame, and before the crumpling blackness had crept over it, a few words appeared in full radiance, then swooned and all was over.\\"Recommended (but not easy)."},{"Title":"The real life of Sebastian Knight","review":"Vladimir Nabokov is perhaps my very favorite author, and so I approached this work withthe mindset of \\"it must be at least good.\\" It is. It contains the subtlety and puzzling qualities and droll humor of his great works and still manages to work in its own little bit of beauty. It also has its duller stretches, it lacks a real point, and it is more than vaguely pretentious, but nothing unforgivable. As his first full-length work in English, perhaps it should be treated more as an experiment in compositional workability than anything else.The relative ease of reading this as compared to Nabokov's best, like 'Pale Fire' and 'Lolita,' may make it a good introduction to novices."},{"Title":"The real life of Sebastian Knight","review":"I&#8217;m still trying to make some sense of this novel. As my sister has written, it warrants another reading. There is so much to process.And this is because the novel occupies a very slippery place: fictional biography/mystery. It is one or the other or both. And Nabokov is definitely having fun with the various conventions and forms that these two genre frequently utilize.A brother loses another brother. Both brothers are writers. Both brothers in some sense are strangers. The one searches for meaning in the other&#8217;s work. We search for meaning from the other. You are thinking that this is rather confusing without my mentioning names, but I&#8217;ve arrived at a conclusion: these names are meaningless. Most of the characters in this novel are cut-outs, they&#8217;re only loosely imagined. The one brother can be interchanged with the other, and Nabokov often plays with his layering/mirroring.It is a novel about the written word and the power of story, specifically the way a story is shaped by it&#8217;s creator. We watch as V. (which stands for Victor by the way&#8212;thank you very much wikipedia) shapes the chronicle of Sebastian Knight&#8217;s life. Or is Sebastian Knight the real brother?The reader must decide which reality to believe, which brother is the subject of this story. It seems very confusing and yet Nabokov provides this meta-narrative parody in the most simple and straight-forward ways.It is as simple as a brother seeking out the various characters of the other brother&#8217;s life in an attempt to create some kind of truth. That we the reader know this is an impossibility, only makes this search that much more humorous.Nabokov frequently laughs at his readers but I&#8217;ve never felt that more strongly than here in this novel. It was as if he was looking over my shoulder and poking me in the ribs. &#8220;Huh&#8230;uh&#8230;.huh&#8230;you see that. Did you see that?!&#8221;As in many of Nabokov&#8217;s novels, not much really occurs. Tea, train-rides, conversations in a garden, and yet so much is happening behind the scenes, in between these small moments.On most book-covers for The Real Life of Sebastian Knight there is a chess-piece. The novel can and should be viewed as a kind of chess game. We see all the pieces, we see them from multiple angles, and no one is safe.My sister might have some words with me but I dare say that this novel is almost (and it&#8217;s just a fleeting thought dear sister) my favourite of Nabokov&#8217;s novels.I am not sure if I&#8217;m selling this novel properly to you, my casual blog/tumblr reader. The only way to really experience a Vladimir Nabokov novel is to pick one up and dive in. There are some things you will catch and then there are those that you will completely miss. The joy is in knowing that there is always more to discover."},{"Title":"The real life of Sebastian Knight","review":"Nabokov is a challenging author, and this book is no exception but it is his first book that he published in English. How do you write a biography? Can you truly write an unbiased biography? Nabokov beacons this question throughout the book."},{"Title":"The real life of Sebastian Knight","review":"Vladimir Nabokov is one of the giants of the twentieth century literature. He is best known for writing \\"Lolita\\", a book that to this day remains extremely controversial. His writing is characterized by a highly literary and complex style and themes, and some of his later works are almost incomprehensibly difficult to decipher. All of this is that much more fascinating when one takes into the account that English was not Nabokov's native tongue, and he started using it in his writing relatively late in his literary career.\\"The Real Life of Sebastian Knight\\" is Nabokov's first English language novel, and in many respects it's the most accessible work stemming from his English phase. The story is conventional enough - a Russian &eacute;migr&eacute; in the 1930s Europe is trying to piece together the secrets in the life of his recently deceased half brother, Sebastian Knight. The two have largely been out of touch during most of their adult lives, and piecing together the intimate details of Sebastian's life turns out to be a bit of a detective work. The narrator, identified only by his initial V., has been admiring his half-brother's literary career, and is intent on making sure that Sebastian's works are appreciated and promoted.The novel contains many allusions to Nabokov's own life, including many big autobiographical chunks. Nabokov was also in real life alienated from his own brother, but one gets sense that both V. and Sebastian Knight are in a large measure based on Nabokov himself. The book's ending only serves to highlight this ambiguity.The style of writing is equally very accessible, but even here are present certain stylistic devices that Nabokov would push to their limit in his later works: wordplays, literary and other allusions, and the blurring of the line between the fiction and the reality. In many subtle ways V. is a prototypical unreliable narrator, another of Nabokov's often-used stratagems.This is a very well crafted novel that will appeal to most Nabokov's fans, even though it doesn't dazzle with complexity and literary mastery of his later works. It's definitely a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"The real life of Sebastian Knight","review":"I'll probably get hate mail for saying this, because smart people are all supposed to agree, smartly, that this is a lesser work, but this is one of my favorite books of all time. I chose it when it was my turn to choose a book for my book club, and people were like... \\"meh\\" -- but if you like Nabokov, you've got to read this one. What I love are the many layers of meaning, which of course I'm not going to talk about because you've got to delve into that yourself.Best Nabokov book ever."},{"Title":"The real life of Sebastian Knight","review":"If any other author had written this I would have given it 5 stars. The use of English is, as usual, fantastic, but for some reason it didn't come together for me as a whole."},{"Title":"The real life of Sebastian Knight","review":"What has Nabokov written that is not of importance, or at least another contribution to the artistry of his sensibility? For those who love VN this is good stuff."},{"Title":"The real life of Sebastian Knight","review":"To place my reading of this book in context, I am an avowed Nabokov fangirl and this is my 11th of his novels and 14th of his books generally. This is not my favorite of his by any means, but I give it 5 stars because being a lesser work in the Nabokov canon is not really a condemnation. Even a run-of-the-mill Nabokov can hold its own with most novels.The elements of mystery, deception, and other literary hijinks that you encounter in this book will be much more confusing or surprising for readers new to Nabokov. If you have read other works of his before, particularly other works with similar focus on a mystery and suspense-- like \\"Lolita\\" or \\"Despair\\"-- these tricks and traps will be familiar or even repetitive. That did not make them less enjoyable, but it did color my reading because (knowing Nabokov) I had worked out the mysteries of the plot before their climactic revelations. The plot twists in this sense are also much less obscure than they are in \\"Lolita\\" (though admittedly that was my first Nabokov and I was caught completely unawares by the ending the first time around). He hilariously mocks the detective genre, referring to plot devices that any reader of Agatha Christie will recognize immediately, but then ironically employs rather similar tricks. There are the usual Nabokovian elements of coincidence and absurdity, which culminate in the \\"deathbed revelations\\" and are evocative of the cruel but remarkably funny absurdities of \\"Laughter in the Dark.\\" As Nabokov's first work in English, \\"Sebastian Knight\\" provides an interesting example of the development of his vision and style.As far as the themes particular to this book, the meditation on identity that occurs throughout and reaches its apex in the final pages is provocative and deeply interesting. Remain attuned as you're reading to these little jokes of identity and you will be much more appreciative of this ending. The book is on the whole wonderfully funny, significantly lighter in tone than some of his novels (which is saying something). I would recommend it in particular to those who are familiar with the genre of literary biography or detective novels, as this is quite an entertaining parody of those, or to those dedicated readers who wish to know more of Nabokov's views on the hereafter, women, and modern literature in general. But if this is the only Nabokov you will ever read, you'd do much better to choose \\"Lolita,\\" \\"Pale Fire,\\" or, if you have more time and effort to spare, \\"Ada, or Ardor: A Family Chronicle.\\""},{"Title":"The real life of Sebastian Knight","review":"The reviewer from Seoul unfortunately has fallen pray to Nabokov's tricks. The femme fatale, the quest for a brother, the mysterious stranger who helps V., V.'s apologies for his poor writing (which I suspect few could match) are all quite deliberately satirical. Anyone who reads the novel, believing everything they are told, will miss a lot. The reader should especially keep an eye out for the wonderful interaction between life and text. This is probably one of Nabokov's &quot;simpler&quot; novels in the sense that most of the tricks are visible as tricks, even if one cannot at first identify them. A fine novel, even if it does not match Nabokov's later English works."},{"Title":"The real life of Sebastian Knight","review":"A book like this is so full of gems that for all intents and purposes it is without flaw. Understanding Sebastian Knight pretty much means understanding how literary genius works. The book is loaded with humour that will be above the head of most err stupid people. I saw Nabokov sitting and smiling at me at times as I read. The world is full of Dr. Goodmann's - that is for sure. Best to take a long time and read this book slowly, out loud of course, doesn't that go without saying?"},{"Title":"The real life of Sebastian Knight","review":"My English not being my mother language has attracted me to Nabokov. And I admire him enourmously.But this novel was almost a disappointment, because, though it is so good at times, the almost plotless tale reaches a climax of the futile and bore when (we are already somewhere in the middle of the book)he narrator, who is by then in search of a lady, indulges in a series of inane dialogues whose aim eluded me. And the eighteenth chapter is wonderful, though I disliked also the final chapters, this simulacrum of impetus and parody of revelation on the very point of dying."},{"Title":"The real life of Sebastian Knight","review":"This is the first book I chanced to meet Nabokov. He wrote this book when he was 38 and none belived that this could make a grade on literature. But like Proust, he became a famous writer and as the Remembrance to the Things Past, to The Real Life of Sebastian Knight . I think this book was written with very profound thought after reading the Remembrance to the Things Past. And he seemed to overcomed the REAL DILEMA of Time( or deconstruct) and Liturature in his own way that doesn't be showed in RtTP."},{"Title":"The real life of Sebastian Knight","review":"Nabokov intension, until he discovered for himself the wonderful world of pop-culture (cf. Lolita and Ada), was really to describe truth and beauty (see 'Luzhin's defense', 'Gift' etc.) in the tradition of the Old World, and play less with cheep riddles and collective phobias. His dealing with the issue of death, as in 'Ultima Thule' etc., appears also here; the last book written by Knight is, however, written about in a pale and uninspiring way (Nabokov could not make his vision clear?), and, surprisingly for Nabokov, is not free of commonplaces and dejavous. All in all the book is original and interesting, as nearly everything Nabokov wrote. And, by the way, the treatment of the relation narrator-genius (commonplace in itself, unfortunately) looks better than in Mann's Doctor Faustus, where it is taken quite heavily (one does not see the traces of the hammer blows).Side remark: the stars practice is really annoying: isn't there a way to write about books without grading them?"},{"Title":"The real life of Sebastian Knight","review":"This exquisitely written novel fills one with despair. It is a sadness that was perhaps felt by many after such rare and creative geniuses as Mozart, Van Gogh, Shubert, and Gershwin all died too young after such short careers. Some of these men, like Sebastian Knight, died in relative obscurity. Sebastian's half-brother, the narrator of this novel, enters upon a journey to uncover the last months of Sebastian's life, to discover his secret, and perhaps to find out about the shadowy woman who was supposedly his last lover.Sebastian's handful of books were admired by some of the critics, who found them scholarly and poetic, and his last novel was judged a masterpiece. Most of Sebastian's books were little read by a public who were probably more inclined to read the popular potboilers of the day. The half-brother, while loving and admiring Sebastian, barely knew him himself, only knowing that Sebastian lead a lonely, sad existence, and that he suffered from a congenital heart condition. What lends much of the novel its sadness is the palpable desperation of the narrator's quest. While his efforts in uncovering his brother's secret may have been less than successful, he did learn much about what Nabokov calls our common shared humanity with the souls of others. This is a beautifully written and heartfelt narrative that should be read by those who appreciate great literature."},{"Title":"The real life of Sebastian Knight","review":"This is my first try with Nabokov, and I must say that I was almost overwhelmed by his masterful and playful use of the English language. A fun little detective story rests atop a rather dark investigation into the nature of human identity. In fact, there are many layers of meaning mixed up with so many cruel jests in this book, that often I found myself passing them by, promising aloud that I would read the book many more times. Recommended for all serious readers."},{"Title":"The real life of Sebastian Knight","review":"I usually dislike the unreliability and uncertainty of the postmodern novel, the often tiresome games the writer plays with the reader's credulity, the deliberate undercutting of the illusion of reality. But for me at least Nabokov succeeds where so many fail. This is a charming and convincing narrative, mixed with what strikes me as a deliberately insoluble mystery of identity. I can't tell you why it works; perhaps just because it is extremely well-written without a touch of the self-conscious strain of modern \\"literary\\" writing. Lots of humor. Very satisfying read."},{"Title":"The real life of Sebastian Knight","review":"According to the Introduction by Conrad Brenner this was written in 1938 in Paris. It was Nabokov's first book composed in English, although I understand he had translated \\"Despair\\" into English from his Russian in 1935. What stands out to me is the contrast between the English English of \\"Sebastian Knight\\" and the American English that he employed so marvelously in \\"Lolita.\\" Only a master of language--which Nabokov is without doubt--could have written both novels. Yet, while the differences in idiom, spelling and expression are true and distinct, the intricate, precise composition of plot and the deliberate game-playing with the reader, which are hallmarks of Nabokov's unique style, are very much the same in both novels.What isn't the same is the experience for the reader. In \\"Lolita\\" Nabokov plays upon the reader's sense of what is right and wrong to the extent that we find ourselves in sympathy with Humbert Humbert who, objectively speaking, is a pedophile, a rapist and a child abductor. In \\"Sebastian Knight\\" our sympathies are confused, at least in the beginning, although in the end it is hard not to identify with Sebastian's loving half-brother who does the first person narration. What Nabokov plays with is the reader's sense of who really is narrating the story. The authorial command of the book--the authentic voice behind the telling of the events--is it really Sebastian's nearly anonymous half-brother or is he just a shill for Sebastian himself? Or is this (on another level) a story of Vladimir Nabokov himself as this brilliant writer \\"Sebastian Knight\\" told by Nabokov in the guise of a supposed younger, adoring half-brother?This is the trick of the novel. How Nabokov adores tricks! How he loves to fool and misguide the reader and play with the reader's sensibilities and perceptions! He does this because to Nabokov the novel is a deception, an art form like all art forms that relies on a representation of truth controlled by the artist. What is the truth of Sebastian's life? What is the truth about Nabokov's life? Was he in some sense the tortured Sebastian whose work was misunderstood and misinterpreted by the vain and stupid Mr. Goodman? Was he in some other sense Humbert Humbert whose shameful acts could only see the light of day in a novel?Nabokov has answered in the negative. He insists that his characters are puppets on his--the artist's--string. And of course we must not commit the biographical fallacy--or so I was taught many years ago in undergraduate English classes. But no artist's life is completely removed from his work. And no writer of fiction can completely divorce himself from reliance on that which he knows intimately. What is marvelous about the great writers--Tolstoy, Shakespeare, et al., and Nabokov himself--is their ability to be so many characters and in those characters to display the psychological veracity that makes the characters seem truer than true.It is interesting to know that Nabokov, after the success of \\"Lolita,\\" went back and translated into English the novels he wrote in Russian under the pen name V. Sirin. It is also interesting to read at the end of Chapter 18 in \\"Sebastian Knight\\" these words: \\"And sometimes I tell myself that it would not be inordinately hard to translate ...[Sebastian's novel 'The Doubtful Asphodel'] into Russian.\\" Here again the narrator is at odds with himself as to his English language abilities. Before he was poor in English; now he could be a translator from English into Russian.This raises the further question, mentioned below, as to what extent we can trust the younger brother--perhaps with younger brother aspirations--on other matters. We might ask ourselves, is the narrator being fair to M. Goodman? To what extent is he objective about Sebastian? We can even ask are Sebastian's strangely named novels really all that good? The prose selected as quotes from those novels is striking yes, but so is the prose of our (unreliable?) narrator, who although he claims no expertise in the English language, gives the lie to that bit of modesty by writing (as far as this reader can tell) as well as his older half-brother. The sense we have about the authorial voice is further confused by how much both brothers sound alike. Normally this would be a fault, but because Nabokov's intent is to fuse the three authors--himself, Sebastian and the first person narrator--into one in such a way as to suggest to the reader that artifice and reality are not so easily distinguished.What I also like about this novel is the sense of Europe between the two great wars that Nabokov achieves. There are no dark clouds hanging over Europe, and there is almost no mention of the senseless war that ended some twenty years before. Nabokov and his characters care not the slightest for politics or international intrigues. There is a clear, deliberate effort at showing life entirely without war or the threat or aftermath of war. Only once does Nabokov acknowledge that there is a political world beyond the day-to-day concerns of his characters. Near the end of the book as his hero is rushing madly to get to Sebastian before he dies, he asks in passing, \\"Who were those idle idiots who wrote on the wall, 'Death to the Jews'?...\\"Few writers can use coincidence to surprise and delight the reader the way Nabokov can. One recalls Charlotte Haze conveniently killing herself off at exactly the right time by running out in front of an automobile. In Sebastian Knight we have the narrator conveniently meet on a train a man, who for unknown reasons comes to the narrator's aid and helps him find the identity of a mysterious woman that Sebastian loved and lost.Finally I have to say that for many readers this novel will develop too slowly and too obscurely to be readily appreciated. But stay with it. It builds to a kind of intriguing lucidity and even develops into a dramatic narrative toward the end.[Note: Nearly a hundred of my fiction reviews by great literary artists and others not so well known are now available in my book, \\"Novels and other Fictions.\\" Get it at Amazon.]Novels and other Fictions: reviews by"},{"Title":"The real life of Sebastian Knight","review":"Once I had closely re-read the first 10-20 pages to better absorb the personal histories, which I found confusing at first read, I was well-fortified to enjoy the rest of the book. The writing is fabulous and I liked the mystery motif. There were very few slow spots and plenty of humor and seeming insight, yet the book had only a superficial effect on me. I left not really feeling I understood Sebastian or his half-brother (Knight's biographical researcher) very well at all -- and not particularly caring either, because it was so pleasant to read and I'm not sure that it was the author's intention to make us really care about the characters. While there is deep philosophy discussed, the book had a lightweight feel. Maybe that was the intent of the book -- to make the point that people (the half-brother biographer and the famous brother) are ultimately indescribable no matter how much you describe them and their acts. Or maybe it was just a display of great writing that was intended to transcend the content, a virtuoso display. In a certain way it reminded me of the previous book I read, This Side of Paradise by F.Scott Fitzgerald, in that each is the story about a purportedly brilliant young author (Fitzgerald himself, and the fictional Sebastian Knight). But Fitzgerald's book, while sophomoric and at times silly in the beginning, ultimately became quite serious and almost sublime -- plus we know what actually happened to talented Fitzgerald, adding another layer of poignancy. Nabokov's book also reminded me of some of the Nouveau Roman authors of the 1950's-1960's where all of the detail is just an intellectual game, not intended for serious reader involvement. Nevertheless, I will definitely read more of Nabokov. This was I believe his first book in English and I figured I would start there."},{"Title":"The real life of Sebastian Knight","review":"Vladimir Nabokov is one of the giants of the twentieth century literature.

I'm assuming that, in another setting or another season, I might have relished its artifice. All the earmarks of Nabokov's verbal virtuosity are there -- the puns, the word games, the slithering tangles of syntax, the lapidary images, the delicious snobbery, the coyly contrived misapprehensions-- but in this book, somehow, his pretences seem uncomfortably pretentious and his precious jewels of language get to be annoyingly 'precieux'.\\"The Real Life of Sebastian Knight\\" is the first-person account of a Russian emigr&eacute;'s attempt to write the biography of his older half-brother, Sebastian, a novelist who may or may not have been acclaimed as a literary genius before his untimely death of heart failure. We have, it's important to note, only the narrator's word for the dead author's brilliance; the frequent quotes from Sebastian Knight's writings are curiously ungainly and at times quite foolish-sounding. After a lengthy description of Sebastian's childhood and education -- an oddly incomplete and disjointed account because, as \\"V\\" confesses, he didn't share much with his brother or maintain intimate contact with him after emigration from Russia -- the biographer focuses his compulsion and our attention on a mystery, the identity of a Russian woman whom Sebastian met at a health spa, for whom he abandoned his wife. The fact is that V had no idea of the woman's existence until he was charged, in his brother's will, with the destruction of her letters, and not until the flames are already consuming those letters does V realize that he needs to 'know' the mystery lover in order to penetrate into his brother's inner life.Frankly, to my reading taste, Nabokov takes far too long preparing the mystery. Fully the first half of the novel seems merely an exercise in indirection, and I found myself tempted to toss it aside. Was the already great Russian writer struggling to find his 'voice' in English? If so, he found it only halfway through the book. The second half, the unraveling of the Russian lover's identity and the narrator's attempt to subsume his own identity in his brother's 'soul', makes a compellingly kinky story."},{"Title":"The real life of Sebastian Knight","review":"Vladimir Nabokov is one of the giants of the twentieth century literature.

Although Nabokov's decision to adopt English as his literary languge had more to do with financial considerations than for psychological or existential reasons, he must have considered the decision profound enough to make it a priciple theme of the novel. His protagonist, the Russian born Sebastian Knight, not only writes in English, but has taken his English mother's maiden name and turns his back on his native country and language - only to make a desperate effort, at the end of his life, to regain some of his Russian identity.There are many parallels between Nabokov, the author, and Sebastian Knight: both were raised in St. Petersburg, both spoke English as a child, both were educated at Cambridge and both made the decision to write in English (although Nabokov published nine novels and many short stories in Russian before the switch), but to call the novel autobiographical would be a stretch. It is, however, a biography. Sebastian's half-brother, V, disgusted with the only other biography of his brother, written by a hack who is more interested in social generalizations than in his subject's art, and who attributes Sebastian's death to \\"the inability of a sensitive soul to withstand the anguish of the epoch\\", decides to write his own account. Although the half-brother is a businessman and has had no previous literary experience, he is able to write an excellent biography because he is concerned with Sebastian's thought processes and his art. How V accumulates the details associated with his brother's life is the focus of the novel and is, as the publisher notes, a \\"literary detective story.\\"As with any detective story, the sleuth often tries to assume the identity of the investigated (at least pyschologically) in order to solve the case, and often there is a blurring of identities as one personality morphs into another. As with detectives, so it is with writers. Brother V, immersing himself into the life and art of his brother, Sebastian, begins to think as his brother and his writing acquires an art of its own. And the morphing does not stop here. The plots of two of Sebastian's novels should be familiar to readers of Nabokov's Russian fiction. The Eye and The Gift are both discernible in the works of Sebastian and just as Sebastian and V become indelibly entwined, so does Vladimir Nabokov, as both creator and colleague of the two characters."},{"Title":"A changing image: American perceptions of the Arab-Israeli dispute","review":"\\"A Changing Image: American Perceptions of the Arab-Israeli Dispute\\" by Richard H. Curtiss, English, 390 pgs, hardback, 1982 (1st ed.), 1986. The author served as Deputy Director of the U.S. Information Agency's office of Near East, North African and South Asian African Affairs in the 1970s. Essentially, the author somehow believes that peace would occur in the Middle East if Israel would just withdraw its settlements from the West Bank and return to its pre-1967 \`boundaries'. Perhaps many ardent Israelis would view this book as \\"anti-Israel\\". This is not a pro-Israel book; but then, it's not really an \\"anti-Jew\\" book - it's just that the author believes that \`peace' won't come to the Middle East until the U.S. drops its \`anything goes' support of Israel. The author describes Israeli Prime Minister Begin as \\"Machiavellian\\" (p. 214), \\"trickery\\" (p. 215), and \\"if not that of a madman\\" (p. 215). In reviewing the photographs in this book, the author displays his bias (sympathies) by his showing the \`power' of the Israeli military through tanks and shellings, and the \`down troddeness' of the Palestinians through photographs of wounded Palestinians. If any American politician had made any statement disapproving of some Israeli political or military action, the author seems to found many of them to reprint herein. Contents chapters include: President Wilson's Fourteen Points and the Palestine Mandate; Pres. Roosevelt's limited support to Zionists, Pres. Truman and the Creation of Israel, Pres. Eisenhower and the Suez Crises, Pres. Kennedy, Pres. Johnson and the Six-Day War, Pres. Nixon and the Rogers Plan, the October War, Pres. Carter and Camp David, Pres. Reagan on Israel's invasion of Lebanon, The Israel Lobby, the Arab Lobby, Arab Diplomatic activities, Christian Churches support of Israel, Congress - For Sale or Rent to Israel, with an appendix of polls: 1946-1986. I found this book to be very informative for \`background' material, not for a \`well balanced' analysis of the overall Israel-Palestine issue. I'm sure an ardent Israel supporter could detail many hundreds of criticisms of this book due to lack of 'balance' or 'objectivity' regarding many issues."},{"Title":"A changing image: American perceptions of the Arab-Israeli dispute","review":"Abraxas says:In reading the review I should add that the author of this book worked for the State department and U.S. Information Agency where he received the agencys highest honor \\" The Edward R Morrow for excellence in public Diplomacy\\". He was stationed through out the middle east. His book is favorably reviewed by seven U.S. ambassadors, Three presidents (Carter, Ford , and Nixon), and three congressmen. When I read phrases like: \\"I'm sure an ardent Israel supporter could detail many hundreds of criticisms of this book due to lack of 'balance' or 'objectivity' regarding many issues.\\" or, \\"the author displays his bias (sympathies) by his showing the \`power' of the Israeli military through tanks and shellings, and the \`down troddeness' of the Palestinians through photographs of wounded Palestinians.\\", the bias of the reviewer comes through. The state of Israel was born in terror by people like the terrorist head of Irgun- Begin. Another quote of the review: \\"The author describes Israeli Prime Minister Begin as \\"Machiavellian\\" (p. 214), \\"trickery\\" (p. 215), and \\"if not that of a madman\\". Actually that describes him pretty well. The modern age of terrorism was born with his bombing of the King David Hotel with huge loss of life. Not to mention the assassination of the U.N. represenative Bernadotte Folke by another future prime minister- Shamir of the Stern gang. Israel is not our fifty first state but you would think so given it's protection in the security council with more U.S. vetoes condemning it than all other vetoes by all other members combined for any reason. And the three billion plus a year. Israel demands inspection of Iran and threatens war yet refuses any inspections itself. Americas prestige after the war in the middle east was enormous and has turned to hate. Truman's secretary of state, George Marshall, said to recognize Israel would lead to a half century of conflict and turn the region against us. He was optimistic."},{"Title":"Tell Me Where the Trees Find Shelter?","review":"Paula Ross', Tell Me Where The Trees Find Shelter is an extremely well planted alphabet flourishing garden.

I think most people will find a bit of themselves in this book. They will also find good advice, tips, scripture, and welcome solutions to real problems.This is a different kind of parenting book. It doesn't lecture, just presents ideas that have been tried and proven they will work. Tricia Goyer has played an active part in parenting programs and young mom's groups.

Her advice and encouragement is always accompanied with a biblical reference to tie the author's words to the Word.The author gives lots of interesting facts about the different generations and their different characteristics. Another interesting feature is all the quotes from other GenX parents giving their point-of-view. In additon, with all the 80s music lyric references, how could the GenX member not \\"feel right at home?\\"The book is well written in simple language. It doesn't come from some \\"too hard to read\\" technical perspective, but from the perspective of a fellow struggling GenX parent. Ms. Goyer notes that she too struggles with parenting issues at times, so the reader is placed (not beneath) but right beside the author...as we all are seeking to be the parents that God wants us to be.A study guide (by chapter) is included at the end of the book for a more indepth personal look at each chapter...and each section complete with a number of biblical references for study.There's so much great information in this book!Tricia ends the book on such a positive note that you can't help but be proud to be a part of GenX and encouraged to be the best GenX parent that you can be!"},{"Title":"Generation NeXt Parenting: A Savvy Parent's Guide to Getting it Right","review":"This is a great book even if you are not a Generation Xer.

Tricia's insight from her own childhood lead her to change her parenting style to separate her from her baby boomer parents. This book is easy to pick up and start reading from where you left off. She has a style of writing, which incorporates original text, Biblical reference, quotes from other parents, and 156 other cited authors. She is able to bring each chapter together with an 80's song lyric which brought back a lot of my teen memories. In this day and age we are inundated with an overwhelming amount of how-to books.

Here, too, Goyer deals with believable scenarios and honest struggles that Christian parents face.I am the father of two daughters, ages 12 and 14. My wife and I have parented from the onset with the belief that we want to prepare our kids for life, not just protect them from it. Goyer finds that balance in this easy-to-read book, offering encouragement and philosophical angles to raising children. The pages are rich with spiritual insight, Scriptural foundations, and bits of humor. The quotes from Gen-X bands (Chicago, Gloria Estefan, Talking Heads, etc) add a light touch to these sometimes serious issues.If you're struggling with your own generational parenting style, if you're wondering how well you are doing in God's eyes, or if you're just interested in a wise, yet never pompous, guide to \\"getting it right,\\" then Tricia Goyer's book is for you.

I am on the line between Boomers and GenXers. Different sources have placed me in each camp, so if I'm a GenXer, I'm an old one.My review will be from the perspective of an old GenXer with a teenager and young adult children. At times, as I read \\"Generation NeXt\\" I felt exactly that, old, but then I'd turn a few pages and identify with exactly what Tricia had penned.Had I read this book when my children were younger, I think I would have gained insight leading to freedom from some guilt baggage I lugged around for far too many years.Tricia's \\"Generation NeXt Parenting\\" is an encouraging pat on the back with plenty of spiritual and practical challenges tossed in. She doesn't take traditional problems and toss out advice on how to handle it as much as she covers the holistic issues of parenting and Christlikeness.If you are looking for another parenting book that has an index and multiple tips on how to handle potty training, you won't find much in \\"Generation NeXt.\\" However, if you desire to dig to underlying motivations on your part and your children's behaviors, there is help offered here. Of course, a lot of the advice is what we who call ourselves \\"Christian\\" know because it's preached from the pulpit, radio and other books. But it bears repeating until we \\"get\\" it. Tricia gives practical ideas for how to get on track or back on track spiritually so that you can be the parent God calls you to be.I learned far more from \\"Generation NeXt\\" than I thought I would.

Tricia Goyer peppers the book with questions answered not only by experts in the field, but by parents in the trenches. The advice offered is practical and down to earth, but based always on Biblical principles. With Goyer's steady encouragement through the book, she helps us realize that we can make the changes that will help to change and fortify us as parents. \\"Why didn't I think of that?\\" easily turns to, \\"I can do that.\\" Goyer's light-hearted style makes you want to try the tips in the book, and to work out the Digging Deeper Study Guide questions at the end of the book.Many of the references evoke a right old trip down memory lane. You can't help but smile and reminisce. Each chapter in Generation NeXt Parenting also begins with a quote from a popular song of the 70's and 80's. From the get-go, with the cover picture of a black Trans Am with a Blondie bumper sticker, an \`80s RUL' license plate, and a \`Baby on Board' displayed, you know you'll be in for a treat. Goyer slips in fun facts and stats mixed with present day concerns, like \\"How much Nintendo is too much?\\" Goyer offers faith-based answers to things we all struggle with. In the chapter Faith, not Fear, Goyer brings it down to this question: \\"Of course we believe in a victorious life eternal, but what about faith for victorious life in the present?\\" And, really, isn't that what we all strive for? It's right to keep our eyes forward and focused towards the prize at the end of the race, but it's the race itself that we have to keep in training for on a daily basis. And Generation NeXt Parenting is a great tool to train with, hand in hand with your Bible. This guide is truly a plethora of practical help.

It received considerable critical praise and numerous awards, but it was no more than a marginal commercial success until the early 1970s, when it at last began to reach an audience beyond the core of science-fiction fans who so praised it--and in fact its designation as a \\"science-fiction masterpiece\\" prevented me from reading the book from well over a decade, for science-fiction is not a genre I particularly enjoy.But I will make an exception for DUNE. This may seem an odd comparison, but in a certain sense it is somewhat like GONE WITH THE WIND: it is long, it is flawed, and it is occasionally silly in a stylistic sense--but you just can't stop reading the damn thing. To pick up DUNE is to find yourself locked in its pages until exhaustion claims you, and on the three occasions I have read the book I have done so over the course of a single day. Such is the power of Herbert's vision and narrative that nothing else matters.An outline of the plot reads like \\"space opera\\" of the least inspired variety: an ecologically hostile planet becomes the center of galactic intrigue due to the fact that is the only known source of a substance--in this instance described as a \\"spice.\\" But what Hebert does with the idea is completely unexpected. DUNE is not a tedious rehash of Edgar Rice Burroughs; it is an astonishing portrait of an unexpectedly plausible civilization in which politics, religion, and corruption begin to spin wildy out of control.Perhaps the single most astonishing thing about DUNE is that there really isn't much in the way of \\"science\\" in this science-fiction. Not only is this a universe in which computers are forbidden, they are plausibly forbidden--and while Herbert is adept at inventing (and, perhaps even more difficult, convincingly naming) futuristic equipment, he doesn't actually spend a tremendous amount on it. The items simply exist in much the same way as you or I might regard a cup and saucer. It is a turn of mind that makes these devices remarkable plausible.Moreover, it has the effect of focusing the story on the characters, the civilization, and the planet itself. And it is here that Herbert really knocks the ball out the park: Duke Leto, Lady Jessica, Paul, Chani--every character is remarkably well rendered, their backgrounds and struggles and ambitions equally so, and the ecology of the planet an overriding concern as the struggle to survive in what is easily one of the most hostile enviroments ever to spring forth from a writer's mind.Herbert wrote several more DUNE novels before his death and his son has continued the series. I have sampled a few, and while I'm sure many will disagree, I have to say that they should have left well enough alone; there is only one DUNE, and this is it. And if you have seen the truly dire film version--don't let that stop you from picking up the book. Because once you do, you won't put it down until you turn the last page.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This review applies specifically to the new audiobook version of Dune. I would generally rate Frank Herbert's Dune as one of the greatest sci fi books of all time (5 stars), but the audiobook version lacks something in its portayal. The reading switches between a single person and a cast, the main difference being that some chapters have the one reader doing the voices of the book's characters and then the voices are being done by a distinctly different series of individuals. Most of the time this makes little difference, but there are enough instances where the portayal of a character is so different between the cast's rendering and the single reader's that it becomes very distracting. For example, Count Fenring is a totally different character while being read by the one reader than when he has his own cast member doing the voice. This was enough to pull me out of the story and cause me to reflect on why the flip back and forth between the styles of audiobook reading. So, this telling of Dune loses one star for its confusing rendering."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"If someone ever tells you this story sucks, ask them if they read it or watched the 80s movie. Herbert's world is as interesting as it is bizarre, and as weird as it is, it manages to be believable.

This novel proves it. Taking place on the barren desert planet, Arrakis, otherwise known as simply Dune to the native Fremen, Paul Maud'dib Atreides has ruled his galactic throne with a religious jihad, ordaining himself as the God Emperor of the Galaxy. But how can a man of flesh, though thought to be messiah of the Fremen, claim to be God? This ruler who's body is not strong enough to repel the radiation of an atomic blast succumbs to physical blindness. Planets across his domain beg for a constitution against the emperor's despotic reign. And all Paul Maud'dib really wants is to secure the safety of his concubine Chani and their twin heirs. But the emperors prophetic visions will not allow for the survival of both.What is phenomenal about this tragedy is the inner struggle of an icon of worship. Even messiahs are only humans. Paul Maud'dib will have to unravel a conspiracy between the shipping guild, the face dancers, the school of witches, and his own wife princess. Marriage being political to secure the imperial throne from the last emperor. Paul Maud'dib will have to do all this and sacrifice one love over another before he too gives up his life for the desert as a true Fremen. The blind are a waist of water. His Prophetic visions will only give him so much sight until the Emperor God himself is rendered a waist of water. This is a powerful read that left me spellbound."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Only twice in my life have I been so enthralled by a book I've read it cover-to-cover without stop. \\"Dune\\" was one of them.In \\"Dune\\", Frank Herbert created both a world and a future universe so complete and wondrously rich in every way that it's impossible to convey even a small portion of what makes it so compelling.Take the human race as it might be several thousands of years in the future... scatter it through the stars... bring back a new form of space-going feudalism... infuse it with philosophies and religions never before known... introduce human computers, blood feuds, intrigues and political machinations Macchiavelli would have been proud of... people it with mysterious desert tribesmen who ride great 100-meter-long sandworms for transport... top it all with a millenia-long breeding program designed to fulfill a prophecy... and bind it all with \\"melange\\", the spice that is the only thing that enables star-pilots to navigate between the stars. This gives you just the tiniest glimpse of what makes Dune one of the classic science-fiction novels of all time.The story takes place on Arrakis, a planet where water is so scarce a person can be killed for the water held in their flesh. It is also the only place where the fabulous spice melange is found. And melange is the greatest source of wealth and power in the galaxy.Young Paul Atriedes is swept up in this world of danger, mystery, sand and spice, and before he is through, he'll become a messiah to an entire world... or die in the attempt."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is by far the best book i've ever read. Even if you don't like sci-fi you should still give it a shot. This book is extremely rich, it has so many philosophical implications and so many cultural and political things that are well blended. The plot is like nothing i've ever seen, so much better than a lot of books out there....... yeah, the book is a little hard to understand and sometimes you have to read a chapter twice to truly understand what's going on, but it's worth it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"But is is what it is. I never liked Science Fiction, and much rather preferred reading Fantasy books. Then I read DUNE. This is the SciFi book for fantasy book fans. It is a great mixture of mysticism and adventure, with a dose of realism blended with high adventure. Frank Herbert truly created a masterpiece with DUNE, a storyline with deep characters and intriguing plot. It is a balance of all the things I love about reading books, and it's a fun read because of it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The most amazing book I have ever read (by far), Dune is unique in that it has a little bit of everything (politics, science, religion, philosophy, technology)"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is truly the best sci-fi book ever written. An epic plot with intrigue and details that spans vast distances. If you love sci-fi you must own this book!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Frank Herbert formulated Dune by conducting extensive research on ancient legends and determining which elements would best serve as the foundation for his novel. Indeed, the story of a disinherited prince (as personified by the book's hero Paul Atreides) who takes on a different identity to lead oppressed people against his one time enemies, is a story that has been told since the beginning of human culture. Another classic element is a secret organization (of which the hero's mother, the Lady Jessica, is an agent) that influences the vast world though its secret hand.Upon this classic foundation Hebert builds a space-faring culture ten thousand years in the future. A holy war that occurred centuries before the birth of the book's hero resulted in the dictate that no machine should attempt to emulate the human mind--a mandate that essentially outlaws computers. This technological constraint results in the evolution of special classes of human beings able to assume the burden that would normally fall to electronic computation. Calculation and strategy fall to the cool mental computations of Mentats. Guiding the superluminal starships that link the planets of a galactic feudal empire is the essential task of Guild Navigators--whose capabilities are only possible by ingesting the drug \\"spice\\" that allows them to see a bit into the future.The drug spice is seen to be the most valuable commodity in this world. Its value is considerably enhanced by the fact that it is the mysterious product of a single desert world--the inhospitable Arrakis--a planet peopled by the fierce but oppressed Fremen--who are seen to be the descendents of our Earth's desert Arabs. Vying for the control of this vital substance is the royal house of hero Paul Atreides and the rival royal house of the evil Harkonen family. This book is the story of Paul Atreides as he comes to reclaim his mantle of authority and lead the Fremen in a actual jihad against the forces of evil."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Does it get much better than this?

Never have I flown through a book so quickly. Dune opens the reader up to a variety of intense emotions, it's language and depth so well conceived that one moment you're feeling a wave of grief and the next moment you are trying to control your anger right along with Paul, resisting the urge to take revenge too quickly. At times, the concepts of good and evil merge with the notion that maybe this really is just all politics, and then you begin to nurture the thought of watching it all go down in flames. An epic to remember for sure, and I cannot wait to move on to the next book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"im twelve and i started reading this book it wasnt as comlex as i thought it was but it was long the print on the page alone was tiny and trust me i have read long books before i read almost halfway i think but i got board of the book"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Easiest 800 pages I've ever read.

So I tried to read it again. There are some great scenes and characters but it takes a long time to get there. I gave up about half way through. I think it does get better after the coup, but it's much further into the book that I expected. The writing style is kind of gets in the way, although it does mask a bit where some of this is coming from. Like most of these types of books it's based on European history, colonization etc. Spice is oil. The desert people are Arabs etc. I didn't even think of that when I read it as a kid, but now it seems like he takes too long setting this up."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Herbert's Dune series is a life's work that made the world of literature better.

However, I'm glad that I chose to read Brian Herbert's introduction at the beginning of the book. It really helped me to keep Dune Messiah in the right perspective.

I can definitely recommend it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Having only read the two Dune novels and having loved the first one so much, I couldn't believe how dull this one was. What a huge let down.

I have now read this four or five times and I can see where so many other authors have borrowed from the work of Frank Herbert. The entire series is good, but the first one was a masterpiece.Hebert is one of the few authors who can do it all, and do it remarkably well. He is a storyteller supreme, keeping you on the edge of your seat, poised to turn pages the instant the last word is read. He is an intricate plotter, creating mastermind plots that reel you in, twist you around and keep you wondering what is coming next. His character development is incomparable. Every one of his \\"cast of thousands\\" is deep and consistent and interesting. Whether you hate them or love them, there is no denying that they are well developed. The fact that you will both hate and love them is proof. He digs deeply into science to construct the planet and its ecosystem, and he delves even deeper into religion for some of the races of people and their beliefs. I have only read a few books as purely satisfying as Dune, and it's one I will keep coming back to."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is a phenomenal book. I call it a Science Fiction \\"Ben Hur.\\" In addition to it being a great story and captivating read, I learned excellent skills to use in life. I loved the interplay between the characters where they were trying to determine what was actually going on by looking at mannerisms, determining what were seeds planted to get them to reach a wrong conclusion, and then looking deeper to try to reach the real conclusion. In fact, this is the only book I read twice in a row. The first time for the story, the second time to concentrate on these interactions. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is my third favorite Science Fiction novel. Number Three. Dune is clearly a masterpiece that resonates with many women and men. This is the only Frank Herbert novel that works for me as entertainment; but he hit one out of the ballpark with this Home-Run novel. I have re-read it at least ten times. On the re-reads I perhaps skip 20%.Dune is so famous that I won't sport with your intelligence by wasting words on plot or characters.[David Lynch lost creative control of his Dune movie: *SOUND OFF* bits of it might have some use as visuals for a Dune music video, or Full-Length as silent visual art for Dune lovers, but as entertainment or story-telling . . . is it possible to give Zero Stars? ~ The 4.5 hour long John Harrison Dune 3-Disc DVD set starring William Hurt is actually pretty good. Most Dune lovers will like it.]Herbert wrote a previous novel Under Pressure about submarines where his Minimum Ecology theme was first introduced. This is the only other Frank Herbert novel that I find readable. But I think here he worked out all the bugs of the Minimum Ecology thing, so a decade later when he wrote Dune he was ready to take it to the next level.The science may be \\"soft,\\" the elements of fantasy may turn off hard-core Sci-Fi fans, but Frank Herbert does everything else so perfectly in Dune that I am jealous and disappointed: I know that I will never be able to write a novel as perfect as this puppy. @hg47"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I love \\"Dune\\" and have read it more than a dozen times.This audio version is really quite good, but I'm baffled: It's advertised as \\"full cast,\\" but once I got past the first six disks, the \\"full cast\\" disappeared.In a way, this was fine with me, as I didn't much like Gurney Halleck as an American dock worker and the basso profundo of the Baron Harkonnen, who sounded more like James Earl Jones than the the sinuous and sinister Baron I imagine.At any rate, great listening - but did anyone else notice the great disappearing \\"full cast\\"?"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Probably the best SciFi story ever.

An editor might have trimmed some of the 'terrible purposes' and 'plans within plans within plans' and other repetitions, and sometimes the mystical-messianic stuff sticks in the throat. But few books rival Herbert's for sheer inventiveness and conviction. Not to mention that he seems to think that readers are intelligent people who like books that make them pay attention.Is it the Greatest Science Fiction Novel Ever?

However, people forget, that Herbert wrote this book BEFORE Lucas' Star Wars world erupted.4) the in-depth cultures, I wanted to know more about them.5) the beautifully written sceneries, albiet sometimes too short.6) the usages of his characters' powers are nicely done.Cons:1) The characters are not as fleshed out as they can be, but this is NOT a character world. It's a plot/political and scenery novel.2) the battle action scenes were not as well described as I liked.3) the powers of the characters were too quickly developed. One day, Paul was a normal guy, and then he became a Prophet? Without background to this? Hello? No description of his dreams? His actual events that took him to become the Prophet?Overall though, Dune's prose is excellent, story telling is superb and it's a highly creative piece of work.

This is one of the mostly richly filled stories ever written. It has great action, intrigue and moves quick. But what sets it apart from the rest is the unique outlook on human nature and the way the universe works.

I read it every time I start a new job for its machiavellian intrigues and insight into human nature. I am now on my 6th copy, having worn out a couple and given a couple away.

It was very challenging with the figurative language. The quest of Paul Atreides was very adventurous and mysterious. Definetly on of the top sci-fi novels aroundand I look forward to reading the rest of the books in the Dune Chronicles."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I initially wrote a review for this over ten years ago, but as one might expect not yet out of his teen years, it wasn't the most eloquent or insightful examination of the book. Not that I expect this will be either,--and besides, what more can be said after nearly fifty years and over a thousand customer reviews?--but I felt that it was a book that deserved better.I first became aware of Dune in the mid-'80s (when I was around five years old) due to the film by David Lynch. I did not see this film when it came out because my parents had heard bad things from a friend. A few years later, the extended version played on television, and I tried to watch it, but I quickly grew confused and, during a scene with the Baron, a bit disgusted, so I gave up.* Still, there was something I found fascinating about the universe in which the story took place, so a few years after that--at the age of thirteen--when I saw the book on the shelf at my local library, I decided to give it a shot. I was immediately sucked in by Frank Herbert's work, and Dune became the first book I'd ever read to truly blow my mind. When I'd finished, I knew immediately that I'd just read my favorite book of all time.It's amazing that Dune is still my favorite book. I've reread it several times, and over the years, I've come to realize just how little it's aged. In fact, I would say that it's only grown more relevant as our country has escalated its involvement in the Middle East (or West Asia, if you prefer). To tell you the truth, these issues weren't things I really thought about those first few times I read it, but it's been pretty much impossible not to in recent days.Allegory aside, it's otherwise a cracking good read. Frank Herbert establishes a meticulously thought out universe populated with wonderful characters (of which there are many). This is truly a book one can live in for a while. It may not have the sprawling page count of, say, The Lord of the Rings or War and Peace, but it definitely has the epic scope.*I did eventually end up watching both the theatrical and extended cuts of the 1984 film. While I really enjoy the look of the film, I don't think it's a particularly good adaptation. (However, I do think that some of that is due to the way it's put together. If someone could go back to the raw footage, I'm sure it'd be possible to make a really good film out of it.) And while the 2000 Sci-Fi Channel mini-series is a better adaptation, it's not very good otherwise. I can only hope that the supposedly upcoming feature film will be the one that sticks it, but I'm unsure if any studio will be okay with making a movie in which the hero essentially becomes a religious terrorist.ORIGINAL REVIEW: Frank Herbert's Dune is one of the few books I have read more than once.

There has to be some sad or not so good parts in a book scattered throughout, but what I found in this book is that there is a depressing feeling that permeates from start to finish.

It inspired me to attempt an imitiation, a post-apocalyptic world full of made-up terms and objects. I finished the glossary, but only managed to write the first chapter.Rereading \\"Dune\\" many years later, I realized that Herbert must have done the same thing. It seemed that he lavished most of his attention and affection for the book's world on the glossary. The actual text gave me the impression that he was looking for excuses to insert all of the great stuff he had thought of (\\"Inkvine - OK, I need a character who was whipped with inkvine and has a scar from it, OK, got that, now moving right along\\"). This made the world seem clumsy and contrived. Lord of the Rings, and even Harry Potter contain innumerable examples of items unique to those worlds, but they are presented as part of the milieu, flowing naturally out of the events in those stories. Also, no glossary is required in either of those series - the author gives a brief explanation of the new term, without stopping the action, then seamlessly integrates it into the story, showing us how it functions in that world.If Herbert had only wanted to write a glossary, he could have done so, and left it at that, like Milorad Pavic's \\"Dictionary of the Khazars,\\" but that would have made Dune a postmodern work, not science fiction, i.e.:\\"Contemporaries say that Mustaj-Beg Sabljak could not keep food down and that, like a turtledove, he ate and excreted simultaneously. On his military campaigns he took along wet nurses to breast-feed him. But he did not mix with women, or with people in general; he could lie only with the dying, so they brought to his tent dying women, men, and children, who had been purchased, bathed, and dressed for this purpose. Only with them could he spend the night, as though he was afraid of impregnating anyone who might live. He was wont to say that he made children for the other world, not this...Sabljak Pasha had a large, irregular build, as though he wore his skin over his clothes, and a turban between his hair and his skull.\\""},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Herbert's creation of Dune is monumental, to say the least.

Go read the Tibetan Book of the Dead if you want deep thought!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is a great sci-fi story. A must read for any sci-fi fan. A real page turner and a heck of a lot of fun."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"It is the one time Frank Herbert let himself (or his editors let him) become truly literary in the series of books about Dune. It must be in the nicest sense of that term.I remember being young, near to thirty, and reading the first time, comparing impressions with friends in the quiet, hands-on moments at our r&d; work.Perhaps we didn't feel the sweep of the original Dune, though in another way it is actually there -- behind, and in the spaces opened by many observations in the text. And it didn't seem to compare with the adventures of Leto and Ghanima and the D-wolves, though today for all that the Children of Dune book is important, it is lesser.In Dune Messiah, the depth of individual story is drawn almost as with Asian brushes: swift, naturally spreading strokes, that you take a moment with to let the understanding come to you, how evocative. There is not summary, yet also there are summaries of whole thoughts, as in the sad ending not of Paul, but of Bijaz, whose power as a person and character just give glimpses of Frank Herbert's breadth of achievement.I have never been able to understand the later books after Herbert died, though there can be a certain fascination in some of them, and now think that they are simply very different works, as if a very different historian had been read to us. Then there is credit where due.Of Frank Herbert's deep and long creation, it's apparent also how he took different avenues himself, perhaps guided by editors, by 'results' for this Dune Messiah particularly. He had a life to support, and could no doubt find fun and satisfaction in putting forward what people most seemed to want to hear, all the way to Miles Teg, who was a great creation also.Would that he could have pursued the tracks of Dune Messiah further in some places and ways, and perhaps he did -- the rest of the series I also have before me to read over. What he did here shows the soul there was behind it all, and it is a thanking matter indeed to meet him so.Highly recommended, and as you see, for reading 'again'."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I read Dune before and was very confused by the story at first. Maybe that happened because I read much too quickly. Then I recently re-read it and was immediatly drawn into Herbert's world. His creation truly is epic. It's obvious to see how it has gained so much attention. Herbert creates a world filled with political strife, internal problems and real mental dilemmas, particularly in Paul Atreides as He delves deeper into the Muad'dib persona and continues on throughout the later books.Dune is a great read for sci-fi fans and anyone who enjoys a riveting tale of adventure and loyalty.PARTY ON, DUDES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I gave this book to my brother as a present for his birthday.He was looking for the books of Frank Herbert in the same layout, so he was pleased to receive the 6 first books of the Dune saga and started reading immediately."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I am always looking for good books, and so I look for reviewed books at Amazon, and browse through the comments in order to select what to read. This one is highly recommended, so I bought, and...It is great! This dates from the 60's (past century) and is way better than the most known dessert planet with Jedi Knights.When I bought the book, I was reading Lord of the Rings (I know what I did was heresy) but I read some ten pages of Dune, out of curiosity... And I was hooked! I have finished books one and two, and I am still around page 200 of Lord of the Rings, ouch!In short, I must also highly recommend this book to those who like Sci-Fi mixed with Fantasy."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"What a powerfull imagination does Frak Herbert had. He takes us to the far future or humankind, to unknown landscapes an cultures product of the evolution of our own culture. Is amazing how he integrates the economic, political, cultural, filosophical and mental aspects. It is beautiful the way he takes us into this future, to understand a lot of things of our reallity as humans. Pay close attention to the litany against fear of the Bene Gesserit.The sequels are great, all of them, specially books 3, 5 and 6. I find it incredible the way he developed a story for a period of time that long. If you like not just SF but good reading, take this entire series and enjoy it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"if there is any book that one even can compare to this book then it might be Lord of the Rings...but Dune is just perfect...i don\`t know what to say...Herbert is a genius"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Very good book, but if you don't already know, it is all just one long anti-Jewish, pro-Arab commentary. I don't remember if Herbert acknowleged this or not; I could be wrong, but I think he did. We are meant to see the Fremen as Arabs, the Harkonnen as the &quot;evil Jews&quot; (they came to take the land of the Fremen away from them; they only care about profit; Baron Harkonnen drinks blood; etc.), the spice is very obviously oil, the Emperor is the USA. It is a testament to the book's worth that this less-than-savory inspiration for it nevertheless does not detract from Dune's overall artistic merit."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"An absolutely amazing book filled with 3 dimensional characters, wonderful settings, and fasinating events. I highly recommend this book. Anyone who would rate this book bellow five stars either never really read the book or has no taster."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"If ever there was a book that deserved more than five stars, Dune is it. Provocative in the extreme, imaginative beyond imagination, and creative beyond comprehension, this book is a powerful tale of Science Fiction that will stand alone as a peice of artistic literature for all eternity. Frank Herbert's ability to transport the readers mind into the places that he describes is unbelievable. This should be required reading for all true students of literature. Thank you Frank for a book that will never end up dusty on the bottom of my bookshelf."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Don't let the horrid 1984 film Dune scare you away from reading one of the finest science fiction books of all time. Frank Herbert's DUNE is a masterpiece, exceptionally well written, with it's uniquely thought-out plots, which are all woven together to form the ultimate science fiction story. But this book offers much more than just a story. It's packed with a plethera of philosphy and insight into the themes of government, religion, control, power, and life itself. A MUST HAVE for any science fiction reader."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Frank Herbert creates an intricate and believable world set thousands of years in the future. From the mind altering spice to Bene Gesserit training to Guild Navigators...it's all perfect! What a remarkable concept! I can not reccommend this book enough. It will challenge you, thrill you and most of all entertain you!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book is one of the best science fiction books ever written. It is a classic in every sense of the word. It is one of the (very) few science fiction works that will cross over to the list of General Classics.This book is not easy to read, but well worth the time and effort applied to doing so. Frank Herbert often presents an event and then &quot;listens in&quot; on the thoughts of those present. This could have made it seem tedious. But Herbert pulls it off inspiring rapt attention. This plethora of viewpoints is one of the strong points of the novel.This book includes many themes including: Fate, Duty, Honor, Despotism, Suffering/Hardship and its effect, Addiction, Sexual descrimination, Autocratsy vs Democracy, Power, Religious Ferver, Genetic Engineering and others.This book is a MUST READ!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Quite simply the greatest work of science fiction. Nothing compares"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is truly a wonderful book that anyone who likes science fiction, wants insights on religion, or fascinates about science &quot;fiction&quot; that is almost a reality. The characters in the novel are great and despite some early confusion, the book is an easy read. I look forward to reading the prequel by Herbert's son when it comes out this October."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book (and series) is hands down my favorite. I am guiding my girlfriend through her first time right now (I myself have probably read it 6 times) and she's just started Children of Dune. The only thing I can really add to what's been said, is, do NOT give up reading Dune Messiah. Children of Dune picks up almost as good as Dune, and they get even better. Dune Messiah feels like a prologue to CoD, and if you don't read it, everything after will be even more confusing. Although, I don't really like Paul anymore.. his son is SO much better. Paul ran from his destiny, but Leto II embraced it.. I honestly cried at the end of God Emperor.."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I've read many books, all were different plots and scenarios.. One of my favorite series used to be the DragonLance Saga. The Dune series absolutely rocks (especially the first book). I recommend that everyone read this book at least twice, you have to read it more than once to get the full effect of one of Frank Herbert's masterpieces."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I've read Dune (at the subsequent 5 sequels) at least 6 times now over the past 20 years. It really changes your outlook on life. Frank Herbert had a wonderful sense of society and a great imagination to create such an astonishing world. David Lynch tried his best to capture that imagination when he made the film version of Dune. Visually, it's a great movie; however, it's difficult to capture all of the book's nuances in just a few short hours. If you've seen the movie, READ THE BOOK! If you haven't seen the move, STILL READ THE BOOK!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I've never read any other book as intricate as Dune that works as well as this one does. The diversity of the concepts and subjects Herbert touches on is seemingly endless, but what's more he covers everything in such grand fashion. Everything from a planet's ecosystem and its impact on the lives and very culture of its inhabitants, the consequences of being able to foretell the future, religion, self-mastery of both the mind and body, politics, leadership...it never ends. I'm also not as down on the sequels as some of the other folks here....I thought that the second book was pretty good, although admitedly it did not live up to the original. The 3rd and 4th books were very difficult to read through, it was a real labor of love to force myself to make it through them. But the 5th and 6th books were simply terrific, nearly equal to the original, and they made it worth reading all 6 without a doubt."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I am currently two thirds of the way through this fantastic book and cannot put it down. It is quickly becoming the best book I have ever read. I first picked it up when I was twelve and read about 50 pages and then stopped and didnt pick it up again for four years and now I am almost through this amazing book. Do yourself a favor, if you are inteligent enough to understand it you WILL like it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune was the first science fiction book I read, and 10 years later, it is still very much my favourite book. Don't be discouraged by the first 50 pages, it does get better once one has acclimatised himself to the language of Dune. Herbert does not try to impress with scientific jargon, instead he creates a fantastic political arena and a detailed eco-system that is totally convincing and dazzling. One reading of this book does not do it justice. Nor do any of the sequels. This is science fiction at its best, and I have yet to find anything else of the same standard."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"there are so many reviews here that you can read a bunch of it and find out the story. my review is neither a synopsis nor a critique of the story or of its author. read this book is all i can say. i am not a science fiction fan but this book was just awesome. i couldn't put it down and i will go through the adventure again. what i will say is that don't play the video game and don't watch the movie. read the book first and then see if you would rather read the book again or watch the movie or play the game; chances are you'll read the book. thanks herbert, you have made me want to ride a sandworm."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is defiantly one of the most monumental novels of the century. The story is good, and pretty well written, but it has it's moments of completely and inexcusably boring &amp; or stupid parts. I find that some of the descriptions are a little on the tedious side, but maybe that's just because I'm pretty young. I might learn to appreciate the depth of it, as I grow older. I find that descriptions in &quot;The Wheel of Time&quot; series are much more interesting then the ones Herbert writes. I also found it disturbing that the book went into so much detail of the Fremen life and religion. I know that this might be interesting for some people, but for me it was down right boring and not needed! And again, like with most long novels, the author could have told the story in half the pages! With all of the above rants, I must say that I did enjoy reading this book, but I really don't understand how it has such a strong following. Probably the best character development was with the Harkonnen's which are the evil guys. The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen was a very interesting character, as was his nephew the co-baron Feyd-Rautha. The best parts of the book are the first 200 pages, and then it starts to go down hill from there until the climatic last battle, which was superb! I can't give this book a full five stars because it was not the best I have read. I would, however, recommend it for people, but I'd even more recommend books by such authors as Tolkien, and Jordan. The ending of &quot;Dune&quot; was a bit of a cliff hanger, so I'm going to be going to read the next book in the series &quot;Dune Messiah&quot; hoping that the series will get even better as I go along. Enjoy the book!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I feel like I'm wasting water when I take a shower now.:) Oh what I'd give to be a Fremen walking the desert in my stillsuit catching a ride on a sandworm. This book is by FAR the most amazing book ever written. I find it hard to believe that Herbert is an Earthling and not Paul Atriedes, himself! The awesomeness of this book just cannot be described in a 1000 word review. DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND READ THIS BOOK!! Don't expect to be the same person afterwards!! The book feels like real life. I would love to live on Arrakis. It would be worth having to wear a stillsuit and live in the desert amongst the Fremen. This is the greatest book ever written (that I have read at least :)"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I won't waste your time with a long review. This is the most engaging novel I have ever read. Read it!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I originally read _Dune_ as a serial in the old Analog magazine (in the '60s I think). It was then and, after 40 years as an SF reader, it still remains the single greatest SF novel I have ever read. I am not as impressed by the author's sequels, and even less so by son Brian's prequels of recent years (though I have read them all because I cannot get enough of the world Mr. Herbert created for us.) If you will read only one SF novel, this is the one to read."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I'd like to get inside Frank Herbert's brain and find out what planet he came from. You just aren't a normal person if you can create entire worlds (and a universe) and make an epic saga out of it.Although the story behind Dune has distinctive political/economic flair to it (centered around the spice and spice mining), it's so much more than that. The inclusion of the Fremen prophecy regarding the coming of the \\"One\\" (a.k.a., Quisatz Haderach; hope I spelled it right) the mental capabilities of the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood and the Machine building Tleilaxu cilvilization bring entirely new depth to this enigmatic futuristic world. The story is quite complex and the reader should vigilantly read to grasp all the details. (I'm not going to give away the story, just read the book)."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I loved this book. The book is a great story with lots of intrigue and detail that keeps you turning the pages. I have re-read this book several times and get more pleaure every time.I HATED THE MOVIE. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THE MOVIE."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The book, Dune, by Frank Herbert is a futuristic science fiction novel involving loss and gain. The protagonist of Dune, Paul Atreides is the son and heir of the Duke Leto Atreides. In the beginning of the novel Paul lives very comfortably on his home planet of Caladan. He has the very best that his planet, similar to Earth, has to offer. Everything changes, however, when he and his family move to the desert planet, Arrakis, also known as Dune. Arrakis is one of the most inhospitable places inhabited by humans. The temperature is so great, and water so scarce that its inhabitants must wear stillsuits, gear that channels all of the human bodies released water into reservoirs that can be deducted from if necessary. Even the smallest amount of water is precious to the populace of Dune and its people have learned not to waste anything. Although Arrakis is extremely harsh to organisms that opt to inhabit it, there is one element that makes it special and preferred above other planets. It is the only source in the known universe of the essential Spice, a cinnamon-like substance used in foods that prolongs life. This Spice is the reason that Arrakis is a coveted planet among the houses of power in the universe.Only a short time after the Atreides arrival on Dune, the Atreides were betrayed by one of their own and a rival house, the Harkonnen, captured Paul, his father, Leto, and his mother Jessica. Duke Leto Atreides was killed but Paul and Jessica, a member of the ancient Bene Gesserit order, (a group of women who have special strengths and mind reading powers) escape into the desert. Paul was left stranded with only his mother in the middle of the harshest place in the universe, fleeing from the colossal sand-worms, organisms roughly the size of a space frigate who inhabit the sands of Arrakis and react to and kill anything that they sense moving on the surface of the sand. In this harsh position, Paul begins to think up a plan for him to regain his title and all that he had lost. His mission was to rally the Femen, the native nomads of Dune and unite them to fight against their common enemy, the Harkonnen. Rallying the Femen would prove to be no easy task however, scattered throughout the planet in different tribes, Paul had to gain their highest respect in order to gain anything from this venture. Although Paul is very smart and skilled in battle, it would prove a daunting task to unite the Fremen, defeat the Harkonnen, and regain his position as Duke of Arrakis.Frank Herbert's epic novel Dune is one of the greatest science fiction novels ever written, in my mind comparing only to The Lord of the Rings in its greatness. Dune is a truly timeless epic to be treasured for all eternity. I am currently enrapt in Dune's sequel, Dune Messiah, and am thoroughly enjoying it. Another aspect of Dune is the variety of excerpts from other made up books and biographies relating to Dune such as this poem,\\" \`Do you wrestle with dreams?Do you contend with shadows?Do you move in a kind of sleep?Time has slipped away.Your life is stolen.You tarried with trifles,Victim of your folly.'-Dirge for Jamis on the Funeral Plain,from \`Songs of Muad'Dib' by the Princess IrulanEven this little aside, irrelevant to the story, adds to the feeling, the mood of Dune.Frank Herbert's Dune is an incredible story with superb writing. It is a great science fiction novel ranking in my mind up with the Lord of the Rings and other classic sci-fi tomes. Overall, Dune is a timeless epic that will leave its mark on our society for generations to come."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"When confronted with someone who says &quot;I don't read SF because I don't like it!&quot;, I always ask them what have they read? Have they read Dune? The answer is always no. And those who go away and read Dune, change their mind and usually will seek other quality SF novels to read.I first read Dune in about 1967(?) as a high school student. I have re-read it many times. To me it was the first hard SF novel to FULLY develop and reveal an entire culture and history as backdrop to the story. Others have tried since; most have failed or at least fallen short of Dune.DUNE is to SF what Lord of the Rings is to Fantasy; simply the best.If you want to know anything about the story, don't look here, just READ IT! I promise you wont be disappointed.I'm about to start reading it again in the next few days!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Herbert is a rare type of writer that combines afanciful imagination, a deep and probing intellectand an innate ability to create and control tensionwithin a well written story.

I don't usually enjoy science fiction, but Herbert's ability to transport you into his world(s) is amazing.

I have highly recommended it to everyone I know and if you love great writing this is a classic not to be missed!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is an excellent work of sci-fi from the Golden Age. It is a beautiful combination of philosophy and action. The planning and the intrugue are the best ever. When a person can create a world of political manuvering that occurs over millenia and you want to see all of it, it is truly remarkable. Where The Prince was a theoretical discussion Dune is a practical application. A work of art."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"My favorite book from Dune serie is God Emperor of Dune; but this one is the first, and it opened our eyes to a new universe, a new thought.Really, it's a hard and complex universe with a lot of different people with them own objectives, ideas, fears, ambitions... Translate it from an extended universe to the city, the street... and you'll see it in a shorted scale. F. Herbert is talking about an extense universe but it's near in distance and relationship. It's not about far away worlds, forgotten worlds... it's near, it's between members of a great family with diferents thoughts and ambitions.All the incredible world of Dune itself is fabulous, the factions along the universe (the powers than tries to dominate or tries to update the human race), the fight of Atraides spirit against the terror...In the other hands you see how the climate, how the economy; works really hand-on-hand with politic and war; how the people tries to move inside a sea (sea of water or sand, it's not different) dominated for those forces.The Dune world is very close to us"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Ok, I admit it I love science fiction. I love this series, but I would have never gotten into it if I hadn't seen the movie first. This book is a great way to dive further into the Dune unverse but beware it is long and sometimes a bit slow. The following books aren't much better especially if the first one didn't do it for you. I highly recommend this book to anyone who really liked the movie. If you are a science fiction fan who hasn't seen the movie I suggest reading Dune : House Atreides by Brian Herbert, first.

Herbert's sheer brilliance and excellent writing style make for a treat. I felt for the characters, Paul Muad'Dib seemed like a true hero, and I loathed the Harkonnens. The character development is excellent, and the plot is truly captivating. I found myself turning pages very quickly. A complex epic with Politics, philosophy, ecology, etc.. all are presented in this great book. I recommend it to anybody who is literate and has a decent attention span.

Although messianic the story is more Muslim then Christian. To some extent it seemed like a straight up retelling of how Islam united the Arab tribes and their later conquests. As Muslims out there would likely say Paul is different then Muhammed &amp; possibly not even a Muhammed figure. As a Catholic I don't like it when sf insults my religion so if I've unintentionally insulted yours I truly apologize. In fact I was only comparing the story not the characters. Still a knowledge of Sufi &amp; Islam is there. I recently found out that thing about the slow blade penetrating was first in &quot;The Paradox Men&quot; by Harness. Herbert &amp; Harness are very different authors, but you might try Harness out if you got the time."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book moves away from what makes the first book so appealing. Instead it focuses on the stupid back stabbing and wrangling for position of the king of Dune. This creates a slow book that doesn't develop characters. Where I hated to put Dune down I now wish the planet didn't exist."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Come on! This book is over rated. It is an amusing story but unengaging. The characters are cold and it is difficult to empathise with them. I did read the next two books to see how the story was resolved...but it wasn't, it turned into the X-files! i.e. continuous suspense, convolutions, but no resolution. A story must have a beginning, middle, and, and, um, an end? The recent appearance of the Dune 'brand extension' books &quot;House Atreides&quot; and &quot; 'Harkonen&quot; confirm that the story continues, be it chronologically before or after the original Dune. Should have been a trilogy at most."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is a classic on so many levels. There's not much I can say that hasn't been said by other reveiwers, but I wanted a chance to throw my five stars in.If you haven't read this sci fi masterpiece, pick it up (or check it out of the library or borrow it from a friend) and give it a look. It will take you to another world, as the best fiction always does."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune has one of the most intricately complex worlds I've seen in any book. The characters are richly detailed, and you can almost see the desert landscape. Herbert does an excellent job of describing the characters feelings and motivations, and whether you know of his writing this as an allegory or not, it's still an incredible book. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Book ReviewI usually do not consider literature as a favorite pass-time but sometimes there are books that cannot be put down until you your eyes are sore tired, and Frank Herbert's Dune is one of them. Although the book is in the science fiction genre, it is a great pick for anyone who appreciates a good story, and the book also includes quit a bit of mystery and romance which fits in perfectly in the world that grips you in and does not let go even after you are done with the book. I am a big fan of the science fiction genre, especially the Start Trek and Star Wars series. Actually most of my reading revolved around those two names, so when I stumbled upon Dune, I was not very enthusiastic to say the least. The book was large and very long (almost made turn away right there), complicated, and dated, but since I did not find anything new in the two categories mentioned above, I picked it up to pass my time during the holidays, and because I like to spend my free tome in front of my computer I though that I might not even start on the book, boy was I wrong. I started reading during the second week of the not so long holiday. I was instantly possessed by the storyline, which was impossible to predict but satisfied with what it revealed to you. The story is a bout a Royal Family Atreides who has to leave their paradise of a planet to govern a desert planet, which is full of the most valuable substances in galaxy. The story twist from there on into betrayals, mystery, romance and finally revenge. I finished the book in less than three days, and the book was almost five hundred pages long. I had little time to do anything during those three days, and I must admit I was never that devoted to a book before. The best part about is the ending. It ends the story in passion able way, and although one can draw a conclusion with it, it acts a lot better as an opener to the continuation of the saga. In fact the book created four sequels (I am already into the second book in the serious) and prequel. The reason for all deviation/continuations is due to a very high critical success of the book and enormous sales that it generated, in fact all of the sequel and the recent prequel have scored very well with the fan base. Due to the big popularity of the book, there was a motion picture created based on the book back 1989, and featured some big stars such Sting himself (I did not know that he acted either), but did not do the book justice and failed in the box office, and it was very recently recreated a six hour special edition show on the Sci-Fi channel, and although a much better than the first was still somewhat out of place. I guess some things have to be left to your imagination."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"After reading Dune you just want more of that universe no? It was to sci-fi literature what Star Wars was to sci-fi films. This sequel is short, has very little action, has nowhere near the scope of the first book, but was interesting to read none the less, because it expanded upon the Dune universe. We do get to see Paul's character evolve, but other than that, no other characters seem to be developed very well at all (with the exception of the ghola Idaho). Where was Jessica for example? - and Chani, Stilgar, etc. seem to be glossed over. I wish Herbert would have doubled the size of this book, and maybe then it would have seemed less like a quickie coda."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I really actually liked reading Dune. It was full of many complicated things that stacked up and stacked up. But it also keeps you hooked. The story line was good and I thought that it all tied together very well in the end.

Its a book you have to read over and over again to really understand it and to really catch it all, in a year or two I will probably go back and read it again."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is a very complex novel. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It allowed you to understand every character by the italisized writing. A key to their thoughts and inner selves. There was much excitement to everything that was going on, and something was always going on. Never a dull moment. Everytime you had a question about what was going to happen or how a particular thing came to be a few chapters later it would answer it for you, which made it more fun to read, more intense. It made you want to know what was going to happen next. I've always been a Science Fiction Fan, Dune is one of the better ones I've read.Sincerely, Bianca Brock"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I am not normally a Sci Fi fan, but after the first ten or twenty pages, I couldn't put the book down. The way Herbert used action and reaction in the book, it really opened up my mind to what could happen in the future of humanity. To think that if we as humans progress at the rate we have been, then we could very possibly become like the people from Dune. Powerful beings with great abilities. Everything about Dune some how made sense, and everyone in the world should have some experience in the literature of Frank Herbert.

When I read this in my youth, it was an absorbing and plausible read. The depth of detail described regarding the cultures and technologies involved was very engaging."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Ignore all these reviews and read this book for yourself. Everyone seems to want to project their own beliefs and opinions on the story and symbolism, then they say &quot;that is what Frank Herbert meant to say.&quot; Having read the series three times (and this first book four), each time the story stikes me differently. Don't make the mistake of forcing the words to meet your expectations. Frank Herbert spent six years researching and preparing for this novel, so don't expect to unravel its secrets in one read. In the end, it is the most enjoyable, entertaining, thought-provoking piece of fiction I have ever read. (By the way, try to ignore the review comparing Herbert's philosophy with Hitler's. If there is a link in the novels to Hitler, it is a negative one. Besides, Herbert's gom-jabbar tests humans based on their decisions in crisis, not their ethnicity. However, don't listen to me. Read and form your own opinion.)"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"At first glance, I also thought Dune would be a very dull book, but after just a few pages, I was captivated. This book was recommended to me by a close friend. I am only 15 years old, yet I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Frank Herbert is one of the best writers ever. From the Castle on Caladan, to the sandriders of the desert, it was an amazing journey for Paul. It is amazing to read how such a frail child could grow to one day become the Muad'dib and rule over the sand of Dune. I am in the middle of Dune Messiah and I like it, but it doesn't come close to Dune."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"a spectacular example of herbert's award winning imagination.

Frank Herbert also wrote five sequels to this book before he died. While they are not as good as the original, I reccomend that you read them anyway.If I may also recommend a few other books which I consider to be great: Lord of the Rings (by the Tolkien), Hyperion (Dan Simmons), Ender's Game and Speaker of the Dead (Orson Scott Card)."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"of all the science fiction books i've read this is by far one set apart. it's not cyber babes and explosions, but a thinking person's read. herbert's attention to detail and his ability to keep the story line intact throughout the book is uncanny. herbert has a tom clancy-esque ability for character development and details. it is not light reading, but it gives a unique insight to the possible future."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I read Dune when I was in middle school. My dad suggested it. I loved it!! In some points, it was hard to understand, and in others, it almost scaired me, because of the amount of suspence. Frank Herbert had a very complex imagination while writing Dune. There are only two kinds of people, I believe, that could write a book as interesting as Dune. Either a genious or a lunitic. and I don't believe Frank Herbert to be a lunatic!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Frank Herbert's DUNE presents a society and universe created entirely by the author. The story was very complex, and written wonderfully with just the right amount of discription. Herbert made up his own religions and forms of politics which are absolutely enchanting. One of the story's components was the classic &quot;coming of age&quot; tale. Paul, heir to a Dukedom, moves to the world Arrakis, aka Dune, where his father has taken control. However, a rival family isn't too happy about the situation. Thus unfolds a tale of conspiricy and wonder, and Paul is suddenly revealed as a legendary man foretold. I especially enjoyed the psychological accounts of Paul's metamorphis. However, I really didn't like the person he became, but I prefer this change. The book was a tad more political than sci-fi, and the story becomes rather entangled in itself. I was very impressed by the complete world Herbert created, but I found myself not as absorbed as I perhaps should be. The ending, the last couple pages, were rather disappointing, compared with other highlighs of the novel. There are many thought-provoking one-liners and symbolism in the book. However, I am still not absolutely enthralled with it. Still, I recommend this to any who enjoy fantasy worlds."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"As a huge sci-fi/fantasy reader, it's astonishing how many other books of this &quot;genre&quot; (not that Dune should be placed in a genre; since it practically created one) attempt to duplicate aspects of this masterpiece. As I was reading, I almost laughed out loud, having read many more recent books who have tried to duplicate the plot and philosophical views of Dune, but just don't succeed compared to this! I can see how it set the standard for modern sci-fi. In many ways, the Hyperion series by Dan Simmons is very similar to it (Hyperion also won the Hugo award). That is a good series by the way. And other popular series' have similar themes...on reading Dune it becomes obvious where these authors got their ideas. All I can say is: I bow to the master!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Im Twelve and I loved this book! IT WAS AWESOME! It kept me guessing and on the edge of my seat! If you love sci-fi, or even if you dont, pick up this book and you'll enter a world unlike any other. If you have chance to read it, do it, because if you dont your missing out on a great thing!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"THE BEST SCIENCE FICTION NOVEL EVER WRITTEN! This book is a masterpiece. It has every thing you could possibly ask for from a sci-fi book. There is a war, magic, alien races, new, interesting planets, strange weapobns, and, best of all GREAT CHARACTERS! However, the book can be really confusing if you don't know the basic plotline. I won't spoil it for those that want to read the book not knowing what's going to happen, but it really is easier to read when you know what the main events are. The only other science fiction book that even comes close to comparing with DUNE is ENDER'S GAME. I deffinetely suggest reading both!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"If a person were to conduct a poll, asking science fiction fans to name their 5 favorite books, Dune would almost surely appear in at least 80% of the lists.Frank Herbert has created something remarkable, blending several intricate subplots around the central tale of Paul Atreides to form one of the most complex and riveting tales of all time.The Characterization is flawless and there are more ideas introduced in this one book than I have seen in a dozen of the same genre. Its only drawback or another novelity, depending on your opinion, its Herbert's writing style. Some, like my sister found it very off putting to be immediately thrust into the world with no proper explanation of terms such as the Bene Gesserit, the melange. Many have not progressed beyond the first 30 pages because of this, professing a sense of confusion. I however, find this to be a refreshing change from tthe usual lengthy explanations, which lend meat but no excitement to a novel.Dune is a roller coaster ride of thrills, exceptional in every way, and should be read by anyone, fans of the genre or not. Wheter u love it or loath it you must admit that it is something special."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Let me preface this review by saying that I believe Dune is one of the greatest books ever written. And to judge any subsequent work to such a masterpiece is unfair. However, DM is everything that the original is not. And a brief look reveals its many flaws. This book is and I believe was intended to be a bridge novel between the heights set in Dune and the continuation of the story in Children of Dune (which was as far as Herbert originally intended to go. And the book reads just like a bridge, short, boring, and predictable. It's almost as if Herbert wrote this book over the Summer just to make a quick buck. Duller than dishwater, this book lacks creativity, lacks imagination. There's absolutely no excitement, no suspense. But if you short, morbid, depressing books, then this is the perfect read.Set 12 years after Dune, the jihad unleashed by Muad'Dib has spread off planet and cost billions of lives. Not suprisingly, Muad'Dib now has many enemies. Chief among them are the spacing guild, Princess Irulan, and the Tlexau. And you'd think they would be the first 3 targets of the jihad. It's funny how the jihad has managed to destroy everyone who could possible oppose them but their actual ememies!Princess Irulan is another matter. She has no right to be in this book. At the end of Dune Paul marries her to justify his ascension to the throne, but he already controls the spice, has defeated the emperor, so why bother with the marriage? He's about to launch his jihad to kill off anyone who would oppose him anyway. And if we buy Herbert's reason for the nuptials, then Irulan would be the empress, holding the cards to make Paul the emperor.But in Dune Messiah, Paul is the emperor and Irulun is the empress wannabe, so the impetus for Irulan's anger shouldn't exist. In Messiah Paul complains he is unable to control his jihad. He's in power, so it's simple, don't tell the fremen these other planets exist. Or have the spacing guild send them to uninhabited worlds. They won't know the difference anyway.So I disagree that this book was the inevitable outcome of what transpired in Dune. And if anything it is what least likely would have happened. In my view, internal problems would have caused Muad'Dibs downfall long before his enemies got to him. (similar to how the Mongol empire created by Genghis Khan quickly feel apart under its own weight). But then again a book about a sagging economony and internal corruption would have been as boring as this book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I did not want to read this book- a friend lent it to me, saying it was about ecology, a subject I have never been interested in. One day, I was bored and saw it lying on the counter, so I picked it up and began to read. I finished it the next day and immediately began to read it again.There is so much to this book! Frank Herbert created an entire universe for his readers to explore, placing it's roots firmly in our own and then spinning it twenty-thousand years and thousands of light years away from us. The reader may notice Herbert's use of (fictional) Arabic-derived languages and the references to Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, etc.What I loved most about this novel, though, aside from the amazing complexity of the various storylines, was it's quality as a story. Our culture is steeped in \\"sci-fi\\" stories. They're everywhere. This was the first one I had ever read that didn't cause me to cringe. At all.Particularly good was Herbert's ironic use of the messiah myth, turning it on it's head by making his messiah an unwilling one, unable to alter his fate.I don't want to give away the story, so I'll just say that this is a book to be read, for it's philosophical musings, religious observations and political theory, as well as for the ride."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Okey, the plot for DUNE MESSIAH goes somethin' like this. Maud'Dib has launched a jihad upon the galaxy, and he has succesfully conquered thousands of planets. Now, you can imagine that he isn't the most well-liked person in the universe. Conspiracies against him abound--even among the Fremen, some of whom have pledged their efforts to revolution and have found a means of obtaining a nuclear weapon.The focus is less on world-building and more on plot in this sequel, but that isn't to say that MESSIAH has nothing new to offer of the Duneiverse. Particularly interesting are the Bene Tleilax, a mysterious race of cloners. Composed of the docile Face Dancers (who can spaheshift) and the ominous Masters, the Tleilaxu are barely human and can engineer anything and anyone bioligcal. They send Maud'Dib a clone of Duncan Idaho trained as a mentat and a Zensunni philosopher....with a secret mission: assassinate Maud'Dib.Dune Messiah is second only to the original novel. Unfortunately, this novel is only 300 pages long and is done with awfully fast. However, it is easily superior to, say, the mundane GOD EMPEROR OF DUNE, or even CHILDREN OF DUNE, because everything is NOT enshrouded in mindless, meaningless philosophy. THINGS ACTUALLY HAPPEN!!! Imagine that.More than a mere sci-fi/fantasy novel, MESSIAH is a work of art and every bit a must-read. You wouldn't read FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and skip THE TWO TOWERS, would you? It's not like you're going to buy FORWARD THE FOUNDATION without buying the original FOUNDATION...so don't stop with DUNE, either.10/10"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is a must have. I'd even say one of the best novels ever written. The idea behind the entire Dune Universe is tremendously well worked out. Frank Herbert's craftmanship is to be studied for ages if you ask me. Many popular sci-fi and fantasy novels haven't got more to tell than the neverending fight between good and evil. The good is white and the bad is black - how very boring. Frank Herbert paints us a universe that is so detailed in both characterization and storyline that it truely becomes real. Marvellous!!!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"As stated in most of the reviews, Dune is a must read for sci-fi fans. I don't want to comment on the story as much as the publisher of this specific book. I purchased a hardcover because I can usually count on a higher quality printing. However, I was discouraged by this book's lack of quality. There were many misspelled words and the printing of letters was incomplete, leaving the bottom portion of a letter but not the top. Overall, I would recommend purchasing Dune, but not from this publisher."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"As is usually the case with me, the library didn't have Dune so I had to read Dune Messiah instead, then I read God Emperor of Dune, THEN I read Dune. When I went to the used bookstore this is what the lady at the cash register said, &quot;Go ahead and take it, it is very important that you read this book.&quot; I'll always remember those words. Dune was far more detailed and wonderful than the previous two books in the series that I had read. Characters that remind you of old friends, great dialogue, a storyline that is truly original and amazing. One parallel that I think many people overlook is that Dune is basically a Science Fiction version of Lawrence of Arabia. A foreigner goes to the desert and wins the hearts of the natives, becoming their leader and takes them to fight against tyranny. I've heard that Lawrence would subject himself to pain so that he would be able to endure it better. Does this remind you of the scene in the beginning when Paul places his hand in the box of pain? There is some really memorable dialogue. In the beginning of the book Thufir Hawat tells Paul how he shouldn't have his back to a door, since he might be assassinated. Hundreds of pages later, Paul meet Thufir and, thinking he's matured, says to Thufir, &quot;as you can see, my back is towards no door.&quot; Thufir brilliantly counters with: &quot;The universe is full of doors.&quot; There are some people who say that this is the worst SF novel ever written. Apparently they are looking too hard at the consistency and sentence-structure and not appreciating this book for its entertainment value. I've read it TWICE so far and I'll definitely read it some more. You might want to note that many fantasy authors use this book as a basis for their works. Robert Jordan and Terry Goodkind come to mind. Fremen = Aiel, Confessors and Aes Sedai = Bene Gesserit. Also, the word &quot;shai'tan&quot; can be found in this book, which is a word that is used by Robert Jordan and Thomas Harris, the guy who wrote Hannibal."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is perhaps the last great work of a Golden Age of Science Fiction. This is not to say that Sci-Fi as a genre is no longer worth reading, but nearly all authors of the genre now conceptualize of themselves as 'Science Fiction authors', and this was not always the case.Dune is not, first and foremost, science fiction. It is commentary. It is some of the most biting and intelligent commentary on religion and government (as well as a plethora of other subjects, ranging from trade unions to ecology) ever written.The fact that it is cloaked in a fantastical future should have no more bearing on our treatment of it than does, say, the fictions of 1984.Dune is one of the greatest stories ever written. This is my firm belief, having read more books than I can care to count. The characters are deep and passionate. Entirely unlike anyone most of us have ever known, yet immenently believable all the same. They are the sort of people we are assured must exist; the sort of people we know mankind is capable of producing.The villains are evil, the heroes are good. There is no ambiguity, but that is because the purpose of the book is not to shed light on the distinctions of good and evil within individual humans, but to investigate the power-plays among people on the grander level.One thing I would caution against when reading this book: commit yourself to reading it. Many find the first half of the book quite slow. Some would even say tedious. Push through it, I beg you. For if you do not, you are cheating yourself of a great joy.And when you finish Dune, continue to the rest of the books in the series. Part of the reason the first half can seem to drag is because Herbert was establishing a universe of incredible complexity. He was thinking in the long term, over a span of six or seven books.And he succeeded in building that universe. The universe of Arrakis. Of Dune. And it will live on in people's minds for many years to come."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is a classic of science fiction and has garnered hundreds of five-star reviews on Amazon, so it clearly has a lot going for it: let's start with that.Herbert has lavished amazing care on the creation of an imagined world complete with its own politics, environment, religion, social classes and conflict. Beyond that, the story here is truly one of epic proportions: the fortunes of royal families ebb and flow over the course of time as they deal underhandedly with one another, lives intertwine, the fate of races, economies and ecologies hang in the balance. As this happens, heroes rise and monsters are revealed. All in all, the story has the makings of being a masterwork of fantasy.So why three stars?In short, weak writing consistently detracts from all that is so strong in this book. There are a couple of problems that rear their heads on a regular basis. First, Herbert clearly wants to let out plot details slowly to create reader suspense. This is a great goal, but Herbert doesn't possess the skill to pull it off. Instead, you just get a deliberate lack of clarity that really takes away from the story in a badly mishandled attempt to make it more suspenseful.Second, Herbert fails to work the details of his imagined world seamlessly into his story. This problem is so severe that the book has a long glossary and several appendices to explain what the prose does not. To some, the add-ons at the end of the book probably further demonstrate the depth of the world Herbert created, but good writing would work in all that depth without the literary crutches.Third is the pacing. This is truly a riveting story and you really want to know what happens next, but you constantly find yourself having to read way too many words to find out. I have no problem with long books, but in good writing every word should have a purpose. In this book, there are chapters that could (and should) be boiled down to a single page and the book would be better off for it. Perhaps all of that appendix material could then be worked into the newly blank pages.It's easy to see why this book is so revered by fans of science fiction. It's rare to find a fantasy world so richly imagined by its creator or a story so epic in scope (comparisons to The Lord of the Rings are apt). However, Tolkein has the story-telling chops to match his imagination where Herbert so clearly does not and it makes all the difference."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I really wanted to like Dune. I really did. But I just couldn't. There's enough here that I didn't like that I just can't put aside; and I stress that these are just my opinions and interpretations of the book, and therefore possibly be irrelevant to people who have different preferences. Skip to the end for a short version of my perceptions of this book.To start with the good - the world of Dune here is excellent. The world is generally consistent, with a good deal of thought put into the various aspects of culture and their interactions with the physical world they're placed in. For the better part, Herbert lets this come out naturally; it's mostly incidental instead of gigantic slabs of information.But, for me at least, this wasn't enough. The characters didn't interest me. Oh, there were a few secondary characters who piqued my interest, but other than that there's nobody I really wanted to read more about. Maybe this has something to do with how all the characters subscribe to the same basic Machiavellian political theory, which more or less deflates their conflicts. Maybe it's the way that Herbert both shows and tells far more than he should, getting inside multiple characters perspectives during a single scene, which removes any suspense or speculation; that typically only works when the characters are on the same side. I don't know. I just didn't care for them.Another problem here are my perceived inconsistencies. For example, the main commodity in this story is shopped around the various Houses, basically like a contract. I can't figure out why the other main players, eg emperor and Bene Gesserit, aren't making more serious attempts to control this commodity; it's outright stated that it's a staple good that is hugely valuable. Especially given the capacity that these main players have to act in their interests so freely.The technology also confused me; I got the stuff about artificial intelligence being bad, but come on, there's a possibility for such a wide expanse of technology without it being AI. Maybe it's because the story was written in the 1960's, so maybe this criticism is a bit unfair. But then they're trained in hand-to-hand combat, even though they have shields that can protect them from those weapons completely. There's a disconnect there between that and the politics that the characters get themselves involved in, I just can't resolve it in my head.A central character, who's supposed to have undergone some of the most thorough psychological training to prepare him for his job and to resist being broken. How is he broken? His wife is kidnapped. While it's a touching moment in a book that doesn't have many, it doesn't make sense. That would, logically, be one of the first things you'd be prepared against. Other characters are supposed to be incredibly intelligent and excellent at critical thought, but then fail to display that. So on and so forth. It killed my suspension of disbelief.Herbert's writing style also grates with me. It's not all bad, but it just seems as though he didn't quite know how to get things from his head onto the page; the result is, in my opinion, an awkward, cluttered prose. The pacing is poor. Too much telling, especially in establishing character relationships. Then there are sections where a bit of exposition IS required and instead there's only showing (a good example is when the ecologist is talking about \\"tipping\\" the ecosystem - i'm no stranger to climate science, but I had to read this half a dozen times before it started making sense).There are other things i've probably forgotten, but these are my main gripes. Again, I wanted to like this book, I just couldn't. I have to have a reason to immerse myself in the world so deeply as to gain the same knowledge as hardcore fans; I couldn't find that reason in this book.So long story short: wonderful world, decent plot, characters felt flat, uninspiring and too similar to me, a number of poor writing choices that left me disoriented, and too many logical inconsistencies within the story. The logical inconsistencies annoy me, but the ultimate let down is characters. I left this book completely indifferent to the characters.2/5"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Why is this e-book $16 and the actual book can be picked up for $3 at betterworldbooks.com?

It seemed a little rushed, as if Frank Herbert didn't put in as much time into this one as he did with the first, but don't lose hope -- this book is still good reading, and thought provoking. If you loved Dune, you'll want to read this book too."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I put this book down the first time I attempted to read it simply because the first book had such a triumphant ending that the dark nature of 'Dune Messiah' just didn't work for me. I had attempted to read this book just having completed the first one. My second attempt came two months later and this time I read it entirely in a matter of days. I'm glad I did. 'Dune' is an epic in every sense of the word. 'Dune Messiah' is anything but an epic. It is a singular story dealing mostly with the inherent problems of religion and politics becoming one. Paul struggles with the consequenses of the jihad yet feels powerless to stop it. He is nothing more than a figurehead to his Qizara and wants to be free of this and the burden of prescience. I don't wish to give anything away but this book is worth reading if only for the fantastic ending. And by the way, 'Children of Dune' is a return to the epic style with which 'Dune' was written."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Look, I love Herbert, and I love Dune, and I just got a Kindle for Christmas, so I figured I would get at least the first three books, but, guys? You might want to take a look at your pricing, there. I am NOT going to pay MORE for the Kindle edition than for the paperback. Particularly not for a book I already own, just for the convenience of reading it Kindle-ized. I hope that is some kind of silly, easily fixed error. Oh, and guys? Also not paying more than four bucks for an e-version a book as short as Dune Messiah. If the publishers are making you do this, feel free to forward this review to them."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"\\"Dune\\" is a wonderful book. I read it years ago and loved Herbert's talent for world-building. \\"Fear is the mindkiller...\\" is a mantra that I've used over and over.So why am I giving it a 1 star rating? Like other Kindle readers, I'm appalled at the price, which is actually higher than the price for the hardback. As other reviewers have pointed out, the Kindle edition is also highly flawed--formatting and spelling errors abound. Is it so much to ask the publisher to get it right? Also, this is a 40 year old book. Penguin has no business charging this much for a non-print edition of a book that is readily available in multiple editions used and is ten bucks new in paper."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is one of my favorite books (series!) ever. But after reading the reviews here (and on iBooks) and after reading a few pages on a friends' Kindle all I can say is shame on you Amazon (and Apple). C'mon folks. At least run a frickin' spell checker before you try to screw me out of 15 bucks! The translation from the original is abysmal."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Great setting, rounded characters, and fine plotting. But amazing? One of my problems with the book is that the action takes place &quot;off-screen,&quot; and devotes way too much time to the sometimes pretentious and boring inner monologues of the characters. While it is eons better than that lousy movie, I was disappointed with the ending. Once Paul Maud'Dib is aware that he's the Kwisatz Haderach, he loses his humanity. There's no sense of struggle or conflict with the Harkonnens, Saurdaurker, and Emperor -- you know he's going to win. The knife fight at the end lacks dramatic impact -- he chooses it, it doesn't feel inevitable. However, the book does make one think and can be regarded as a &quot;Hamlet&quot; revenge story meets an interplanetary &quot;Lawrence of Arabia.&quot; While it's hard to believe that 20,000 years in the future societies need a spice for geriatric purposes and the Bene Gesserits wait 90 generations to perfect their genetic line when in the near future OUR genetic engineering will do the same -- the plotting keeps you on your toes. The depiction of the Fremen is both moving and interesting. Before Paul becomes the messiah, you really care about him."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book is the shortest of all the six in the series. And yet, despite being less wordy, less worldly, less epic, it packs such a punch that I was left mentally reeling after the last chapter.Paul's almighty victory on Dune hasn't spawned the cosy future that we foresaw for him. His Fremen armies engage in intergalactic jihad; his own Fremen advisors are getting corrupt in all the wealth; all around are conspirators plotting his usurpment; and everywhere he looks with his prescient eye he sees dark nightmares of futures, one of which he must choose to realise.This book sees the introduction of a new brand of human organisation - the Bene Tleilax, a breed that meddle in genetics and boast their own tricks such as Face Dancers who can shift appearance and behaviour to trick the unwary.The story is compelling. You find yourself more and more drawn into the horror that unfolds. Again, Herbert has managed to make the book unpredictable at all times, leaving you gasping at one nasty occurence after another.If you think you might go the whole way and read all six books in the series, then do read this book after Dune. If you don't think you'll manage all six books, it's perhaps best you don't venture beyond Dune, for this book leaves the universe in a sad state compared to the heroic victory at the end of the first tale."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Frank Herbert's 1965 novel, &quot;Dune,&quot; is a work of startling depth and of lingering relevance to current readers. Creating a civilization out of bits and pieces of European feudalism, Arab and Islamic traditions, startlingly modern geopolitics, ecology, and an advanced handling of cultural mythopoetics, Herbert's &quot;Dune&quot; is far more than a simple &quot;sci-fi&quot; adventure tale. Like JRR Tolkien's earlier &quot;Lord of the Rings&quot; saga, Herbert fashioned a novel which has endured for 40 years because of its ability to appeal to so many readers in so many different ways.&quot;Dune&quot; begins when the 15 year old heir, Paul Atreides, is preparing to leave his lush homeworld, Caladan, with his father Duke Leto and his mother, the Bene Gesserit concubine Lady Jessica, for their newly assigned fief, the desert planet, Arrakis (also known as the eponymous Dune). We are constantly reminded by the narrator and the characters that the political balance between the noble Houses of the Landsraad confederation is highly precarious - that plots within plots and feints within feints are to be found in any kind of political or economic maneuvre. Accordingly, the Atreides takeover of Arrakis is in a constant state of danger. The family they are replacing, the Harkonnens, led by the scheming evil of the nefarious and repulsive Baron Vladimir Harkonnen (who for good measure is coded as sexually-deviant) plots with the family of the Emperor to disgrace and unseat House Atreides. When the Imperial-Harkonnen plot succeeds in murdering Duke Leto Atreides, and forcing Paul and his mother into the deep desert, the true action of the novel begins.The most valuable thing in Herbert's universe is the Spice, Melange, which is only found in the deserts of Arrakis, guarded, surrounded, and even produced by the dangerous giant sandworms. It is at the heart of many of the novel's conspiracies and power plays. In Herbert's anti-techonology universe, Spice enables mysteriously deformed members of the Spacing Guild to warp space for interplanetary travel; it opens the mystic order of the Bene Gesserit to extra-sensory perception; and most tellingly for &quot;Dune,&quot; it gives the indigenous population of Arrakis, the Fremen, blue-within-blue eyes. It is to the Fremen that Paul Atreides and his mother must appeal, and even depend, to retake Arrakis. The water-zealous Fremen, living in the deepest desert regions, believe that Paul is the Mahdi, the savior of their legends.Caught between politics and religion, Paul Atreides (known to the Fremen as both Usul and Muad'dib) becomes, if he wasn't before, the focal point of the novel. In a novel in which plots, breeding programs, and martial training seem to argue for the ability of people to control their own destinies, Paul cannot seem to escape the notion that the path of his own life is horribly fated. As the Fremen religious figurehead, Muad'dib, Paul spends the greatest part of the novel tortured by the idea that he cannot avoid the destiny he is hurtling toward, envisioning a future where his sect will terrorize the universe in an unstoppable jihad.Of course, there is much more to say about Herbert's &quot;Dune,&quot; but I think it appropriate to mention just one more thing which really appealed to me in the novel. Along the lines of fate/free will, each chapter of the novel is tellingly prefaced by quotations from books, either about or related to the history of Muad'dib (note, not &quot;Paul&quot;), most of which are attributed to Princess Irulan (the daughter of the Emperor when the action of the novel begins). The prefatory excerpts, one of which actually begins the text of the novel, perform an intertextual struggle with Paul's own self-doubts throughout the novel. While Paul wonders if he can change his own fate, Irulan's excerpts, written from a time clearly after the action of the novel, seem to confound his attempts, adding a melancholy sense of fatalism to Herbert's novel. For me this renders Paul-Muad'dib less an epic hero than a tragic victim of a tale much larger and longer than this novel could contain. Brief allusions to our own Earth as part of the novel's distant past should cause us to reflect even further, as Tolkien's &quot;Ring&quot; novels do, on our own individual relationships to each other, to our world, and to our relationships to power. For an ostensibly &quot;sci-fi&quot; novel to do all of this, for me, is remarkable."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I have now read Dune twice, and it remains, upon completing it a second time, just as good, intriguing, and thought-provoking as it was the first time around. It's one of those rare, wonderful novels after the reading of which no other books seem quite good enough to read for a while. In fact, Dune is so great that though I own the sequels, I haven't yet been able to read them for the fear that they might in some way diminish the masterpiece that is the original.When I first read this book, my schoolwork and social life suffered through the days it took to read it. I almost literally couldn't put it down. This novel is so engrossing, so enthralling, and so REAL that you wonder how you ever enjoyed the shallowness that is most sci-fi novels. In fact, Dune isn't just the best science fiction novel of all time, it's one of the best pieces of literature, period.And it is a very real world. The multilayered plots, the believable science, the shades-of-gray characters, the religions, emotions, technology...everything. Arthur C. Clarke is quoted in the book as saying that, &quot;Unique...I know of nothing comparable to it except The Lord of the Rings.&quot; It's true.Any type of plot synopsis I try to give here would be hopelessly muddled and confusing, so I'll forgo that in this review and simply say that, to use the old saw, If you only read one book this year, read Dune."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Since enough has been written about the _Dune_ story, let me focus this review on helping the potential reader sift through the accumulated viewpoints. I will allude to some degree to the series that follows it, on the grounds that this pertains to whether one would want to invest the time in the first book to begin with.First off, _Dune_ is deep. It's exciting, and Herbert is a master of creating The Moment. It has some of the richest character development you will ever see. It is often very subtle and will tend to inspire you to question some basic assumptions. It is a very egalitarian book in which both genders are quite deadly.So who might not like it? Well, on your first go, it can be hard to 'get it'; my first effort didn't succeed, as a matter of fact. I read on, bewildered, not understanding much. (Lucky for me I gave it another go at a later date.) You should be prepared for there to be a large leap between each book (sometimes thousands of years). Herbert handles these quantum leaps interestingly, but they can throw you a curve. Also, if you want light reading, Herbert isn't it. And there is no question that there are mature and sometimes disturbing themes. (If your child is old enough to make sense of it, s/he is probably old enough to deal with the disturbing parts.)Essentially, _Dune_ (and the series) is one of those works people either love or they hate. My recommendation is to try it--it is surely a masterpiece in the eyes of many, myself included--but to be prepared to invest time and brainpower in picking up the storyline, mulling over questions, and other cerebral pursuits. If you go into it armed with this understanding, your odds of enjoying it are excellent."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"After hearing and reading many glowing reviews, I was disappointed to find that Dune was not quite what I had expected. Perhaps my less-than-perfect rating is due to the discrepancy between my expectations and what was delivered, but I found that Dune lacked a overall cohesiveness that would have merited it the fifth star. There were points where the novel seemed to teeter on the edge of something greater, but the potential was never fulfilled and the work would quickly steer clear of whatever larger goal it had glimpsed.The barren landscape which Herbert depicts is very real in its harsh cruelties, and I doubt that anyone could dispute Herbert's ability to render an entire world and a related existence with such precision. However, I found his characters devoid of that which gave his landscape such life, almost paling in comparison to the grand events and environment sweeping around them page after page. They seemed less human than pawns of fate, even Paul with all his power; perhaps that is Herbert's point, but not one I felt it was necessary to sacrifice character quality to prove.The greatest flaw of the work was my lack of belief, in both the characters and events. I believe the greatest sign of a work to be the level in which one can relate, or even believe in the reality, the truth which the author presents. I felt incredibly distant from the events I read, unable to suspend my disbelief even momentarily. I felt that the story was repetitive, cycling within the same limited confines, and even the the magnitude of the ending did not seem a release. Although the end of the novel is a far cry from what the reader could imagine at the beginning, the story lacked a quality that made me believe. I gave it four stars only because of the quality of the author's writing, and because I can see the potential effect of such a work for other readers even if I am unable to experience it myself.Perhaps I should temper my critique with a confession, however. When this book was recommended to me, it was compared to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings trilogy. I read it in anticipation of what I had read and so enjoyed in Tolkien's work, only to be disappointed when I realized that it was nothing similar. Perhaps had I read it without any preconceptions, I would be able to appreciate Herbert's work on its own merits. Unfortunately, I found myself comparing it to the fantasy trilogy, resulting in the review you read above. I am more a fantasy-fiction lover than one of science fiction, which gives me a definite bias. If you like science fiction then by all means, I highly recommend this book as one of the watersheds of modern science fiction."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"When I first read Dune, I became obsessed. what a great storyline! It had just about everything I've been looking for in Science-Fiction, such as a really complex plot and an almost complete lack of cliches, among other things.Then I picked up all the other Dune books (Including Dune: House Atreides) to see if it could accomplish the other impossible: Surviving through about six sequels.You know what? It couldn't. Instead, I get what is the second worst of the Dune books (the worst being God Emperor). So WHY is it so bad?First, its the shortest of the series. Its only got like 300 pages while the others have at least 450.Second, Herbert seems to of lost it. Rather than having a complex story with alot of subtleties like the first one, we have a bunch of unconnected events, most of which are trhere for no apparent reason. For example: Alia fighting a training machine naked, Paul losing his eyes, etc. The Bene Gesserit come up with a plan to get another Kwisatz Haderach... and drop the plan almost immediately, it seems. there is also supposed to be some conspiracy, but that part is breifly wrapped up in the ending.One problem with Dune as a whole is that the characters never really have definate personality traits. One minute Paul is a hero type, another minute he's a tyrant, and then next he's confused. No consistency at all. Then we have Alia. She was an extremely wise little girl in the first one, but you wouldn't know from Messiah or Children of Dune, in which she seemingly lost all her intellect and now is simply a stock character with emotional problems. If I wanted that, I'd play a Final Fantasy game.These, my friends, are why I do not like Dune Messiah. As of writng, I've read through God Emperor and started on Heretic (I might as well finish) and can say: read the first Dune, which was GREAT, but ignore the sequels unless you're obsessed."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Why is the kindle version more expensive than a hard copy?

When I moved I left it so that the next person would be able to read it and enjoy it, knowing that I would probably get a digital version the next time I wanted to read it. $14.99 for a 40 year old book that can be picked up in innumerable used book stores? That much for a book that is 40 years old? There's no reason for it to be more expensive than a print version. Now, instead of buying it, I'm going to pass. I'm also going to pass on all the sequels I might have bought after it, and all because Penguin doesn't understand the digital world yet. Readers shouldn't have to pay for a publisher's mistake.

I delayed reading it for years because I usually avoid cult classics and overhyped books. But the moment I started reading Dune, I was captivated.This book creates an entire world and society (what I love best about sci-fi, when done really well.) And this book has an epic struggle of Good and Evil. The bad guys are really BAD. The good guys are complex, heroic and vulnerable at times. There are plots, sub-plots and counter-plots.Some fascinating concepts are introducted in Dune; an order of women who control breeding of superior human beings and influence politics--the Bene Gesserit, the Mentats, human savants who replaced computers when computers were banned from the universe for their &quot;dehumanizing&quot; effect. And the Fremen, a desert people who are fiercer than the trained killer army of the Padishah Emperor.This is the most exciting science fiction book I ever read, and is one of my favorite books of all times. If you haven't read it, you are in for a treat. Dune is complicated at times, but always worthwhile."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Underlying the structure and presentation of Dune are a number of disturbing presumptions. Together they conspire to make Dune intellectually depressing. I think very few readers would finish the book feeling \\"good\\". I agree that the effort in imagining the various groups portrayed, their customs, the ecology of Dune and the worms, all this is a magnificent achievement by the author. However, for me, the psychological world inhabited by his characters was much less varied and much less involving: in what follows I hope to suggest why this was so.The novel's world is Machiavellian. The motivation of virtually every character is a lust for power. It is a crude lust in that there is no detailed vision of what purpose such power could serve. Indeed, there is no vision of what constitutes a good life. Without enemies, the characters lose all direction - if they are not openly fighting each other, then at the very least they must fight the elements, as embodied by the eponymous planet, Dune. The characters, while differentiated in some ways, share the premiss that the purpose of conversation is to manipulate the interlocutor; practical intelligence is measured by the ability to hide one's own intentions, while discovering those hidden by the other party - this secrecy implies that most intentions are intrinsically hostile. By sharing these assumptions, the characters lose their individuality, and paradoxically their struggles lose their potency, since it is not a clash of opposites (despite the superficial, and very well drawn, differences in dress, background, and supernatural abilities). Those characters who do not personally engage in such tendentious discussion ally themselves unreflectively with one party or another - and they generally express their allegiance through overt violence - these characters too fail to individuate themselves, all falling into the role of the loyal lackey. This is a world informed by \\"The Prince\\", Nietzsche, and Hobbes.There is little or no scientific curiosity displayed by any character, nor is such curiosity venerated. It is really a misnomer to term this book science fiction - it has far more in common with medieval fantasy stories. The disciplines of body and mind at which the central characters excel would not be out of place in an Asian martial arts tale. Technology is limited and it is a given - what is mentioned has the status of an artisan craft, such as the Fremen skills in manufacturing clothing. Knowledge comes from revelation, or is passed from generation to generation - it is not earned through rational enquiry and experimental method.Similarly, the arts are at best sources of brief diversion. As a token, the man Halleck strums a stringed instrument and recites appalling poetry. Aside from him virtually no mention is made of literature, the visual arts, music, or philosophy.Blood ties win out over any more universal sense of morality. Allied to this are themes of overt eugenics. This ugly emphasis on genes and family loyalties speaks of the tale's respect for, if not implicit endorsement of, social Darwinism - a theory dangerous in its rampant oversimplification of real society. It is the kind of thinking which recalls that of the Nazis.Religion is dealt with in a dismissive way. Yes, there is the appropriation of many terms from Islam, and the depiction of rituals borrows from Christianity and elsewhere, but all this is implied to be a means to an end. The Bene Gesserit \\"Sisterhood\\" implant legends, religious in flavour, so as to facilitate their \\"breeding program\\". Paul looks to his status as deity as a means to secure political power, and to inspire violence (which becomes uncontrollable, and this lack of control he admittedly regrets up to a point). This is a very instrumental and cynical view of religion. It very much neglects a more general sense of wonder and amazement at our existence which, more optimistically, fills the spirit of religion.The protagonist Paul Atreides is horribly solipsistic. Ok, so he's the Messiah, but he doesn't have to believe his own publicity. He can see the future, but he has great trouble empathizing with anyone - compared with his overarching ambitions, the lives and desires of others seem at best trivial, and at worst invisible. This solipsism is married to a kind of determinism, or, if you like, fatalism - in making decisions he has a very limited choice, and the making at times feels more like the toss of the coin than a willed act. Possibly Herbert had read Sartre and was impressed by the Existentialist notion of radical choice - Sartre writes of a being attaining Messianic status, or perfection, and being faced with only one last authentic choice: that of self-annihilation. This is truly a bleak vision, and one deeply disrespectful of the reality of other lives and the interconnectednes of them too.Unsurprisingly, given all the above presumptions, the world of Dune is unremmittingly humourless. There is deadly earnestness hanging over everything. Life is nasty, brutish, and tediously prolonged. It's a shame that a movie version of this wasn't made in the 60's, directed by Jonathan Miller, with Dudley Moore as Paul, and Peter Cook as Stilgar; Peter Sellars would make an outstanding Jessica, and possibly Peter Ustinov could be stuffed into a worm-suit...having finished reading this book the two things I imagine most readers would need would be a glass of water and a good laugh."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"You might think this book is awful after just reading it... This may be because it's a very sudden change from adventure / action to political intrigue and complex storyline. I don't know, personally I loved it, and I thought it was excellent, if not the best, until I read God Emperor of Dune. My advice to you is: you might not fully understand some of Paul's actions until you've read , Children of Dune &amp; God Emperor of Dune. You have yet to discover what that terrible fate consists of, and how small Paul can be compared to his son Leto II.What I don't aprove at ALL are those people saying &quot;I didn't like this book, don't read it and don't read any book after the first/second/and so on&quot;. Besides, even when you might not like Dune Messiah's complexity or Children of Dune's super-human theory, it doesn't mean you won't like the rest of the series. This is different for every reader. I personally love Dune Messiah and God Emperor of Dune, because of their complexity. Others may prefer Dune or Children of Dune because of having adventure/action. It's up to you: Dune is a very balanced series and it's impossible to love every single book, or to determine which one is the best.Anyway, we have to admit Frank Herbert had a prodigal brain... how did he do to imagine an entire planet's ecology, an entirely different human society, such a distant future?

Amazon and the publisher should be ashamed to be marketing this Kindle version with so many misspellings. This is one of the top classic Science Fiction titles of all time. I am here to tell you to that this Kindle edition is not worthy of your funds. I could excuse a couple of errors in the book, but the Kindle edition is **RIFE** with them. A major Kindle disappointment that I will not soon forget. I have purchased *many* other Kindle books and witnessed misspellings, but was able to forgive due to infrequency and more obscure book titles. But to see so many misspellings in such a renown title was rather disgusting. I had planned to buy the other Dune books on Kindle but will not do so now, solely due to this issue. I have better ways of spending ~$40 than to spend it on products that evidently the publisher and seller care nothing about. Can't express in words just how angry I was to see this book given this treatment. One final note, I saw another post that said the Kindle edition had the same misspellings as the original book. I have no idea what Kindle edition this person was comparing to what print edition, but I am here to tell you that this is NOT the case with this Kindle edition. The misspellings in this Kindle edition are NUMEROUS, GROSS in their error, and DO NOT match the paperback book I own of the same title (I have Dune, 40th Anniversary Edition in paperback - the multitude of errors I checked are not found in this print edition).As for the book itself, what is there to say that has not already been said?

This time, though, the story is less epic: The Harkonens have been defeated and a corrupt Emperor has been cast away from his throne, the precious spice is now being distributed by necessary quantities and the Bene Gesserit have gained Paul's entire mistrust.This time we are told about a spiritually hurt Paul Atreides, a man who still cannot come to fully grasp the devastating power his god-like nature has on the psyche of those who worship him as a Messiah. Paul's attempts to stop the bloody jihad set in motion by his messianic reign are futile and his minions seem to enjoy the bloody massacre just for the sake of killing, using Paul's image solely as a shield, an excuse for mindless slaughter. Worst yet, his prescient powers have shown him the terrible future that awaits humanity, and the horrible alternative, a sacrifice so monstrous not even the Kwizats Haderach dares face. Meanwhile, a conspiracy against Paul's life is being cooked among a wide number of people, ranging from government agents to retired fedaykin warriors.Many judge this to be the worst among the Dune books, but personally I find it a very good read because we have a more direct chance to take a deeper look at Paul's disturbed mind. A worthy little book filled with surprises."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"How often do you find a book of moderate length with original and complex characters, set in a compelling historical and physical context, that has a complete story arch that lets you close the book satisfied? Infrequently, especially in the world of Sci-Fi. It is the accomplishment of all of these that allows &quot;Dune&quot; -- if not its sequels -- to hold its own among all the great stories of our time.Many others here have written about Herbert's brilliant character development and his incredible creativity in conceiving the world of &quot;Dune&quot;. I would like to call your attention, though, to the satisfaction that comes from reading a well thought out story that is told deftly and with passion. All too often in Science Fiction (and non-Sci Fi for that matter) we see books premised on a few ideas that go nowhere as a story. Authors have very original ideas that suck us into the book, tease us along for a while, and then end the story with a fizzle, dragging us into a morass of over-wrought characters and needlessly complicated plot-lines. Neal Stephenson's &quot;The Diamond Age&quot; is a perfect example. Your feeling after the first 50 pages is, &quot;What a cool idea! This is great!&quot; But the book ends up taking you on a long, slow downhill ride with an ending that is nowhere close to the brilliance of the original concept.&quot;Dune&quot; does not do this. It lifts you gently into the main story, making sure to point out the relevant characters and side-plots as you go along, builds your anticipation over its entirety, and continually keeps you fresh and interested. The resolution is complete and timely, and doesn't leave you slogging through 20 meaningless pages at the end. When you finish, you can look back and say, &quot;What a great story, and what a great storyteller.&quot;I believe the goal of all fiction should be to make readers say that, and with &quot;Dune&quot; Frank Herbert has definitely made me say it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I give Frank Herbert's DUNE five stars not because I belong to any small group of overzealous supporters, but because it is honestly one of the finest science-fiction novels I have ever read.DUNE combines the best of &quot;golden-age&quot; science fiction. (space opera, emperors, genetic supermen) with the technological believability of the 60's New Wave . Although Herbert's writing is plodding and stilted, the reader is ultimately kept reading to learn more about the byzantine politics of the Imperium and the wonderfully portrayed environment of the desert planet Arrakis.Another reason the book deserves notice is because it is appealing to all ages, much like the works of Mark Twain. I read DUNE for the first time as a 10-year old and again ten years later, seeing the plot from a different angle but no less impressed with Herbert's world building.Granted, a lot of people are going to be put off by the prose, but the plot machinations and futuristic-but-feudal society make the book fantastic. And the setting is extremely original. As the reviewer below pointed out, the planet is really the main character."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I was very excited through the first half of the book because of the vast range of creative ideas and thoughtful insights into human personalities & psychology. The influence on the author of WW2 and the cold war after it are evident, in stories of loyalty and betrayal and traitors within. The ending is a bit of a let down after such a beautifully crafted work. I think this book has been missed out on by a lot of people (like myself in the past) who dismissed the idea of a powerful novel within science fiction. It probably deserves to be in the top 40 books of all time."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"this is one of my all time favorite books. i love post apocalyptic dystopian fiction, and though this is a universe only loosely connected to our own, the themes are painfully relevant.Herbert was a master, and it shows. in this one book (the rest of the series drops off in quality), he creates an entire universe, complete with politics, religion, cultures, legends, heros and villians. he constructs a world that is entirely foreign, yet strangely captivating, compelling and strikingly familiar in its humanity, and lack there of.i frequently pick up used copies of this at garage sales and used book stores so i can pass them on to friends. i can't stand the idea that there are people unfamiliar with this amazing tale. don't be put off by the movies versions. while the david lynch version captured the lusciousness of Herbert's world, he utterly lost the story. the sci-fi channel version is true to the story, but with an austerity reflective of the planet dune, but not to this masterpiece of fiction."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"When I'd first come across this book, I'd have thought it would have been a drag.

Instead, the universe of \\"Dune\\" is shaped by organic concepts: mysticism and ecology, intelligent machines having been banned. Great Houses govern their planets as fiefdoms. Duke Leto of the House Atreides is sent to rule the desert planet Arrakis, the source of the spice melange, upon which all economic, social, and political structure depends. The drug facilitates preternatural computational and intuitive abilities in its users. The Harkonnen Baron, a ruthlessly ambitious leader of a rival House, plots the murder of Duke Leto, his concubine Jessica, and their teenaged son Paul in order to reclaim Arrakis. But he has underestimated young Paul, who may be the prophesied savior, a male who possesses the greatest powers of the female mystic sect Bene Gesserit. And he has underestimated the fierce Fremen desert people, whose ambitions and accomplishments defy their primitive reputation.\\"Dune\\" excels in evoking a culture with values very different than our own but connected to us by bits and pieces of Islamic and Christian doctrine that readers will recognize. The unusual social structure and value systems of these future humans appeal to the imagination. And the ability to read what the characters are thinking -always in italics- involves the reader in their lives and minds. The only fault I find with the novel is that it is long, spending more time than necessary on Paul and Jessica's flight through the desert and struggles amongst the Fremen. But the excessive time spent with some characters does immunize \\"Dune\\" from the poor character development that is common to science fiction. The politics of the story are utterly arcane. But author Frank Herbert has grasped the idea that cultures are defined by their limitations, and he makes excellent use of Arrakis' limited water supply as the defining characteristic of Fremen society. \\"Dune\\"'s vivid cultures and page-turning adventure make it one of the great works of science fiction."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This isn't just one of the greatest sci-fi novels written, but one of the greatest novels ever written, period. The characters and believable, the situations intriguing and the science pretty much sound.Frank Herbert based most of his books around power struggles and how humans operate when given exceeding harsh conditions to survive in. Here you'll see parries within parries, fantastic interplays of action and diplomatic maneuvering that would make Machiavelli take some lessons.Paul Atreides still is one of the most brilliant characters ever to grace any book. He's brash, arrogant, and is going headlong into a situation that he knows will only end poorly for him in the end. It's a compassion for the people, a want for revenge, and a primal struggle to survive that eventually leads him to embrace the beginnings of the golden path.The Baron is a satisfying villain, and truly one of the most vile to be found in all literature. A lot of the likeable characters get killed off, as another positive point is that about everyone feels killable, which adds much to the suspense of the novel.Any sci-fi fan owe's himself to read this."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I have always shied away from Science Fiction. I don't know what it is about it, but it has never appealed to me. To illustrate: a friend of mine bought me this book four years ago with the promise that it would be worth my while and I have only recently read it.If DUNE is a good representation of Science Fiction, then I have been missing out. What a great book. I always hesitate to voice my opinion on books that are time tested. I mean, do you really need someone to tell you that the LORD OF THE RINGS are good books. Still, if you, like me, eschew Science Fiction for fantasy or other fare, then hopefully my review will persuade you.I enjoyed the technique the author used of dropping the reader into a new world together with the protagonist. We learn as he does. This keeps the pace of the book brisk. Other authors have employed this technique less effectively.The world - Dune - is original and intriguing. The originality of the book is probably its greatest selling point. I have not seen, or imagined this type of world (apart from the obvious homage in Beetlejuice).I thought that the development of characters - both as to the insight into their character and their acquisition of skills and powers - was also a great contributor to my enjoyment of the book. One gets a good feel for the motivation and reasoning behind all of the characters actions, be they prominent or not. Also, the book does not waste a great deal of time developing the protagonist. His progression as a powerful figure progresses quickly. This I think lends itself to better story telling.My experience with many fantasy books is that the development of super-powers IS the story. Once the protagonist has developed the powers, then the final conflict is brief and ultimately unsatisfying. Here, there is a story to be told after the pieces are in place, so to speak. It works.In all, I think that whether you're a fan or Science Fiction or not, you will enjoy DUNE. I whole-heartedly recommend it. It has inspired me to read ENDER'S GAME. Another Sci-Fi book I've put off for years. I'll report back to you on my impressions of it here."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I'll start with this: Dune is a great science fiction book. It captures the reader and holds them tight. There are wonderful parts with great characters and a fascinating plotline. The politics in this book are really great and interesting. There are, however, parts that are less interesting, and sometimes let the reader down.The book is not spectacular. There are definitely other books out there that are better than Dune. What is special with it is that it has this good plotline with lots of action and intruiging concepts, and that it also has characters that are interesting.The story is about Paul, his family, the families at war around him, and the spices found only on Dune. Paul is a strange kind of kid, but he's fascinating as a character, and understanding where his head is is great. We also get to know his mother very well, and she was personally my favorite character.This is a science fiction classic. Despite there being better books out there, I can't help but like it more than one should. Despite minor flaws, and other small things, I know that you, the reader, will not be as eager to read it should I rate it a four. It deserves a four-and-a-half, because reading it is certainly worth your while."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"At first sight, Dune may be viewed as a classic that will just be called \\"The Best Sci-Fi Novel Ever Written\\" and that fact will prevent people from reading it, simply because they've heard \\"It's the best there is\\" and there's no reason to read it, they already know it's good. Not True! Until you've read Dune, Dune cannot be judged.The story starts out with Duke Leto, the son of Duke Leto I, being forced to leave his home planet by the ambitious Emperor. Meanwhile, the Duke's son, Paul, trains his last lessons with his teachers, Yoeh, a doctor and wise man and his teacher in swordsmanship. As the tension grows, the Ducal family and their soldiers, servants and belongings move to the dessert planet, Arrakis (Dune), and settle into a new mansion.Although, Thufir Hawat, the lead commanding officer in the Duke's army, and a mentat(A human trained for combat and has supernatural intelligence)cleared the mansion as \\"Safe\\", there is a traitor amongst the family and soldiers. And one of the suspected is the Duke's advisor and the mother of Paul, Lady Jessica.Jessica, trained in the arts of the Bene Gesserit (A religious group that struggles for power over all the royal rulers) is considered a \\"witch\\" among some and capable of evil deeds. The story moves on to the tragic betrayal that would lead to the downfall of Duke Leto's house and the rise of the Baron, his own cousin.Dune is about Paul's adventure throught the wide dessert of Arrakis, fighting against giant sand worms, traitorous royalty, the Emperor's soldiers (Sadaukaur) and the religious extremists who would follow Paul to the end of the universe, the Fremen.The Fremen, who value water like gold and think of Jessica's powers as both amazing and deadly, and revere Paul like a god, teach these powerful humans the meaning of value, and the meaning of the phrase \\"you need to be the dessert to own it\\".Frank Herbert's novel is a triumph among Sci-Fi, it's story, though simple enough to follow, grips you and pulls you along for a ride of suprising twists, turns, references to religion, values and a change in a Duke's son, that will leave the minds of all readers blank and speechless.Read Dune and I promise that you will not be dissapointed!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"One of the best things about parenthood is the opportunity it affords to revisit books you might otherwise forget or never return to. I'm sure that if I hadn't been scratching around to think of new books to occupy a nearly-14-year-old on a 10 hour drive to Scotland I would never in a million years have picked up Frank Herbert's seminal Dune. Well, that would have been my loss. I did pick it up and ended up glued to it throughout my holiday. It was a total joy to rediscover - my only worry is that I'm not sure when I'll find time to move on to the rest of the Dune books. It's also alarming to realise how much time has passed since then and sad to discover that Herbert himself has died long ago - I'm a bit worried to learn that his son's picked up the mantle and is doing Dune Prequels. I hope they are better than George Lucas's attempts on Star Wars.Any way - don't be ashamed to read nerdy Sci-Fi, whatever your age or parental status. Dune is still fantastic, its charms are undimmed and it is as addictive as spice."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Before this book, the only knowledge I had of Dune was the 1980's movie that featured actors Sting and Patrick Stewart (of Jean-Luc Picard fame). I did not think it was a very good movie. But it seems the people who know sci-fi literature really believe Dune to be among the best. So, I decided to give it a shot.This book is a real tremendous work. It's not perfect, but it is so deep and intricate that I found myself lost in it. Frank Herbert really attached a good portion of philosophy in this book, and this is clearly seen in how he lets you into the thought-life of all his characters (good and bad). Furthermore each chapter begins with an excerpt from future fictional books that read like spiritual scripture. I found myself reading these a couple times over to make sure I understood what he was saying. I didn't necessarily agree with the conclusions, but you shouldn't care what I think about that. You should know that his thoughts are provocative and will make you think.The story itself is beautiful. It's tough in the beginning because this world, its people and culture are so foreign. As you read you find terms that you cannot yet define. Hang in there though, the mystique does get explained.The characters and their interactions and motivations are entirely believable. And having access to their thoughts is such a good idea, and it's unfortunate that those portions of the book could not be easily translated into movie-form.There are some things that I would have liked. The ending of this book jumps around a bit and seemed a little hurried. There's a big climax coming and then main characters are killed, but you, as the reader, find out about it secondhand. I would have liked to read the action from those scenes.It is also easy to get lost in all the cultural nuances of the Fremen and Bene Gesserit. Sometimes I knew what they were talking about, and sometimes I just couldn't get it. I would read some paragraphs over a few times, and then just move on. Generally I could get at least a basic-level understanding of what was being talked about.All in all, I've enjoyed this book more than any I can remember from the last few years of reading. It's great and you just want to keep going. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This may be the most overrated book of all time. I had expected to like it a lot, but the reality was otherwise.First, let's start with the good: The setting of Arrakis is cool. So much for the good.On the bad side, we have uniformly unappealing, sterotypical characters. We have utterly plain, unlyrical, and occasionally incomprehensible writing that belongs in a middle school literary journal, not in a published novel. Worst of all, it seems like fully half this book consists of the internal thoughts of the characters. Where's the \\"show, don't tell\\" concept that everyone learns on the first day of creative writing class? This book is 450 pages of \\"tell\\" and 50 pages of \\"show.\\"Finally, if you haven't read this monstrosity yet, here's a paragraph from the book to show you the kind of writing you're missing: \\"This realization returned a small measure of confidence, and again she ventured to focus on the psychokinesthetic extension, becoming a mote-self that searched within her for danger.\\" Writing of this quality speaks for itself."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Many readers often incorrectly guess the title as being inspired by the desert regions of Saudi Arabia. While the massive machines of the oil refineries of Arabia and the Northwest are in part, the author was more inclined towards the fragile ecology of the duneform stuctures near Reedsport, Oregon ...Often difficult to suppose the author's real meaning.Interesting book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Lot's of hype, good substance/plot/characters, but no suspense. There is a lot to slog through and this book is slow reading. I did have to put it down after ^150 pages because after a while, I just wasn't interested. Who are these Dune cultists? Living in a big city, I can't say I've met one."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I can see how this book was once considered great, just like Star Wars once had the best special effects and the Cubs were once a good baseball team... A LONG TIME AGO. Modern readers will likely find Dune slow paced, overly ambitious, and mediocre at best."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I must admit I heard a lot about the book prior to reading it: 1. One of the top ten 2. Question antisemitism 3. A little boring at times. Honestly, I can only agree to 1 and 3. I don't think it is in the class of the Lord of the Rings, but it is certainly noteworthy science fiction if you can slog through some of the more longwinded passages. Herbert's GRAMMAR skills are in question at certain points. Finally, except for it's small cult fan base, no one talks about this book....at all. No one buys Dune calendars, plays Dune games, etc. Thus, the emotional bond that Tolkien established in the Lord of the Rings is obviously absent here. Tolkien influenced generations with his story, and clearly Herbert has not."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"A famous quote in the book is, &quot;Fear is the mind-killer&quot;. I agree if you fear reading boring books as alternative to treating insominia.There were some good parts of the book that sparked interest, but they were few and far in between.I read the marketing ploys trying to convince the LOR fans that Dune was their science fiction savior. It's pure nonsense.What I can't understand is how overrated this book was. Even English majors I know gave me positive accounts of this book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"...but I honestly don't see what's so great about this book. Daniel Keyes' &quot;Flowers for Algernon&quot; and Arthur C. Clarke's &quot;Childhood's End&quot; are both better science fiction stories than Dune. They make powerful, emotional statements about the human condition without rambling on incessingly or clogging the pages with useless action scenes. If you want epic literature, read Lord ot the Rings. That story about an innocent hobbit thrown into a destructive war is a million times more epic and personable than this rambling nonsence about a superhuman destined for greatness since birth. Everything is predictable about the plot, not to mention the fact that Paul is next to impossible to relate to.On the other hand, Frank Herbert DID exert a lot of artistic effort into this, which is to be commeneded. Perhaps he should have exerted this effort into a better idea."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"A friend told me that DUNE was different from the run of the mill sci-fi endless spillage of adverbs and adjectives. After three chapters of the most tedious and unnecessary descriptions of the tiniest details I decided he didn't know what he was talking about. Boring junk with a capital J!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I loved the book Dune, but the \\"Dune Audio Collection\\" was a big disappointment. It included some selections from the book and jumped around. Scene one: Paul is fighting his instructor. Then quick jump to scene two: him and his mother running away and survivoring the sandworms of Dune. They let you know between the two selections: \\"Oh by the way Paul's dad just died.\\" Very jumpy."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"After 10 pages everybody could guess the end.I just hate predictable book the first part of this book is worth reading but if your not an hard core sci-fi fan drop it after."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"To put it shortly this is one of those books that anyone who is seriously into Sci-Fi needs to read. The way Frank Herbert uses and mixes in religion, science and politics is just something one must behold and witness on your own. Frank Herbert creates not just a world to travel in but also a universe to wonder about and contemplate on as well. His characters are all solid and very realistic to read in their thoughts, emotions, and motives. All are so well intertwined into this story that it baffles the mind how one man can come up with such a masterpiece of Sci-Fi lore."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Frank Herbert had a lot to live up to when it came to writing a sequel to the greatest science-fiction epic of all time. In parts, he succeeded admirably. Sadly, pacing is not one of them. When I first read Dune: Messiah I had an idea of what was to come, Messianic Prophecy has a way of telegraphing the knockout punch, and I found myself longing for the end of this book and the resolution of Maud'Dib's journey. This is not to say that I did not enjoy the second chapter of this masterwork, but it does not live up to Dune, or the sequels for that matter. Still recommended reading if only to get to the next chapter of the Dune saga."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"In the very far future, the Atreides and the Harkonnen families are reaching the peak of their unending feud. When the Padishah Emperor - the ruler of all the known worlds - discovers that the Atreides army is becoming dangerously strong, he develops a complex frame-up to wipe-out the whole Atreides family. The Duke of Atreides is invited to accept the job of administering the planet Arrakis, also known as Dune. On this desolate, almost uninhabitable planet only one thing is of value: the spice Melange, a drug that makes space travel possible. At first this seems to be a fabulous gift, but soon the Duke suspects the true reason for the Emperor's generosity: with the help of the unbeatable army of the Emperor the Harkonnen family attack the planet Dune. All seems lost for the Atreides, but there is still hope: Paul Atreides, the Duke's son, has more power than seems feasible at first sight.Dune is consistently voted the Number One science fiction book of the century by readers all over the world. Overrated? Reason enough to give it a try - I thought - so I embarked on this epic voyage to the planet Dune, although packed with quite a lot of scepticism. But surprisingly, I didn't regret my decision for a single moment: this is truly a Classic Masterpiece. The narrative of Frank Herbert is simply addictive; his insight into the fantastic gives evidence of pure mastery. The images used to describe the planet of Arrakis are overwhelmingly strong. The human struggle for survival in the most relentless conditions imaginable is so intensely portrayed that the planet itself becomes one of the major villains of the book. Nevertheless, Frank Herbert writes with such involvement that there is no doubt as to the reasons people might have for living in such conditions. High drama and complex plots, filled with treachery within treachery, makes this book an experience you never to forget.A must read for everyone interested in fantasy and science fiction."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Frank Herbert's classic sci-fi epic Dune should not be skipped over by anyone interested in the genre. The planet Arrakis is so fully realized through the words of Herbert that it becomes a three dimensional landscape in the mind. The characters all develop logically throughout the novel, and Herbert is not afraid to kill off a hero. Everyone in this novel has multiple motivations, some noble and some ignoble. The ability to convey a plot as complicated as this in a believable way with non-static and human characters marks this as a classic."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is the sequel to the #1 selling science fiction novel of all time. Whereas 'Dune' is broken down into 3 parts: Dune, Muad'Dib, and The Prophet, about 150-200 pages a piece, I see 'Dune Messiah' as Part 4 of Dune, about 200 pages. It is a MUST READ for anyone who enjoyed the first novel. Essentially, this story picks up right where Dune ended. This is the only novel I have ever read that made me cry...."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Pual Maud'Dip, a Duke's son, a Human computer, the ultimate Fighter, a man who see the doors through the corridors of time.

Abandoned on possibly the most unhabitable place in the universe, and coincidently the most valuable, they must learn to learn, learn to move, learn to think, learn to fight, and learn to lead a people who have proclamed Him their Messih. This is one of those few masterpieces that can enthral the mind and wrap the senses. It is a fascinating literary accomplishment spaning time and the human mind in a way never before concieved."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Imagine a barren planet, entirely covered with desert, where it never rains, and the Fremen, natives of the planet, have no words for \\"sea\\" or \\"river\\". But this planet, called Dune by the Fremen, but Arrakis on the maps, is of utmost importance: it is the only place in the Imperium where the spice, a drug almost everyone is addicted to, can be found. Young Paul Atreides must move to this thirsty planet when it is given his father, Duke Leto Atreides, after the Harkonnens, rivals of the Atreides, are kicked off. Through treachery and deceit, the Harkonnen manage to oust the Atreides once again, by killing Duke Leto. Paul and his mother, Lady Jessica of the mysterious Bene Gesserit, barely manage to escape into the desert, where they are taken in by the Fremen.Along the way, Paul discovers his destiny as the Kwisatz Haderach, a legendary being who has the power to see through time and space. In order to survive, Paul must also demonstrate his worth to the distrustful Fremen. Among the Fremen, he finds a love in Chani.Lady Jessica, his mother, is pregnant when she consumes the potent and poisonous Water of Life to convince the Fremen of her good intentions. The baby, Paul's sister Alia, is born with extraordinary psychic and mental powers, and is shunned.At the climax of the story, Paul leads the Fremen against Harkonnen forces, and he himself is pitted against the cruel and ruthless Harkonnen heir apparent, as they carry out a centuries-old family feud.He then realizes that, as Duke Atreides, he can never marry his love, Chani, for among nobles, marriages are alliances.A very, very, very complicated story, too complicated to summarize very well, but it will all make sense if you read it. It's an adventure/science fiction/coming-of-age/tale of political intrigue all twisted into one."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"A science fiction classic revisited after re-reading Brian Herbert and Kevin Anderson's prequels (House Atreides, House Harkonnen, and House Corrino).With the recent release of Butlerian Jihad, I wanted to go back and re-read the series, to refresh myself on the details of the story. While reading Dune over again (for the fifth or sixth time), I continue to be amazed by the framework that Frank created for the Dune series development. From the starting chapters, the reader is immediately transported into the setting, and the urgency of the situation. He uses a combination of techniques to effectively suspend disbelief,including the shifting of viewpoints of the story protagonists, and a well developed backstory, illustrated by the introductory quotes at the beginning of each chapter.It was well worth reading one of the treasures in my library and one of the top ten science fiction books of all time."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I found this book to be quite confusing. Evertything happens very fast and then cuts to a different seen. However, I thought that it was a very well written sci-fi novel. It is full of action and suspense. It also delves very deep into religion and philosphy. I thought that the characters were written in very good detail which is, in my opinion, the best part of the book. This a book that I would not recommend for many people. I would only recommend this for science-fiction readers that also have an interest in philosophy. Overall, this was a very well written novel and interesting novel."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"WARNING: There may be spoilers in this review if you actually haven't read this book yet. Go read it. Now.Strangely enough, it took me a few attempts to read the entire text of Dune, and I am usually not one to leave books unfinished. My first attempts failed because some of my false impressions about the book were fueled by the first third of the story. Though Herbert launches into the story without giving much thought to the nuances of the universe he has created, the story in the beginning is very concrete and easy to absorb. However, when Paul casts his lot with the Fremen, the plot becomes increaslingly abstract and the writing gradually loses control. I was one who had difficulty understanding the limits of Paul's prescient awareness, the changing goals of the tribe, and the marvelously confusing effects of the Water of Life. But the &quot;real&quot; part of the book is a mere prelude, the Fremen, led by Usul (Maud'Dib), hold the real meaning of this book. How Herbert creates such an intricate world I cannot begin to guess. Arrakis is an incredible creation, rife with fascinating characters and political intrigue, but secretly controlled by a complex and beautiful religious movement seeking to remake the planet. The setting in itself is reason to read this book, but Herbert's real strength lies in his characters. Maud'Dib's transformation from naive youth to messiah is the caliber of character development that we are not likely to find in modern science fiction. And the conclusion, though abrupt, is a massive redirection of the story, in tune with the epic scale of the book. If you haven't read it yet, it isn't quite too late. With the prequels coming out, now would be a good time to start."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The story line has been revisited and rehashed by so many people that I don't have much to say about it here. If you have seen the movie, then you know the gist of the story. What I do want to write about is the unique nature of Frank Herbert's writing genius. For all his characters, strange worlds, and fantastical creations, the people of the Dune world are remarkably like Americans in the 20th century. More so than any writer that comes to mind, even many non-ficition books on the 20th century American fail to capture what Herbert captures.Here are people grappling with religion, government, technology, and environmentalism. They express concerns over medical technology (cloning, regeneration, etc). These are not the concerns of the people of the future, they are the ideas that are being debated in our culture now. It does not surprise me that before becoming a writer, Herbert spent years as a newspaper reporter. He has a unique conception of the human condition. I recommend reading at least until the end of 'God Emperor of Dune' to get a full understanding of Herbert's creation."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This Hugo and Nebula Award winner tells the exiting tale of a desert planet called Arrakis, also known as Dune, the story of an intricate power struggle in an interstellar empire. Arrakis is the sole source of Melange, the valuable Spice. Melange is necessary for interstellar travel and grants psychic powers and long life, so whoever controls it has great influence. The troubles begin when the Emperor transfers ownership of Arrakis from the Harkonnen House to House Atreides. The Harkonnens do not want to give up their privilege, though, and through sabotage and treachery ,they attack the Atreides base, kill the Duke Leto Atreides and cast the new Duke Paul Atreides out into the planet's harsh environment to die. There he finds in the Fremen, a tribe of desert dwellers who become the army with which he will reclaim what is rightfully his. Paul Atreides, though, is far more than just a duke. He is also the end product of a long-term genetic experiment designed to breed a super human; he might be the Kwisach Haderrach, the man that can see into the future. His struggle is at the center of powerful people and events, and the repercussions will be felt throughout the Imperium. &quot;Unique...I know nothing comparable to it except Lord of the Rings.&quot;--Arthur C. Clarke That's a truth if I ever saw one! And I would go farther. This book surpasses the Lord of the Rings greatly. It is very exiting as well as it has a touch of satiric against politics and what the world(s) will look like if we do not change our ways. Also, I like the politics that is so active in this futuristic society. One politic group, The Bene Gesserit, an order consisting of only female, have mastered their voice to the point where they can command anyone. The have used this skill to create a grand scheme of breeding to create the best mix of all the humans.And I wonder if Frank Herbert ever had problems with computers, because in these books, computers are totally forbidden and feared. There is even a new bible, called the O.C Bible, which main motto is: \\"Thou shalt not make any machine in the likeness of a human mind\\" This means the Orange Catholic Bible. I have wondered a lot about this, is orange his favourite color or what? Was his pencil orange when he wrote this? Or is it just a color like any other?It was really obvious that this man had some geological knowledge, because he actually invented a complex geologic system. And after looking a bit on the web, I found that he had taken some courses in geology just to make this book as correct as possible. He was a really good writer because I ended up hating the House Harkonnen and loving the honourable Atreides, and I think that this was his intention. To like this book you must have read other science-fictions book, because an inexperienced reader might not like this book, thus loosing a wonderful time. The fact that this book won the first Nebula-award and the Hugo award should make anyone want to read it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I cannot truly ascertain how many times that I have read &quot;Dune&quot; because I find myself reading passages sporadically, but in estimates I can say I have read it at least 5 times. My first taste of &quot;Dune&quot; came from seeing it on television on lazy Sunday afternoon. Some people do not like the film, but I became hooked. Since then I have read the sequals, prequals, and other associated works. I believe that one cannot read &quot;Dune&quot; without having it change them in some way. I have yet to meet anyone who has read &quot;Dune&quot; who has not fully enjoyed it. Those who tend to shy away from the Science Fiction genre of literature will be plesantly suprised with this literary masterpiece. Dune in now included in the recommended reading list for AP English, and deffinately warrants that position, as that it truly is one of the greatest books of the 20th century."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"One of my all-time favorite novels, I cannot say enough good things about it. It's a book that every science fiction fan will instantly fall in love with. It's the kind of book you can also read over and over, and you will find new meanings each time.The novel follows the young Duke Paul Atreides in his feud with the rival noble house of Harkonnens. The politics in this universe of the future are complex as well as very deadly. In addition, every family in the galaxy is driven by their greed over the addictive spice that is mined from the planet Arrakis, or Dune. A mind-enhancing drug, the spice is expensive, difficult and dangerous to mine, and very valuable. Whoever controls the spice calls the shots.Paul and his mother become outcasts after the Harkonnens raid their home on Dune and kill the old Duke. Then begins the adventure which transforms Paul into a legend in his own time. Throw in suspicious natives, a demented baron Harkonnen, an Atreides traitor, ancient rituals, psychic abilities and giant sand worms and you've got a definite page-turner by a fabulous writer. If you'rea sci-fi fan and haven't read this book, you're truly missing out!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Herbert's done it. Widely regarded as THE scifi novel, Herbert's Dune makes Star Wars or Star Trek seem like kittens. The flow is impeccable, the writing much enriched, and the philosophy and politics are outstanding! The story pits the soon-to-be-legendary Paul Atreides against the evil Harkonnen. Paul explores the reaches of his &quot;powers&quot; and the prophecy he was born to fufill. I look forward strongly to reading the rest of the Dune novels. If you love a thickly based scifi novel, with writing that is so powerful that it makes you quiver, Dune is the novel for you!!!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"A book which unreservedly deserves 5 stars if there were 10 available I would give it 10. Simply one of the greatest science fiction masterpieces ever written, there are some others which rate a close second such as the Foundation Trilogy by Asimov, The Galactic Millieu by Julian May or Enders Game by Orson Scott Card but they try to live up to this epitome of the classic. Not only a classic but one you must read rather than the usual attuitude to classics which everyone knows about but doesn't read. The superb story concerning Paul Atreides and his parents as well as the various remarkable characters which inhabit this Galactic Empire such as the Bene Gesserit or the Sardaukar which stand out in the same way as the Fremen as incredibly tough, proud warriors which would make a marine look to them in awe. The whole world created as well as the politics, psychological intrigue and so on are incomparable, the excitement involved with the warrior ethic imbued in young Paul, it just doesn't get any better, intelligent, exciting story telling."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is a great work of fiction. Its Sci-Fi aspect is more evident in its presentation of an alien ecology and the use of advanced powers of the mind that is present in the story. However, most of the trappings of Sci-Fi (starships, ray guns, high-tech gadgets etc.) is very much in the background. This is a character-driven story, and is much more like &quot;Fiction&quot; than &quot;Science Fiction&quot;.The strengths of the book is the great character development, an involving plot, a mix of philosophy, action/adventure themes, court intrigues, and the &quot;sense of wonder&quot; that abounds in Sci-Fi. There are two big shortcommings in this book, however, that prevent a five-star review. The various confrontation sequences in the book are multi-dimensional, in that the reader is made aware of what each character is saying, thinking, and noticing about the situation. This is partly what makes the book so good, but it is also a flaw because it tends to slow down the pacing of the action in areas where the writing should be more concise to reflect the intense drama or action taking place. I also felt that the story's sociological premise was a bit unbelievable; it's set in a feudal society where people still fight with daggers and poisons. (He gives good reasons why daggers are back in vogue, but it is still a bit unbelievable for me, as is the premise that feudalism will return 10,000 years in the future.) The book does a good job at presenting the world of Arrakis (&quot;Dune&quot;), though because of the slow pacing, the Dune world loses the immediacy of other classic sci-fi worlds such as Majipoor as presented in &quot;Lord Valentine's Castle&quot;.What I really enjoy about the book is the great spiritual lessons in the book, which are demonstrated without being preachy. For example, the two feuding houses in the book are contrasted: the Atreides, who maintain power by mutual trust and respect, and love, and the Harkonen who maintain power by manipulation, treachery, and back-stabbing. Just placing both systems side-by-side as Herbert does is a very effective teaching. The zen-like training of Paul Atreides and the extrordinary powers of mind that he has is very believable and a great teaching in itself. For example, the teaching about fear in the book, &quot;Fear is the mind killer... I will permit it to pass through me... When the fear has gone, only I will remain.&quot; is right on, and is the essense of Buddhist philosophy. The book also contains an ecological message that is perhaps even more relevant to us today as it was when this book was written."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Thankfully I read the prequel, House Atreides, before Dune so I had some background on the characters. Even so, this is an awkward, difficult book to get into. It doesn't have enough action and is filled with unending detail on the powers and backgrounds of the different races of people. The intrigues are endless and many of the connections are difficult to deceipher. But there is brillance. Herbert's Imperium is a fantastic world, strange and familiar at the same time. Being in it made me view our own planet differently. I think that's the sign of a good book, that it stays with you and has some effect on your perspective....and this book can definitely do that."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Herbert carries on the Dune legacy with another spellbinding novel. Although I have to agree with most people that the original Dune was far superior, Messiah more than adequately shines as the second book of the series."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I was never a big fan of books that were part of a series. I always associated them with star trek type of books that could only be appreciated by people who devote their entire lives to the storyline. What enticed me about this book (besides the attractive cover) was that I heard from a friend that it was suppose to be one of the best sci-fi books ever written. So, I thought I'd give it a shot. I'm glad I did, This book was exciting and kept my interest through the entire book.I have only read the first of the series so far, but I plan to give the rest of them a shot soon. Check reviews for the other books in this series to see how I feel about them."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"You have to give Frank Herbert credit for having a great imagination and stamina. That's about all you have to give him credit for.The plot is cumbersome. The characters have no charisma. The whole idea of this high culture developing on this barren rock seems pretty far-fetched. Herbert's invented ceremonies and cultural mores are wonderful, but they can't support the bloated story and anemic characters. Masochism not being my strong suit, I gave up on this one after about a hundred pages."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"It really puzzles me how this book could have so many five stars. How a slow book like this could achieve a rating close to Ender's Game is indeed quite incomprehensible. Are there many fans from the 1960s editions rating it?"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"It took me nearly a week to read the first hundred and fifty pages. Perhaps it was not the story itself that made me stop every twenty pages or so, but the characters. Character development could be much better executed. Overall each character repeats a saying about ten times through each book or takes the same actions over and over again. Herbert was most definitely a pioneer in the genre of sci-fi, but since his time there have been many novels of greater quality.The story becomes very emmersive after the overthrow of the Atreides. Paul coming of age and becoming Muad'dib is very entertaining and it is impossible but to hope that he wins every battle and becomes the most powerful person in the galaxy.Ive seen reviewers complain about the ending. I thought this was the best part of the novel and I'll tell you why. It was the first real part of the novel involving political intrigue. In the beginning of the novel we all knew the Atreides were doomed...the Reverend Mother told us so in the first few chapters. At the final battle we knew that the Fremen would win. People not familiar with Dune would think that Paul would marry Chani. However, instead he marries the Emperor's daughter in order to secure a tie to the throne and future dominance of the Atreides line.In the movie(6 hour version)the storyline holds quite true to the book. However; instead of dragging you through five or six hours reading the boring setup of the plot, it provides you with the exact same information in an hour and a half. It even includes more detail, such as tone of voice and facial expressions that make the whole experience seem more real.This book will remain a classic for die-hard genre fans and is worth the read for anyone who enjoys action-adventure stories. As for myself, I enjoyed the book but feel that there are better books out there to take the time to read."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"How can anyone find Dune to be entertaining. Frank Herbert rambles on incessantly about politics, religion, and society. There is little action and Herbert never goes into detail about the technologies of his universe. However, he never seems to shut up about his philosophy either. This is a VERY tedious book. The concept is quite fascinating, but the book itself lacks the entertainment factor."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is the best novel ever written, period. Nothing more needs to be said."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is a very complex book, but its design is absolutly brilliant. I enjoyed how well Frank Herbert made his story so detailed, and how he still keeps you to the story at hand without detailing you to death. My only problem with the book however is Frank Herberts ideas conflict too much with my own. I find myself debating over many of his thoughts and ideas. I rate the book a three only in prospective to my ideas. But for creativity, complexity, and shear genius, this book I would give a five star rating for."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Other reviewers seem to have missed the obvious influences on this book. My pointing them out will not make me popular. But a book this good needs to be understood in all its intricacies, if only in outline.Paul Atreides is the last in the line of the ancient Greek king Aggamemnon. (See Children of Dune.) The Book Dune tells of his odyssey. He travels far from his rightful home in the capital city of Arrakeen on Arrakis and ascends to the throne of the known universe with righteous vengeance. Just as Odyessyeus traveled far from his home to retake his throne and family.He is, for all intents and purposes, a Christ-like figure. He is the Kwisatz Haderach, the individual forecasted by the in-bred Bene Gesserits who can see throughout the entire present world. The Bene Gesserits represent a sort of people (I leave it to the reader to determine which) who seek a messiah. Atreides fulfills that role, only to turn against the Order of Witches. Just as certain lamb-like followers assume Jesus turned against the People of the Book.Atreides is not just a Christ-like figure, but also a Hitler-like figure. He instigates a religious war against the known universe with his fremen warriors, once he has ascended to the throne. The comparison is actually drawn in Dune Messiah for all to read. However, just as certain revisors of history deny that Hitler was responsible for the &quot;mere excesses&quot; of his Stormtroopers, so Paul Mua'dib doesn't really know what to do with his fremen zealots.Further implications of the books' fascism are found in their idea of the Gom Jabar. This is a test, wherein the person who undergoes it must prove his or her &quot;humanity&quot; by being not flinching while being tortured. God Emperor of Dune explains this one. It seems that one proves one's humanity by being civilized in an exceptional circumstance, such as being tortured. Anything else is madness and fought violently. Carl Scmitt, a Nazi ideologist would be proud. (See Scmitt's Political Theology.)And then there's the utterly hysterical homophobia in the cycle.Don't get me wrong. I loved these books. Herbert's line at the end of Dune Messiah that Mua'dib lives forever in his suicide is noted and taken to heart. But the ideology and philosophical content (though not their form) of these books are rancid."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I find it hard to believe this is also a Frank Herbert book, after reading the great &quot;Dune&quot;. I understand the book is a collection of serial installments published in a scifi magazine, and that is exactly how it reads. There is none of the character development we find in the original except for the revived Duncan Idaho who struggles between two masters. You never find out why he decides to stay on the side of Paul at the end, one point of the novel that I thought might be interesting.There wasn't much talk about water this time either, one of the good parts of the first book. It seemed like Arrakis was becoming more moist, people weren't hoarding water as much as they did in the first novel, but why? Had some scientific plan for the distribution of the stored water in the cave gone into effect? If this was discussed I missed it. At the end I was basically forcing myself to finish it. I will read the rest of the series but I sure hope they're closer to the original than this book was."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I worship my lord Frank Herbert. Get down on your knees and embrace the power of Dune. Only then may your retched souls be saved!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Although I happen to love SF, I cannot understand why Dune is considered one of the greatest of all times. The first half was great, but the last part was totally different. It seemed as though Paul transformed into a completely different person with different morals. In addition, the plot was way too complex. After all, a few twists add to the plot, but an entire book full of them merely confuse. Despite all of the praise, I found it to be confusing and boring."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"A fascinating concept, well executed. I particularly liked the blade fights and the desert culture Herbert created. I defy anyone to read this book without getting thirsty. Only beef: I think the book could have been as good with about 75 fewer pages.Dune is a great book for those who like science fiction. I am not sure if it merits another two-dozen sequels, though.Be sure to catch the newest Dune sequels coming out:&quot;Son of the Cousin of the Messiah from the House of Atreides that Jack Built&quot;AND...&quot;Milking the Dune Pony for Every Freaking Dime&quot;(both also by Herbert)"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I read that book after I happened to look at the (grotesque) film adaptation by Lynch. The book itself is not really better than the latter. Esoteric, repeatitive, obsessively descriptive of mind states and thoughts, there are many good ideas (worms, guilds and sisterhoods, stillsuits and many others) but they are attached to a weak structure and a poor and heavy writing style. To be honest, it is very hard to find a book of good SF that is also a good book, but Dune seems to have a bit less than the average narrative flow. Perhaps, if I were younger, I would be a fan of the Herbert's complex world, but now I have really got the opinion that the book has too many more pages than it needs."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I admit, I am not an avid Sci-Fi reader; but I thought I'd give the genre another shot with reading this novel. Dune, does manage to avoid a few of the literary pitfalls I've observed in other Sci-Fi books. First, Dune does not use technology or gadgetry as a crutch for a poor plot or characters development. The setting and mythology of Dune is interesting and unique; although it seems very contrived. As one example, the political/ecomonmic balance between the high houses, the imperium, choam, and the spacing guild, I find to be unbelievable; the political system that Herbert portrays simply isn't stable. Of course, it is a work of fiction and such contrivances go along with being in the genre.Really, I think the biggest dissapointment of Dune is the character depth. Herbert has gone out of his way to construct a set of amazingly powerful (albeit grotesque) characters. There are Mentats (the ulimate logical stratigests), Bene Gesserit (basically female jedi, without the light sabers), suks (highly trained doctors), sadukar (warriors that are known to be the best in the universe), and freeman (survivors and better fighters than sadukar >.>). In Dune you have a cast of characters, almost all with some uncanny ability, all trying to interact. On a literary level this is ambitious to say the least; and, in the end, characters do not balance well at all. The irony of reading dune is that one is seemingly immeresed in conversations of subtlties, multiple meanings, deceptions etc etc; but the nature of the characters make the conversations dull and predictable (not to mention how the narration points out every single nuance of what is said). There is no true subtlties in dune; the predictability of the characters and the narration kill it all. In the end, the characters are little more than what they are trained to be. Almost EVERYTHING Jessica does in Dune is via her training; she truly thinks for herself a handful of times in the book. Paul is the most dissapointing, someone who is painted as this truly infallible entity doesn't develop at all over the course of the novel; and despite being a messiah, does not raise the level of his thinking at all beyond that of a political creature (he has premonitions of jihad etc, but he really does little beyond worry about his visions). After reading the book, I really felt no attachement to the main characters of this book; they were just too flat and uninteresting.Dune is an interesting book for it's unique setting and fairly engrossing plot. As for religious, philisophical, sociological, and deeper literary points of interest; there are much better books to read out there."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I am a life-long SF fan and finally got around to reading Dune for the first time in my 31st year. I was very disappointed. I cannot come anywhere close to agreeing with its 'title' of SF's grand masterpiece. I found the writing unsatisfying and quite dated. Too much drug use stuff (boy, you can tell it was written in the sixties!), too much exposition, and too little character development (of everyone but Paul at least, who I really got too much of). Potentially interesting minor characters are introduced, only to be killed off in very vague ways before they can really be developed. The spacing Guild and how they use the spice is never really explained, nor is CHOAM and the endless, sketchy references to it. The Emperor (and the Guild for that matter), very important characters, are never even seen until the very end, and ALL the action takes place in the last 50 pages or so. However, the worst part is the ending; the one-on-one fight with Feyd is very predictable, and I was seriously expecting to turn the page to another chapter when it ended; terrible ending, quite a let down.The bad stuff being said, the book does get progressively better as it goes along; or at least less boring. And it does paint an intriguing picture of Arrakis, I do now find myself interested in Dune itself, and that is a very original and interesting part of the story. I have been anxious to finish the book and watch the movies. I do find myself thinking about stuff from the book, so it does kindof 'get under your skin' I think, even if like me you don't think its very good.I guess I was expecting it to be the Lord of the Rings of Sci-Fi, but it does not even come close. If you want a grand epic that is the pinnacle of its genre (fantasy, in that case) I recommend you stick with it. Dune is quite a let down by comparison."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Having heard about this book as one of THE science-fiction classics for years - and had a friend who talked enthusiastically about the Bene Gesserit - I finally decided to give it a try. I can only say I'm glad it was a $5 second-hand copy, because it's a total waste of money. I'm not too far in, but the boredom factor is taking over fast, and skimming ahead isn't encouraging me to pursue it. Doom and gloom without a glimmering of the ordinary, let alone humour, isnt' my cup of tea. For all the time spent on the characters' thoughts, they don't seem to come alive. A story needs to grab the reader and get moving faster than this one is doing. The political set-up is not exactly original - feudalism and women as concubines, wives or quasi-nuns - even for 1965. SF had been doing that for decades, and Herbert doesn't seem to have added much to it. But apart from that, it's the flat, verbose, pretentious writing that really irks me. Herbert reads like he's some undergraduate who's overdosed on the more miserable philosophers.Back to the shop for this one ..."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The main reason i picked up this book was because i'd heard it praised as Science-Fiction's-Crowning-Achievement. more than a few sci-fi fanatic buddies of mine found this book the dune series frighteningly addictive. they would say things like \\"i just got the 6th dune book!\\" while jumping up and down excitedly. one of the best sci-fi authors around, Arthur c. Clarke, even compared Dune to The Lord of the Rings.sadly, at least for me, dune wasn't all it was cut out to be.if not downright awful, Dune is _certainly_ no LOtR. LOtR has characters, history, rich cultures, awesome landscapes, and above all the vivid imagination of a smart, meticulous man behind it.okay, so frank herbert was probably meticulous, considering he had to create the simply massive amount of politics found in Dune. is all the political junk why i gave the book 2 stars? not quite. politics don't thrill me, but they don't bore me to tears either. unfortunately, for some reason Herbert's endless, tiring banter did.after some deliberation (after all, i hesitate to call an alleged Masterwork a piece of [junk] until i've thought about the reprecussions of such a statement.) ... i've come up with a theory to explain why Dune was so frustrating to read.as the novel progresses, i found myself assaulted by a seemingly endless barrage of events, one taking place right after the other with no warning.although this style is similar to LOtR, and many fantasy/sci-fi works, what is so disheartening about Dune is that the events are not explained thoroughly. sure, Herbert offers a paltry excuse for why the Atriedes and the Harkonnens hate each other, and he tries to summarize why the Emperor wants to kill the Fremen, but his answers lack depth. they don't make sense.I'm not sure about others, but when something doesn't make sense to me, i don't believe it. plausibility makes good fiction.inevitably, someone will call me an idiot for not understanding the socio-economic reprecussions of spice production, but this isn't entirely true. i understand it superficially, but herbert doesn't give me enough facts or history or first-hand accounts for me to gain a real understanding of his world. it's almost as though he assumed the reader could see inside of his head, something which we certainly can not.even more disappointing is that Arrakis had SUCH potential--a desert culture more extreme than any on Earth, a desperate people, a royal feud...sadly Herbert is so fixated on propagating stereotypes (Baron Harkonnen, the fat evil homosexual pedophile...Paul Atriedes, the young handsome messiah who can see into the future...shall i vomit now?...) and stuffing in as much action and politics as possible that he takes no time to develop the culture, the languages, the history, the characters...all of the things that would make sludging through 550 pages of political maneuvering worthwhile.the result: i found myself reading on in a hurry, even skipping over sentences, to get to the good part that i could feel coming. unfortunately, none came, and i ended up feeling disappointed and more than a little betrayed.best piece of science fiction ever written? c'mon, i'm sure sci-fi can do better than Dune."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This must be one of the best books I have read in my whole life!Read it!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"A sad book in some ways, tracing as it does the fall from power of the once-idealistic Muad'Dib.

Mixing the distant, distant future with the politics and culture of the medieval age, Herbert is one of the few Sci Fi authors that have not only a visionary outlook, but also a fine grasp of past history. A mutli-layered, complex book, with many different plots, schemes, and treacheries, running through it and intertwining, Dune is a book that can be read and read and still enjoyed. The made-up vocabulary of this fictional universe is a treat to read, in many places the words roll of the pages almost as poetry. Written in the 70's, it is easy to see the author influenced by OPEC and the energy crisis and the Iranian Islamic revolution. The mystical, dark and brooding atmosphere of Machiavellian intrigue will make any reader reflect on the ugly nature of power.It is the politics of the author that is the most objectionable part of the novel. The book is full of totalitarian political philosophy, worthy of any Nazi or Stalinist. The author obviously does not put much value in individual freedom or even human life. Characters are dispatched with cold cynicism all throughout the book without much reflection on the morality of murder. This sentiment seems to grow in later installments of the Dune series. Readers should not confuse the profound political musings of Herbert as an endorsement for the absolute power held by a god-emperor like Paul Attreides."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I can't help but feel the need to write a less-than-memorable review on these books of Frank Herbert. I'm on the verge of giving it away, but if you read them, over %90 of them are people sitting on rock ledges or balconies thinking of plans and plans and plans. The action scenes seemed to be written as if they were afterthoughts, almost a &quot;by the way&quot; feeling. The characters were elaborate, but making them ACT was impossible, and that's why I gave the whole Dune series 2-stars instead of one. If you're thinking about reading them, ask someone who has already read them and then get a summary; it'll be quicker."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"DUNE was an ok book. I read it once and that was enough but it was rather enjoyable.However Mr Herbert seemed to want to invent a religion based on the Holy Scriptures (he used enough Bible references!) but without its discipline. He failed.As for Huge on Brazil if that is the kind of person who recommends this book -- don't bother. But I rather think that he is making fun of the book.Dune is ok but IT AINT THAT GREAT."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Having been recommended by friends as a must read in the sci-fi genre, I finished reading the original Dune trilogy, expecting something spectacular. Unfortunately, I found myself disappointed and want my time back :).Herbert has created a colorful and exotic world. The writing is very detailed. However, I found the series to have too much pretentious babble with little real substance behind it. The first book, Dune, is the best book of series. The second is barely readable. The third one bored me to tears at times. For a classic sci-fi series with real plot twisters (or \\"a feint within a feint within a feint\\" in Herbert's words) and intelligent discussions, read Isaac Asimov's Robot series and Foundation series. For a fantasy series with enticing plots and moving character, read Salvatore's Dark Elf Trilogy."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I read the many superlative reviews of this book and purchased it last month. I thought the people who wrote in that they couldn't finish the book were just being obnoxious. To my dismay, I would have to agree with them. Yes, the plot is fine, and the book is imaginative. The rival families/spice/Gesserit are somewhat interesting. But I had to put the book down 2/3 of the way through. It's just so boring, and convoluted, I couldn't take it. I found no pleasure in having to work through it. Anti-semitic? I doubt it. Bad grammar in spots? Yeah sure, but not a big deal.In short, a good book, but clearly not in the same league as J.R.R. Tolkien's &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;P.S. No one talks about this book...at all. Just wait until Tolkien's movies come out. See the difference for yourself."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I've listened to this book (from audible.com) for the last 10 days or so. I selected it because it is supposed to be one of the best sci-fi novels and had great reviews. I have been disappointed.I kept expecting it to get more exciting, more poignant or more enthralling but it never did. Frankly, it was boring.Some of my criticisms: The author did not set up the Paul's secondary characters very well. I felt that I barely knew them and did not feel the supposedly \\"closeness\\" that Paul felt with them. Also, the author does not know how to write action. He would create conflict but never created a satisfactorily climax. After the extraordinary buildup, the end kind of puttered out like a damp roman candle. Poof! a few words and it was all over.I think that the author specializes in espionage and politics, not action. There is a buildup, and a buildup to the climax (which is supposed to be huge) then. . . a couple of sentences and the conflict is over. Just like that - very little payoff.This happened several times in book and I finally realized that this is not an adventure novel but a political novel. The lack of action after such buildup and conflict is very disappointing."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is the true mastery of the humans imagination, far surpassing such inferior works as Lord of the Rings.

I don't read much SF, so I try to get to the Big Books (War of the Worlds, Ender's Game, Fahrenheit 451, &quot;The Year's Best&quot; anthologies, etc). This was not a good book. The dialogue is stilted, the characters are caricatures, and everyone's always &quot;hissing&quot;, &quot;glaring&quot;, or &quot;swallowing with a dry throat&quot;. The plot is interesting enough, but not nearly as complex or Byzantine as I had expected: warring factions, religious fervor, double-crossing, nefarious rulers, ulterior motives - standard stuff, really. If anything, the plot seems complicated because we're told so little about what the Guild, the Great Houses, and CHOAM really are. Anyway, as a non-SF connoisseur I realize that I don't get to vote on which books are the classics. But from where I stand, DUNE is a poorly-written, lackluster, repetitive tale. It's not the best SF I've ever read; it's not even the best book I've read this month."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"It is a shame that the majority of science-fiction is usually grouped into two very deplorable crowds. There is the 'SF' that leaps and bounds with clich&eacute; settings and strategic contrivances, cheap melodrama, and stifling comic-book characters. The other kind is a mish-mash of pseudo-philosophy, self-righteousness and mindless cosmic diatribes. Dune takes all the worst aspects of both groups and wraps them in a velveteen package.What's worse is Frank Herbert can't write. At all times he is either 1. Spilling over in verbose, describing repeatedly things we already know and that serve absolutely no aesthetic or meaningful existence (most likely to fatten his 'epic') or 2. Infering so poorly to the plot as to cause the uninitiated reader to literally fling the book into the wastebasket and reel in frustration. By itself his writing is so abominable that it may as well have been written by Ayn Rand minus the political gauze. And if you want THAT you might as well go buy Atlas Shrugged instead.When I finally did get to the good parts somewhere down the line (last 50 pages, give or take) I learned to accept, by a modicum, Paul's lack of depth and meandering sensibilities (throughout the book, mind you), the empire's recalcitrance in the last battle, the Bene Gesserit's 'secret agenda', the all-powerful spacing guild, and melange, the sole miracle drug everyone wants but is too lazy to take the initiative. You honestly can't make up some of these concepts. They hang by a tenebrous thread in the cadaverous closet of Mr. Herberts mind and mediocre prose does nothing to bring them to light. Much less epic stature.1 star.P.S.if you want to experience what other, better, writers have done to refurbish this tepid genre and breathe new life into imaginative fiction check out the likes of Jack Vance, Robert Silverberg, Fritz Leiber, George R.R. Martin and Dan Simmons. These are TRUE visionary stylists who write engaging prose and powerful characters you can care about and love. Not like moldering semi-literate ideologues."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I didn't like the Dune book and here are my reasons why.It should be noted that I'm rating this book without taking into account at all that it is 49 years old -- had I done so this review would be different.This review might contain spoilers.Having just finished the four novels set in the Hyperion universe and the single short story in the same setting I was shocked that something so great (the Hyperion series) could have existed for so long without myself knowing about it. Having grown up as very young with the \\"Dune 2\\" real time strategy game on the PC which I have fond memories of I later on always had a strong suspicion that the Dune books must be truly great -- but for some reason I never got around to reading the books despite reading a lot of other fiction. Finally I bought all the books in the Dune series -- I was THAT certain this series must be so good I would want to buy all of them anyway; or so I'd been told, things like \\"So you thought Hyperion was good? You should read Dune.\\".I was deeply disappointed. For starters I didn't like the tone and style of writing, but I didn't like Hyperion immediately either, and I went into the book with enthusiasm, a truly open mind and embraced every idea when I started reading and didn't care if things didn't make sense at first.I'm soon finished with the second book now and here are my thoughts: Dune has little or nothing to do with science fiction and technology, it has everything to do with politics, religion and what I'd call magic -- the abilities of e.g. the protagonists to manipulate their own bodies and see into the future with no explanation whatsoever or even vague references to physics is hard to grasp. It is even told that the magic spice can \\"bend space\\", presumably as implied by GR. It is even harder to accept that in a high tech, interstellar fairing civilization computers are outlawed and knives are extremely effective weapons.As said already \\"The universe that Frank Herbert creates here is a humanistic one, almost a mideval renaissance world.\\", if you can accept this as science fiction in addition to a lot of seemingly absurd babble, then you will probably enjoy the book.The author seems to employ cheap plot devices to elude the burden of having to speculate on the technology of the future. E.g. all computers are illegal due to a \\"jihad\\" that banned them a long time ago. Apparently digital guidance computers are not needed to navigate nor control the massive interstellar spacecraft that are present in the novel but never discussed in detail. Instead they are navigated using one of the several magic forces of the \\"spice\\" in addition to so-called \\"navigators\\". The most sad thing is that exactly how this (and basically anything else too) works is not even mentioned as far as I can recall.To imagine strong AI is forbidden is possible, but to imagine that not only weak AI (expert systems) are illegal but ALL computers altogether are illegal? Give me a break. Supposedly \\"Ornithopters\\" are used as aircraft on Dune, with no explanation as to why this is cheaper and more effective than regular aircraft -- however, are we meant to believe these aircraft are operated with analog electronics? Is all communication analog too?\\"JIHAD, BUTLERIAN: (see also Great Revolt) -- the crusade against computers, thinking machines, and conscious robots begun in 201 B.G. and concluded in 108 B.G. Its chief commandment remains in the O.C. Bible as \\"Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind.\\"\\"Since computers per se are never mentioned in the book as far as I can recall I can only interpret the Butlerian Jihad as outlawing ALL computers -- as is actually stated too in the quoted text. Are we really meant to believe that an interstellar civilization operates a vast network of huge, massive spacecraft of all kids, without using any form of digital computers? All sensors, attitude control, thrusters, life support systems, GN&C;, communication, command and data handling are all analog, and somehow fed through a mutated creature that is this \\"navigator\\", who uses a magical spice to fold the very fabric of spacetime itself? And none of this needs to be even remotely explained or even mentioned how actually works?Other works of science fiction often refrain from explaining the inner workings of arbitrary technology too, but in those cases the underlying concepts or ideas that are implied (or stated explicitly) are often familiar ones that are easy to imagine -- the reader can fill in the voids and gaps on his/her own, however with Dune I'm unable to do this. It seems impossible.It is perhaps at least as hard to accept that weapons are near useless, due to everyone in a military situation being equipped with a \\"shield\\", which supposedly causes subatomic fusion upon being struck by directed energy from a weapon. To suppose that nothing, not particle weapons nor energy weapons are useful at all, because of a shild that can stop ANYTHING, seems not only unrealistic but makes again for a poor excuse as means to exclude such weapons from the universe altogether.In all Dune seems more like a desert fantasy universe with the technology so distant and so remote that it is felt as if it is not even there at all. The ideas and concepts seem more magical than scientific.Due to the age of the work I expected a space opera/soft science fiction -- little talk about technology and science, but as I've tried to explain there is less than that, there is so little science in the book that fantasy is perhaps a better term.Although if you can live with what I've briefly mentioned so far, the rest of the book must be said to be great, but there are plenty of other reviews that deal with what the book is really about. I'm just disappointed from a *science fiction* point of view."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"If you have ever watched the movie just know the book is much better and doesnt have sting in it.

Long live the intergalactic jihad!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"How does one begin to write an original and interesting review of Dune?Appearing in print first in installments between December 1963 and May 1965, this is the audacious novel that forever nailed shut the coffin on pulp-style science fiction and cheesy space-operas. This does not mean that Dune is literature in the way that The Great Gatsby, say, is literature - Herbert's writing would remain generally plot-driven rather than more favorably style-conscious for another decade - but it does mean that in Dune science fiction attained a legitimacy it had never known before. The genre could no longer be so readily dismissed with a condescending wave of the hand. Author Frank Herbert successfully mated together a number of disparate elements which resulted in a compelling future-fiction which, as of 2012, still remains unequalled in scale and scope.A substantial part of the achievement of Dune is the awesome success it achieves as a standard in world building. It is for this reason that it has been so often incongruently compared to The Lord of the Rings, a fantasy epic with which Dune otherwise has next to nothing in common. Jacques tells us that \\"all the world's a stage\\" in As You Like It, and Herbert seems to have taken the line as a literal challenge. In reading Dune we feel the physical weight of an entire planet beneath the feet of our heroes and villains: it's all there, the geography, the meteorology, the astronomy, the ecology, and all the myriad chemical and biological and physical cycles turning, turning, turning some more under the sun and pair of moons glowing in the clear desert night sky. Herbert creates the masterful illusion of having imagined it all, and we readers are merely transient visitors. The planet Arrakis, also called Dune, we feel to be an intensively real planet, whole, massive, subtle and intense. That's the first part of the unprecedented greatness of this book.But though it's set in a future many generations removed from our own, when humanity has settled on hundreds and hundreds of planets spread throughout the galaxy and Earth is a distant, all but forgotten dream, the more important secret that keeps old readers coming back to the novel again and again, and new readers in high school encountering it for the first time and instantly falling under its spell, snapping the bait hook, line and sinker, is not a new trick or gizmo at all, but the oldest trick in the literary spell book. In Dune Herbert very deliberately and very explicitly set out to create an epic hero, following all the rules for doing so that were well known even before Homer wrote down the Odyssey, or Anonymous wrote down Beowulf. We are utterly captivated by the story of Paul Atreides because we have to be: it's written into our DNA to be bewitched by this kind of epic hero. Herbert's poured out a trail of sugar, and like helpless ants we march along in line, follow the leader, unknowing and uncaring where our fantasies and dreams of wish-fulfillment are leading us.Which is not to disparage Frank Herbert. In Dune he is a master story-teller.All of Dune - indeed, all of the Dune series - is predicated on one single particular which we must simply accept without question, and that is that humanity has rejected technology whensoever possible. Whether this underlying premise is rational or reasonable is never questioned. Take away this underlying proposition and Herbert's entire Duniverse collapses into a pile of rubble and dust. Reasonable and rational or no, all the drama of Dune can ultimately be traced back to this one fact.I've mentioned that Paul is our unassailable champion because he must be: this is the nature of our response to the mythic hero. Likewise many of Herbert's other characters also perfectly fit their mythic roles. We loath the villains by reflex as we must, never stopping to ask whether they are really just straw men Herbert has created to be destroyed. Probably the most truly interesting and original characters are Paul's mother, Jessica, and the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood to which she belongs. Now here are some startling characters, with an intellectual astuteness encountered nowhere else in science fiction, or in mainstream fiction, for that matter.Shall I, in this non-review review, mention the spice?The spice melange is fundamental to the story, its need arising directly out of the restriction on technology. If computers can't guide humanity across the gaping chasms of spacetime separating distant solar systems from each other, then somehow human minds must do so. The spice melange is the requisite McGuffin, a drug which allows interstellar pilots to navigate through higher orders of spacetime. Oh, by coincidence it's also the drug which transforms our hero, Paul Atreides, into a superhuman messiah-figure. How happy Frank Herbert must have been the day when these disparate pieces began falling into place!Dune is one of the truly great science fiction novels of the middle of the 20th Century. It has its flaws, but I lack the space to discuss them here; nevertheless, it doesn't get too much better than this. As I consider myself a student of Frank Herbert, both the author and the man, I've come over the years to value Dune as a window into Herbert's mind and soul, and to appreciate it more in that way than for the joy it affords strictly reading it as a novel. But if you are considering reading Dune for the first time and so you decided to check out a few reviews first, I can only envy you your innocence, and for the journey you are about to take. Prepare to have your mind expanded.Bob R Bogle, author of Frank Herbert: The Works"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I wanted to start reading a science fiction series today and had good memories of reading Dune a decade back but I never read more than the first two. I thought I'm reading a lot, now is the perfect time to go through the whole series and if I like them there are numerous recent prequels and sequels to dip into after I'm done with the original Frank Herbert stories. Then I saw the $15 for Kindle price tag and read about the errors in the volume and decided to buy Asimov's Foundation series instead.You've priced your gateway drug to a multi-book series out of competitive range, I'm sure I'm not the only one passing on a whole range of Penguin books as a result.PS: the rating is for the story (which I remember liking a lot) not the format, which I don't like in any way."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I liked Dune in spite of its ending, but in Dune Messiah Herbert really completes the story with one of the best endings and most heart-wrenching stories of epic science fiction. 'Seeing' Paul through the eyes of others really enhanced this book for me, though I initially found it a little hard to get used to that. Overall though, this book is poetic and beautiful with some of Herbert's best writerly writing.If you liked Dune, you owe it yourself to read Dune Messiah."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\" is, in my mind, one of the most influential science-fiction books ever written. Its seamless blend of religion and science is engrossing and thought-provoking.Overall, the entire Dune series is fantastic -- examining sacrifice, love, religion, and culture -- and this is where it starts."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This review discusses Frank Herbert's six Dune novels.Dune, the first novel, is a classic work of science fiction. It manages to effortlessly convey a future where humans have created an interstellar empire with planetary fiefdoms controlled by noble houses. Interplanetary travel is provided by the Spacing Guild, whose Navigators rely on \\"the spice,\\" or \\"m&eacute;lange,\\" to pilot ships instantaneously from planet to planet. M&eacute;lange is found only on the desert planet Arrakis, or Dune, and is also crucial for the survival of the powerful matriarchal order of the Bene Gesserit, whose members get advanced physical and mental abilities from the spice as well as through special training and conditioning. The novel recounts the coming of Duke Leto Atreides and his family to Dune. Unfortunately, life on Dune is not easy for the Atreides, and the choices of the Duke's son, Paul, and Paul's children shape the future, as detailed in the next five books.I started reading the Dune saga almost two and a half years ago, and only just finished the final book, which takes place around five thousand years after Dune. Usually when I read a series the author has already completed, I find myself picking up the next book instantly because I cannot wait to see what happens next. With the Dune series, I often felt so exhausted after finishing one book that I waited months before picking up the next one. It is not that the books aren't exciting or that I wasn't interested in learning what happened next, but somehow getting through each Dune book took an immense amount of effort, and each book seemed to take an inordinate amount of time to finish. Perhaps this was because the books are packed with dialogue and philosophical discussions, but, for the most part, not many actions scenes. This may seem like I don't recommend reading the books, but I do. I really do. Especially the first one.Not only does Dune reveal a universe in the far distant future, it offers a different take on that universe than most other science fiction novels. Instead of the classic model where computers and artificial intelligence control daily existence, Frank Herbert created a world in an era after humans decided to destroy all computers and artificial intelligences. Humans had to adapt and rely on themselves to perform the functions that we are already accustomed to leaving to computers. For example, the Spacing Guild specialized in mathematics, and special training gives some humans the ability to calculate and logically reason better than any computer could.Dune also champions environmentalism. It explores the idea of a planet as a complex living ecosystem functioning as a whole. The Fremen on Dune recognize that if they want to change their planet from a desert planet to a verdant one, they must alter the entire ecology of the planet. They also realize that they must balance their desire for water and greenery with the needs of the great sandworms, which are critical to spice production and which cannot survive in or near water. Frank Herbert also extensively details the adaptation of life to Dune's arid conditions. In addition to the sandworms that require arid conditions, Dune boasts kangaroo mice that have learned to live with limited water. The Fremen too have developed methods of sealing their residences and their bodies to conserve water, and they even reclaim water from the dead.Frank Herbert has created a fascinating world full of intrigue, philosophy, and mysticism. He explores politics, empire building, and the advent of new religions. Try the first one, and if it appeals to you, go on to the second. The other four are not quite as good, but still worth the read if the world of Dune intrigues you. For my part, I think I'll eventually read the two sequels co-written by Frank Herbert's son, Brian Herbert, and Kevin J. Anderson. I'm not sure if I'll go so far as to explore the prequels and interquels though...For more reviews, visit my blog, Life Off the Shelf."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"First off, if you have not read this book, buy it now! Do not waste another second, buy it, read it, and then read it again!This book still captivates me after all these years. Even if you are not a fan of science fiction, I would find it hard to believe this book will not grab your attention immediately. This is a science fiction tale no doubt, but it is much, much more than that. At the root of this story is an epic adventure about a young man coming of age. The relationships and conflicts he encounters are told with such passion that the reader cannot help but feel deeply for the trials and tribulations of the young Paul.I have yet to discover a book that has moved me the way Dune has. It's unfortunate that many won't go near the book because they didn't like the movie. If you are of this opinion, I would strongly urge you to reconsider."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is the second novel in the classic Dune Series by Frank Hebert. It might be noted that the Dune books were originally planned to be a trilogy. This would have been the second book and \\"Children of Dune\\" would have been the conclusion. Some would say that it should have remained that way. However, regardless of how you read the books, I'd advise you DO read the original trilogy: \\"Dune\\", \\"Dune Messiah\\", and \\"Children of Dune.\\" The latter-written Frank Hebert books are optional: \\"God Emperor of Dune\\", \\"Heretics of Dune\\", and \\"Chapterhouse Dune\\". These latter three books almost seem to tell a different story, set in the same universe in a much later time frame.OK, so \\"Dune Messiah\\" itself is a good book. However, it does seen to suffer slightly from \\"second book of a trilogy\\" syndrome. It picks up after the masterful conclusion of Dune, and it takes a while to get all the complex plots going again. Kind of a slow reboot if you are reading it right after Dune, but keep in mind it took that story a while to get going as well."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"*Slight spoiler alert*This is not a normal review. Due to the fact this book is decades old, and is far from new. This version is just the kindle version. This is more of a format review. In this edition, there is a wonderful intro by Frank Herbert's son Brian. It is truly written by a son that is proud of his father. If your a Dad, be prepared to cry.I was a little disappointed with the book formatting though. Every once in awhile there are are sentences split in half, leaving some awkward spaces. Other than that, it's good. The story hasn't changed, so if you were among the many that hated this book back in the day, you'll still hate it.OverallI give this ebook 4 out of 5 stars."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Frank Herbert's Dune is simultaneously one of the most sublime and frustrating works of literature ever produced.I gave this novel a 5/5 rating outright for two reasons: it's my favorite novel, one I never tire of re-reading; and it's a book that should be read at least once by anyone interested in science fiction, fantasy, history, political science, economics, mysticism, or narrative. Regardless of whether or not someone actually enjoys Dune, every reader can glean something from it.That said, were it not for the latter two points, I would likely give this novel a lower rating, and here's why:Dune sacrifices storytelling for story.What in the name of Thor am I talking about? Let me explain.The world-building of Dune is outstanding, and I mean, REALLY outstanding. Tolkien can't hold a candle to Herbert's work in this regard - sure, he came up with a number of artificial languages, but from a narrative perspective that's actually one of the less productive things you can do to flesh out a setting.In Dune, every story element has relevance and connection to every other story element. The political reality of the galaxy depends on economic power, which is derived from trade, which is made possible by the Spacing Guild, who uses the spice, which exists only on Arrakis, whose administration depends upon the political climate. Paul's character is related to the mystical aspects of the story, but also brings relevance to the ecological and historical aspects. And so on, and so on. There isn't a loose thread here, no equivalent of the Fellowship of the Ring's Barrow-wights; nothing here could be removed from the whole package without substantially diminishing it. Tapping into all of these fundamental spheres of thought and creativity gives Dune the feeling of being a real history, and it gives the reader the feeling they're witnessing a change in the axis of civilization - something more subtly epic than big battles, of which we only get one (and an indirectly described one at that).That said, because Herbert is so dedicated to giving us as much material to work with as he can, in many instances this novel misses out on what might have been effective dramatic elements. An important plot point early on in the book is the supposed presence of a traitor in the midst of the Atreides, a traitor who will make the Harkonnen plot possible. Ordinarily I wouldn't mention this for spoiler concerns, but the novel basically comes out and tells you who the traitor is from the beginning, a while before it even comes into play in the events of the story. The reason this is problematic is because in a story which is so dependent upon political intrigue, it makes the decisions of the characters more powerful when we share in the mystery of the information around them.Another narrative problem is Paul himself. Though he is unquestionably the central character of the story as well as its protagonist, Paul starts off as a precocious fifteen-year-old and ends as a major player in galactic politics. In other words, he starts of as unrelatable and becomes less relatable as time goes by. In fact, several of my friends told me they stopped reading after a while because they didn't like Paul. This is an entirely fair criticism. In fact, the only character with whom a reader could form a true emotional connection would be Paul's mother, the Lady Jessica, whose problems are much more grounded in humanity. Now Paul's nature is basically vital to the fabric of the story, so it would diminish the story's complexity for him to become a more human character; but Dune would undoubtedly have been an easier reading experience had the novel chosen to focus on Jessica.This should give you a taste of what I mean. Dune isn't a novel that really engages a reader on an emotional level; because it reads so much like a history, it engages you on intellectual and thematic levels - but again, not emotionally.This is still my favorite novel, because measured against the standards of what it's trying to accomplish it succeeds beautifully; but potential readers should know what sort of undertaking they're facing when they pick this up."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I finished reading all six Dune books on 6/15/00. About a week ago (today is 6/23). It took me a little less than three weeks to read them all (I started Dune on 5/27/00). I rented the movie years back and turned it off after watching it about twenty or thiry minutes. I didn't know what the heck was going on. So, I said to myself that I'd read the book before I rented the movie again. Well I finally did...and then some. I started collecting all six Dune books. When I had them all I began reading Dune. Talk about one cool plot. Dune had it all. One main plot with many subplots underneath. I had to stop reading the book at points so that I could reason everything out before I continued (I LOVED IT). Dune Messiah was pretty good too. It seems to me to be the easiest to understand because its very simple. Children of Dune was okay, but seemed to dragged out because Herbert spent so much time describing Leto II's hallucinations, trances, thoughts, etc. It could of been 200 pages less to get the story across. God Emperor of Dune was really cool too. I love how Herbert describes the changes of Arrakis into Rakis over the millenia. This book does a great job in describing the changes. Heretics of Dune: the most fast paced, action-packed book of the series. This one was a real page turner. Chapterhouse: Dune was an okay story but the book doesn't get interesting until you've read about 300 pages, 3/4 of the book. To me it seems when the Bene Gesserit are in the picture the story slows down quite a bit. I thought there was too much Bene Gesserit philosophy in this book. Overall, how do I rank all six books? Well, the first one, Dune, will have to be my favorite because it is a classic and it is the most intricate book of the series. Herbert really did his homework for this book. It's easy to tell. Book Five is a close second. Book Four is a third. Book two is ranked fourth. And I'll have to say Books three and six tie for last because they seemed the slowest of them all (however, I lean more toward Children of Dune being better because I think Leto II's &quot;transition&quot; was fun to read). Since then I've read two nonfiction books (one on the Alamo) and today I finished Clive Cussler's Serpent. &quot;Now what?&quot; you might ask. Well, I've been wanting to read some more fantasy since high school. The only fantasy I've read are Tolkien's famous four books and C.S. Lewis' &quot;Chronicles of Narnia.&quot; Now I'll read Piers Anthony's first Incarnations of Immortality book &quot;On a Pale Horse&quot; and then start reading some Xanth novels. Until next time..."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I thought Dune was a masterpiece. No other books can compare with it. I have read as much of the series as is currently out. All of the books are great and if you haven't read them yet, DO IT NOW! You will not be disappointed."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I must admit, I was hesitant to read James Herbert's opus, &quot;Dune&quot;. I had a misguided (and somewhat negative) idea of what to expect. You see, my first encounter with the world of Arrakis was the less than memorable motion picture. Luckily, however, I took the plunge and was rewarded with a beautiful and enthralling reading experience. I have not encountered such a detailed and thoughtfull piece of fiction since my childhood when I read the Middle-Earth stories by Tolkein. The characters of &quot;Dune&quot; are engaging, seductive, tragic, and occasionally humorous (just like us &quot;real&quot; people). There were times, while captured by the pages of this masterpiece, when I lost track of the outside world and could actually feel the hot desert sand on my face and hear the tell-tell approach of a &quot;maker&quot;. With a complex storyline and superbly realized characters, this epic of science-fiction would be a grand read for a fanatic of the genre or someone who has never even heard of the late, great James Herbert. Brilliant!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"&quot;Dune&quot; will equally satisfy the fans of science fiction and fantasy - the book is as great as the movie version was atrocious. Along with &quot;Ender's Game&quot; and &quot;Space Odyssey 2001&quot;, I rate &quot;Dune&quot; as one of the three greatest science fiction ever."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"WOW! This book is an amazing read. Not only is the plot superb, but it is written in a manner that catches the reader and never bores him/her. Considering the prodigious length of the book this is quite a feat. Dune is given a world of mystery, proud tradition, and dangerous conflicts with the new and the old. The characters interact in a pleasing manner and the end is not what we the readers expect, but exactly what we want."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"It seems unreal that all the reviews for Dune (well, almost all) are so overwhelmingly positive. All I can say is &quot;Right on,&quot; this book changed my life and the way I look at science fiction. Repeat the Litany Against Fear if you are ever nervous in real life, I swear it really helps."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I think the most recent reveiws of Dune Messiah miss the point by calling it a sequel. The trilogy should be taken as a whole. Dune Messiah sets up the action that will climax in the third book. Read the trilogy as a whole, have some patience. The Dune trilogy is still one of the greatest science fiction stories ever written. P.S. - Skip the movie (the 80s one that is; the Sci-Fi Channel mini-series is very good)."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"One of my favorite books ever. I have always had a copy of this no matter where a lived. It is one of the first sci-fi/fantasy books I've had and one of the most often read. The rest of the series is also very good, but nothing compares to the first book. It is about politics, adventure, romance. It is intelligent, insightful and entertaining. One of the best books I've ever read."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"My dad gave me a copy of the first paperback edition of this book for my 13th birthday back in 1965. I just want to say now - thanks Dad. From the very first I could not put it down. Since that first reading I have read the book at least a dozen times or more, and even read it aloud to my son when he was about 10 years old (as a teenager he went on to re-read it on his own).This book is a classic, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes SF, or just like a darn good read in general. Interestingly enough I never cared for anything else Frank Herbert wrote - but this one just blew me away."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I enjoyed this book to be sure, and although it was quite lengthy, I found myself unable to part with it easily. I finished it within a week simply because the story was so gripping. I'm not sure how Herbert manages it, but it seems that he can endlessly descibe something yet never bore someone. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"When I first picked up the torn paperback copy of &quot;Dune&quot;, it was out of boredom. As the book progressed, however, I was reading it out of necessity.In a matter of hours, I was completely immersed in the trials of Paul Atreides and his cohorts. I cannot compare this novel to any others I have ever read. Im not a fan of science fiction in any way, but this irresistable masterpeice drew me in to the point I wished it would never end. As I reached the end of the book, I was filled with a sense of almost forboding. The fact that the book would some time end was my only regret.If you are a fan of liturature at all, read this book! I have been disappointed by the genre in the past, even by the &quot;Greatest&quot; of science fiction (The Hobbit, Lord of the Rings), but Dune was one of the greatest novels I've ever had the fortune of reading. If any of the other books in the series (I've just ordered all 6 of them) live up to their predecesor, then I will not be disappointed.Although many other reviewers said this book held less meaning in their youth, I still grasped enough of the epic to enjoy it greatly at my 15 years of age. If you have come this far, you must take the next step; read the book. You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune was pretty good, but I don't think it is the greatest book I've ever read. It started off well, but it seemed like the last part of the book was rushed with the author jumping over large periods of time. I also had difficulty finding any characters that I could really like. They all seemed a little shifty. I will probably eventually read the rest of the books to see what happens, but I won't be rushing out to buy them."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I noticed the mixed (hah! that's an understatement) reviews in here and am therefore putting in my two cents. DUNE is a masterpiece. People who know why, I don't have to tell. But the complaints I want to address.1. boring To each his own; but to understand Dune's complexity you have to be unfortunately aware of a lot of general knowledge. 1st of all, nothing in Dune is entirely fictional, not even the sandworms (though their size is, of course). The language is Arabic, Hebrew and occasionally Latin (aba, Shai-Hulud, Alia, Mahdi, and of course Jihad). When you realise the whole story is in reference to our existing history, you get more out of it.2. pretentious Herbert is writing on many different levels; and remember this is a RELIGIOUS book, which is unusual even in sci-fi. He's writing a Bible in postmodernism. Look closely. Who is Paul? Who is Jessica? Why are the Bene Gesserit a 'sisterhood' of pseudo-priestesses? You don't write a Bible with Gary Larson.3. cliched The point of reusing the old formulas was to take those same formulas to a higher level. The story isn't about monarchies, space, aliens, drugs or mind manipulation. It's about how people can mistake another ordinary man for a god - and how he actually DOES become one. Again - it's the Bible in 10 191.Look beyond your noses, folks. Don't read it once and pan it. You're missing out on a lot if you do."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I drive a lot and consider the time productive \\"reading\\" time. I prefer unabridged audiobooks not only because they last longer, but I feel as though if I can't physically read it, by listening to the full version, I'm coming as close as possible.I've read Dune a couple of times, both as a teenager and adult. I've also seen the movie and miniseries. I was delighted that it was finally released as an unabridged audiobook and even more pleasantly surprised to find Scott Brick among the readers. For anyone unfamiliar with Brick; he's one of the better readers I've heard and I thoroughly recommend his version of the unabridged \\"In Cold Blood\\".But I digress.Unlike many audiobooks, this version of Dune has many \\"readers\\". I'm not quite sure why, but I thought \\"okay, let's see how it goes\\"...and it didn't go terribly well. The dialogue was obviously read at different times by different people. At times you can hear the editing. A conversation supposedly in the same room sounds as though one person is in a bathroom while the other outside the door. Perhaps it's not the best analogy, but you get the idea.Then, just as you've gotten used to the voices, the book switches into single-reader format, with one person reading and doing all the dialogue. I've not quite been able to fathom why and when it is supposed to happen. At first I thought it might be in alternating chapters, but it isn't.The major problem with this is that you get used to hearing someone and then it changes. You hear a woman speaking in a woman's voice. A short time later her lines are being read by a male reader. A little further on it's back to the woman. With a diverse cast of readers and different accents, it gets really confusing.I could have lived with multiple readers, editing issues and all if the publishers had stuck to that format and not moved back and forth between single/multiple readers. I can find no explanation as to why they did this. On the Macmillan website are lots of testimonials notes and a \\"how they did it\\" video but nothing to explain the discrepancy.And surely they must have realized that Baron Harkonnen sounds almost exectly the same as Darth Vader...come on guys...So - listener be warned. You might want to have read the book first because the voice mix-up may throw you a curve ball.It's a pity that the presentation in this case has tarnished what should have been a very worthwhile effort. I'm giving it 2 stars because of the story, but only 2 stars because of the presentation. I am very glad I didn't pay full retail for it because at close to $60 it would have been a very expensive disappointment."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune built a fantastically complex and interesting world with very dynamic characters. The character portrail/development in this book are paper thin and do not seem to be true to the characters developed in the first book. Paul goes from a powerful, intelligent and dynamic leader to a needlessly cruel, borish nihlist who just plods along accepting a terrible fate. The Duncan Idaho Ghola is somewhat interesting -- the paradoxical nature of him (gift and assassin's tool) gets a bit old after a while.The premise of the book is fairly straight forward: The method that Paul used to become Emperior, a Jihad of the Fremen, has doomed Paul and his family. The massive carnage unleashed by the Jihad has turned the people of Dune and the universe against Paul...so it is presented. Paul laments about how he can not stop the Jihad and complains about simple people deifying him. The solution to this is so obvious that it is painful to read most of the book -- He could as God just say no more and adjust the religious constructs that have been rapidily put in place by political power seekers and the religious fanatics. The various factions worked to remove Paul only have small parts to play in the book -- their plan is set up and put in motion. I was really hoping for much more out of them.It is interesting that Paul plays out the events he sees in the future even though he knows how bad things are going to be for himself, his loved one, etc. If Paul really was a great Mentat as claimed in the book, he really should have realized that all he only to do something different than the visions to change the future (as he finally ends up doing in the end). I have not figured out why the Txeilians have not been hunted down and destroyed to the last being in the Dune universe; they clearly are the most evil, vile race of Man in the Universe.It was painful to read the first 90% of the book. The conclusion finally brings back the Paul from the first Book -- bold, empowered and controlling his future. Perhaps the point of the book is that freewill is still Man's greatest power and no one's future is set in stone.Overall, this is probably one of the weakest efforts by Frank Herbert I have read."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I have yet to read another book that I have enjoyed as much as Dune. This book is absolutely essential science fiction. Several things set Dune apart from average sci-fi, the paramount such thing being the Dune universe.Dune takes place in the FAR future, about 10,000 years after a war against \\"thinking\\" machines. The war itself doesn't play a very large role in the story, in fact it's only mentioned a few times, but its repercussions constitute the most interesting part of the Dune universe: computers and other \\"thinking\\" machines are outrightly forbidden within the Empire. For this reason, people must perform all the functions such machines would otherwise do for humanity. For example, people known as Mentats are trained from birth to be capable of sublime feats of logic. These people take the place of computers. Interstellar space is traversed without computer navigation by Guild navigators who perform this task with the limited prescience granted them by the spice, Melange.Because of the fact that these types of technologies are eliminated from Dune, the book has a certain timeless quality to it. It was not necessary for Frank Herbert to guess what kinds of computers and AI people would possess in such a far-flung time from his vantage point in the sixties. In summary, a large part of Dune is about humans and their nearly infinite abilities of mind. For people interested in the philosophy of \\"mind over matter,\\" this book is definitely, unquestionably for you."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I read the Dune novels as a teenager and recently started re-reading them 15 years later.Dune Messiah is exactly as I remembered it: a disappointment not just in comparison to Dune, but a true mediocrity in its own right, with a surprising amount of fragements of thoughts and ruminations that just don't make any sense. The point of Dune Messiah, and Children of Dune, is to enjoy the much grand God-Emperor of Dune."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I have read all the books in the Dune series, and I have to say that I feel \\"Dune Messiah\\" is the worst of the lot. After the initial novel, \\"Dune\\", the other books in the series took a turn for the philosophical. \\"Dune Messiah,\\" perhaps more than any of the other books, concentrates on the philosophical, and leaves action and plot development by the wayside.The story focuses on Paul Atreides after he has become, essentially, emperor of the universe. His legions of religious zealots spread the word of Muad'Dib to all the worlds in the universe, in a religious jihad. Paul, blessed or cursed with prescience, becomes more and more inhuman, he begins to question the Golden Path which he has created.The book covers a very short period in Paul's life, during which he wrestles with his self-doubts, as well as contending with a plot which has arisen against him. Look for the first \\"rebirth\\" of Duncan Idaho, a pivotal character throughout the whole series.I found it hard to read because, I was rooting for Paul, in \\"Dune,\\" he was, in every way, the hero, and you wanted him to win. In \\"Dune Messiah,\\" though, now that he has won, its sad to see how his initial dream has been has been corrupted by circumstances. I wanted Paul to be as heroic as he was in the first novel, but he is not. This may be more realistic, but its sad, and you really don't know who you should be rooting for, if, indeed, you should be rooting for anybody.All in all, Herbert took a very long time to say very little. However, he says it well, and as in all his books, Herbert's characters are quite compelling, even if they are more tragic, so it still reads very well, even if it isn't as interesting as the first novel."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"How can I begin to describe the sheer genius of this book? The characters are fantastic, the plots within plots are engaging, the world is so well thought out. . . It is impossible for another book to be written like it. Just impossible. It cannot be duplicated by any human being. This book lay the foundation for so much of modern science fiction, yet still remains unparalleled. It cannot be overestimated."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"While this was not a horrible book, I found it very lacking in terms of story and it just wasn't every cohesive. Much of the book is supposed to be dialogue that is meant to be clever and plotting. But I found a lot of the dialogue incomprehensible. They're not actually speaking in riddles but it seems Herbert chose for the dialogue to be confusing in order to impress upon the reader the feel of plotting. I read a lot of books and a lot of the dialogue was atrocious in that way and there is a LOT of dialogue in the book, it seemed like I was reading a play.And if they aren't talking and talking, then much of the text of an all ready very short book is devoted to Paul's visions which are kind of a chore to read over and over again. The book isn't really 300 pages either. The font is huge and the white space is more than the average book. So expect maybe 230 pages of a regular book.Literally, nothing happens until the end, either. I loved the other review of how the reader just cares nothing for the Jihad in that it's never explained at all. I don't know, Paul is supposed to be the Messiah, and literally conquers an empire in the span of a few years in the first book. But in this book, it was mighty convenient that each and every bad thing that was to happen to him, he cannot see in the visions.And those people who claimed this book changed their lives, they must lead VERY superficial existences in that case. This book is a read it and forget it book, tops. The philosiphizing was banter at best. Dune was much better but by far not my favorite book, either."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I read Dune in high school and loved it then, and it was such a pleasure (more than a decade later) to pick it up again.Dune is to Science Fiction what The Lord of the Rings is to Fantasy. It almost defines the genre and you can see its influence in almost all Sci-Fi literature today.What makes Dune especially exciting is how complex and thorough it is. Dune is not a simple story, but then, neither is life. You have so many characters and groups of characters all with different and opposing objectives. You see how the decisions and actions of one can influence the course of so many other groups of people.The characters are all so real, deep, and believable. The plot is sensational. Getting this bird's-eye view of the rise, the fall, and the rise of the Atreides family is a real thrill unmatched by very few other books.Yes, this book is a must-read even for those who do not read the science fiction genre often.On a side note, I was warned in high school about continuing the series as most people I talked to considered it dull and boring. I'm in the middle of Book 4 right now and I attest that while the next two books are not as fast paced as this one they are still quite interesting with a fun and complex story line."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"While Dune Messiah is the second part of the Dune trilogy, I think Frank Herbert really accomplished his goal of describing the failure of the future-seeing hero in this book. Unfortunately, you might have to read the first Dune book to get to this one.The second book takes over twelve years after Paul Atreides' triumph over Emperor Shaddam IV. He is master of all he surveys, and yet he sees trouble on the horizon, trouble which none of his miraculous powers can stop. He can only bide his time until &quot;the inevitable&quot; comes to pass. Herbert is not fond of this vision for humanity (to know the future in advance), and he makes that very plain in this novel. In many ways, Dune Messiah is a much easier book to read than the first one, as everything is set out in much plainer language.There is a conspiracy against Emperor Paul Muad'Dib (spelled with a lower-case &quot;Muad'dib,&quot; just to confuse me) in this book, as well. We have the wicked old crone, Gaius Helen Mohiam, a Spacing Guild Navigator, the history-writing, conniving Princess Irulan, and something not mentioned in the first book: Scytale, a Tleilaxu &quot;Face Dancer&quot; (shape-shifter). Herbert manages to conjure all of these characters up believably, and also portrays what's going on in everyone's head. The motivations are clearer in this book, and the imagery (for me) much better.We also find Paul's sister Alia has become a power in her own right, conducting ceremonies she does not believe and which give her no peace, but which somehow manage to calm the masses. Herbert is unflinching in his judgment of Paul and Alia as religious manipulators, and manages to question (as might a suitably inclined reader) how the average person could believe such hokum. Herbert seems to insinuate that religious conviction comes at the point of a sword, a belief which might hold a slight grain of truth, depending on which of the sword you're on.The book also contains the first appearance of a &quot;ghola,&quot; a body raised from the dead by the genetic technology of Bene Tleilax, but with no memory of its former self. The ghola, in this case, happens to be the loyal Atreides retainer, Duncan Idaho. Duncan, too, has a role to play. Even when he states bluntly that he was sent to destroy Paul, that does not prevent him from drawing close to the Emperor. This is all remarkable stuff, and richly told.In the end, the universe outguesses Paul Atreides. That's the best way I can explain the ending without telling you the ending in specific detail. I really enjoyed this book, and find it a quick and quotable story."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book is the best, I think this is the best book that I have ever read. Now that I have read the first book I want to read all of them.It will sometimes get hard to understand unless you have seen the movie.I think that everyone should try to read this book. Sometimes you need to go back if you get lost but when you get it the book gets realy good. I have only read this book one time but I will probably read it agian.I cant wait to start the second book. I love this book and hope other people do to. It is a very good book and I would recomend this book to any one even people who realy hate reading.I Love this book more than I love gitting on the computer. I gave this book a 5 out of 5 because it is a cool science fiction and I think every one should read this book or see the movie. Even though this book is a very long book for beginers but after the first 200 pages out of the 490 pages the book seems short.The storie seems to go by realy quick and you are done before you know it . I dont think that I could say this enogh but I love this book . I think that it would be hard to make a book this good.This book is very gook and should become the emperor of books."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Without a doubt Dune is one of the strongest sci-fi books I have ever read. Infact, I should have read it sooner. The book was written way before I was born but it is only when someone presented it to me as a gift that I decided to read it. I believed that after seeing the movie adaptation by David Lynch the book will not be as interesting. I was wrong.In addition, I have played every computer game in the Dune series. After reading the book I have noticed some subtle roots of computer game story and design I have not noticed before.Without contemplating any longer, I went out and bought the two sequels. I can't wait to finish them. There is something amazing about Frank Herbert's writing. It is so rich, so deep, so dense with thought that I find it to be a jewel among thoughtless sci-fi of today. Dune was written in sixties but it still blows away the sci-fi world of today."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"That is how good this book is. I will forever remember it. As previous reviewers said, music that I was listening to at the time and things like that, when I hear it again will bring my mind straight back to DUNE. Dune blends plot, character development, tradegy, and triumph perfectly. I know no other book(s) that can compare to Dune."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I love this book! On a scale from 1-10 I would rate it ten. DUNE is the first book in a trilogy a book for readers at about 12 years old and up because it is very complex. An example of how complex it is that there is a dictionary of the unusal or madeup words.DUNE is a little bit like STAR WARS, if you like STAR WARS, you would like DUNE. It is set in the future. Bene Gesserits are a little like Jedi Knights except they are all female. What happens in DUNE is that the Atreids, people from a planet with a normal amount of water (Caladan), come to a planet with almost no water (Arrakis/Dune). The main setting is on Arrakis. Arrakis is a planet that is all a desert where water is used instead of water. The Atreides came to defeat the Harkonnens, they have been fighting for a long time. The Fremen are native to Arrakis. Water is a treasure to the Fremen so precious that when a person dies they squeeze the water from his skin.The main character is Paul. He is a very complex character because he changes completely. During most of the book he is smart but at the end he gets smarter than his Bene Gesserit mother. An example is that he can se many ways that he could change the future. Jessica is Paul's mother. She is a very loving and compassionate person, but when she needs to fight she will. She is very logical and intelligent. Paul's mother is a Bene Gesserit. There is only one Kwisatz Haderach (A male Bene Gesserit) that could do things no Bene Gesserit can. Could that be Paul? Bene Gesserits have the power to use the voice a way to tell people what to do and they do it without thinking they are under the Bene Gesserit's power."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The main problem every science fiction write has to face is to completely outline a futuristic world without being obvious about it. Even historical novels face a lesser problem; the worlds they describe are at least partly known to the readers. It takes quite a balancing act to tell a story and describe the future at the same time, both plausibly enough to achieve a suspension of disbelief, and in enough detail to fire the imagination of a true sci-fi buff.I thought Asimov had done it brilliantly in the Foundation series - told a great story and at the same time shown us a future universe. (though I felt he faltered after the first three). I read many other books describing different futures, but never really came across another rounded, complete universe description. Star Wars had it, but it was a movie.Then I read Dune. The one thing that struck my dazed brain at the end of the novel was the sheer complexity of the worlds described here. Somewhere down the line in a complex tapestry of what I can only think of as a period drama was a futuristic universe of incredible richness. Here it all was - incredible landscapes, unheard of technology, well-rounded characters and incredibly dramatic situations. And it had one thing that Asimov lacked - religion.A true future universe is always going to have some component of religion and mysticism; Frank Herbert evokes this in fantastic ways by borrowing freely from Islam and other religions to give a texture to the political plots that really elevates Dune to classic status.The only complain I have; I bought the collected volumes, and its far to fat to read comfortably in bed."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I first read the Dune series in the late 80's after the first movie came out. I have just begun re-reading them after 9/11. I particulary find the manipulation of politics and religion by first the Bene Gesserits and then by Paul to be quite interesting in light of the current events. For those who have only seen the movie, Paul may seem to be a romantic hero. However in a 1980 interview Frank Herbert compared Paul Atreides to Hitler, and warned of the dangers of a charismatic leader gaining influence on a population. I reccomend that people read Dune, Dune Messiah and Children of Dune. You may see some comparisons to our current &quot;war&quot;."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I'm currently reading Book 6. I've thoroughly enjoyed every book in the series so far. Dune Messiah is top-notch classic sci-fi. In this novel, Paul develops and matures as the prescient leader of a people in a religious fervor.Herbert masterfully portrays the various forces at work attempting to stop Paul and his immensely powerful following. There's a lot of action in the book but not as much as in Dune. Messiah focuses more on Paul's personal struggles with knowing the future and being trapped in his vision, with only a handful of critical &quot;junctions&quot; available where he can change course. The ending is highly satisfying and emotional."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"A lot has been said and written about Dune, but if there is one thing most people tend to agree on, it is that Dune is truly a masterpiece, unique in its own right. Epic is the best way to describe it, reminiscent of Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. Just like Tolkien's masterpiece, Dune deserves a place on everyone's book shelf. In a way, finishing this book might be a little disappointing, because you really wish there was no end to it. The Bible can only be written once, and so it is with Dune. Though I have read the sequels to Dune, they really cannot compare to the original. My advice is to read and experience Dune, but if you want to read the sequels, keep an open mind, because Herbert has fallen into the trap that most sequels of succesful movies have fallen into: they really do not add anything, and make you wish you could erase the memories of the sequel(s), so you can think of the original as truly being unique. The sequel is no equal, especially so when it comes to Dune."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Well, this is simply the best book I've read EVER, starting the best SF series ever written by the human being.

Now many years later, at the ripe old age of 22, I cannot tell you how much this book has influenced my writing.

I've already read this book 6 times and I don't think I'll stop here. A world saga that will remain the best in time. Dune world is so well described that you cannot think it's not real.

I am drawn in the intricacy and detail. It is profound and amazingly wonderful tale which should be read by all who enjoy quality story-telling.

I have re-read the book so often that I have worn out four copies of it. I waited for was years for Frank Herbert to write another book on the Dune saga. I am sorry that he is dead and there will be no more--at least from his mind--I would not mind being a ghost writer for him and continue the saga. What I especially like about Dune are the religious factors brought into play, the emphasis on mental powers instead of technology--even though that was very advanced; the Bene-Gesserit, the Emperor Shaddam and his daughter Irulin, the Freman, the spice, and of course the mighty sandworms. I appreciate the writing ability of FRank Herbert and his drawing on many historical, scientific, cultural, and religious sources to create memoralble plot and characters. I especially love his use of delightful irony--like the fact that the deadly sworn enemies like Harkonnens and Atreides are really very closely related. As are the Freman and the Saudakaur troops. Any way, if you saw the movie and did not like or understand it, read the book and then see the movie again--Patrick Stewart make one heck of a Gurney Hallick. And there are many other recognizeable faces--if you like twin peaks, famous german and swedish actors, etc. The whole series is good, but the first book &quot;Dune&quot; is best with the third one, &quot;Children of Dune&quot; very good as well. I do not like the 2nd becuse I do not like what Herbert does with Paul. If you at all like science fiction or historical drams, you will really enjoy &quot;Dune&quot;.

I'll put aside the slight inconsistencies of the series regarding prescience for the time being and talk about the plot. It is mostly political intrigue. The entire ecological thread is lost from the book and the Dune feeling is therefore gone. However, the rest of it is pretty good, and the religious themes are much more prominent in the tortured heart of Paul Muad'Dib Atreides, who must live with the destruction being done in his name and the prescient path on which he has trapped humanity. All in all, it is slightly more philosophical, the characters are revealed more clearly and interestingly, and the focus shifts from the planet to the people."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The story is talking about desert and dune, but the book is actually like ocean, with not only bellowing plot surface, but also unfathomable thought-provoking depth.Actually I read three sf books in a row in two months: Speaker for the Dead by Orson Scott Card, Blood Music by Greg Bear, and this Dune by Frank Herbert.

If you haven't read it yet, this must be first thing you have to read."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The book, Dune, written by Frank Herbert was interesting novel. This book was good, although at times it was confusing. Herbert takes you into his imagination which allows your mind to run wild. Many times i was lost because his world is nothing like we know the world as it is today. This book is in the future and is based upon a war over spices. In which, a man, Paul fights against the emperor. If you want to read something which allows your mind to run wild this is a book for you."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"GREAT BOOK. Love the way Herbert has made up a &quot;new&quot; religion, based on Islam and Christianety...It gives the reader a perfect picture into a futur, where humans relly more on other people, then robots. Also the part about &quot;making a perfect humaniod&quot; is great."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Provocative and sometimes terrifying, DUNE transports us to Arrakis. A place like no other I have visited in my travels of the imagination.

I'm currently reading it for the second time and plan to read the rest of the series later this year."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"it's rare to find a sequel on par with the original. This one fits the bill."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"When I first read this science fiction classic, I was 14 and probably read it purely as an adventure story. (I still remember it vividly. I read it in two or three sittings on a long plane trip.) When I reread it as an adult, I came at it from the perspective of a character-driven political novel that happens to be set on an alien planet. It works both ways. Herbert has created a world that is so complex and layered that the reader has to tease it apart to gain full understanding of all the themes at play. I suspect even more rereadings may be necessary.One new thing I noticed during the latest reading was how much human political and religious history is infused in the alien societies Herbert created, with a particular emphasis on Islam, which makes this messianic war story just as apropos for our time as it was when it was written 40 years ago. The depiction of life on a desert planet where water is the most precious of commodities and every action is about survival remains fascinating as well. The only thing that fell short for me this time was that the story was so epic and so grand that certain aspects of it had to be glossed over; some characters got short shrift, and some plotlines got lost. But that's nitpicking. This classic of the genre still stands.http://readmorebooks.wordpress.com"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune...Arrakis...Desert Planet...This is the best book of all time in my opinion. The level of complexity and that every bit of it is pertanent to the story. I'm not a fan of artsy fartsy ambiguous type stuff that to me seems like a cop-out to actual ideas. I have heard this book has received this label as well, and will agree it isnt an easy read. But everything, i mean everything that happens.. if you are paying attention is a reference point to another part of the book, and in some cases serise.Well enough with that. In my opinion this book explores humanity and what it is to be human better than any other piece of art or literature I have ever read. Although at the beginning (as often times are observations in life) it seems easy to define who is good an evil. If you read this book and continue on you come to realize through amazingly human characters that people and ideals are very complicated.. good and evil is relative and no one is either. Paul is a product of much, as is the Barron, as are all other characters.Dune may as well be a history book of the future.. it is as useful in exploring human nature. It even has a biblical.. its a messianic story that teaches, for those willing to absorb, an immense ammount about life, humanity, and the world around you. In my opinion (im an athiest) it is far more useful that the bible because it teaches empowerment as opposed to subsurvience.One last note, and this will probably sound fake, but its not! When i read this, and all 5 other origional Dune books I was in jail, because I was a drug addict. I became obsessed with them and i credit them to where my life is today. I'm almost done with my bachelors degree with a 3.7gpa(in buisness administraction), sober, have an internship and a powerful private investment firm where im learning so much, and will be attending Graduate school next year.i probably sound like a crazy person lol.. and no i dont think Paul Muad'Dib is my personal savior.. but i do think this book is a must read!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book is very brief, but I guess this is how its supposed to be since it seems Frank Herbert wanted it to be a link between Dune before Paul, and the Dune after Paul. The end of the book is the perfect way to take us to the next stage, the children of Muadib."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"A little shorter than the massive Dune first installation, but Frank doesn't disappoint in the manner of the storytelling. Not as sweeping as it could have been, but a great gateway to The Children of Dune book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"They did a great job with this audiobook. Dune Messiah is my favorite of the Dune Books. I found myself getting all choked up at the end, even though i knew what was going to happen. That tells you a lot. I hope Children of Dune is not too far off in the future. They really do need to get all of the original Frank Herbert material on cd."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"While this book was panned by the critics when it was first published in 1969, this book is a milestone in the Dune Saga.The story told in this book takes place 12 years after Paul Atreides usurps the imperial throne from House Corrino. Paul has become Emperor Paul Muad'dib and has unleashed the Freman legions upon the universe, not only to consolidate his control over the imperium, but also to spread a new religion across the known universe.This book details Pauls struggle to reconcile his desires for a free humanity, while at the same time, his government assumes the mantle of a religious gestalt. To question the government is to question god. To break a law of society is to commit a sin. While Paul acknowledges his own folly, the apparatus of government takes on a life of its own and Paul can no longer control it.While this book lacks the action adventure of Dune, Dune Messaih makes up for with thought provoking questions and rhetoric about society, government, religion and philosophy.Well worth the read."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book has a much different feel than the original book--a narrower scope, slower pace, heavier on philosophy, intricate layers of plotting, etc.--but still vintage Herbert. If you were hooked by the first book, this volume won't disappoint you--just be prepared for the different tone in which Herbert wrote this one."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I have read the Dune trilogy for the first time as a very young adult, and it made a very large impact. It opened up a complete new world to my already over-active imagination.The Dune Universe, is anything but simple or easily digestable: filled with dark and soul tortured characters in a highly political structure, with creatures, technological and ecological ideas that can only come from a genius - The Dune trilogy is simply a masterpiece, and not just in the Science Fiction genre...Dune Messiah, the second installment, is absolutely brilliant."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"If you're a fan of Dune, this book may or may not be for you. It's definitely not one of Herbert's better works, so if you're looking for something of the same quality of the first book, you'd probably be better off looking at some of his other works (I recommend the Destination: Void series). If you're looking at reading the entire Dune series, however, this one's a must-read...just don't expect the high-quality thrills & intrigue that make Dune the high-quality novel that it is."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I like the direction Frank Herbert took the Dune series in his first two sequels. This book has a bit more development than the original Dune. We get to learn more about the inner turmoil of Paul, Alia, and then meet the kids. Frank has a way of creating politically exciting twists and power struggles, without making any one character the villain. Paul and Alia in their own ways are both despots and victims. In terms of storyline, I think this brings the story to a satisfying conclusion (I'm not so big a fan of what happens afterChildren of Dune (Dune Chronicles, Book 3)).Frank's writing style can be a bit dense. Sometimes the dialogue is filled with philosophical or nonsensical musings. Some of it is quite deep - but certainly not how people actually talk. It takes some getting used to. I'd recommend only continuing on to this book if you got through the original Dune and liked it.If you liked the books, I highly recommendFrank Herbert's Children of Dune (Sci-Fi TV Miniseries) (Two-Disc DVD Set)- it's a pretty good film adaptation ofDune Messiah (Dune Chronicles)andChildren of Dune (Dune Chronicles, Book 3)."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I like the direction Frank Herbert took the Dune series in his first two sequels.

Many parts I felt like I could not read fast enough, because I had to know what would happen next.I loved reading this book! It had a few moments that were boring, but they led up to something really good. When the book gets to a boring part, just read through it as fast as you can and soon it will get interesting again.The first thing that I think this book does for you is makes you feel grateful for water. Dune is a desert planet and has no water or precipitation on it. You read about how the people of Dune, especially the Fremen, conserve water. In one point of the book, it says, \\"he saw human figures moving into the flower fields, sweeping them with strange scythe-like devices--dew gatherers. Water so precious here that dew must be collected.\\" Conserving water is one of the things that makes the book interesting. For example, the people of Dune wear Stillsuits to conserve their body's water. The only water they lose is through their hands.In the back of the book there are appendices to help you understand the space travel, the environment of Dune, and the Bene Gesserit ways. I would read these before starting the book. There is also a small dictionary for words that you may not understand. The author, Frank Herbert, makes up new words for this book. As you read in the book if you don't understand what a word means look it up or soon the book will not make sense.There is a movie to this book, and I watched it many times as a child. I don't know whether or not to have you watch it before reading the book. Watching the movie gives you a feel for the new \\"universe\\" that Frank Herbert has created. Watching it first will give away a lot of the book though. So I think it is a personal choice.I really enjoyed this book. It creates a world that is unlike ours. It also is fun to read about something that is not in our lives. I really enjoyed the different things such as the space guild, Bene Gesserit ways, the Fremen, and the other things that Frank Herbert created."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I watched the original Dune movie (you know...with Sting hah) not too long ago and became enthralled with the idea of reading the book. I really wanted to understand some of the things in the book that didn't get across in the movie. While Dune was a bit too political for me at times overall it was a surprisingly steady and understanding read."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Hard to imagine anyone who enjoys science fiction not having read \\"Dune\\" but it's an older work and might possibly have escaped the notice of younger readers. A Hugo award winner, \\"Dune\\" will capture your imagination, mesmerize you with it's scope and detail and make you so conscious of wasting water it will be weeks before you can flush your toilet without wincing. Read the book and if possible follow up with the audio book which can be purchased rather reasonably or checked out from your local library."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Literary science fiction at its best. A novel of ideas and of characters that will lead you to ask questions about power, the role of religion for an individual and a society, and what possibilities exist if human beings give themselves over to ideas and plans greater than themselves. Dune is a story to big for any adaptation to do it credit, read it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Honestly , really truthfully honestly, this book is the best book i've EVER read i was shocked that up until this point.I thought i knew great authors i really did but i was wrong. it was like i had never read a book before it was like being blind had having someone discribe colors and then actually seeing the colors for the first time ... It's the first time i read a book where some one had a story, and just really owned it, run with it and made you care.... And it wasn't absolutely unbelievable, impossable. I mean look the story is hot the story takes place tens of thousands of years in the future. the story chronicles the human race which has banned computers but developed advanced technology and mental and physical ablitites. everything is run with the consumption of melange (spice) which can if consumed enough make flyng ship travel with out moving and they can simply fold space and they are there. extend life. see into the future, see things. minus the royality the witchs the mentats humans so logical and conditons they where biological computers able to amazing feets with their minds, along with all the political and social and scientific things. its all consuming. i'd often be stuck in pleace reading the book oblivious stuck in unknown spots just reading ... wondering at points where this author came up with this story... i mean he has stories within stories plots twists... he has dept that he follows threw like or as with realistic life senerios would happen complete with all the little details. which he takes the actually time to tackle and write. i like how in his novel he speaks in that by the way there's this whole story that happened before the machine wars which you learn in qoutes and statements and remarks from people and books in the story... but this is what we are covering now sense. Every thing has its own history its own language along with amazing incredible quotes. He doesn't have chapters he has quotes. how hot is That are from histories or journals that seem like they are outside sources seemingly like it is factual documents. you have to remind your self its a story. but you feel you have to tell your friends. Its crazy how even the last line of dune is inspiring. I love this book it is my favorite. And all the reviewers are right the only thing comparable to it is the lord of the rings with its rich and complete world."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I don't think the cover of this book saying \\"Science Fiction's Supreme Masterpiece\\" is out of place by saying so.

It is a wonderful, well-written tale and was and is very innovative and draws the reader into the story. The detailed background of each place and character just deepens the sense of reality gained by this knowledgeable book. My favorite!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Words cannot describe the depth of this book's greatness. Not only is Dune the greatest single sci-fi novel ever written, it is the greatest novel ever written. It introduces the reader to a new and fantastic world, more realistic than any other in literature. Frank Herbert was a genius. Paul is a little stiff, but at the same time, he is more &quot;real&quot; than most people I know. This is the first novel that I've read that wore me out reading it, that is how powerful it is. There are scenes that simply left me physically exhausted after reading them. No book I have ever read before or since has drawn me in like Dune does. Enough good things cannot be said about Dune. It is pitiful that the Modern Library skipped this in it's listing. Dune blows Ulysses, Gatsby and anything by Faulkner completely out of the water. Whether you're a sci-fi fan or not, you MUST read Dune. You will NOT regret it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Definitely one of the wierdest (good) books SF has to offer. Herbert presents Paul as the classic tragic hero. In this book society has gone onto a new level, even though it is feudal. People work to ultimately perfect body and mind. As a blend of mysticism and SF, it is one of the few that work.... beautifully. But don't read any of the sequils."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"No one, nobody can possibly overdo the immense task of creating such an amazing, complex and profound frame for a story like Frank Herbert has done. The unbelievable depth his thinking takes us, the incredible charm of a feudal way of living in the depths of outer space, is something that really is beyond anybody's expectations. The teachings about enviroment, about the autocratic rule of emperors, the &quot;noblesse oblige&quot; that you find in the Great Houses Covenant are things that everyone in this world should be aware of. If you want to search in you deepest roots, if you want a book that can shatter and remake your way of thinking and living, then this series is for you. All the six titles have something to teach in bravery, fight against destiny, family, tradition and needed changes. Please go for it because it certainly deserves one star more than any other book sold here."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Its about the continuation af Paul-Mau'd dib.

This book gives me a stronger view, and a better felling on science fiction. Auther Frank Herbert does such a great job on actually making every effert for detail, to make it feel like you are there. The many story lines happening at the same time really keep you into the book, but this can also lose you in the book too. Overall, I give dune 5 stars. It has to be one of the best novels ever written."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"One of the landmark novels in science fiction, Dune is worthy of its rank as a classic. Prior to its appearance in the mid-1960s, few science fiction novels even approached its level of depth.The story, which follows Paul Atreides and his growth into the messianic Muad'Dib, is rich in detail. There is a feudalistic galactic empire with all the attendant political intrigues. There are numerous religious movements, some operating more scientifically, others quite mystically. And there is the subtle character of the planet Arrakis (or Dune) itself, whose hostile environment, precious spice resources and devastating sandworms make it not only the most important planet in the galaxy, but also arguably the most interesting planet in science fiction.There is too much here to detail in one review. While it is not perfect - Herbert does have his writing flaws - the imperfections pale in comparison to the importance of this novel to the genre. Just as the Lord of the Rings is an essential fantasy read, this book is a must read for any science fiction fan."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is the science fiction novel by which all other science fiction novels are judged. I remember reading it for the first time as a sophomore in high school and I was completely blown away. The first 50 pages were pretty boring, as Frank Herbert is laying the groundwork for what's about to come. By the time I hit page 100, I couldn't put it down. I have read thousands of books, newspapers, and magazines over the last 30 years and if someone were to ask me, \\"If I only read ONE book in my lifetime, what would you recommend?\\" - DUNE would be my answer. Here's my credentials: [website]"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"First of all, I am not one who typically writes reviews. However, I was compelled to write because this stunning novel is one of the best in modern fiction. There are many reasons why this novel has been loved by so many. Most of all, Herbert's is a creation of supreme depth, describing the economic, military, political, and social interactions of a vast universe. To my knowledge, only Tolkien has created such a detailed and believable reality. So, if for no other reason, read this novel to become engrossed in the rich tapestry of humanity that is &quot;Dune&quot;."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"A friend had recommended this book once. I am glad I read it. The characters are excellent, especially the young boy Paul Atreides. The development of this kid to a powerful creature will make hooked from the first page. I don't think you have to be a sci-fi reader to enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Sequel of Dune. If you think Dune has not enough action, wait until you read this one. 95% dialogues, I would say. Still, I like the book because it attempts to depict what Paul is thinking and why he did certain things. I recommend this if you like the first book and don't think it is boring."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"An introduction by the author in my edition indicates his goals: to explore the messiah myth, to examine the relationship between politics and economics, to explore the consequence of the control of a limited resource, i.e., water as an analog of oil. The novel does this so admirably and a great deal more. Overlayed are a gripping story and some really big issues: loyalty vs. betrayal, love vs. obligation, nature vs. nurture. Strikingly, these inevitable conflicts are subjected to tension and resolution. Sure, this is space opera at its best, but it is a wonderfully written novel that can stand on its own beside traditional literature. Don't let the detractors keep you from this; they simply don't get the point. It is a big, well written book that will enrich you whether or not you proceed on to the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book was amazing. Don't be discouraged by the length of the book because this is one of the best books I've ever read. If you know Hebrew or Arabic, some of the words might make more sense.

'Dune' is very likely one of the most brillant worlds ever imagained and also one of the most ingenious books you will ever read. Frank Herberts genius at creating a true and real culture is always overwhelmingly apparent. His stunning creations of literature, history, religion, and culture reflect and could very easily be our world.Set on the planet Arrakis, the only in a universe where the entire population depends on a spice called melange, Arrakis is the only planet that produces this staple. The king and queen of House Arrakis, Duke Leto and Lady Jessica have a son named Paul and they have been assigned to watch this planet. But getting there is only the beginning........Although very slow at times, Dune is truly a great book. Hard to get into at times, it is absolutely worth the read. This book will be read by me for many years to come. My only regret is that I will not be able to read it for the first time. The only warning is that the books that follow have only gotten much, much, poorer."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is an amazing book. Even though it was written in the 1960's it is still a solid sci-fi book. This is the first book I have read that made me want to grab a highlight at highlight certian passages. Granted, the first fifty pages are the hardest, but after you get used to the language it runs smoothly. Frank Herbert is not afraid to kill off main charaters either(something more authors should do). Forget about the terrible movies and take a ride to Arkeen, just be wary because you will want to read the rest of the series."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"For anyone who even remotely enjoys sci-fi, they should pick up this book. But it is not for people who think sci-fi should be &quot;all action, all dialogue, non-stop.&quot; Because Dune is a far cry from action. It has it's moments of intense action at times, but for the most of it, it delves into the inner-workings of baronies and empires, the thoughts of young dukes and old planetoligists, and the struggle against tyranny. There are characters you will hate, characters you can do nothing but love, and some characters will seem so unimportant you forget them, only to have them come back at the end.All in all, I reccomend this book so highly, I think 5 stars is a rude understatement. I believe this to be the best book ever written (that I've read.) Buying this book is a must."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I've been a Dune fan since the late '70's when I first picked up my mom's copy (she was a fan as well). The early '70's \\"oil shortage\\" was still a recent event so the concept of artificial shortages of heavily-used commodities created for political and economic reasons (the over-arching theme of all the Dune books) had particular relevance to this impressionable teenager.All through the \\"greed is good\\" '80's and \\"internet-a-go-go\\" '90's, I kept returning to the Dune stories and finding continuing relevance and insights which helped me understand the world around me.In early September, 2001, I had the good fortune to take a plane trip with a friend who happened to be as devoted to Tolkien's Rings as I was to the Dune series. (Our discussion would have made a Comparative Lit professor proud as we each vied to \\"prove\\" our stories were better than the other's!) My arguments hinged on the premise that many of the themes and situations in the Dune stories were applicable to the real world (and this was a week before 9-11, which made them even more relevant!)When people ask me to recommend books, Dune is always first on my list, followed by Dune Messiah and Children of Dune. If you desire a complex, imaginative and morally ambiguous series of novels that have deep and continuing resonance to the world around you, try Dune. At the very least, you'll be treated to a grand adventure story. At the very best, you'll find a tremendous resource that you can return to again and again."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is justifiably considered one of the classics of Science Fiction. Many of the created societies in sci-fi feel one dimensional and antiseptic, but Frank Herbert created one of the most realistic and belivable futures in the genre. Dune was described in one of these customer reviews as what would happen if James Clavell wrote sci-fi. I couldn't agree more. It shares the same narraritive techniques as a Clavell novel, the same complex plot, and if Herbert isn't quite as entertaining a writer as Clavell, the ideas he presents are extremely fascinating.Much of what drives Dune is two subjects largely absent from most science fiction: biology and religion.When I say religion I mean religion as a social phenomena. In the few instances religion appears in sci-fi it is often presented in a smug or condescending way. But religion has been a large social force throughout recorded history and Herbert postulated, not unreasonably, that it will continue to be so.If it is not surprising that religion gets such short shrift, it is surprising how little attention biology gets in most Science-fiction. Authors conversant in PhD level physics often have no conception of the basic tenets of biology or ecology (though to be fair this failing is more pervalant in TV sci-fi). But in 'Dune' it is the ecology of the planet Arrakis that shapes the Fremen, and the religion based on Paul Maud'dib and jihad that shapes the galaxy."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"BY far Dune is one of the best science fiction novels ever written. This book gave me a stronger view, and a better perception on understanding science fiction. Many story lines that run at the same time through out the story really keep you into the book, but many readers can get lost through out the book in between story lines. Overall I give dune a five star reading! Dune is the best science fiction novel I have ever read and I definatedly recommened this book for anyone who likes to read. It is spectacular.Dune is based in a galaxy far away much like most science fiction novels of it's time. A boy named paul has caught word that he may be the Kwisatz haderach. He has to travel through out the planet Arakis and train his followers to defeat the emporer and the Harkoneons, the defeaters of his father. I will not reveal the end of the story so I don't spoil the reading."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is simply amazing. The book is even more in depth than the movies. I had never read the books before, but I recently saw the Children of Dune mini-series, and it got me interested. I'm sorry I didn't pick up this book sooner, it's excellent.The sad part is, that the mass market paper back edition is poorly produced. My main gripe is that the margin is way to close to the binding of the book. I have to come close to destroying the thing just to bend the book open enough so I can so those words down the inside edge of the paper.I heavily reccomend Dune to anyone who's a sci fi fan. I also reccomend picking up a different printing of the book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Probably the best of his works, Frank Herbert's DUNE is a masterpiece by a master of authors. The story line is rich, with realistic characters portraying people as they really are and not loaded with sugarcoated individuals that survive the entire book and the next four in the series. It begins with Paul Atreides being brought to the desert planet Arrakis, the sole producer of spice, by his father the Duke Leto Atreides. Ambushed in a strange world with his father killed, Paul is taken in by the desert Fremen to become the Kwizatz Haderach... This book can only be compared to Herbert's The Godmakers, another one of Herbert's greatest works. I am also a fan of John Robert Reule (J.R.R.) Tolkien, Tom Clancy, and Clive Cussler; Herbert is one of my favorite authors among the few whose books I look for."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I saw the movie 'Dune' as a kid. About the only things I remembered from the movie was the worms, the blue eyes, and Sting. Being a science fiction fan and wanting to form my own opinion of Herbert's story, I decided to read the book not too long ago. 'Dune' is a story, set in the distant future, about the battle for a planet and it's precious spice. It is full of adventure and fantasy.'Dune' holds your attention throughout, and leaves you wanting more at the end {Herbert satisfies this craving with more Dune books). My only criticism is a slight one - there seems to be too many characters, plotlines, etc. going on at once in a couple of places - hard to keep track of it all occasionally.I would greatly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys science fiction novels."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"In sixth grade, a friend and I read this book and fell in love with it. We attempted to use the Bene Gesserit to force kids away from drinking fountains, turn our eyes the deep blue of the spice addiction, and were constantly discussing what it would be like to be on a planet where it never rains(partially since we live in Oregon, where it seems like it's ALWAYS raining).Dune is complex, a skillfully created tapestry, each thread a different character or situation to follow to the end, not just chopped off abruptly at some point like in poorly written books or ideas. Warning: may cause health hazards to people who are looking for a &quot;simple book&quot;."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The 2nd book in the Dune cronicles, Dune Messiah changes the tone of the series. One of the most dissapointing things about this book is how Paul Maud'Dib is shown. He is not the hero of the first book, but an actual human that has (many) flaws. 3rd favorite of the 4 I have read so far. Best in this series: Dune Second: Children of Dune"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"One of the most outstanding novels ever written. After first finishing it, I read the glossary, and began again on page one. Each reading yields new knowledge, and I have read it approximately twice a year since it was first published.

I was mesmerized, totally.It has been 20 years now since I first read Dune, and I've fully re-read it 6 or 7 times in that span.Brilliant sums it all up.Postscript:The film totally f***ed the original vision, and it ruined the mental pictures formed by Herbert's elegant descriptions.

All that and a great story drew me deep into the the world of Arrakis and Frank Herbert. Get this book !!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Science fiction with a heavy touch of fuedal fantasy, well plotted, well written, great characters. This is not a book to be left sitting on your &quot;to read&quot; list, or on your bookshelf. Not much here for the hard sci fi fan, but rich for the lover of the language, for readers who demand characters they can care about, and for lovers of classic intrigue and betrayal. Don't judge this book by the movie. If you think Crichton's novels get hacked in Hollywood, you haven't seen anything yet. If I was Herbert, I'd have gone through the roof at the movie. the book is just so, so much more."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is the darn best novel I have ever read, a completeness unprecedented in the history of science fiction (if one disregards Heinlein's Multiverse for a sec or two). In refference to Paul Muad'Dib and the Mentants I hope there will never be anything like the Water of Life for a male, though the variante for the Mothers is quite a positive feature, for Dune, the Fremen and the Human Race. I wonder how Lord Leto II would review the book, he's the one who knows all this best of all, or was it ol' Frank .. :) Anyhow, get this classic novel, read it , love SF."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"For sheer scope, coupled with the depth of characterization this book cannot have an equal. My original copy that I purcahsed as a teenager has long fallen apart because of excessive rereading. This is a book that I can go back to again and again and find something new. I read it for just the thrill I get from certain passages; like when the Emperor says to Count Fenring &quot;Kill this upstart Duke&quot; and the Count &quot;Knew that he could kill him. He knew it for a fact&quot;. Yet, he declines! The later books in the Dune saga to me are all lesser works. 'Dune' will forever be, my favorite."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Since I was 10 years old I saw the movie and now I got more interested in the book.

But seriously, it is a rare insight into the bitter rewards of power, along with all the other levels this book has to offer. Religeon; how much of this is created, &amp; how much is self-creating. Economics; Muad'Dib - the supreme energy eater. Politics: Bene Tlalaxu, Bene Gesserit, House Atredies, The House of Ix, The Fremen, The Guild, oh yeah. Finally, this concludes the story of Paul Atredies (The Preacher is another story...) who sought to make his future, only to find his future made him."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Great to see all the classic Dune novels on Kindle now. Dune is the kind of book that, if you haven't read it, you've left a huge gap in your knowledge of contemporary sci-fi and fantasy writing. If you never read any of the others, don't sweat it, this is the first and the best. Almost more quotable than the Bible."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book is one of my all time favorites. While the Lord of the Rings trilogy stands out as the best fantasy novel, I view Dune as the best science fiction novel. I am an avid reader and when I find authors I love, I devour everything the write. The first Dune book is the best in the series, but I liked the first three books. I made the mistake of watching the movie Dune (the version with Sting in it) before reading the book, and I hated the movie, which caused me to avoid the book for several years. Finally, a friend of mine who had read the book strongly recommended I read it anyway and I broke down and picked up the book at a library. It drew me in so quickly, I bought it and have read it several times since. I love the intrigues between the royal houses, the devious manipulations and scheming (breeding programs, power, control of spice, Arrakis/Dune and space travel) which extends even to the planting of religious seeds into undeveloped civilizations so that a reverend mother would be recognized and embraced by these civilizations generations down the road. The political and religious themes are woven powerfully through the plot. I cannot recommend this book strongly enough."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"In description of the binding type you need to specify dimensions of the book. I thought I was getting a standard size library book, not a glorified hard bound paperback."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is the Dune we all know and love. So you know what you're getting in terms of the novel. There are plenty of reviews on this book by people much more well informed and educated on literature than I am, so I will not try to go there.This printing is a cheap, small paperback so it's perfect for what I wanted! The printing was great in terms of accuracy and precision. Whether you're a newcomer to Dune, or you read it years ago in your childhood this would be a great edition for anyone."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is, to me, an amazing book. It' well written, the characters are extremely believable (be it good or bad) and the story is incredibly gripping. The level of detail of the history, planets and faith is well told and the author succeed to create something that felt so real it felt like I stood on the planet myself.Love it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"So I finished. Its like a lot of those Shakespearean things, where there's court intrigue and all that jazz. The fight at the end, I was thinking that he ripped off Hamlet, and I was waiting for Fointenbras to walk across the stage.I figured out that the difference between fantasy and SciFi while reading the novel. Fantasy is Magic + An imagined Medieval Europe, SciFi is Space + Technology + Magic. SciFi that is overly reliant on the magical aspect somewhat loses me when there's all sorts of possibilities with technology. That's where Asimov lost me in the Foundation Trilogy. I was able to accept the plausibility of the concept of Psychohistory, but once he introduced the character of \\"The Mule\\", I was lost as a reader. Herbert does the same thing here: \\"Spice\\" can make you see the future; Paul and his family are Magic! Can you have it both ways?That said, things finally picked up. In my copy, I realized it was on page 411 of 474 in my copy. Things are moving along, a climactic battle is in the works...it happens, but between the chapters. Did that really happen? That said though, it ends in such a way that does feed consumption of the next book. You want to, HAVE TO, know what happens next. It's just not that important for me.It took too long to build interest for me. There were points where I was wondering about the world Herbert built, its possibility in terms of geography and geology and the biology of the place. there were other points where I was analyzing the structural elements of the novel, thinking about narrative voice and scene selection. Not that those are unimportant parts of considering a novel, but if your reader's thinking about them on the first read-through, there's something missing. Unfortunately, that's hard to pin down."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The story itself is wonderful. I believe that listening to this recording of Dune is even better than reading the book.

Arabs in space, some of whom are on drugs.Humanity devolves back into tribalism/feudalism, with attendant problems of religion and war. Dark, cult-ish, historical hodgepodge, all in sci-fi drag.Sorry, but throwing in some spaceships and anti-grav gadgets doesn't qualify Dune as a science fiction story. This story is simply a relic of the hippie-dippy culture... toss out rationality and other elements of modern civilization, and substitute supposed mind-expanding drugs, Eastern mysticism, and revolution.If that sounds like something you would enjoy (perhaps if you're an old hippie, or a \\"turn on, drop out\\" type) go for it.The movie was beautifully done, however. Even Frank liked it. Only problem with it was the story."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Arthur C. Clark found nothing comparable to it except Lord of the Rings. I find it better.Dune was, is, and forever shall be, pardon the Dune pun, the God Emperor of science fiction. Nothing, from Tolkien to Poe can beat it.It starts out cloudy, and especially if you saw the movie first. You find that the slow trickle of Spice is the only way to keep the weakly ruled houses together, through the inefficient practices of the Guild, and keep it together through the iron scepter of the Saduakar and the clay fist of the Emperor Shaddam. But the fat were growing fatter in the old system, quite literally, so the immense and immensely powerful Baron Harkonnen lost fief-ship of the planet Dune, the only place where Spice can be found (at the time). Dune is given to Duke Leto Atreides, but the Baron and Emperor made a pact behind his back and destroyed House Atreides. The traitor and doctor Yueh sabotages the shields, getting Leto killed and his concubine the Bene Gesserit Lady Jessica, and son, Paul Atreides, run into the unbearable desert, home of the worms.Although I won't give away the later parts, I will tell you it does rule.

The only problem that I have with this book are with the rest of the series, which seems to be milking his worlds for all that they are worth, and in retrospect, I realize that I have read books that are a lot better.If you like politics, this book would seem a lot better to you. I can understand the politics, but it doesn't seem to really interest me all that much. I also like fantasy books more than science fiction, and I would rather have the main character that seems all-powerful to have some more impressing abilites than to simply see into the future, and then to find out that he isn't the only one that can do that in the universe made it almost like he wasn't THAT special, and was simply the right person in the right place at the right time."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"ACE reprint of 'Dune' - ISBN0-441-17271-7never before have i seen a book contain so many print &amp; editorial errors...ink application is not homogeneous, resulting in many blots &amp; light print areas...print pressure is inconstant, resulting in wavy print &amp; apparent font reduction...then there are the editorial errorspg. 108 &quot;the gift is the blessing of the river&quot; &lt;giver&gt;...the most egregious so farif there had been physical defect allowing return to place of purchase, this paperback would surely have been exchanged for a previously published edition of better quality"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"this book bored me to death. it was hard to follow with way too much description. scenes that should have been exciting took up five more pages then they should have, and quite frankly could have been made more exciting by a first grader.

I like a well written book with a good plot, but am not genre specific. I am 36 years old and read \\"Dune\\" for the first time a month ago. It is a very good book. The Greatest Sci-Fi novel ever? I'm sceptical of that claim, but I would recommend it to anyone who likes a very good, intelligent, action-packed adventure novel.\\"Dune Messiah\\", on the other hand, is almost a travesty - MASSIVELY underwhelming. There is virtually no action in this one. Just a bunch of crusty middle aged people talking...and talking...and talking. Though the ending is satisfying, and there is something almost resembling action at about the 250 page mark, it is otherwise devoid of excitement.Reading this book was like being the only sober college student in a room filled with pot-smoking philosophy majors. The same points get repeated over and over again, until you can bearly stand it. There ARE some interesting ideas in this book (particularly about how extraordinary men and their actions are twisted to serve the purposes of their warped followers, a la Jesus Christ), and dozens of wonderful lines to quote, but not nearly enough to justify it's 300+ page length. It is almost necessary to read, since it does complete the story of Paul Atreides, but it would have been so much more bearable if it had been half the length.I will NOT be reading any more Dune books, as the general consensus is that each sequel is progressively worse than the one before. I believe it now."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This sci-fi classic tells the story of the planet Arrakis (otherwise known as Dune). It is a barren place, mainly desert, and water is scarce. But in the sand is a precious spice that controls inter-planetary travel, and everyone wants control. The plot concerns two nobel families, the Atreides and Harkonnens, who fight it out for rulership of the planet. But there is a third, unpredictable force in the form of the native Fremen, who have a plan for Dune all of their own.The story starts quickly, with relationships and loyalties tested as the main characters take sides. There is intrigue, fighting and double-crossing. But after the initial momentum, the plot slows to a crawl. After a narrow escape from death, the main character is exiled, hiding from those out to kill him. He shelters in the desert with the natives, transforming himself into a mystical demi-god to get them on side for the ultimate battle of revenge. There is more talk than action, and the characters spend a lot of time explaining and analysing the planet Dune, and how it determines their own culture and religion. It goes on like this for the next 350 pages.When the final battle comes, Frank Herbert dodges the responsiblity of actually describing it. The preparation is outlined, but then the action cuts off the very moment the forces rush into enemy headquarters. The very next scene is the surrender, the terms and conditions of which are described in exhaustive detail. At this point, &quot;Dune&quot; abruptly ends in a massive anti-climax.Dune is a classic, and as such, should probably be read by any sci-fi fan. However, the book never reaches it's full potential. The themes and plot laid out at the beginning are promising, but they quickly drift into nothingness. By the time you reach the end, you may find that you hardly care about what happens to Dune."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This work is very much a product of the 1960's and, though set in the distant future, appears somewhat quaint in 2010.Indeed, it is odd to see characters with the technology to travel through space but without cell phones or computers. Social and political organization is akin to early medieval times and totally remote of any democratic pretence. There are human servants about and no signs whatsoever of robots. For reasons that are beyond me, as if in the theatre, knives and poison constitute weapons of choice.The audio book's production is far from outstanding: various actors are called upon to impersonate the many characters and all are not equally convincing. The problem may lie in the direction as the tone changes often considerably from one to the other. Possibly, the different parts were taped separately and edited together subsequently.Contrary to my expectations, this work stands no comparison with the Lord of the Rings series in terms of imagination, depth or significance. Some may however find it entertaining."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The quotes!The drama!The characters!The planets!Everything...Simply Grand!Read it!K3"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book was so incredibly boring it was mind numbing.The first few chapters kept me going, but to get to the end...good god.

When i closed the book I couldn't even remember what it was all about. So unless you are a great fan of Frank Herbert or intend to read the entire series, don't bother."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"It really is a shame that this book has to be classified as science fiction. Many people, who are otherwise well-read, are going to live out there lives having never even considered picking up Dune, let alone giving it a good read.I'm no-where near literate enough to right a review that would do Frank Herbert justice, so I won't. Besides, I think the other reviews do complement to the book quite nicely, and I wouldn't change any of them, even the ones that are slightly negative. After all, we're all entitled to an opinion.However...I would like to (briefly) note the parallels between the political situation in Dune, and what's currently happening in the world today.For example:I. Spice (oil)II. Empire (OPEC)III. House Atreides (America, Iraq, Britain, Russia?)IV. House Harkonnen (America, Iraq, Britain, Russia?)V. Freeman (Kurds, Turks, Al-Qaeda, Taliban, Afghanis, Iraqis?)Granted, these are all pretty interchangeable, depending on your political/moral leanings.This may have all been brought up before, so I hope I'm not plagiarizing anyone, but that is certainly not my intent. I do feel that this kind of adds a new scope of perspective for anyone who might be re-reading Dune, or even reading it for the first time. Regardless, it's a great piece of American literature. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"One of the best sci-fi books ever written. I've read the entire series twice - I like them all but Dune stands alone as the best of the bunch. BTW - don't bother with the \\"prequel\\" novels, those all suck.It really isn't possible to summarize the plot in a short review because... well... it just isn't. You'll just have to take my word for it - like you should always do.The nutshell is that the entire galaxy is addicted to drugs - specifically, \\"spice\\". The spice opens the mind, allows space travel, and is only on one planet. Unlike weed, which turns your eyes red, spice turns your eyes blue. The plot is basically a Mexican drug war in space - except one of the drug lords is a selectively bred super-human who uses drugs to open a big can on his enemies a ride giant sand worms like wild horses. Hmmmm... very similar to my own life actually - except I have groupies...After reading Dune, I figured that starting a drug habit might be a good idea. I started with Weed, it was smooth, but soon bored me. Therefore, I moved on the meth, cocaine, crack, and heroin. Heroin just didn't do it for me - the needles sucked and I was always passing out in public parks, bathrooms, and behind dumpsters. One time, I woke up when the garbage truck came and picked the dumpster up right in front of me. Good thing I wasn't in the dumpster that time!I think the closest thing I could find to \\"spice\\" was probably LSD. It was awesome because I found one of those fancy freeman water suits online and would put it on when I dropped the acid. Then, I'd hang out in my living room and be like \\"ahhhhh I'm in the desert! Ahhhhh I'm so thirsty! Ahhhhh I'm riding a sand worm! Riding a sand worm! Weeeeeeeee....Weeeeeeeee... ahahahahahahahaahaha!!\\" Good times.... Yeah... good times.I'm blind now. I freaked out once after getting me a pair of those crazy \\"dune\\" blue contact lenses and looking in the mirror. I was ripped out of my mind on the hash and forgot that I'd put the contact lenses in. I looked at my reflection and stabbed my eyes out with a tweezers. It is ok though - now I wear a patch over each eye and play \\"hide the eyeball\\" with my nieces and nephews. Which patch is it under? Left or right? Hehehe... oh boy do they love that game. Sometimes I'll give the kids a little surprise and put a marble in the hole or maybe a small plastic animal or lego toy. I've also found that little LED lights are a big crowd pleaser. Plus, when I close my eyelid over the hole, you can see the lights flashing on and off in there!Anyway, there are a lot of self-righteous pinky-in-the-air coffee house review writers filling up the review pages with their swill. Unfortunately, a lot of those reviewers will put Dune on their top lists just because sci-fi fans pretty much think that is what you are supposed to do.Not so with me. I'm recommending it just because it is good. If it wasn't good, it would qualify for the fabled Hall of Suck."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I guess it's just personal taste, but I'm sorry to say that I did not really like Dune that much. I really wanted to; I know it has a great reputation, and legions of fans who have read it multiple times. I just finished reading it last night. The overall setting and the complex story were fine. The opening scene, the visit from the Reverend Mother, was intriguing. But, somehow the writing style for the rest of the book just didn't click with me. You know how some books have wonderfully-crafted language and sentence structure that mezmerizes you? Well, this book was not like that. Time and again I found some passages awkwardly worded. As well, while there was a great assortment of characters, I felt no emotional attachment to any of them.I had previously read a couple of Herbert's sci-fi novels, and liked them, but this one, well, doesn't get 5 stars from me.

It's a very intelecual book, hence everyone thinks they've graduated colege when having finished this book and think they have to write a big thesis. It's a BOOK for crying out loud.

Ruling from Arrakis, he spots trouble from a mile away with his melange induced powers of prescience.Of course if you have not yet read the prequal, Dune, then by now you are obscenely lost and would strongly encourage you to run to the nearest book store, pick up a copy of both books, and read them in chronological order.This book, although difficult to understand is awesome to read and is very easy to get into. Some of the qualities are bewildering plot twists, bizarre characters, and an entertaining and action packed story line.This book is so awesome it has often been compared to The Lord of the Rings books, however like LOTR it is extremely difficult to read.

This was one of my ventures into the &quot;best of science fiction novels&quot;. This truely lives up to its billing because of its muti layered story line and complex character development. I was very impressed by the novels layout. Its easy to see that a lot of planning went in to writting this book. To be honest i was much more impressed with the style of the writting and the thought that went into every aspect of the way the story unfolded than the actual story itself. Don't get me wrong the story was fanatsic, but done by a man with lesser talent and imagery and one might say it comes off a bit.....dare i say.....cliche? I'm talking about the main storyline here when i say cliche, its the surrounding elements and subplots combined with Herbert's genius that separates this novel from all others. Anyway if you enjoy a great adventure with extreme detail to both atmosphere (and that's no outerspace pun) and character, this should be your next read. Forget whether you enjoy science fiction or not, this is a classic that everyone can enjoy. Next up.... the movie! By the way if you look closely and use your imagination you can pick up alot of similarities to Star Wars. However i will not mention any so as to not ruin anything for anyone."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune presents a sci-fi/fantasy spin ongoodoldVictorianOrientalism. The book valorizes the nomadic, tribal warrior culture of the Fremen, and deliberately places it in contrast to city life (the \\"pan and sink villages\\"), which is portrayed as drab and cowardly. The Fremen are totally invincible. They win effortlessly even against the Emperor's personal guard of selectively bred, highly trained interplanetary shock troops. Even against these outstanding opponents, the Fremen kill three enemies for each casualty of their own even if the numbers are against them.But for all their amazing prowess, these mystical warriors can only achieve victory under the guidance of a properly educated foreigner. A sympathetic foreigner, to be sure, one who goes native to a large degree and diligently follows local customs, but a foreigner nonetheless, easily able to set aside his role as tribal leader when necessary and step back into the mantle of hereditary duke, feudal lord, and military governor. Paul Atreides isLawrence of Arabia. He marries a local woman and appears to integrate into the tribe, but in fact, his children are only one-quarter Fremen. The fierce nomads are praised so highly precisely because their society has already been marked for external control (in Dune, by the Bene Gesserit order).Herbert does explore some of the burdens weighing on such a character. Buried inside Dune is a coming-of-age story about a boy who has to suddenly learn a harsh new culture, become a leader, and get accustomed to violence (most notably on p. 314 -- his speech at the eulogy is an effectively drawn moment of regret). Unfortunately, Herbert is a bit too enamoured with Paul, eventually idealizing him beyond good measure. Women throw themselves at him, even the widow of a man he just killed in a duel. He gains the ability to see the future, instantly becoming a flawless strategist. With his desert army, he effortlessly crushes his enemies. Even long before any of that happens, here's an early example. Paul is discussing politics with his father:\\"'Whoever had stockpiled melange could make a killing,' Paul said. 'Others would be out in the cold.'The Duke permitted himself a moment of grim satisfaction, looking at his son and thinking how penetrating, how truly educated that observation had been.'\\" (43)This quote highlights several weaknesses of the book:1. Herbert extensively uses internal monologue, perhaps thinking that it helps to bring out his characters' innermost thoughts and motives. Instead, however, he just bluntly and laboriously tells you exactly how you should interpret dialogue that was perfectly clear from the start. Paul's observation, above, is a complete banality. I even think it's only there as plot exposition. Yet, in the book, the word \\"educated\\" is actually italicized, just to make doubly clear that you should be impressed. This happens frequently. Here's another example that I found by flipping through the book at random: \\"She is brave, lovely, and, ah-h-h, so perceptive, Jessica thought. She'd have made a fine Bene Gesserit.\\" (440) Here's another one: \\"He's talking of single combat with Paul! Jessica thought.\\" (298)2. Exposition is handled awkwardly and overloads dialogue, right from the get-go: \\"'I hold at your neck the gom jabbar,' she said. 'The gom jabbar, the high-handed enemy. It's a needle with a drop of poison on its tip. Ah-ah! Don't pull away or you'll feel that poison.'\\" (8) The book's villain introduces himself via the line, \\"Is it not a magnificent thing that I, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen, do?\\" (14) In this scene, he is talking to his closest associates, who presumably know his name.3. Obvious or mundane statements are presented as wise revelations. \\"'She asked me to tell her what it is to rule,' Paul said. 'And I said that one commands. And she said I had some unlearning to do.'\\" (31) These statements are often inelegantly expressed. On the next page: \\"A process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the flow of the process, must join it and flow with it.\\" (32) Every chapter opens with a quote from a fictitious literary work praising Paul. Even the glossary in the appendix can't resist the temptation. The term \\"Kull wahad\\" is explained to mean \\"I am profoundly stirred,\\" with the note, \\"It is said of Muad'Dib that once he watched a desert hawk chick emerge from its shell and whispered: 'Kull wahad!'\\" (522) The affected high-poetic tone (\\"it is said of,\\" \\"once he watched\\"), the incongruity between the meaningless statement and the sycophantic gravitas slathered on top of it, start to seem unintentionally funny.Speaking of \\"Kull wahad,\\" Herbert's invented language is clunky, and adds to the needless exposition, since Herbert has to explain what someone said right after they said it: \\"'It's the amtal rule,' Stilgar said. 'Jamis is demanding the right to test your part in the legend.'\\" (298) The actual invented words appear to have been scavenged from real-world cultures and languages with no particular system or guiding principle. On p. 309, Herbert translates a Slavic word for \\"roots\\" (adapted to his Fremen language) as \\"roots,\\" but then translates another word meaning \\"grass\\" as \\"ashes.\\" Other words such as \\"shari-a,\\" \\"shaitan,\\" \\"fedaykin,\\" \\"bourka,\\" or \\"kindjal,\\" are derived from Middle Eastern culture. The Fremen words in Chani's eulogy on p. 315 appear to have been lifted directly from ch. 14 ofGypsy Sorcery And Fortune Telling, written in 1891 by Charles Leland.Dune has lyrical moments, intricate political schemes, and occasionally intense expressions of loyalty or honour-bound duty. Unfortunately, getting to those good parts is a slog through a lot of narrative and rhetorical mis-steps. If you do get through it, what you're left with is a story about a colonial viceroy who used his influence on a tribal culture to solve his political problems. Good for him, but then you're expected to react with admiration and awe. That's a bit much."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"i've read the negative reviews and could not believe my eyes! some people compared this series to the LOTR! first LOTR is not SCIENCE FICTION you idiots! it's FANTASY at it's best!!second i hate people who write a review without even reading the whole book! i've read all six of the original dune novels and the ones frank herbert's son wrote and i think all 11 books are great, especially the original novels..this series is not for novice sci-fi readers! so if you are new to this genre stay away from these books or if you don't like them keep your thoughts for yourself!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"In Dune the author Frank Herbert used 3rd person omniscient. He shares the perspectives, thoughts, and feelings of multiple characters. Frank Herbert uses symbolism as a literary device. One of the symbols he uses in the book is water. The Fremen refer to blood as \\"the body's water,\\" suggesting that the Fremen view water as the blood of the environment. When Thufir Hawat agrees to join the Fremen, he enters the \\"bond of water,\\" rather than a blood oath. People show their loyalty to one another by spitting or sharing water. Paul and Jessica, during their time with the Fremen, engage in many rituals that involve water. For example, Paul accepts the water of Jamis's corpse after he kills him. After drinking the water, Paul is baptized into the culture of the Fremen, and he is reborn as a leader in their world. For the Fremen, water and life are the same.One of the themes Frank Herbert uses in the book is religion and power. Religion represents a source of comfort and power throughout the novel. Paul pursues the same goals as Kynes, but uses his religious power over the Fremen as their messiah to gain control of the entire Imperium. Paul possesses mystical abilities that go above and beyond a simple heightened awareness or intelligence, but his clever exploitation of religion is his most powerful advantage. Paul's manipulation of religion and the calculated use of legends contrived by the Bene Gesserit allow him to rise to the position of emperor. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes science-fiction and fantasy."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"all around a good book. by far not better than the lord of the rings. this book had some rather disgusting parts with the barren (and some partickular parts with paul). next to reading the dictionary in the back the freman semed to be the best part of this book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune...Arrakis...Desert Planet...A global atmosphere of no precipitation, yet the planet is the most significant and important of them all.

The book is filled with excellent dialogue, fine word choice, and excellent atmosphere. However, I don't consider it &quot;Science Fiction's Supreme Masterpiece&quot; as the cover says. Don't get me wrong, it was a good book, but I've read better. And after all, this rating system is relative. (Besides, it's not like my opinion will change anything).

As for the book itself, it had been a while since I had read it. Again, Frank Herbert is absolutely amazing in creating the Dune universe...many levels superior to the \\"clever\\" sci-fi\\" prevalent today. My favorite aspect of the Dune series is the contemplation of humans moving toward the Omega Moment, or in other words the process by which humans could evolve in virtual gods. This is a topic that Herbert covered in other non-Dune books that he wrote as well. It is a topic that is more and more discussed even by serious scientists and philosophers in light of discoveries of the epigenome among the fundamental nature of the universe. Herbert was way ahead of his time."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune has been voted the best science fiction novel of all time; I can't disagree with that.

While the first Dune was a Hero's journey, Dune Messiah takes that premise (along with the Messiah) and deconstructs to the fiber of it's being and concept.I felt in the first novel that the world established most of the philosophy and politics, while in Messiah the philosophy and politics come from the characters. Messiah is far more focused on the inter-personal relationships and conflicts of the characters than anything. Most science fiction would, but most of the focuse on wars and battles that are established to be happending in the universe.Here we do not personally see them, but feel the effects that the characters go through because of them. We see some personal questions and the some tough ideas explored through Paul and nearly everyone else involved.Dune Messiah is a character driven work that is greatly complex. I needed to take a break from the Dune series after reading it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I will start this review by telling you who I do not recommend this book too. I do not recommend this book if you are look for a light, easy time waster, a book just to relax. Dune is a book that requires not just your full attention, but your full mind.Set on the desert planet Arrakis (Dune), a fifteen year boy boy named Paul, accompanies his father, a duke, to the new world to supervise the cultivating of the addictive spice Melange.This is an extremely brief summary of the incredibly complex book and plot.One of the things that impressed me most about Dune was the world building. Everything works to make this world, nothing is added just for the sake of feeling 'exotic' or 'cool'. Everything works together in order to make this world seem so whole and unto itself. One thing about Sci-fi is that it can easily be dated by advances in technology, but Dune does not feel dated. I feel it could have been easily written today in the same form. That is how good the world building is. I cannot recall being pulled out of it for a moment.I think i large part of it is the focus of politics and philosophy also keep it from being dated. Since so much of it revenant to us, especially the commentary on the interplay of religion and politics. Some of the quotes and lined made me pause and just think about them and their place in the contemporary world. The only other author that has ever made me do that is Orwell.If you are looking for a book that can be considered 'brain food' and challenging to you, then pick up a copy."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I still have my well-thumbed copy of Dune from when I first read it in the eighties. The first installment of the epic series grabbed hold of my imagination in a way few science fiction books ever had.The series is fantastically detailed, but the power of Frank Herbert is in his grasp of the esoteric, the mystical, and the way he weaves it into the world that is Dune.This is more than just a timeworn story of a noble child caught in a dynastic fight between houses--this is a story of a boy grappling with a supernatural destiny, with no way of escaping from it. Herbert brings the character of Paul Atreides to life against a panoply of supporting characters. All very well done and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"God characters ruin stories. Since Paul is the prototypical god character, he can ruin a good plot line. If someone is untouchable and perfect, where's the story?This book solves the problem by limiting the scope of Paul's prescience. It also deals with the god character by reminding us of Paul's humanity in a way that I don't think I really like. Paul has a vision he does not like but is unable to avoid it. In the process of trying to avoid this future, he basically destroys himself physically, mentally, and emotionally.One can argue that the universe does this to him, but whether he does it to himself or fate has him locked into personal destruction doesn't matter to me. Either way leads to the dimishing of the Dune franchise.While I like the plot and I love the writing style, I felt like this book set the series in a course that became as inevitable as the vision Paul was trying to avoid. In the first book, philosophy was omnipresent but was beautifully intertwined with the adventure. In this book, we see the philosophical begin to control the story. In each subsequent book, the plot drives the book less and philosophy takes control.I guess the golden path was unavoidable."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I have read the pocket book of Dune and now rereading it on the kindle. I haven't noticed any miss spelled words if any like some kindle book reviews suggest. The book seems to be all there and Dune is a blast to read. Truely a great scifi novel. Occasionaly I think the author gets sentences that just seem to run forever. But they do work. Read aloud with a bit of emotion and it comes to life. The author has several different religions mixed into the story and many great Scifi elements such as desert planet, sand worm, a baron, folded space travel, bene gesserits, and spice and the weirding way. I wish the movie could be redone and include more of the book in it, but I think it would have to be done with models and not CGI to work properly. Some people complain about the individual story lines being too long and too numerous, but I didn't think it was really that difficult to keep track. There are mainly just three being the Emperor, Harkonnen, and Atredies. If you like Scifi, you have to read Dune and kindle version is a very good version. It even has the dictionary in it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"So much has been written about Frank Herbert's \\"Dune\\" in the nearly 50 years since its publication that it's difficult for the modern reader to come at the novel with expectations that are even remotely realistic. As for readers like me -- I've probably read the book half a dozen times by now, if not more -- I'm sometimes not entirely sure what I think of it myself. At times, it can seem very pretentious to me, and there are occasions, when revisiting it, that the precious, overweening dialogue drives me straight up the wall. But when I return to it with an open mind, I re-experience what drove me through it on my first reading: The sense of awe, the marvel of it, the magnificence and ambition of its narrative.\\"Dune\\" truly is an epic novel, not just because it's more than 500 pages long. It's the scope of the book that resonates with readers, I think -- this is a \\"science fiction\\" novel that's also about religion, mysticism, race memory, politics, ecology, warfare and diplomacy. It's a huge book, but it doesn't wander, nor does it get mired down in its many themes.Thankfully, the story is strong, which keeps the book moving. Paul Atreides may or may not be the new messiah, the young man who, according to prophecy, will lead the Fremen of Arrakis to dominate the known Universe. His father, Duke Leto Atreides, is murdered by the Harkonnens -- royal cousins, yes, but also sworn enemies of House Atreides. It falls to Paul to explore the potential of the desert-dwelling Fremen, even as he begins to experience his own powers of prescience and considerable gifts for leadership. Long oppressed by the Harkonnens, the Fremen are only too glad to accept a young leader willing to upend not just the politics of the planet, but of all humanity.Herbert's storytelling genius was matched by his larger vision. Clearly, water-starved Arrakis is a metaphor for our own world's dependance on oil. But it turns out that \\"Dune\\" was literally about water, too -- that is, Herbert realized when he was writing it that water would become, over time, an increasingly precious substance. All you have to do these days to realize he was right is pay attention to the news -- news of droughts, yes, but also water rights being bought up by companies looking to profit at a situation some in our culture see as increasingly alarming.\\"Dune's\\" other great theme -- and warning -- is its exploration at the apparently universal human desire for a messiah-like figure to emerge and provide hope, wisdom and guidance. As \\"Dune\\" reveals, such a desire has its dark side. Paul Atreides transformation into Paul-Maud'dib comes with a terrible price, both to himself and, ultimately, to his people.Fiction writers are supposed to create worlds in which we can immerse ourselves, worlds that seem as real as our own, at least while we are turning those pages. Science fiction writers, especially, have the task of creating entire alternate worlds that nevertheless seem believable, even plausible. While some of the science in \\"Dune\\" is rather \\"soft\\" compared with other novels in the genre, it really doesn't matter. After all these readings, I'm still not exactly sure how, for example, a Guild Heighliner achieves faster-than-light speed, except that it \\"folds\\" space, and requires a navigator who has at least some ability to see into the future. Beyond that, Herbert doesn't offer much in the way of explanation. No worries; you'll be carried along by the author's enthusiastic narrative drive."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This title I beleive is truly mindblowing. I don't often read but from the moment I started reading Dune I could not put it down. Frank Herbert's universe is so real you often find yourself believing the content as real, only reminding yourself later you are reading \\"science fiction\\" in the good old 21st century. The native Fremen of Dune are depicted in such amazing depth with entire historic, spiritual and religious backgrounds. They have they're own language and religion stemming from their native planet, and all explanations of this flow so logically and realistically.All characters, populations, places and events get the same treatment, and as you delve further through the Dune novels only then do you realise how truly epic and powerful Herbert's vision is, from entire population level events to the intricate spirituality within the minds of his characters.This book is not about anything in particular, a friends words were \\"It's about life.\\" Mind enhancing ..., spritituality, religion, genetic manipulation, technology, love, death are all delved into. You will find yourself asking \\"what if?\\", if only a fraction of Herbert's imagination was possible in the future.Read this book. You will only gain insight."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"There are a few essential titles any self-respected science fiction aficionado ought to, if not hold in one's collection, at least read for the sheer pleasure such endeavor rewards the reader. This being said, I believe it is safe to say that Frank Herbert's brilliant &quot;Dune&quot; is one of such mentioned worthy books.The distant beginning of a legendary saga spawning thousands upon thousands of years, &quot;Dune&quot; (along with many other worthy titles such as &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; and &quot;Stranger in a strange land&quot;, among many others) set the landmark for modern science fiction to follow its current course of action. It is not secure to say science fiction today would be like it currently is had &quot;Dune&quot; never been written. Even though the influence is not as direct as one might be tempted to believe, the influence is in there. Not only has &quot;Dune&quot; inspired science fiction on its literary form, but in entertainment as well. Videogames such as &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; and &quot;Xenogears&quot; (Both by Squaresoft) have plot elements straight from &quot;Dune&quot;.Set in the distant Arrakis, also known as Dune, this book tells the story of Paul Atreides, a young gifted boy destined to one day hold his father's position of Duke of House Atreides somewhere in the future on the planet Caladan. The apparent tranquility ruling upon House Atreides is disturbed when, by order of the Emperor, House Atreides is ordered to take ownership of Arrakis, a place once held by the dreaded Harkonens, mortal enemies of the Atreides for generations. Arrakis, the most precious and important place in the whole of the Universe, is the sole source of the awareness enhancement drug that enables space travel, and anyone who controls it, controls the entirety of the Galactic Civilization. But forces beyond the Atreides' control mark the terrible destiny of the House, setting its unavoidable demise. Paul soon discovers how these events might play a very significant role in his life and the fate of the entire Universe, a role so intrinsic and complex, that a complete religious/social movement was started generations before Paul's birth, all of it carefully planed for its day to come.An amazing and complex story that is sure to glue you to your seat. Do not worry if you do not understand, or even like it the first time you read it; this book is of those you need to read again to fully appreciate it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The first novel ( Dune) was full of the contradictions surging from the meeting of several worlds, several philosophies and several ways of looking at the world. The Atreides are an old feudal people based on honor and self-inspired justice and righteousness. They have to free the planet of Dune of the fascistic, rotten, decaying, bloody and cruel dictatorship of the Harkonnen. They do it by sealing an alliance with the Fremen, the men of the desert. And doing that Paul, the heir of the family, creates a new religion, a new way of looking at the world, a new philosophy. In this second volume this philosophy finds its full realisation because Paul has to choose between two survivals. First he himself has to survive through death and he does it by willing to the world a pair of heirs who have all the prescient powers he had and all the rectitude the Fremen had given him. By doing that he manages to destroy the conspiration against his power and to provide his Empirium with a new generation of leaders. ...he is blind, he does not have any vision any more, so he has to give himself away to the sand worm in the desert and to become part of the whole planet, part of the whole universe. He steps into this track without any hesitation and becomes a roaming saint inspiring the whole Empirium with the philosophy of melding oneself into Nature, into natural ways, the ways of eternal Nature, this eternal Nature humans or other thinking beings can try to pervert but that always regains the upper hand. This is Fremen philosophy, and Herbert shows this choice in depth, with emotion and feeling, with passion and sensuality, with the force and strength of a new faith, the faith in the future that comes all by itself, provided there is a visionary mind that can deliver it to itself, deliver this future of Nature to Nature itself, that can deliver Mother Nature to Mother Nature herself. And this delivering becomes a crisscrossing crossroads of meanings between giving life and birth, bringing the goods of the promise, and freeing the real energy and potentiality of Nature. Herbert adds to that a marvelous sense of details that demultiplies the meaning and creates a phenomenal suspense, a fascinating interweaving of twists and surprises in the fabric of this tale. ..."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"If you are intimidated by what you've heard about Dune, pay it no mind. Never before, even in the works of Tolkien has such a detailed and intricate world been created within the pages of the book. Arrakis and the world surrounding it is as real as our own as told through the cryptic yet poetic words of author Frank Herbert.So much can be said for what this book symbolizes. Not only does it take modern religions and translate them to the 110th century, not only does it argue philosophically with the nature of war, not only does it show fascism, communism, oligarchism and democracy in truly creative lights, but it also is one of the greatest adventure stories ever written. Paul and Jessica's journey through the desert (and eventually the Fremen way of life) will keep you interested the whole way through. It is a page turner until the very last page.Pick up the original Dune - and when you're done with that, read the next two. The three after that aren't for all tastes, but they too enrich the original even further (as do the prequels). And whatever you do - DON'T watch that god-awful 1984 movie version. If you really must watch one before you read the book, pick up the DVD of the 2000 Sci-fi miniseries.

In reading Dune, I recalled an interesting much earlier short story by Herbert that shows his interest in human nature and political intrigue. Written in the 50's, a full ten years before Dune, it shows his fascination with these themes can be traced at least back till then. Entitled &quot;Cease Fire!,&quot; it is about a time in the future when weapons based on conventional high explosives become obsolete because they can now be detonated remotely by a revolutionary new invention. This basically throws warfare back into the Middle Ages. At the very end of the book, someone hands the main character an old book, saying that this is what warfare will be based on from now on. He looks at the book, and it is Machiavelli's &quot;The Prince.&quot;I found this sort of interesting given the important place psychological warfare, political intrigue, and human psychology in general occupy in Dune. Obviously Herbert had been thinking about these issues for some time before writing the book, in addition to the novel's important ecological themes."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I picked up a dusty copy of Dune off of a ill-used fiction section in my school library back in 6th grade.

It is the sequel one of the greatest novels of all time. Messiah failed to keep pace and continuity with the climatic and geograph pretense of the planet. Politics and religion showed strong potential for a monumental struggle, but didn't really collide as I figured they had to. The role of Paul seemed to be a bit misguided and without a positive stand for or against his sister's corruption. The marriage to Alia showed the farce of power that Paul had to escape. All in all, the themes of this book had to live up to the original but stand up on its own, which it failed to do."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I read this first a few years ago. Like eight or nine. I've reread it a couple of times and found that the sense of wonder elicited by Herbert's vivid prose and attention to detail is stunning. This is coupled with profound thoughts and a story that is unparalleled in this reader's experience w/fiction in terms of its complexity, yet remains clear enough to let the reader know the author's not forgotten us, that Herbert wants us in this world, not just observers of it. All this and an amazing couple of plots, plus jaw-dropping scale (read 'epic cubed') make this book a thoroughly, even stunningly engaging book and one of the few that are worth reading multiple times."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I'am a science-fiction fan and I have read lots of very good books, but Dune is by far the best. I have never read such a good book. It has everything : Action, philosophy, psychology, everything is perfect. If I had to choose through my (big) collection of SF books, I would take this one without any hesitation. Really, there is no word to describe how fantastic it is."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"A avid fan of Science Fiction. I started reading the series when I was only ten years old. It changed my life. It taught me a new way of experiencing the world, a new way of living. I'm nineteen now, and this series is still the deepest most meaningful written work I've ever come across. Dune is a piece for everyone. But please, read ALL the books. Too many times I've heard people complain afer reading only the first. It's like using only one of your senses and then deciding that life's not worth living. Read them all, and let them combine to become the greatest work of all time."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Very good book. A lot of action and suspense. Frank Herbert just urges you to read on and on in the book. I've tried the other books in the series but none of them nearly as good. This is the BEST science fiction book I've ever read."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I've read a great deal of science fiction books, and after seeing Dune the movie one evening, my roommate handed me the book. I finished it weeks ago and I'm still flipping through it, absorbing more each time I read something in it. The movie was good, but as usual, the book was fantastic. The degree of depth acheived in a book written in 1965 still has appeal thirty years later. Absolutely fascinating, worth every minute of reading."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"You will find no nine eyed purple Martians attacking planet earth in &quot;Dune&quot;, but human fears and desires in extraordinary circumstances. Deeply psychological, intricate relationships and power plays give this book a unique flavour. I especially liked the separation of a human from an animal by the ability to stand immense pain, and overcome the urge/reflex to withdraw his hand from a &quot;pain box&quot; - i.e. placing the will before the instinct. Do read this book (not once, but several times), and see if you also yearn for the &quot;spice&quot; - that mother of all hallucinogens found only on Dune that allows clairvoyance - among other things."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is a grand tale of the far future, chronicling Paul Atreides' fateful progression from boy to leader. Frank herbert's sweeping saga is closer to Homer and Vergil than to Star Wars. His concepts are brilliantly creative, his setting more real than any painting, his characters subtle. The level of spiritual description and development astounds. Like Aeneas, Paul survives the destruction of his family and home, to grows up among the people of the earth until, like Odysseus, he can finally arise to reclaim what was stolen decades ago. Considered by many to be the best science fiction ever written, Dune is not mere sci-fi but a literary classic which happens to have a sci-fi setting."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Those only familiar with the movie version of &quot;Dune&quot; may at first find it confusing. The critics blasted the movie. It's understandable. Having read the book much later, the movie (short version) leaves many questions unanswered. The long version of the movie is not available on videotape, but may be copied when it is shown on the Disney Channnel. For the most part, the movie tries in vain to follow the essence of the book, but like all literature translated to the screen, always falls short. I recommend reading the book first, then watch the movie. See it several times, and you will see what David Lynch was trying to achieve. It is obvious Lynch was familiar with the later Dune books in order to present the movie version. For example: the Spaceguilder in the movie is somewhat described in the 2nd Dune book: &quot;Dune Messiah&quot;. Critics see a movie only once. This one can't be done in a one-timer."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I read Dune when I was 13 years old. Even then I could recognize its philisophical blend of ecology, politics, the struggle for power, and the quest for a superhuman. The book has a pwerful plot with great characters. I believe Herbert was trying to set up a altered scenario of the role of religion in humanity. However, his fifth and sixth books were not a extension of the scenario but a prediction"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is the book about the reign of Paul and his sister Alia. I think it lacks A LOT of Dunes dense atmosphere. A disapointment. The thoughts and thinkings of the main characters are severly reduced. The plot itself is also not nearly as intriguing as in Dune (I even have some trouble recalling it). Perhaps it would have been preferable that Dune would have remained as a finished work itself? I wouldn't have missed Dune Messiah"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Two families, the Harkonnen and the Atreides, struggles to gain control over the desert planet called Dune.

While DUNE is the best known and the best written story of the series, don't let that stop you from reading the sequel's. Like all good sci-fi, it presents you the customs and attitudes of beings in completely different surroundings that seems to come out of present day situations. The value of commodities is directly related to it's abundance. Here, water covers 2/3 of the planet. How much more value would it hold for us if it were as hard to get as gold or oil? Dune shows us just what life might be like in such a place. This is a definate &quot;must read&quot; if you are a sci-fi fan. Better even than Star Wars"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"It is one of the most favorite sci-fi books in 2nd half of 20th century. I think it ows its popularity to ONLY ONE great idea -- &quot;The less you explain things to a reader, the more interesting it is to read the book&quot;. There is absolutely nothing new in this book except the way F. Herbert is telling about events in the book. It's like he's telling it to a person who actually lives there. The worst books I have ever read, especially sci-fi, just explain TOO MUCH! They make everyone feel like an idiot. What else can I say...? Bravo, Mr.Herbert!="},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Never before have I loved a book so much. Dune iseasily the best science fiction I have ever read and probably ever will. I read Dune and have not gone a single day without my thoughts drifting to the sands of Dune.Frank Herbert has not only managed to tell a story that is unparalleled in detail, but he has done it in such a way that I will never forget the wonderful characters he has created. One can't help but look at the world in a different perspective after having read Dune. It has altered my way of thinking about literature and the untapped potential of the human mind. No books have ever taken such a strong grip on my imagination and buried themselves as deep into my thoughts as the magnificent Dune cycle."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The only story that has ever come close to the Dune Saga's greatness is the Star Wars Trilogy"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"That may seem like a strange heading but the more I read through the book and the more the Fremen characters became important and the saviors of the Dune universe the more I realized that Herbert tapped into the mystique of Islam from a Western vantage point. His use of Islamic/Arabic terms is obvious and intentional and to an untrained ear it adds to the mystique. But behind the terms is a theology that is rooted in Islam. We cheer for the Fremen. From the point of view of Islam, even though Dune's theology is syncretistic and a bit suspect, this is why this faith holds such an appeal. Again, this may sound a bit strange but this was the impression the book left on me.As for the sci-fi component, the universe Mr. Herbert has created is brilliant. It is not grounded in this world or space but is a universe unto itself. His knowledge of desert and the importance of water makes for engaging reading and one imagines the world as quite real and believable.But ultimately I was more drawn to the philosophy/spiritual component and the interest in the Messianic figure as such a figure can be found in all religions and the Islamic view of such a figure matches the Messianic figure here more than it does a Christian, even Jewish, type of figure. This is not an Islamic theology book but this book opened my eyes a bit as to how the early Islamic community may have succeeded and why it has the appeal it does even today. And, it seems to me, Mr. Herbert used this story as a launching pad to insert his idyllic worldview.Why not five stars? It (or I) just ran out of steam at the end. But still one of the best fiction books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I wanted to get this for my 16 year-old son, but refuse to pay the price for the Ebook. I love my e-reader and hope to never buy a traditionally bound book again, but when the Ebook is more costly than a bound book .... Well Amazon just lost a sale.With that said, I think anyone who is an officiando of great Sci-Fi, that has something to say, should read at least the first three Dune books. I personally got burned out after three, but have never forgotten the ones I read and would love to share them with my son."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"[Review written in Dec 2004]It's credentials say it all ... winner of the Hugo and Nebula awards, and widely acclaimed as one of the crowning masterpieces of Science Fiction.Before I begin, the first thing that people need to do is to ignore the exceedingly mediocre and disappointing theatrical movie. The made-for-TV mini-series by the SciFi Channel was marginally better, but still fell well short of the quality and depth of the original books. Readers also need to completely forget (and avoid) the highly mediocre \`fluff' offering by Brian Herbert, who is apparently trying to ride to success on the coat tails of his departed father.That having been said, the Dune Saga (referring to the series as a whole) tells the tale of how an intergalactic empire, stuck for countless centuries in a rut of social and technological stagnation, suddenly reaches a political, military, economic and religious \\"tipping point\\" ... and then suddenly slides headlong into war & chaos, as military alliances, political powers, economic cartels, and secret societies/orders all begin vying desperately for control over the most precious substance in the known universe: The Spice Melange (which extends life, expands consciousness, and makes interstellar travel possible).It's a tremendously complex and sweeping story, pulled off in elegant fashion by a grandmaster writer ... and the amazing thing is that it can be read on so many different levels, and that it touches on so many different branches of academic interest - cult dynamics & religious engineering, philosophy, ecology, eugenics & selective breeding, medical ethics, super intelligence & racial memory, etc ad infinitum.This is not a series to be attempted lightly by casual SciFi day trippers ... this is fairly toothsome, polymathic and intellectually challenging series that lays the burden of keeping up with the sweeping social avalanche(s) underway squarely in the lap of the reader. If you prefer your scifi lite and not too challenging, then you're probably better off avoiding this series, because you won't be happy.Highly recommended - for high brow readers."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I love this book. Reading it now years after first reading it, now in my 40s with a little more wisdom and maturity, it's even richer and more rewarding than ever before.My problem is with the incredibly sloppy text -- riddled with noticeable typos, funky kerning effects, and paste-up errors. Nor have these been fixed since I bought the paperback in the late 80s! The current edition, the \\"20th Anniversary\\" edition...the only thing different is the cover! Nobody took one look inside the text at all!With the advent of computers, it's now even easier to avoid these ridiculous errors, to get the text clean and keep it that way. Perhaps the publishers don't like thinking machines anymore than the Imperium. Fine -- then what about sonny boy? For the luva pete: Brian, bubby...the LEAST you can do take a look back through your father's pages with a red pencil!I swear, if it were THIS book, and my OWN father, I wouldn't let one more day go by until I'd fixed the text. It's a bloody disgrace."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune, by Frank Herbert, is the most fascinating book I have ever read besides The Lord of the Rings trilogy by J.R.R. Tolkien.Dune is about a Royal Family of the Atriedes lineage. The Atriedes House are rivals with the evil House Harkonnen. The Atriedes receive the desert planet of Arrakis, also known as Dune, from the Harkonnens because the Harkonnens want to be in favor with the emporer. After the Atriedes move to Arrakis from their safe homeworld of Caladan, this doesn't come with out cost though. This is when the story starts to get action packed. At this point in the story things start to get complicated.Something about \\"Dune\\" is that it has so much detail. Every thing in the world has it's own name in the \\"Dune\\" universe and is so detailed. However, this means that it takes a while to get into the story and understand everything. New characters are introduced continuously, and the reader thinks \\"Where did you come from?\\". Also, many plot twists add to the confusion. These things make the book harder to understand the first time around, but they make sense looking back at it when it is finished. Dune overall is completely satisfying as a science fiction novel. It's tough to get at times, but hang in there; it is totally worth the read."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Every good thing you've ever heard about this book is true.However -If you're new to the \\"Dune\\" universe, it may initially be difficult for you to get into this. Fair warning - the novel drops you off right in the middle of a set universe and right in the middle of the story, and it may initially be difficult to grasp everything or get into the story.Stick with it! You will not regret it."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Having been a science fiction fan for only a short time, and mostly through the works of Robert A. Heinlein, I felt compelled to read Dune as I considered it my &quot;duty&quot; if I were to repectably describe myself as a Sci-fi fan.What I found in Dune was a richly detailed description of that universe's politics, commerce, warfare, and all the intrigue and scheming that ultimately tie them all together. However, there is at times a tendency toward a sluggishness of plot that can make certain parts of the novel a chore to get through, but it is all rewarded in the end.What was intriguing, however, was that, as a sci-fi novel, Dune pays scant attention to the supposed advanced technology that we 21st-century folk would expect from humans in the year 10,191 A.D. I had expected to find descriptions of how the ornithopters (aircraft that flap their wings like birds) and personal sheild belts (which generate a force-field around the wearer that deflects fast moving projectiles and swift sword swings, but curiously lets in slowly-guided knife thrusts) work, but it seems Herbert expected the reader to take it at his word that such things were as commonplace and therefore as unnoteworthy in the 102nd century as jet aircraft and automatic firearms are in the 21st. I found it curious that warfare in the 102nd century was conducted in much the manner it was in the 13th century, where the soldiers' standard weapons were swords and lances.The story itself revolves around the character Paul Atriedes. At the book's beginning, he is a mere lad of fifteen, heir to his father, the Duke Leto Atriedes. The Atriedes family is ordered by the Emperor to take over the planet Arrakis, a desert planet regarded as a wasteland and valuable only because it is the source of the spice known as Melange, which imparts on its users a form of ESP. The incumbent Noble House on Arrakis, the Harkonnens, are loath to give up a huge source of profits without a fight, and through intrigue and scheming, manage to launch an attack on the newly-arrived Atriedes, killing the Duke Leto and casting Paul and his mother into the desert to die. Paul eventually comes to be the leader of the desert people known as the Fremen, and through his skill and training recovers his rightful place as Duke.WHile this book is widely considered a masterpiece of science fiction writing, I found that the climax felt, well, anti-climactic. There wasn't the feel of tension before the final battle, being built up over several chapters, as was the case in the Lord of the Rings saga, and is this were written as a stand-alone book, it didn't feel like it. In fact, it felt as though it was deliberately setting the reader up for subsequent novels of Paul Atriedes and his Fremen hordes."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I have read this book so many times that I can't even remember the exact number.The reason for my behaviour is not that I don't like to read other books,it is just that every time I read this one I get something new from it.Every page reveals something else and I get the feeling that I am not only readig a very good science fiction book but also a very good philoshopy book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Although not quite on the same scope as the original Dune novel, Dune Messiah is a triumph (and defeat) of the boy grown into a man, grown into an empire, grown into a god. Most notable in the book is the return of Duncan Idaho as a ghola whom becomes a major player in the visions of Paul's future. The dwarf in the story whom was grown along side Duncan in the Atoxl tanks is an interesting twist in the story and you are actually glad when things turn out the way they do for that little menace.The dialogue is long and complex (a necessity for this type of novel) but kept the storyline moving along at a good clip. There is no doubt that I will continue to read the series to its finish. I hope others do the same. May your water mingle with our water."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is not just a &quot;science fiction novel&quot;. It's an incredibly well written piece of literature that addresses political, social, environmental, and religious issues in a way that is enthralling and immediate. It's a book that you can pick up at any stage of your life and find something that speaks to you, and something that profoundly affects you.On one level, it is a political story. Alliances change, traitors bring down great houses, there are plans within plans within plans. It can almost read like a mystery novel, as you figure out why someone did something seemingly illogical, which actually furthered their own interests.On another level it's a story about the things humans hold most dear. The spice, melange, grants some great powers, others long live, and others great wealth. Who should control the spice, how should it be used, how should people profit off of it?This is a story about environmental consequences and the interrelatedness of all things. Dune is a desert planet, where even spit is valuable because of its water content. The scorn of the ruthless holders of the planet for this valuable commodity clashes with the care and concern the natives have for preserving every drop.It's even a story about human relationships. The lead character's mother and father never marry, so that the father might be open to a political alliance. Despite this, they are deeply in love with each other. The son finds himself in the same situation, in love with one woman but for political reasons forced to consider an &quot;alliance of reason&quot; with another. How do these situations affect people?I played in a DuneMUSH for years - a role playing environment where we based characters and plots on the Dune universe. The characters, situations, and plots that Herbert laid out were so well done and complex that it supported hundreds of players through months and months of gameplay without any flagging of interest, and indeed many players found their outlook on life changed by exploring more and more deeply into why this world worked the way it did.Highly, highly recommended."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Frank Herbert's novel 'Dune,' ranks among the great works of fiction and is perhaps the greatest of it's genre. The novel is a subtle but effective weaving together of political intrigue, heart-racing action, intense story, and incredably well-drawn characters. Paul Atredies, the young son of the Duke Leto, and his family are removed from their home world of Calidan to oversee operations on the desert world of Arrakis, or as it is better known, Dune. The story that follows sees Paul grow not only into a man, but into a super-human being capable of destroying the hated enemies of the Atredies, the evil Harkonnen. Herbert's understanding of human nature serves him well in this novel and his concerns about our own ecology are apparent. Like Asimov's 'Foundation,' series and the 'Childe Cycle' of Gorden R. Dickson, Herbert's 'Dune' is a classic of Science Fiction that will ignite any reader's imagination."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book introduced me to a whole new universe. It's quite starnge that it was this book that introduced me to the sci-fi genre, I originally intended on buying a different book, but eventually ended up with Dune. I loved every word of it, the scene is intense and captures your attention. It might not be the easiest of books, but it is one of the best books. It has multiple layers, each time I've read it, I've come across a new layer, each layer has it's own truth. The characters are interesting and even though they act like demi-gods they remain human beings with their own problems they must solve in the bigger hole of their lives. An excelent book, you can clearly feel the level of inteligence behind it, as can you can almost sense the universe in which it occurs.A must read for all."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune Messiah was a bit of a boring and wordy book. It mostly has to do with the rule of Paul Mau'dib and his reign as Emperor over Dune and the universe. Plots to remove him from his position as a godhead are formulated and carried out by people all around. Basically, it was a good story, but dry and boring in comparison to Dune. Read the book if you plan to continue with the Dune Chronicles like I have."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I finished this book in two days, and it wasn't that bad. Dune is still the best so far, but I still got several books to go. It's about how Paul acts as an Emperor and what all happens the time during his rule. This book make me bawl and I mean bawl. Heck, read it and then put an opinion on it. It was boring at the begining but it really did get better."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"As with the other reviewers, I feel obliged to pay Herbert my homage. I read this book 15 years ago, after hesitating over the atrocious book cover illustrated with scenes from the movie. Beware, this work is addictive! I've read the entire series over ten times, and I still find something provoking every time I go back. I'm not religious, so this is probably the closest I'll come to having a bible. The story grabs you, but you go back for the pearls of wisdom, which can and will change your understanding of life. I highly recommend that you read the entire series, the later books will clarify the philosophical assumptions that permeate the entire work."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The only comparable thing to this book is the Lord of the Rings. All that makes them better is that they were consistently good. Dune is awesome, but the sequels had no hope of surpassing its genious. The book itself is exceedingly difficult to read at first, but your mind adjusts to the jargon eventually. The plot is complicated, intricate, and mildly esoteric, yet is very entertaining. Nothing in this book can be explained. Read it for yourself. Your life will be changed after reading this book. Oh, don't go watch the movie first. It's awful. Read the book, then watch the movie, proceed to ridicule the attempt to move this masterpiece to film. There was simply too much for a movie to relay effectively."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"If you are at all a fan of science fiction, you owe it to yourself to read this book. Frank Herbert is a Genius, and the entire Dune series is incredible, but the first book, dune, stands out because it can be enjoyed by anyone for it's sheer drive and originality. A deffinite page turner, everyone should read it at least once."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"When I took on Dune, I was rather skeptical. I had just started to get interested in sci-fi and everyine kept saying to read it, so I did. After the first 16 pages, which were kinda tough, I was hooked. Frank Herbert builds such amazing characters. The plot was confusing at first, but when I got the hang of it, I was utterly fascinated. The Baron gave me chills...Arrakis, with its sandworms and Fremen, is definitely a superior world. I've read the entire series at least three times and I always find something new to marvel at. There is nothing light about these chronicles, let me tell you. If you haven't read it, then, by all means, perpare for the original saga of sci-fi!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"In Dune, Frank Herbert tries hard to craft a complete world by throwing a lot of strange words at the reader, and it doesn't really work. The science and logic is dubious at best (memories passed down through genes, the premise that living in a desert makes people into invincible warriors), etc. As a book of epic battle it is mixed, with the first half done in wonderful detail, but with the climax simply glossed over, the hero's victory seemingly inevitable making description unimportant (or so it seemed to me). The book is poorly paced, to say the least. But what makes Dune a decent book afterall are the characters. The characters are beautifully drawn out, each with their own motivations so that friends are drawn into conflict and enemies drawn together. Dune is by far the best in the series, the other books lacking any real tension, since the protagonist's victory is all but assured from the first page. In Dune, the final outcome is uncertain up until the last moment, and even then there are plenty of unresolved plot lines that leave room for a wonderful (but unrealized) sequel."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"&quot;Dune Messiah,&quot; the second book of the series, shows the &quot;Messiah&quot; (Paul) comparing himself to Hitler. Where Hitler tried killing only one religion: the Jewish religion. But Paul killed some forty religions and billions of people.This book teaches us to be careful whom we choose to be our messiah. Undoubtly, the images left by such superb writings as that of Frank Herbert are forever chiseled in my mind.There is a conspiracy to eliminate Paul and Alia from the throne. The Space Navigator, Eric, with the Superior Mother are part of the conspiracy.The conspirators send the &quot;face changer&quot; to meet with an old guard who is blind. But his son, thru the tune of a flute, sends an encrypted message to the Face Changer that talks about a &quot;loop hole&quot; in the heli pad of the palace where Paul can be assasinated. After that, the Face Changer killed both the old guard and his son.Although everybody thinks of him as dead, Paul survives the atomic attack but becomes blind himself, and drifts into the desert sands.

In a way it was short and sweet. However, the downfall of Messiah, despite the fact that it is more confusing, is that it provides maximum satisfaction only at the end. The whole story seemed like a long set up for the final few pages. It is as if the prophecy was unfolded in few seconds before our eyes after years of waiting for it. In short, the ending is what make Messiah worth reading, Shai-Hulud can shallow the rest.Messiah, doesn't have the same epic feel to it as Dune but is not a disappointing book in any way.

On the surface, it is great Science Fiction, introducing a complex world of intrigue and imagination. On another, it is a religious novel -- a comparison between Catholicism and Islam, and the uniting of both of those religions through a future messiah.

The characters are wonderful(you'll even like the scum-of-the-earth villans). This book was so good that I had to get the rest of the books in the six part series. If you are even interested in sci-fi literature, I say, &quot;Get it! Get it now!&quot;"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The Dune series is the pinnacle of fiction. There are many other examples of fictional worlds within which epic adventures are set--Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and Asimov's The Foundation Series being two such examples. Dune stands above these and all the rest. It is such a classic of science fiction that it requires reading on that basis alone.The first book, Dune, introduces the series and is a true science fiction action adventure. It is a complete story in itself. You can safely undertake reading the first book without feeling you have to read the entire series, but after reading this I'll bet you read the next and the next until you've read them all.The following two books in the series complete the original trilogy and bring a closure of sorts. Sometime later Herbert started writing additional stories to extend the saga forward into the future. He completed three additional books before his premature death to cancer.What makes the Dune books such standouts is the combination of a masterfully woven story with many intricacies and subplots; a complex and richly detailed world; and a philosophical underpinning that ties everything together. It is in the additional three books to the series that the philosophy is explored and developed, and that's why as great as the first book is, the fourth book, God Emperor of Dune is my favorite.I mourned the day that Herbert died, knowing that there would be no more installments in the series. After reading the Dune series many years ago in college I went out and bought most of Herbert's other books. The strange thing is that I would swear someone else wrote them. His other books are mostly B-grade science fiction novels--not terrible, but certainly no hint of the greatness represented in the Dune series. His son Brian Herbert has collaborated on some additional volumes that fill in rather than extend the series, but these do not satisfy the same need for the world to continue. Alas, at least there are these six books to read again..."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is the last review for Yog. You may enjoy his other reviews.I still say that this is the best sf book of all time. It follows a strict formula of action sequences about every 20-30 pages to massage the reason why the reader is reading the book (or at least this reader). And it also provides you with glimpses of the Universal. I don't know how Herbert managed to understand Heidegger better than everyone else (including most literary types), but he did. And Herbert really was influenced by Heidegger, because he names his hero in The Santaroga Barrier Gilbert Dasein. (Also a nod to the classic World of Null-A.) The one problem with the books is that they are so unrelentingly right wing. But that's the sf milieu for you and he did manage to get a lot of money out of it. The only other person who comes close to Herbert is Heinlein in The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress. (It really is a masterwork, working on at least four levels.)There seems to be some confusion in the sf community over mortal or divine status the hero, Paul Atreides. Herbert deliberately wrote his book to make it ambiguous. But (a) Paul really is the Bene Gesserit's Kwisatz Haderach; (b) he is in those mystic nuns' blindspot, like the sun which blinds; (c) he rises to power over the Fremen by the (spectacular and exceptional) coincidence of the Bene Gesserit laying a prophecy into the inhabitants of Arrakis; (d) his sister says that he attains immortality in Dune 2 in his suicide, without any irony; (e) the later Dune books imply that God himself planted the worms on Dune.The way the book works is that by making you connect the dots, you get an insight, you pass a threshold, and suddenly you are Herbert. Herbert attained immortality with this set of books. (See Derrida's Glas where this is laid out in some detail, however opaquely.)I read some of the other reviewers' comments. The one below by a guy named Tozer gets almost everything right. But he gives Herbert five stars only to berate this enthralling classic for everything. Just relax, guy."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune Messiah is definately the conclusion to Dune and SHOULD NOT be read before Dune, as you must first familiarize yourself with all the characters.Despite what others may say, Dune Messiah is not atrocious.

The vividness and completeness of the 'alternate reality' being portayed is staggering. You truly are thrown into another world; given the number of books available, you can 'wallow in it' for quite some time. If you want a break from everyday reality, dive into these books and don't surface until you need food, sleep, etc."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Frank Herbet's Dune is perhaps the best science fiction/fantasy novel that I have ever read. Once you read the first few pages you are hooked! I couldn't put it down. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves sci-fi. Also try ALL his other books they are great too!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Everyone knows Dune is a science fiction classic, but I whole-heartedly recommend it to readers who normally shy away from the genre. Dune is an incredible story that far trancends its genre and I hope anyone who's tempted to dismiss it as just sci-fi will pick it up and give it a try."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Herbert's classic! I won't bore you (like many other reviewers) by telling you an abbreviated version of the story. Just know this: this book is simply amazing. The movies pale in comparison. GET THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I once saw a list of Year 8 recommended reading materials. I am not on the whole a snob, but when I saw 'Dune' listed on this, I thought someone had made a serious mistake. I know people of eighteen years upwards who wouldn't get past the first few pages of this truly outstanding science fiction epic. Although I wasn't so impressed with the numerous sequels, (and don't even bother to watch the film unless you wan't a major distortion of the actual story), in 'Dune', Herbert has created an incredibe world with its entirely different culture. I have never found a flaw with this book, and it stands alone in my humble opinion, as the greatest science fiction story ever written!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is the best hard science fiction novel that I ever read. Frank Herbert's deep understanding of issues range from economics all the way to desert tundra. The center plot of Paul of Atrides measures easily with the epic sagas of antiquity. Majestic heroes, horrendous villains, an exotic environment, terrible wars, court backstabbing, messianic thrills, WHAT MORE CAN YOU ASK?I read it back in College, and after countless SCFI stories this is easily the best one."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"There is no doubting that this book is written in a different style than the original Dune. It is a completion of the original in many ways. The social explorations glanced over in Dune are more deeply explored and this may cause some readers to not appreciate it as much as the first. I have been reading this series at least once a year for many years. I read Dune over 30 years ago and snapped up each sequel as it appeared. There are only a few writers that I compare to Herbert, as well, there are only a few books, and a few series of books that I compare to his work. He is an old friend and I miss him (I never met him). I do not give away plots or give excerpts and I never choose 1 book of a series over another. I stop reading series (like Jordans and Goodkinds works) if they appear drawn out and pointless. That is never a worry with the 6 original Dune books. The Fremen would be proud of Mr. Herbert as he had no sweat on his palms..."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book was ok! if you like fantasy fiction then you will probably like this book, and better yet after you read it you can watch the movie and see everything that happens or you can watch the movie and read the book . whatever that you choose it is your choice but i think you should read dune it is very good book."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Arrakis is a hot and dry place. A place that is full of death and deceit. It is a perfect place for an exciting story to take shape and to enthrall its audience. Frank Herbert's book about Arrakis (Dune), is a great science fiction story. There never seems to be a dull moment while the reader is taken away to this desolate place. The book is entertaining from cover to cover. The book does have a few downfalls though. For one thing, the characters that appear in this story are often hard to follow. The characters seem to jump in and out of the story line and it is hard to keep track of exactly what the character's part in the story is. Another downfall is that the author seems to spend too much time trying to draw a mentsl image for his audience. For example, when the author explains a certain character, he tells his reader everything and more about the character and it gets pretty boring. I seemed to lose concentration when I was reading those boring details and explanations the author provides. Overall though, the book is fun. It is very suspenseful with, something new happening around every sand dune. I highly recommend this books to people who read science fiction. It is a classic."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Although the scope seems limited compared to Dune, there is plenty of intrigue to captivate readers. While not as gripping as Dune itself, Dune Messiah features new faces and new places, as well as old friends. I found it somewhat disjointed to begin but as the final chapters approached and the senarios emerged I couldn't put the book down."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The Dune Chronicles are the most richly imagined, fleshed out books in history. Never before has an alien landscape come alive like Dune has. There is not one facet of life Frank Herbert does not touch on. This book makes one long for the future. Frank Herbert gives us hope that as a race we will survive and, indeed, flourish, beyond our wildest imaginations."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I picked Frank Herbert out of the air for a school author project and I am so glad that I did! The detail of his book Dune led me through the story from beginning to end without any weak spots a reader has to wade through in other books. It is easily readable by any one from high school and up. It's a great book and should be read by anyone wanting to get away from it all without getting away from it all!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune by Frank Herbert 517 pagesPublished by G.P.

There isn't anyone who doesn't like action and excitement."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I have read the entire 6 books 3 times and the last two a few more times just by themselves. For me Dune captures everything that an epic should. I agree with virtually everyone else that the movie shouldn't be seen, however, when I first read Dune at the tender age of 10, I didn't know what was going on and seeing the movie was like a simplified version. Following the movie (which left a lot of unanswered questions and inconsistencies begging an answer) I read the graphic novel which I'm not quite sure helped anymore than the movie as it was an even more simplified version of the film. I embarked on the quest somewhere in the mid-eighties and was absolutely hooked. The first book came and went - I found it answered my questions but also left me feeling ripped off at having one of the greatest novels ever written portrayed so badly - weirding modules - Pah! In its defence however it did give me a mental image to go by when picturing the Harkonnens, the planet Arrakis (or Rakis??) and the almightly sandworms, Shai-Hulud (or Schmai-Gunug from the National Lampoon Novel &quot;Doon&quot; which only a true Dune fan will properly enjoy, and for anyone that hasn't read it - find it because it is hysterical!!) Anyway, the series explained a lot to me. Someone above said you have to THINK about Dune to understand it. I believe reading and re-reading the novels give you fantastic edge it problem solving and clear thinking. The author's views on the manipulation of the masses by the few, about religion and politics sharing the same cart, etc. is absolutely mind-bottling. You cannot help but feel humbled by the experience, and empowered by what FH believes mankind with develop - the mental and physical reckoning that come only come through controled breeding. The sci-fi aside (melange, snadworms etc.) gives us more than a short term view on our life expectancy. We are so consumed by what will happen to own lives in the next decade, our corporations and even our country in the next 50 years even - where is the long term thinking, the planning, the strategy? I might have more to say next time, but it has to be one of the greatest lessons to learn about noble purpose and to live the lives of the Duncans and the Divided God! Well done FH!!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"While Dune was rich in historical and sociological vision (a pun), Dune Messiah is a poorly executed commercial sequel. Readers of Dune can explore age old conflicts based upon wealth, power, and religion. Herbert uses the planet Dune to retell the story of religious incarnation and to explore the conflict between religion and power without the baggage of historical and religious bias. While Dune Messiah promises to continue the brillant story telling of Dune, the characters become one dimensional. Instead of exploring religious conflict, Dune Messiah wastes the time of its readers in living Paul's drug induced hallucinations."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I only read Dune after I had seen the movie (2 hour version) and was overwhelmed! I then proceded to read the rest of the series (6 books) and tape all three (the two, three and four-hour) versions of the movie. The book Dune is one you must read thru at least twice, including the glossary and index before all the ramifications of the 'history' start to become clear (The Butlerian Jihad, for example) and the realizations will change your first impressions, and so you will READ IT AGAIN!! I would love to read a 'prequal' of this series, but alas, for naught. For a great time on a rainy Saturday, get all six, sit down, and read them in order. You will not be disapointed."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"The series of 6 Dune books stand out as the most important works I have ever read. I pity those who have never read all six.

Clarke. The person gallery and scenery is descricbed as beautifull as it can be, much like the Hobbit by J.R.R Tolkien. If any one is interested in SCI-FI, this is the book to read."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I had always heard that Dune Messiah was not supposed to be nearly as good as Dune. I was surprised then at how much I liked Dune Messiah. Though Herbert does not introduce nearly as many ideas or trends that he does in Dune, he does clarify many that he conceived in the original. A worthy read!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Although I had already watched both movie adaptation, I wanted to read this book. It was well worth it. Anyone who gave this novel one star is being dishonest, and I doubt they read the book. If someone didn't enjoy the story they should not give it one star unless the writing it self was poor, and Dune is written well. That is why it won both sci-fi awards for best novel.I really like how more indepth the book is, which is always the case vs a movie adaptation. You learn so much about the characters, their motivations, etc, that the movies do not show.If you have not seen the movies, then the book is going to blow you away. if you like this sort of thing. The last line almost made me cry, and only one book has ever made me cry, and that was Swan's Song. Where the red fern grows came close."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune truely is one of the absolute finest fantasy (and sci-fi) novels ever and subsequently has become a role model for many science fiction works that came after including George Lucas' Star Wars. The complex plot throughout is stunning, how Herbert creates a fantasy world that is so flawless down to every little detail shows how much dedication he took in writing it.The only problem with Dune is--the writing isn't as smooth and easy to read as it should to make this a true masterpiece. Herbert might be capable of creating a plot around his entirely fictional world flawlessly, but Dune is not a fast easy read. Unlike writers like Kurt Vonnegut for example you find large parts of this book are far too wordy, making it at times a slow, and other times, occasionally Dull. Plot events don't just flow from one part to the other. Herbert also has a strange habbit of throwing in far too many obscure vocabulary words into characters dialogue. In descriptions this is actually a blessing, but in all seriousness, who talks like they're reading out of a thesarus in conversation? With better writing this book would be totally flawless. Because of the writing the plot is occasionally cumbersome and jagged, but the ideas behind it are so stunning that the read is certainly worthwhile. Rest assured...if you have ANY bypassing interest in this genre check this out."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"People had been recommending this book to me for years. I had avoided it, convinced it could never stack up to my first epic love, Lord of the Rings. I'd seen bits and pieces of the Dune film here and there on cable, and wasn't impressed. I spotted it in paperback last month at a garage sale for $0.25, finally caved and decided to just read it.I so regret the wasted years! I was engrossed from the first page. Frank Herbert created an amazing and rich universe, complex enough to satisfy this Tolkien fanatic. Plenty of reviews offer synopsis; I will just suggest giving it a chance. I'll be reading the others in the series, and I'll surely be revisiting Book 1 in the future."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is one of those intimidatingly long books that I'd always told myself that I should read but never got around to. What a mistake that was! Despite the length, the pace feels just right, and the characters are absolutely fascinating. The use of a third-person omniscient narrator really allows the reader to appreciate the political intricacies and strategic calculations that each character undertakes. At the completion, I found myself completely surprised that Dune was written in 1965 - it felt much newer and more modern to me. Well worth the effort."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I read it recently when one of my high school students loved it and said, \\"You have to read it!\\" So I did--and loved it. (Thanks, Orion!) Don't know why I didn't just jump on the band wagon decades ago when my friends were reading it, but I'm glad to have read it now. A truly satisfying sci-fi read."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"book was off the hook.i read it like 3 times already. the universe that Herbert created and the way that he writes is based on some reality type stuff. The stilsuits and all of the technology sounds like some stuff you would read in a police issue catalog. Everything is explained in depth and it feels like it could actually exist in real life. The way the Fremen worshiped water and their rituals sounded like something that would happen in real life if I lived on Arrakis. Sixty-four thumbs up even though I dont have that many hands. MUAD DIB MUAD DIB MUAD DIB MUAD DIB!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Buy this in a hardcover edition--you won't be disappointed that you did! A solid and complex read time after time."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This is a fantastic, tremendously influential sci-fi epic. It's a bit long (489 pages, but if you're up for the challenge you'll probably come off rewarded.The thing I like most about this book is that it manages to balance every element of its complex plot. This helps him build suspense and makes him come off as an intelligent, talented writer. Speaking as a budding author myself, I can say that it's hard to do that without having your story collapse on itself. But with Herbert, it gives him a chance to develop his intriguing characters - the messianic Paul and his powerful mother Jessica; the scheming Baron Harkonnen and his evil nephew Feyd-Rautha, and my favorite character, Stilgar, a \\"Fremen\\" nomad. The \\"Fremen\\" characters (a humanoid race) are interesting because they really fall in that extremely gray area of morality that always results in some of the best characters, from Macbeth to Long John Silver.The most interesting things, though, are the innovative ideas Herbert throws into the fold to make his universe seem even more realistic and emphasizes Herbert's imagination. For instance, can you imagine a science-fiction novel without computers? Well, Herbert could, that's for sure. Not to give anything away, but if you're wondering where the idea for Star Trek's Vulcan characters came from, I'm willing to bet Dune inspired it. Similarly, there's his vision of time being as nonlinear as you can imagine. And hey, it's true - time is not a straight line, since the future is so easily changed.On top of all that, the book is VERY descriptive. I know this is a cliche, but I really get the feeling that I'm ON Dune, or wherever other setting Herbert used, on pretty much every page of this book. The art of showing and not telling is a difficult one to perfect, but I'd say Herbert had it perfected. And the dialog is very natural, sometimes with dry humor. You'd be surprised how hard it is to write natural dialog, but again, Herbert pulls through.This is an amazing book. It's the only part of the Dune series I've ever read, but I own the second book and plan on conquering that one, too, and all the rest of the original six. This might be the best book I've ever read, I don't know, but it's certainly up there."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"You have to read this book! When I purchased Dune I expected a good book. What I had was something unimagined! I got addicted to living in the world Frank Herbert created. I became emotionally attached to the characters. Actually I became depressed when I finished reading it.Dune is about love and feud, treason and loyalty, fear and courage, politics and religion it's about life. Most surprisingly, in Dune you can see how myth is actually reality but viewed from the outside.The world and the characters Frank Herbert created were just too real. Actually while reading this book you forget that this is all the imagination of Frank Herbert! The way that Frank Herbert writes, the style, the logic, the details are just surprising. Even if you are not a science fiction fan, read this book; just forget about the fictitious stuff and concentrate on what could be real, you will be amazed.I did not read the sequels and I don't want to. I loved this book and I am afraid to ruin the feelings and memories I have for the characters and for the story by reading the others. However, Herbert has a message he wants to deliver in the rest of the series, but I think I am already aware of it as I read the genesis of Dune. I think each person will love this book in his own way. Extremely Recommended!"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"An anomaly for me.

Not only one of the greatest science fiction stories ever written but a novel destined to be considered one of mankinds greatest literary achievements. It is not hyberbole to compare &quot;Dune&quot; to the greatest works of any writer in history, including Shakespeare. Herbert breathes life into his characters and their surroundings making them vivid and unforgettable, effortlessly transporting the reader into another world. You will feel the hot sand beneath your feet and see the majesty of the sand worms as you read the pages of this work of genius."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Very complex, but I like that. I felt that it lost something after the second book... but I kept reading and realised the merits of each book were great, yet different. Within the Dune books, thousands of years pass, yet, if you give it the chance, each book is as intelligent and &quot;must finish&quot; as the previous.

( Yes, well, the BASIC story plot is the same, but that's different :c) ) I've saw the movie after I played the game &quot;Dune II&quot; and that kind of discouraged me from reading the book. I read the book anyways, though, and found that it was nothing like the movie. In fact, it was better. Much, much better.

I first read it when I was 11 years old and have probably re-read it at least 15 times over the years. Re-reading Dune is like hooking up with an old friend. From the very first I was fascinated with the universe created by Frank Herbert. The characters are vivid, the story is complex - filled with politics, intrigue, betrayal and redemption - a vast story set in a rich universe.I've always been fond of superhero stories and Paul Atreides is an archetypal classic. Guided by an unusual childhood education, trained by skilled and experienced mentors, he is thrust into circumstances beyond his control over which he ultimately prevails. Paul has learned many skills of body control, martial and social arts - but he is also the product of a multi-generational breeding program designed to produce a being more powerful than any in the universe. To the chagrin of the Bene Gesserit, the chaperones of the breeding program, Paul shows up a generation too early and throws off their plans. Paul's powers along with his acceptance by and ultimate leadership of the Fremen desert people carry him to victory over the enemies that killed his father and stole his birthright.There are many images and characters from this book that I still carry with me - Sandworms, ornithopters, stilsuits, Paul, Gurney Halleck, Thufir Hawat, Duncan Idaho, Stilgar, the quotations at the beginning of each chapter, mentats, the Bene Gesserit, Ix, Leto, Jessica, Alia, The Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, Baron Harkonnen, the gom jabbar, the Sardauker, the fremen, melange, the planet Arrakis, the list goes on and on.What a fantastic story.

Written as a prophecy (see first page), it really makes you wonder if his writing is an analogy of the present, or an irrefutable message from the future that goes to show time repeats itself."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"A brilliant book by a brilliant writer. Frank Herbert had an unique ability to write in an interesting, compelling and thought provoking way about complex human social issues such as religion, philosophy, politics, love, warfare, ecology, and power (and the eternal abuse of power). Dune has it all and more. The characters are real and believable and all too human (warts and all). Treachery, deceit, honor, sacrifice, heroes and villians. It's all there, in Mr. Herbert's fine prose, set in the stunningly harsh and brutal realities of the planet Arrakis. I've read all of Frank Herbert's books, and without a doubt, Dune is the pinnacle of Mr. Herbert's creative powers. I highly suggest reading the whole Dune series. But, if you're only going to read one, read Dune. It's the first and the best. This book is a must have on any self-respecting sci-fi fan's bookshelf. Dune is literally a masterpiece of science fiction."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Cuando un amigo me recomendo leer DUNE, yo no sabia que este libro lograria impactarme tanto. Yo lo unico que conocia de DUNE era la pelicula , pero al leer el libro me di cuenta de que cualquier libro de ciencia ficcion queda chico al lado de este."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"dune is one of the best books ever written it is a must read book i have read and reread it many times it is captivating and beliveable.it is clearly a true piece of literature.only one book could equal and that is JRR Tolkiens middle-earth"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book was disiponting with Paul as emporer he was to powerful and he did not do much himself it was more ploys and counter-ploys. With not as much done in the book it was like polotics today, boring and uneventful. The idea of him going blind and still being able to see was kinda of tacky and wierd. Do better on the next one."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Outstanding in every aspect! Multiple storylines and all charaters well developed. Extremely complex weaving of political, religious, economic, social, and ecological themes. Great for even the non scifi reader. Best book I ever read."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Dune is without a doubt one of the all time great masterpieces of science fiction.It is what good science fiction is supposed to be. It shows you a different world consistent in detail and complete down to the dust on the rugs.We expect our world to become more progressive with time and the future to be utopia. What if it regresses to feudalism?When you are supposed to rule worlds, how do you rule ecologies?Dive into Dune and you will see that the answers only beg more and more complex questions and that humans are still the most viscious animal yet encountered in the cosmos."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"Masterpiece! Tackles religion, politics, economics, ecology, with such finese and grace. Truly one never to be trumped. And lets face it, how many time has the world killed for \\"spice\\". Brilliant job Herbert."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"This book Dune Messiah is a great continuation of the Dune Series. This book takes place around 9 years after the first book finished and is again focused on the Main character Paul. There are a few twists and turns through the book and is interesting to see if someone can change their fate. If you knew what the future held with all of the options that were possible, what outcome would you choose?"},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I like the direction Frank Herbert took the Dune series in his first two sequels. This book has a bit more development than the original Dune. We get to learn more about the inner turmoil of Paul, Alia, and then meet the kids. Frank has a way of creating politically exciting twists and power struggles, without making any one character the villain. Paul and Alia in their own ways are both despots and victims. In terms of storyline, I think this brings the story to a satisfying conclusion (I'm not so big a fan of what happens afterChildren of Dune (Dune Chronicles, Book 3)).Frank's writing style can be a bit dense. Sometimes the dialogue is filled with philosophical or nonsensical musings. Some of it is quite deep - but certainly not how people actually talk. It takes some getting used to. I'd recommend only continuing on to this book if you got through the original Dune and liked it.If you liked the books, I highly recommendFrank Herbert's Children of Dune (Sci-Fi TV Miniseries) (Two-Disc DVD Set)- it's a pretty good film adaptation ofDune Messiah (Dune Chronicles)andChildren of Dune (Dune Chronicles, Book 3)."},{"Title":"Dune","review":"I like the direction Frank Herbert took the Dune series in his first two sequels.

I loved the sci-fi setting in the story and all of the futuristic creatures and abilities.
