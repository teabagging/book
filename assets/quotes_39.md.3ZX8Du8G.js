Kaplan never bothers to step outside of mainstream thought, even after being confronted with incredible human suffering and environmental destruction (his method of judging a country's modernity: how many computers and fax machines he sees in the cities). this is the part i found shocking. somebody who has the privilege to see the third world and its horrors and doesn't really stop to think fundamentally for a second. he never questions capitalism or technology for one second. it frightens me that this mindset is so powerful that it can't even be budged with a glimpse of its reality."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"I read this wonderful book 2 years ago, after reading the initial article in the Atlantic Monthly.

I was constantly shocked to read about the extent of enviornmental damage done in the former soviet republics around the Caspian Sea. This book full of mind boggling statistics and engaing anecdotes but lacking in answers, suggestions or hope. This book left me wishing the mainstream press would spend more time on some of the topics covered by Kaplan.

I bought the book hoping to get a brief review of some remote corners of the world, and to some extent I did, but too many chapters seemed to be about dirty toilets in Uzbekistan. Some chapters, such as Iran, were very informative though too many others lack focus. Every now and then I buy a book (sight-unseen of course) from amazon.com that I know I would have never bought if I could have leafed through it in a store. This was one."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"Robert Kaplan sought to achieve a rather ambitious aim when he set out to research and write this book; he wanted to find a new paradigm to understand the early decades of the 21st century. Kaplan noted that some experts focused on the effects of overpopulation and environmental degradation as the dominant forces (particularly in the developing world), while others spoke of a \\"new anarchy\\" (such as former UN secretary-general Perez de Cuellar, he and others noting that of the eighty wars between 1945 and 1995, forty-six were either civil wars or guerilla insurgencies). In 1993, forty-two countries were involved in major conflicts and thirty-seven others were suffering some lesser form of political violence (sixty-five of these seventy-nine nations were in the developing world). Kaplan journeyed through sub-Saharan West Africa from Guinea to Togo and through Egypt, Turkey, Iran, former Soviet Central Asia, Pakistan, India, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia in his research for the book.He found a predictably bleak situation in Africa. While 13 percent of the human race lives in Africa, they contribute only 1.2 percent of the world's gross domestic product. Crime - particularly violent crime - is soaring in much of Africa; for a time the United States suspended direct flights from the U.S. to Lagos, Nigeria due to the rampant violent crime at the terminal and nearby, the first time any such embargo had occurred for non-political and non-terrorist reasons. Soaring malaria in Africa is intensifying the spread of AIDS (as malaria can result in anemia, which requires blood transfusions), just as AIDS and tuberculosis are helping each other's spread.As bad as the economy, crime, and disease in Africa are though, Kaplan believes the real problem in sub-Saharan Africa is too-rapid urbanization, a problem he comes to again and again in the book. Festering \\"bush-slums\\" that appear on few maps border many African cities, where relatively prosperous cities end up being \\"slum-magnets for an emptying countryside.\\" He visited several such slums in Ivory Coast and elsewhere in West Africa, many packed with migrants from Mali, Niger, and elsewhere (50% of the population of the Ivory Coast is now non-Ivorian). The native forest culture of Africa, however primitive, was being destroyed by soaring birthrates, alcohol, cheap guns, and extremely dense concentrations of humanity in slums that lacked any stabilizing and unifying government or culture. Though he does not believe this to be the only factor in the bloody conflicts in Liberia and elsewhere, he does believe it to be a dominant one.Though not leading to the level of social breakdown as seen in Africa, rapidly growing cities - packed with peasants drawn in from the countryside - was a dominant feature in other nations he found as well. China, while touted at the time of writing as having a 14 per cent growth rate, really meant that coastal China was growing; this growth did not apply to inland China (and also could be said to favor the cities and not the countryside), leading to a mass migration from the countryside. Migration to shantytowns in Pakistan is tremendous, owing in large part to a skyrocketing population rate (only 9 percent of Pakistani women use contraceptives and the population of Pakistan is close to doubling every twenty years), a situation leading to empty villages and a poorly urbanized peasantry that cities are unable to cope with.Kaplan found similar problems in Egypt, where urban poverty and newly urbanized peasants, threatened with the loss of traditions, the government unable to help them, with basic services like water and electricity breaking down, having found something to turn to; Islam. Islam is thriving in a time of unregulated urbanization and internal and external refugee migrations. With increasingly militant Islamic Egyptians turning against Christian Arabs (both Coptic Christians, who like the Lebanese Kaplan met in West Africa and the Korean grocers of South Los Angeles, formed a \\"middlemen minority\\" in Egypt, as well as the Christian leaders like UN secretary-general Boutros-Ghali who failed to aid Bosnian Muslims) and turning to the Ikhwan el Muslimin (Muslim Brotherhood) for social services instead of an increasingly overburdened state, Kaplan sees scarcity and woes of the urbanized peasantry of the shantytowns as the driving force in many ways in Egypt.The growing marriage of Islam and urbanized peasantry was not unique to Egypt. To a somewhat lesser extent Kaplan found a similar process on-going in Turkey, as the Turkish migrants to the gecekondus (literally \\"built in the night;\\" shanty-town houses) on the fringes of Istanbul found more aid from the Islamic Welfare Party in the form of water, coal, and food than from the Turkish government itself. In some areas of western China such as Kashgar, overcrowding, unemployment, and the lack of any real middle class was leading to a Muslim resurgence there among non-ethnic Chinese.So what did Kaplan learn from his travels? He was quite frustrated, and found that the more he traveled the less he felt he knew. Kaplan did grow disgusted with the idea of political \\"science,\\" paraphrasing Tolstoy in _Anna Karenina_ in writing that while successful cultures are in many ways alike, unsuccessful ones fail each in their own way. He did come to the conclusion that nation-states at least in West Africa, the Near East, and Central Asia were weakening. In some cases organizations and entities outside or beyond the state - such as the various Islamic groups in Egypt and Turkey - were starting to fill in the vacuum, while in other, failed states such as Sierra Leone, nothing was taking its place. Borders in some regions, the legacy of long-gone European imperial powers, were becoming less and less important. Laos and Cambodia were in some sense creations of the French, areas that might have long been swallowed by the Chinese, Vietnamese, and Thai and were now being divided up economically if not politically by these countries. I think his firmest conclusion though was that poorly and newly urbanized rural poor flocking to the cities represented the greatest challenge."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"Robert Kaplan has made a name for himslef by combining the page turning, easy-reading style of many (unfortunatley factless) journlists into authoritive accounts of humanity's struggles in the developing world.As he points out throughout \\"To the Ends of the Earth,\\" the authorities that we in the developed world have come to depend and rely upon to inform us and thus provide assistacne to ailing peoples and economies in the world seem to have lost sight of the reasons for their being in places such as Sierra Leone, Iran and Cambodia. From my own travels in the developing world, I have seen that, even more than in the United States or anywhere else in the developed world, foriegn elites can live a rich and privelaged life away from the general populace. This is exactly what has happened among residents of embassies, development projects and expatriate businesses.The result of this distance is the complete inability to understand the complexity of world issues. Our expatriate elite publish well - manicured reports about wrongly subsidized bread prices, backward cultures, governmental authorities reaching totalitarian existences and lazy local workers. Yet, these issues are all analyzed and dealt with as unrealted issues. Kaplan's strength is the insights he gains by travelling on the ground in bush taxis and dusty pensions; he recognizes that these economic, political, cutlural and geogrpahical issues are inextriacbly inked and must be dealth with as such.Kaplan paints an amazingly grim picture of the world's future. From my travels through some of these countries I agree with many of his observations, but despite his efforts to be objective, I find many of his comments to be very quick-handed and made in a very judgemental manner as if he just arrived at the local bus station, fresh after reading his first travel book about the country. Nevertheless, I greatly recommend this book as it reveals the discrepancy in the way the news is covered today and how we must begin to consider third world issues seriously connected to our very being as connected human beings."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"I purchased this book expecting a bit of a travelog having never read Kaplan before. However, to my pleasant surprise, Kaplan gives wonderful insight into a host of socio-economic issues facing the countries he visited. He also never seems to forget to mention the upside of sometimes intolerable living conditions. Although a number of his opinions are derived from his personal experiences, he also sprinkles his commentary with the opinions and thoughts of other authors, researchers and philosophers making for a nice balance. A great read to say the least!"},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"Robert Kaplan is my favorite non-fiction writer. I have read almost everything he has written. This book was the first book of his that I read -- it prompted me to read many more. This author is absolutely brilliant in processing information, making relationships among trends, and communicating them to others. He's also brilliant at survival because he goes to places few would even imagine contemplating. This particularly book is extraordinarily well cited and substantiated with sources."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"Kaplan presents more than a travelogue of some of the most inaccessible places in the world, he also makes a compelling case about why these forgotten pockets need to be of more than passing concern to citizens of developed countries. While the author's characterization of these &quot;frontiers of anarchy&quot; is provocative, his arguments cannot be ignored.This book's first third, which focuses on West Africa, can be profitably read alongside an in-depth study like LIBERIA: PORTRAIT OF A FAILED STATE by John Peter Pham, published by Reed Press, which gives a detailed analysis of the strategic importance that Kaplan ascribes to regional conflicts."},{"Title":"The Ends of the Earth: From Togo to Turkmenistan, from Iran to Cambodia--A Journey to the Frontiers of Anarchy","review":"In this, the best of Kaplan's books, he seeks out the areas undergoing gut-wrenching change in search of broader lessons of the world's future. He travels between Guinea and Togo, mainly by bus, and later travels from Uzbekistan, to western China, to Pakistan by a combination of bus and rail. Other chapters describe his visits to Egypt, Turkey, Iran, India, Thailand, and Indochina, all involving overland journeys through the countryside, not just forays into the national capitals. Kaplan's larger point is that the system of sovereign nations is dissolving and being replaced by a struggle between the world's poor versus the world's well-off. As Kaplan describes the chaos of contrived political entities such as Pakistan, Liberia, and Togo, his arguments are convincing, although he readily acknowledges he chose his itinerary with the intention of demonstrating his point."},{"Title":"Little Angel","review":"Beautiful book of pictures and words.

Fantasy stories that are clearly about things unrelated to the actual birth of Christ are fine as long as they are not promoted as truth.

If you want your kids to know the Truth, especially if they are very young, don't read this to them, and make sure they don't really believe in Santa Clause either, 'cause if they do, then when they find out one day that he is not real, they might wonder if Jesus is real or just a fairy tale too."},{"Title":"Wartorn: Resurrection","review":"The various city-states in the Isthmus have never known wholesale war but that is about to end. The ruler of Felk, Lord Motokin has planned for years to conquer the city- states and become Emperor of the Isthmus. He amassed a large army and trained in his own college a group of powerful wizards who would give that army instant transportation and communications. He places them under the command of a two hundred and fifty year old general remembered in the history books as Dardas the Butcher.The city states of Windal, Callah and Sook fall immediately and the entire population of U'delph are killed, the city leveled to the ground. Although Dardas knows he needs periodic rejuvenation spells from a wizard under Motokin's command, the general is plotting to turn the magician's loyalty towards him. However, there are plans in the works from an assortment of people to stop this madness. One man is raising up a resistance in Callah while the leader of the powerful city-state Petgrad is trying to unite the city states so there's a chance they can win against the horde that is coming for them.This story is told from the perspective of many individuals including a mercenary, a scholar, a collaborator, a resistance fighter and Dardas. Once the reader adjusts to the changing points of view, the transitions between these various viewpoints are smooth and makes for a fascinating reading experience. With the exception of the collaborator and the general who are deliberately made despicable, the audience will like the other characters and feel close to them. That Robert Asprin and Eric Del Carlo can accomplish such a feat is a testament to their tremendous talent.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Wartorn: Resurrection","review":"I am a huge fan of Robert Asprin's, ever since my Uncle handed down the Myth series books.

I found many useful ones and profited from them.Mr. Morris' \\"Dogwatching\\" is a very special book. It is not a traditional \\"How to take care of your Dog\\"; it's constructed as a series of questions & answers including many different topics that neophytes are willing to discover.Some themes are serious as \\"How often do dogs feed?\\", \\"Why dogs pant so much?\\", \\"At what rate do puppies develop?\\" or \\"How does a mother-dog deal with her newborn puppies?\\"Some other chapters focus on rather comic issues, but not less important for will be \\"dog parents\\" as \\"Why do puppies chew slippers?\\" or \\"Why do dogs try to sleep on their owners' bed?\\"Lots of miscellaneous items are discussed in this very short and entertaining book.It really gave me an overall picture of the \\"hows\\" and \\"whys\\" of canine mind and eased my apprehensions.I recommend this book to anyone who's going to raise a puppy. It's also a fun reading for any pet lover and general public.Reviewed by Max Yofre."},{"Title":"Dog Watching","review":"This was the first book on dogs that I read and it set me on a path of discovery that is still going on 30 years later.

My guess from reading this book is that dogs are pretty specialized to guard. And when I take her alerts seriously, it means a lot to her. Also, it makes her calmer in general, so she calls less alerts, so a win all around.People say that this is too old, but I don't think so.

She came late to the cuisine of coastal Veracruz, thinking it too touristy and modern for her taste. But she has come to love the place and opens her book with a culinary driving tour of the region, discussing terrain, local ingredients and the best restaurants. The recipes make plentiful use of seafood, various chilies, corn, beans, tomatoes, citrus and avocado.From Almond Soup to Shrimp Salad to Totonac-Style Beans with Pumpkin Seeds to Shredded Chicken in Blackberry Liqueur Sauce, Zarela insists on fresh herbs, painstaking preparations and the finest ingredients (which she often laments of finding in the U.S.).

To do this, I would like to record not only titles, but what Kathie Coblentz calls &quot;other access points&quot;, which could be the names of authors whose essays appear in a collection, for example. It's also the case that, while you may record several authors for a book, the search function will only find an author in the position in which you entered it, (so you may have to do several separate searches to find all the books on which a particular person's name is listed as author). So this won't save me the trouble of setting up my own database, as I had rather hoped it would.The book is more helpful, with sections on figuring out ways to group books together into categories, how much shelf space you need for each category, a system for numbering shelves so that you can use the software to know where in your collection to find them (more useful if you have the luxury of making these shelves be partially full, so that you just add books to existing space, rather than moving categories around when you add new bookshelves), preservation techniques, and tips for culling the collection.The largest piece in the set is the ring-binder with a number of landscape-oriented brown sheets of paper, for you to print out your booklist. Again, this is probably more useful for the person who wants to lovingly look over the data about their books than for someone who is adding new books all the time and will put such a list out of date regularly.So if you're seriously looking to bring a large set of books under searchable control and are comfortable using software, this is probably underpowered for you. But for the book-lover whose books are treasured objects (someone who collects first editions when they find the ones they want, for instance) and who is comfortable enough with a computer to enter some data and print it out in order to then be able to handle a physical list of their books, this is a nice gift set."},{"Title":"Your Home Library: The Complete System for Organizing, Locating, Referencing, and Maintaining Your Book Collection","review":"According to a recent New York Times article, Kathie Coblentz has a home library she estimates at 3,600 volumes packed into a one-bedroom apartment. As a special collection cataloger for the New York Public Library she has written the book portion of this set (software, book, and binder).Book cataloging software is an iffy proposition. My current collection (20,000+ volumes not counting 1,000+ of graphic novels) is on a computerized database. I tried many off-the shelf products and they all fail in one major aspect or another. Do you want to know what stories are in a particular collection? Do you want to know that the book crosses several genres? (a big thing in romances these days) Do you want ISBNs? searches capable of looking for primary, secondary, tertiary, etc. authors? M. Ahrens suggests software that adds data based on ISBN. But what about all of those books published before the ISBN became a standard in 1970? Value? Edition? Typeface? Binding? A collector is better off thinking about what they want to track in their collection and using a simple database program (Paradox, Access, etc.) or a configurable home inventory program.The binder is designed for printing out a copy of your book inventory (mine changes several times a week thus making a paper record short-lived and wasteful). It is a nice addition for a complete collection (say a complete collection of first editions of a favorite author) but inadequate for any active collection.The book is interesting but seems to apply to a perfect world. If you add to your collection, the idea of shelf numbering may not be something you want to have to keep updating in the database as books move from one shelf to another. Calculating shelf space needed is usually pretty straight forward (but always add at least 30% if you don't want to spend more time moving books than reading them.Of course there are nuggets that cataloging novices may not have thought of and the price is not prohibitive but if you are looking for that final solution to your personal library, this is really just a signpost that can point you into better directions."},{"Title":"Your Home Library: The Complete System for Organizing, Locating, Referencing, and Maintaining Your Book Collection","review":"I bought this off of the New York Public Library website.

First of all, it is difficult to install--this is always a sign of a inferior product: no product that was properly QA'd would be released in such condition. Second of all, the product is just a fancy version of a spreadsheet. I could literally use Excel or MS Access to catalog my books just as well as this software. You actually have to input EVERY piece of data associated with a book. There is no excuse for anyone with an Internet connection to have to manually input book data. I state again: it is very surprising that the New York Public Library would include this product in their stores. It is a major, major rip off and there are far superior cataloging products out there.The product I finaly ended up using is one called Readerware (http://www.readerware.com/). Readerware, for the same amount of money ($40), allows you to scan in the barcodes of your books--the software comes with its own CueCat scanner. Then the software looks up the barcodes you entered, (using the Internet), and updates each barcode with all the available info on the book. I scanned 800+ books in about 4-5 hours. BTW, you can also use Readerware to scan in all of your DVDs and CDs, (you have to pay more to get the full version of Readware that supports books, DVDs, and CDs).Of course, you don't have to take my recommendation to buy \\"Readerware\\", but please don't waste your money on \\"Your Home Library.\\""},{"Title":"Your Home Library: The Complete System for Organizing, Locating, Referencing, and Maintaining Your Book Collection","review":"Unless you're a data-entry maven, the software is worse than useless. Why waste hours of time entering the info for your books, when the technology exists to simply enter the ISBN and get all the relevant data? (see www.bookcrossing.com to see how easy this could be)The &quot;shelf feet&quot; info was somewhat confusing, suggestions for classifying by genre was vague, and the material could have been presented in a much more logical fashion.Layout of the book also lacks...although non-fiction isn't necessarily as compelling as fiction, this really puts me to sleep.There is some good information in here, but overall it is a dissappointment. I am only hoping that it doesn't take potential librarians and turn them off from the whole idea. This book reads like a marian-the-librarian steriotype. Libraries can be vibrant, alive and FUN. This book is none of the above."},{"Title":"Your Home Library: The Complete System for Organizing, Locating, Referencing, and Maintaining Your Book Collection","review":"I spent a fair amount of time looking for something like this last year and couldn't believe there weren't more options.

They could automatically add the information on books you buy from them."},{"Title":"Your Home Library: The Complete System for Organizing, Locating, Referencing, and Maintaining Your Book Collection","review":"Unfortunately I concur with the semtiments of the other reviewers. I ordered the system based on the writeup in the New York Times. At least I can save the $40 price by ordering books from Amazon.com. First, I could not open the CD-ROM, but apparently the program is not useful. Second, book's main virtue is as a general discussion of book cataloguing and organizing, best suited to a collector of fine books rather than someone (like me) who buys too many and needs to find them at home, rather than duplicating an academic library setting. For the basis of my collection's organization I used The Reader's Catalog. It works great because of its index to over 40,000 books, a well thought-out plan, and the convenience of being a paperback book with complete bibiographic data on the books. Why type in an ISBN when they are easily available from Amazon or in a book like the Catalog?"},{"Title":"Your Home Library: The Complete System for Organizing, Locating, Referencing, and Maintaining Your Book Collection","review":"This product has specific fields for the entry of all essential data about a book but is still flexible enough to allow for theentry of information specific to a personal library.

I've been attending for many years and at the recent show in main I was absolutely ecstatic when I saw a dealer with an entire box full of old Judge Dredd and other Fleetway comics that he was selling for .25 cents each...25 cents!!! He was only too pleased to take the $20 bucks I offered him for the full box. I was only too pleased to get some 200 comics for such a paltry sum. In the mid-80's and into the 90's Dredd was one of my favorite characters and I regretfully have not kept up with him in recent years.I was thus very excited to see that Games Workshop's Black Library has been producing Dredd's adventures in novel format for some time. Whiteout is the first book I've read in the series and I will definitely be back for more. Author James Swallow has written a couple of books in the Dredd series as well as other books in the GW family such as Warhamer and Rogue Trooper. The book begins with a shadowy group of scientists and presumably a military commander testing out a deadly new weapon on some mutant gang members. The stealthy weapon performs flawlessly and yet too well with dire consequences.Fast forward a bit to Mega City 1 where Judge Dredd and several other Judges are in the midst of shaking down the residents of a seedy building to send a message to the local perps. A napalm explosion by some would-be terrorists goes off killing them, and providing the distraction that small-time crook Wes Smyth needs to escape the building and the Judges notice. He doesn't get far as the strong arms for a local crime boss catch up with Wes demanding the money he still owes and delivering a brutal warning to come up with the money in 24 hours.Later Dredd and several other judges have come under attack by a group of wreckers, highway bandits who literally set the road on fire. Wes finds himself again caught in the middle of this mess as his own vehicle is destroyed sending him out on foot to scavenge when he comes upon a tipped transport van. In it's cargo hold a single item that Wes quickly procures, recognizing something valuable when he sees it. The van proves a mystery to Dredd. There are no records of the license and registration, and the serial number has been removed on every part on the truck, right down to the light bulbs on the headlights. The truck is removed to headquarters where Tek-Judge Tyler orders it to be disassembled, but when Dredd comes to check on the truck, Tyler finds the droid disassembled it and had it destroyed. But who have the order for the van's destruction? Furthermore, why is a Judge Vedder, a member of the shadowy COE the Covert Operations Establishment, skulking about near Dredd's evidence and what was she doing at the sight of the wrecker attack? Wes has now found something that is sure to turn his life around while Dredd must not only find out what was in the van, but also contend with this covert ops unit who is determined to keep him out of it, even if it means killing the legendary law officer.Swallow maintained all of the thrill-ride action and violence that fans of Dredd have come to love with also showing Dredd's detective side as he works with Judge Tyler who is kind of a high-tech CSI type Judge. Swallow is faithful to the long-time character while giving us a plot that shows Dredd having to rely on his intelligence and instincts as much as his guns and fists. Highly recommended.Review By Tim Janson"},{"Title":"Bishops","review":"Trevor Beeson writes with scholarship and cccasional wit about many Anglican bishops of the 19th and 20th Centuries. The reader gets to know of the inter-relatIonships between the bishops and the Archbishop of York and the Archbishop of Canterbury. As an avowed Anglophile, I found the book fascinating. Those uninterested in the Church Of England should steer clear of the book."},{"Title":"Living Safe in an Unsafe World: The Complete Guide to Family Preparedness","review":"I first borrowed this book from the library and found it so useful I bought it from Amazon. I live in the Washington, D.C. area and felt very unprepared for emergencies in the aftermath of September 11. This guide helps you create a family emergency plan and give you tips on keeping safe in more routine situations. Particularly useful was their suggestion of a disaster supplies kit, which I now have. Some items in the kit were predictable--like a first aid kit, but others were not and make a lot of sense like a NOAA emergency radio, list of key addresses and contacts, extra prescription medications etc. While I don't expect to need it for an evacuation or terrorist emergency, these are supplies I would need in other emergencies from power outtages to storms etc. They recommend that you pack this in a carryall and take with you on trips as well.Also useful was the idea of a family emergency plan--places to meet outside your home in case of an emergency. This would have been very useful on September 11 when all phone and cell phone lines in this area were busy and roads were clogged while people didn't have alternate ways to get home.Other useful topics are in areas such as fire emergency, food related dangers, weather related disasters, dangerous encounters with animals and insects and a great chapter on home related emergencies.I think every home should have a reference book like this one."},{"Title":"Living Safe in an Unsafe World: The Complete Guide to Family Preparedness","review":"In view of recent national events and all the possibilities, this book is a &quot;must-have&quot; for everyone.

I think the title is so appropriate, and the book delivers on that theme."},{"Title":"Living Safe in an Unsafe World: The Complete Guide to Family Preparedness","review":"If you don't own a book like this then buy it.

If you refuse to use perl, which incorporated most of awk, or have to maintain old awk scripts then this is the text. I like the O'Reilly text for learning the basics, but after that you need this guide. For some tasks awk is the premier solution, for others, use awk as part of the solution along with perl and a shell script. Still a cool language. And this book is very helpful for both beginning intermediate programmers of awk and advanced users."},{"Title":"The AWK Programming Language","review":"The AWK Programming Language was written very well. The first couple of chapters describe the language and the rest are full of real-world examples. The exercises at the end of each section are very helpful and expand on the examples given. Any one who works with flat data files should be familiar with awk, and this is the book to get the job done."},{"Title":"The AWK Programming Language","review":"While the Nutshell book is more of a reference guide, Aho's shows how to really use the language with practical examples.From basic examples to flatfile reports and using Awk to try out language issues in compiler design.For those who know Awk there are some great ideas in here. For those who are just starting out it's an excellent way to ease yourself into writing Awk scripts.A script writers must have."},{"Title":"The AWK Programming Language","review":"In Unix today, several scripting languages exist: awk, perl, tcl and python. Awk is a small, easy-to-learn, yet powerful programming language, and is language of choice for quick, think- and analyze-on-the-fly tasks. This book is written by the inventors of this wonderful language. It provides an excellent introduction to the language, with many practical examples for day-to-day use. Over many years, it has also served as a good reference to the language. In addition, this book gives concise introduction to numerous fundamental algorithms in computer science (interpreter, calculator, parser, sorting, graph algorithms, ..), which I consult for complex tasks even today.Always a joy to read! Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The AWK Programming Language","review":"I've become a big fan of Awk. Some people may tell you that Awk is outdated and no longer useful; not with other languages such as Perl and Ruby available. Well, Awk does one thing and does it well. It does it \\"fast enough\\" most of the time, and does it with a very small language.Perl and Ruby are fine, but if you lean towards \\"small is beautiful\\", you must learn Awk. For times when you need it, it's a Godsend. I've used it recently to automatically generate SQL insert statements from some flat files and to do automatic code generation for larger languages.Some of the best tools have survived the test of time.In this book, I feel like I learned all the things I need to know about Awk - all the way from beginner to advanced. It's a classic. Not a lot of books get five stars for me. This book fulfills it's goals perfectly, so deserves a perfect rating."},{"Title":"The AWK Programming Language","review":"I found this book to be well written and to the point. I was able to quickly learn the basics. Yet the book is also a valuable reference book covering all facets of the language. I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The AWK Programming Language","review":"This is a wonderful book -- but the price is ridiculous. I purchased a paperback copy of \\"The Awk Programming Language\\" about 15 years ago, and its price was in the $20 range. Times change, and prices go up, but $73 for a 200-page book, even if it is a hardcover, verges on outright theft.Which is a shame, because this is a great book, written by the men who developed the language. In addition to a lengthy tutorial, it contains many examples of sophisticated programs that can be constructed from the simple tools provided by Awk. Anyone who supports computers for a living, whether in the Unix or Windows environment, can find valuable ideas here.But the price: c'mon guys, you've got to be kidding. This book has been in print for 20 years now. You've long since made back the initial costs of publishing it. The authors are famous in computer science circles, and have written many other books. I'm sure they don't need the money. So I have to conclude that this is just a cash cow for the publishers.If you're looking to learn about Awk, and you're on a budget, I would suggest \\"Effective Awk Programming\\" by Arnold Robbins. It's available in PDF form as a free download. If you'd like to support the author, buy a printed copy of the book, as I did. Published by O'Reilly, it's available in paperback at Amazon for about $26.And if you can find a reasonably-priced copy of \\"The Awk Programming Language\\", by all means, grab it. It's a classic. Thanks to the publishers, however, it's a classic that's out of most people's reach."},{"Title":"The AWK Programming Language","review":"When I bought this book in the early 90's, it cost me $20, now it is $84!!!!

Easy to read andunderstand references and examples. As a beginner I was able to startquickly, and now it still makes a fine reference to the finer pointsof using AWK."},{"Title":"The AWK Programming Language","review":"Along with sh, AWK is one of the original scripting languages. Before I learned Perl or any of the newer languages (python, etc), I wrote scripts combining shell and awk. I had a template that I used over and over for combining shell and awk. The book I used to learn AWK and I continuously referred to was this book. The examples cover the cases where you use AWK as a filter or for prototyping. The nicest feature of AWK: it really is a *little* language. It has a couple of precedence issues when reading in a file, but these are explained and the *fix* is shown. Overall, a complete introduction to AWK syntax and idioms, and with many useful examples."},{"Title":"The AWK Programming Language","review":"I second the feeling here, this awk book is the most concise, clear and useful scripting book on unix period with the exception of perl. Its also a job life saver. At work we cant use perl on our unix servers because of management attitudes so awk and sh are the only tools to script with. Become a Unix power scripter with this cool book!"},{"Title":"The AWK Programming Language","review":"Since 1977, I read Computer books in japanese.So, Many English book was trasrated in japanese.But this books is essential one, I need this read again."},{"Title":"The AWK Programming Language","review":"I am torn about this book. My primary complaint is that this book costs so much. Its only a 200 page paper back book. I'm a sucker for classic books though. This text appears to be the original 1988 version by the authors. The actual text of the book is very good and being written by the authors of AWK, provides a certain view on the language and their intent that was well received. I do carry this book with me as a reference which I have found invaluable in my shell scripting endeavors. This book will give you a solid overview of the language. Be prepared for example references to the world of 1988 such as the USSR. Despite my complaints about the price, I have to admit that I enjoy owning this bit of Unix history and having the authors own words about AWK. From a practical standpoint however, I think that you can learn every bit as much about AWK by learning from freely available internet content on GNU/Linux versions of AWK (gawk). Since I have worked with Unix since about 1984, I have to concede being blinded by a bit of nostalgia. However, AWK is still a vital tool for anyone's shell scripting bag of tricks and this book will help you further develop your skills with AWK if you have only used it lightly in the past."},{"Title":"The AWK Programming Language","review":"Chapter 2 of The AWK Programming Language serves as the formal definition of the language, written by its creators. There is no other published standard or official document. So this book is the primary, definitive resource for all issues related to the awk programming language in general. Other awk resources (e.g., the GNU awk manual) should be regarded as secondary and treated as subordinate to The AWK Programming Language. It is especially important for contributors to the Usenet newsgroup comp.lang.awk to bear this in mind when posting general, version-independent information about awk to that newsgroup.Owning this book is a prerequisite to becoming an expert awk programmer. Though there are other resources available for learning awk, both in print and on the Internet, none of them are as succinct and as straighforward as The AWK Programming Language."},{"Title":"The AWK Programming Language","review":"AWK was intended to be an easy-to-learn and easy-to-use tool.

If a problem fits AWK's problem space....there is Nothing better at solving the problem."},{"Title":"The AWK Programming Language","review":"This is an absolute classic which although ancient in Computing years is an absolute gem full of relevance yet.Perhaps there may be a reason within the pages if this book and within the wonders of awk itself to return to a simpler way of just \\"getting things done\\". Maybe I'm just a hopeless devotee to almost everything Brian Kernighan (and his esteemed colleagues) gave to the world of computing over the last forty years.Whether it's the next wave of the web you are potting to invent or if you just want to deduplicate a text file, reading this book will stand you in good stead."},{"Title":"The AWK Programming Language","review":"This is my choice for the answer to the question \\"If you were stranded on a deserted island and you could have only one programming book which book would you choose?\\".

It has an incredible amount of depth for a book of only 200 or so pages. Well-written, concise, with great examples. Truly an enjoyable book to work through."},{"Title":"The AWK Programming Language","review":"This small book is packed with relevant tutorial material and examples about AWK (nawk). Since nawk is the only thing besides KSH which one has available on every UNIX system, it is absolutely essential to have a good handling of it. At many places one is not allowed to use Perl/Tcl/Python, but AWK they cannot take away, because the system needs it. And this book is the only one which presents awk in it's full power. It contains a concise reference at the end, which is very helpful. Although gawk can do more and has a nice book, it is so, that if one can install gawk, one can as well install perl. So I think, that gawk, as far as it can do more than nawk is useless. But it's not useless below, because then one can programm nawk on linux as a preparation to use it on some UNIX server. This is important for the book to choose. Because a gawk book contains many nice things which are not available to the nawk programmer."},{"Title":"The AWK Programming Language","review":"This is a wonderful book about a very handy language.

To this day I still can't find any ecology book like it and none are written so clearly, which is particularly surprising for its age. Elton synthesized many of the traditional natural history observations into ecological concepts that are still adhered to today. Not all of its ideas are original, but his success in emphasizing general themes in ecology surely is unique, especially for the time. He also emphasized the dynamic nature of ecological systems, and cleared distinguished the field of ecology from related fields. Ecology textbooks since then have been more focused on cramming as much information into one book without much concern for overview. Since I have been studying ecology for years, I see how many of the ideas in ecology today were alluded to in Elton's book, and basically ecologists since then have not conceived many revolutionary ideas, instead that have been accumulating data to support the old ones, and expanding concepts when necessary. There is still much to be learned from this book and current trends in the field today follow what Elton predicted or recommended 80 years ago."},{"Title":"The Prince's Dolls: Scandals, Skirmishes and Splendours of the Hussars, 1739-1815","review":"John Mollo has done a remarkable job in &quot;The Prince's Dolls&quot;. He has given his readers an accurate, honest, and colorful picture of the British Army during the Napoleonic era. Mr. Mollo has taken life in the Regiment of Hussars and led us through the grim realities of the Peninsular Wars to Waterloo, in an engaging and readable book. We are taken on a tour through life in the barracks and fighting on the battlefield with dashing and courageous Hussars. We are present at the retreat from Corunna with Sir John Moore; we learn of Lord Paget, the charismatic, confident leader of men and lover of women and of his elopement with Lady Charlotte Wellesley. These are only a few the legendary personalities brought back to life in &quot;The Prince's Dolls&quot;. I found the book fascinating. John Mollo has managed to capture the arrogance, pompousness, swagger, courage, boldness, and passion of the era. All two hundred pages are crammed with interesting information and vignettes about the fascinating people, events, scandals, and skirmishes that have made the Regency one of the most provocative and exciting periods in history. This book would be invaluable to researchers of the era or anyone interested in military history. Well done, John Mollo."},{"Title":"The Prince's Dolls: Scandals, Skirmishes and Splendours of the Hussars, 1739-1815","review":"The men of the Prince of Wales regiment - the 10th Hussars, were the ultimate reflection of the contrasts in Napoleonic Warfare. At once fashionable dandys who dressed in immensely expensive uniforms, but also courageous and daring cavalrymen. John Mollo's history of this regiment covers its beginnings in 1739 until the close of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 although the majority of this history is focussed on the Prince of Wales's involvement in the regiment. While the Prince of Wales poured all his ambitions for military splendour into this regiment he never actually served overseas with them - all his association with them was superficial.The personalities in this regiment were often larger than the regiment itself (no mean feat!) - Beau Brummell, the Prince of Wales himself, Lord Henry Paget (later the Marquess of Anglesey), the Duke of Clarence's illegitimate sons, and Captain Hesse (probably a royal bastard himself). With so many men inextricably linked with highest of the upper-classes there is ample room for a great many wonderfully salacious and scandalous anecdotes which lighten the book. Mollo does not leave it there though, he does a good job in covering all the elements of military life including the regiment's service in the Peninsular War and the general life and discipline for the ranks.It is such a pity that most books, this one included, don't reproduce their illustrations in colour - this one has a number of good pictures, but they are all in black and white. I would certainly recommend reading this book in conjunction with Myerley's recent work &quot;British Military Spectacle&quot; - which examines in much more detail the structure of the army during this period."},{"Title":"Notes from the Country Club","review":"Notes From The Country Club by Kim Wozencraft -- written in 1993, this is a novel about a woman who eventually kills her abusive husband. The book opens with the reader finding her in the psychiatric evaluation section of a Texas jail. For about 2/3s of the book, Wozencraft did a good job of creating characters, a sense of mind and a sense of place. However, about the last 30-40 pages of the book were given over to polemnical-type statements/rants of paragraph-length coming from the characters. It was really tiresome and boring at that point. Part of the problem may be that what was news in 1993 no longer is vis-a-vis battered women. The other problem is stepping away from the character and deciding the reader needed some learnin' and doing it through lecturing the reader."},{"Title":"The Jewish Book of Fables: The Selected Works (Judaic Traditions in Literature, Music, and Art)","review":"Having grown up on the original versions of these fables (Shtaynbarg was often compared to Aesop, La Fontaine, and Krylov) I was looking for an English version for my grandchildren (I even attempted to translate some myself).Professor Leviant's translations capture the spirit of the original and the volume is beautifully illustrated by Dana Craft.The only thing missing (maybe because of copyrights) is the woodcut portrait of Shtaynbarg by Arthur Kolnik, which is the frontispiece to Yiddish editions of the \\"Mesholim.Every library should have this book!"},{"Title":"Master the Act 2001 (Arco Master the ACT Assessment (W/CD))","review":"This is one of the best books I've ever seen!

It is written in Teddy's classic modest style (who else could float the Missouri during spring break up chasing criminals with guns and describe it with as much excitement as buttering toast).It also is a repeat of some of his earlier works as this seems to be a bit of transitional book of when he was about leaving the Elkhorn for the east.The Wilderness Hunter is more poetic and Hunting Trips of a Ranchman is a better read, but the history in this book of how Montana and the Dakotas were made safe by lynch justice makes this one interesting too.The sketches by Remington are wonderfully historic to study and add a great deal to this book.This book though is like all of Teddy's in settling down with a friend and always looking for his next book to find a campfire with him again.Thank God Mr. Roosevelt wrote so many wonderful books."},{"Title":"Ranch life and the hunting-trail","review":"Having misplaced my earlier printing of this book (by the University of Nebraska Press) I ordered the Kessinger Publishing, LLC release of this title, only to be terribly disappointed. The Remington drawings are so poorly reproduced that some appear as blacked-out, scarcely discernable blobs, rather than the wonderful sketches they originally were. This printing appears to be a very poorly-reproduced copy of earlier ones, with much quality lost.

See my reviews. I like true stories about the Old West.I knew some of the famous Theodore Roosevelt's life but this book taught me much about his frontiersman/outdoor life and his being a hunting sportsman. The 187 page book read very well with no boring parts. I read it in 1 1/2 days. Some great B/W drawings and illustrations. A few were a little darker than I would of liked but still good. T Roosevelt was a very good writer and the reader has no problem following the descriptive flow of his writing.I target shoot but don't hunt. I don't put down hunters especially if they use their kills for food. Roosevelt was a very good descriptive writer about the outdoors he loved and hunting. He owned a ranch on both sides of the little Missouri River. A really nice place.We see the hardships he experienced in hot and cold weather. He only had very limited experiences with hostile Indians but had a few experiences with bad white men. A group stole his boat ( the only one on the little Missouri). The group of three is tracked down and captured. Also scenes of men shooting in saloons, etc. Theodore was deep in the tail end of the Wild West.What I really liked was his descriptions of the wild life he hunted, how he stalked them and the difficulties getting a shot. Some of the animals like the White Goat were quite rare. I was extremely interested in his hunting of antelope.We have a small ranch in Oklahoma and the Proghorn Antelope sometimes come right under the barbed wire fence to drink from a very small overflow pond from a holding tank from our windmill. I was sitting on a bench with my Remington 700 .308 with scope on a rest and pointed it at a beautiful Buck Pronghorn Antelope( the same kind of animal T Roosevelt describes in his book). I pulled the trigger on the unloaded rifle and said \\"Bang, if I wanted you I could have you. Too beautiful an animal INMO for me to kill. If I was desperate for food I would though.Back then in the mid to late 1800s in the mid west interior there were no supermarkets to get your hamburger. You got out and shot your game.This is a classic book by a really famous man and a great writer. The vast majority of the time Teddy killed for food while enjoying the sport of hunting. There were a few times in the book he shot a particular trophy just for the trophy. I wasn't too interested or thrilled about that.Anyone interested in the great outdoors of the Old West, great descriptive detail about many different kinds of wildlife, survival, Indians, outlaws/badmen,combating severe weather, ranching and sportsman/hunting will like this book. 4 stars"},{"Title":"Ranch life and the hunting-trail","review":"The reprint publisher appears to have simply photo-copied an original edition, upsizing it to a larger format. The print is large and easy to read, anyway - I don't need my reading glasses. Not sure why they printed it in the larger format - there doesn't seem to be a good reason for it. I was extremely disappointed in the reproduction quality of the Frederic Remington illustrations - the simple line drawings came out OK, but the more complicated pictures are rendered so dark that all detail is lost - some are almost totally black.

Some dog eared pages but still a good buy,"},{"Title":"Ranch life and the hunting-trail","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite books which I also appreciate for its historical value, having been written by one of our greatest presidents, yet before he became a national political figure. Reading Roosevelt's own words is pure pleasure.Some people say the \\"Wild West\\" is simply a Hollywood concoction; that is never happened. It did happen--it just didn't last much longer than a decade. After the virtual eradication of the Indians and buffalo, they were replaced by cowboys and cattle. The cowboys were needed to keep the cattle together and steer them always toward fresh, safe grazing, away from other outfits, in a completely unfenced Western frontier. In only a few short years, however, the lands were claimed by wealthy cattlemen, fenced, and became ranches. The cattle could no longer wander off, and so really the cowboys became ranch hands, and the West began to lose it wildness.Roosevelt was there on the Great Plains directly after the Indians and buffalo were removed, and before the fencing was accomplished. He greatly admired, and perhaps romanticized the cowboy life, but he wrote a first-hand account of that life, persuading his friend the great Frederic Remington to accompany it with what have become many of our most-loved classic Western illustrations and paintings.The account of his venturing out into the Dakota winter to bring a band of common thieves to justice is rather mind-blowing, when you consider how our history would have been altered had he died during this escapade, which he easily could have.Roosevelt was also a keen observer of nature, which is actually what true sportsmanship is about. Seeing--for himself--wild animals and birds in their pristine natural habitats brought joy to his soul. Along with earning the respect of the cowboys he so admired, living the ranch life and riding the hunting trail also healed his heart--broken at the deaths of his wife and his mother--enabling him to go on and lead the United States into the 20th century with such foresight that it can truly be called The American Century."},{"Title":"Ranch life and the hunting-trail","review":"What a great book - too bad the reproduction in this hardcover is not so good.

Those who take the time to read its contents, however, will be unable to avoid rethinking and reconsidering their long-held assumptions concerning the teachings of scripture and its impact on Western culture's view of morality."},{"Title":"More Steve Allen on the Bible, Religion and Morality (More Steve Allen on the Bible, Religion & Morality)","review":"This book helped me a lot. Steve Allen is not afraid to discuss the problems with the Bible. He especially made clear that Revelations (Apocalypse) is not really very clear. I never did understand Revelations, but I thought maybe I was missing something, since Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins had made such a big deal with their &quot;Left Behind&quot; series. Allen straightens all that out: basically, what he says, we really can't pay much attention to Revelations, because it really can't be understood, the author is really not known, and so forth.Allen's basic approach is that God, as an omnipotent, omniscient power, could not have had much to do with the Bible, because the Bible has so many contradictions, errors, descriptions of revenge instigated by God or Yahweh. Allen interprets the Bible literally in order to show how it really doesn't hold together.But I think, at least for me, Allen's whole book (I didn't read the first volume) tends to increase my faith in God, the omnipotent, omniscient One, that is. I'll have to look a little closer at our current version (one of many) of the Bible. Diximus."},{"Title":"More Steve Allen on the Bible, Religion and Morality (More Steve Allen on the Bible, Religion & Morality)","review":"Allen's second volume addressing facts, history, and morality in the Bible is interesting and well-written, with an eminently compassionate, reasonable perspective. However, it does contain some noteworthy stumbles in his approach.In addition to numerous mini-essays on morality and the human condition (all thoughtful and well worth reading), Allen takes aim at fundamentalism to expose the flaws and fallacies in fundamentalist reasoning, as illustrated by the Bible itself.However, this is a hit-and-miss endeavor because he attacks fundamentalism on two fronts, only one of which is firmly supported by reason and logic. He addresses aspects of the Bible which can be loosely grouped into two categories: \\"logical impossibilities\\" (such as \\"The earth is flat,\\" \\"You can eat any flying creatures with four legs,\\" \\"This city will be conquered 20 years after it's destroyed\\") and \\"moral impossibilities\\" (\\"God orders the murder of thousands of innocent women and children captives.\\")On the logical impossibilities, Allen is on firm ground: theologians and biblical scholars have long discussed the number of contradictions, scientific and historical errors, and outright falsehoods sprinkled throughout the Bible-which have no effect on its overall moral message, I might add. Even within the framework of the Bible's own statements, many contradictions and impossibilities exist (ranging from counting and name errors to faulty references to other books of the Bible), which Allen addresses in a clear and lucid manner. The fundamentalist perspective has no real recourse but to ignore such blatant discrepancies and pretend the logical flaws and inconsistencies simply don't exist.When he discusses what I call \\"moral impossibilities,\\" however, he enters much shakier territory. These are sections and passages of the Bible in which God is portrayed as so capricious, so unjust, so pointlessly vengeful and violent, that Allen cannot accept this depiction as true; therefore, he concludes, the Bible must contain errors and falsehoods that have portrayed the real, loving, just God incorrectly.In taking this stance, Allen has committed the Argument from Personal Incredulity error (as well as the either-or fallacy of assuming only two possibilities exist). His reasoning boils down to: \\"If the Bible is literally true in these sections, then God is unthinkably awful, and I can't accept that, so the Bible [and the fundamentalists] must be in error.\\"This is one of the weakest attacks on fundamentalism you can make; it is unsupported by the rules of reason or logic, and Allen does no service to the skeptic's cause by framing his argument in this manner. He also ignores other possibilities: For example, the humanist conclusion would be that such a god, if he exists, is not worthy of worship. Other possibilities abound: That God has changed his attitude over time; that God is insane; that God is, in fact, evil, and the *positive* depictions of him are the ones in error; etc., etc.(Allen's reasoning on these points also includes the assumption that *of course* a perfectly wise, just, and compassionate God exists, so any portrayal that shows him to be otherwise must be in error. In other words, Allen is guilty of a little \\"My perspective cannot be contradicted\\" fundamentalism of his own here.)Allen is (was) a talented writer with a strong sense of justice, compassion, and morality. He is on target with his criticisms of the fundamentalist stance that ignore the logical impossibilities of the Bible. He's a clear thinker overall, and bible scholars and skeptics alike would benefit from reading this and his previous book on the subject. However, his take on the \\"moral impossibilities\\" (as he sees them) stems from personal preference, not reason and logic. While I applaud most of his moral and ethical positions, I believe Allen made a serious mistake in pretending that his conclusions about the Bible's moral flaws are as rational and inevitably logical as his criticisms of the logical flaws."},{"Title":"More Steve Allen on the Bible, Religion and Morality (More Steve Allen on the Bible, Religion & Morality)","review":"My respect and admiration for Steve Allen the comedian, creator of the Tonight Show and \\"What's My Line?\\" panelist is limitless. And so is my contempt for his attempt to masquerade as a Biblical scholar and pass his drivel off as something to take seriously.Allen's whole problem stems from the fact that he thinks he can understand God and how He was worked through history through the rationalist/Enlightenment lens of modern man. He in short, presumes that he, like so many others who do not want to accept the truth of God's word as it has been revealed, can presume to judge God through the limited capacity of the human mind which is ultimately the greatest exercise in arrogance I think anyone can presume to do.I find it strange that Allen would say that his discourses do not presume a belief that God does not exist. But to borrow a page from the greatest defender of orthodox Christianity, C.S. Lewis, this is a simply illogical position to take. If one presumes that there is a God who has created the universe and is a real presence, then it is illogical to think that God is capricious enough to prevent His Word and His message from being revealed clearly to man. This is the supreme irony because in arguing that a literalist view of God makes Him somehow capricious because the Old Testament enemies of the Hebrews are smote down on occasion, then I would submit that if no clear view of God has emerged until the perspective of post-18th century Enlightenment humanists, that is by far an even greater mark of a God engaging in a malicious game with humanity, and thus, renders his whole framework ridiculous.Steve, may you Rest in Peace (though I fear with approaches like this to Scripture that may be a forlorn hope of mine), and God bless you for the rich creative legacy you left us in television and comedy, but these forays into something you had not a whit of competence in, ultimately besmirches your otherwise great resume. Such a pity.One note to the gentleman above who chose to attack me personally rather than look for virtue in this silly book. I *am* a history teacher and have taught so at Wheaton College and Joliet Junior College in Illinois for over five years. So much for your vaunted skills of objectivity. My POV is that this is a rotten book written by someone who was in over his head on a subject he knew little about and who had no more business writing a book on the Bible than I as a history teacher have writing a book on nuclear physics.

Secondly, very much badly organized and scattered in terms of argumentation. It gets sometimes very hard to follow the author's points. Thirdly, the main theme is in no way can be taken as more than an intellectual exercise of an intellectual pop star. The idea that chiristianity has a hard kernel which grasps the real human condition (the split inherent in the subject) is not even a pseudo-marxist or pseudo-lacanian view. What lacan borrows from Hegel's dialectic, his concept of divided self or marxist analysis of history is not in any way in conformity with chiristian idea of fall of man or the idea of trinity as such as the book puts forward. It just seems to be the cultural prejudice of a man from post-communist Balkans who has very litle real say in postmodern era but repeats very old euro-centrist teological stuff.

So I'll keep it brief: Yes, the rambling style can be distracting as well as entertaining when he gets it right.The book is not so much about Christianity as it is about what Zizek claims to be the very core of it, where there is another dimension. And in discussing the core as such, the book takes off as a reading of the symbolic structure (Lacanian) that made it possible for the transition from Judaic Law to Christian Love; and St. Paul's role in it. Jesus' \\"Father why hast thou forsaken me?\\" is one of the loci of Zizek's defense of the \\"ex-timate\\" kernel of Christianity: 'Imitatio Christi' as sharing Jesus' own doubt -- not of God's existence but rather of His Impotence. And after taking some very general swipes at Buddhism for (supposedly) aiming for that state (Nirvana) in which all differences are leveled, Zizek presents the genius of Christianity as the religion of Difference in which the very separation between God and Man is God-as-Man. Zizek argues against the idea that the Fall and Redemption are polarities but that the Fall IS Redemption, the Opening of the very space of Redemption.The crux of Zizek's \\"argument\\" boils down to what he says in the last page: \\"...It is possible today to redeem this core of Christianity only in the gesture of abandoning the shell of its institutional organization (and even more so, of its specific religious experience). The gap here is irreducible: either one drops the religious form, or one maintains the form but lose the essence. This is the ultimate heroic gesture that awaits Christianity: in order to save its treasure, it has to sacrifice itself -- like Christ, who had to die so that Christianity could emerge.\\"The basic attitude of the book is fueled by contempt for opportunistic liberals, academics, and intellectuals, in short, the Last Man, who drinks decaf and jogs to stay fit, and make a habit of demanding the highest ethical ideals from society KNOWING full well society cannot possibly deliver. Zizek's venom is aimed at the fact that this very impossibility allows intellectuals without any real moral commitment to wallow smug their safe, cushy university jobs and still feel good about themselves for having demonstrated a nobler social conscience: A life devoted to speaking dangerously with all the possibility of danger (and caffeine) removed.Zizek's enlistment of G.K.Chesterton -- who was, himself, perverse enough to speak (and very convincingly too!) of the \\"Thrilling Romance of Orthodoxy\\" -- to kick off his argument is a brilliant move and that alone makes this book worth reading.Read this book like it was a clearance sale where everything is 90% off: the only thing is, some very fine finds come attached to a lot of junk you don't need. So, keep the baby and throw out the bath water -- even if you know Zizek can convince you that it's really the bath water you should keep."},{"Title":"The Puppet and the Dwarf: The Perverse Core of Christianity (Short Circuits)","review":"Zizek is a remarkable Lacanian cultural theorist, and his work deserves to be taken seriously; unfortunately, it is beginning to appear as if Zizek doesn't even take his own project seriously. How else can one explain the poor organization and endless series of digressions that constitute this book?Most of Zizek's earlier books (The Sublime Object of Ideology, Looking Awry, etc.) give strong accounts how how Lacanian psychoanalysis can be used to analyze contemporary culture; in these works Zizek is never at a loss to show how pop culture can illustrate difficult concepts. The end result was usually a witty, incisive demystification of conservative capitalist ideology.Unfortunately, &quot;The Puppet and the Dwarf&quot; falls far short of Zizek's past accomplishments. The anecdotes are still there, but they are piled up in a heap with no coherent thread of argument. There are interesting ideas in here about critical negativity in Christianity, but it is far too difficult to discern how Zizek's scattered insights hang together. In the end the reader winds up feeling more like s/he is the object of an intellectual confidence game than anything else.Readers who don't already know Zizek's work are advised to start with earlier texts. Readers who do know Zizek's work should wait for something worthwhile."},{"Title":"The Puppet and the Dwarf: The Perverse Core of Christianity (Short Circuits)","review":"Okay, so what can one say about Zizek?--at times brilliant, infuriating, outrageous...yes, all of the above. If you are looking for the secrets that unfold time and space itself, then, this is not the book for you. But, if you are looking for a fantastic read of applied Lacanian theory on religion and other cultural arenas, then, by all means this book is worth the buy. It is almost getting trite to hear people complain about Zizek's style, analysis, originality, etc...After all, he is only a man. Rather, to focus on the strengths of this book: it does a good job of introducing one to some interesting Lacanian issues, such as the the super-ego, the idea that the Other does not exist, Lacan's interesting thesis that God is not dead but unconscious, just to name a few. Also, many of the jokes that Zizek loves to tell are put into footnotes instead of the body of the text which gives the text more focus. Also, if one has been keeping up with Zizek's interventions into Christianity versus Judaism, then, one may be interested in this book because he does change some of his positions.

Quotes like this make me love Zizek:\\"One commonplace about philosophers today is that their very analysis of the hypocrisy of the dominant system betrays their naivety: why are they still shocked to see people inconsistently violate their professed values when it suits their interests? Do they really expect people to be consistent and principled? Here one should defend authentic philosophers: what surprises them in the exact opposite - not that people do not \\"really believe,\\" and act upon their professed principles, but that people who profess their cynical distance and radical pragmatic opportunism secretly believe much more than they are willing to admit, even if they transpose these beliefs onto (nonexistent) \\"others.\\"\\" Slavoj Zizek, from The Puppet and the Dwarf: The Perverse Core of Christianity, p 8Zizek is fun to read, and in the this book he spikes into the red of the fun meter. Whether you like Lacan, or can even pretend to understand Lacan, Zizek is good at explaining what he thinks Lacan means to express. Besides that, this book tackles a few more topics which make it worth your time - like the victim culture in politics and academia, where the victim is given a privileged position and a sort of super-authority - he sites all kinds of problems with this practice. He also gets into Biblical stuff, walking around the same terrain as Jung did when writing about Job (old-testament story which basically states that there is no personal God), and Jesus's moment of doubt on the Cross.

Is this what happens to you when you read too much Lacan? There are more Christian sects then Trotskyist groupings and Maoists put together, which one should aspiring dialectical materialists join?

This book turned out just right to keep me in the right mindset - what is that exactly? As he says to Paul Taylor (as I recall) - what is important is not that you be convinced of anything he is trying to say. Rather, the style of critical thinking - what some might say rambling but I suspect instead is a result of modern technology presenting us with the opportunity to explore everything and Nothing - all at once. This is a method or process and SZ models it for us at every turn. Here he plays with everything on his mind that will fit in the contexts of a linear thread - imagine if he went to a blog with links! We would go crazy and enjoy every moment of it.

I grew up reading Kierkegaard. I read Barthes, Althusser, and Baudrillard in college. This was my first attempt at Zizek's work. I recall an interview where Zizek went on a late night talk show to discuss this book and told the host that he wrote it specifically for clarity. I do not know whether this was one of his ironic attempts at humor or whether all of his work is as generally impenetrable to the layman as this.The only thing that allowed me to muddle through was a small familiarity with Nancy's Dis-Enclosure (which I've also been muddling through) and some of the thankful redundancies that appeared in their evaluations. The problem was that most of the language used in the book is hedged in stark psychoanalytic terms. Virtually nobody knows or understands these terms. Not even psychology majors are taught them anymore (although one could ostensibly argue that psychology majors aren't really taught anything anymore).I came from an English Criticism background and had a very difficult time with everything and made markedly slow progress in the book. I'm not sure if Zizek's aim was to make Derrida seem like beach-reading, however this almost seems to be the case.What you most likely will be able to take from this book if you are a layman is a grasp of some of the fundamental ironies of Christianity coupled with some poignent anecdotes to flush them out. I don't necessarily trust Zizek's epistemology with regards to his interpretation of scripture, however his observations give one pause.I with I was more equipped to give a better reading and therefore elaborate on whether his psychoanalysis is accurate and bullet-proof or whether it is indeed bunk.

Likewise, there is no reference that Reverend Watson, whom Hurston claims gave her, her last initiation, was ever a practitioner of Hoodoo.Scholars in this area also feel Hurston took experiences in places like Haiti and gave them a US locations, plagiarized some of her material from other authors, and inserted herself into situations that happened earlier and of which she had no part.When all is said, I recommend the book for the folklore it contains, but take the Hoodoo with a grain of salt."},{"Title":"Mules & Men","review":"A friend said I should buy this book. it has roots in it he said.......you might find them entertaining.

In this book she not only becomes part of the African-American culture, but she was originally born into the culture (though not into the specific community she studies). This exemplifies the idea that culture can only be understood within itself and within its own history. In the book Mules and Men, one of Hurston's main objectives is to become one of the southern African-Americans (by gaining acceptance within the specific community), and she certainly achieves it. She records the southern African-American's folk-tales in a way that preserves not only the tale itself, but also the exact linguistics of the language -- grammar, tone, and dialect are all carefully sealed within her literary recordings. Having received her anthropological training from Boas, it is no wonder she sought to record even the grammatical details of the language.Some parts of this book are rather disturbing ethically, because she becomes so deeply involved in the culture she actually participates in rituals that outsiders are not allowed access to. Her role in the community seems to border on the line of deception."},{"Title":"Mules & Men","review":"When I pulled up the inside of this book, it came up as the book, not the review.

The theater world's loss was actually the literary and folklore world's gain, and this book is a terrific study of black folklore from Florida and Louisiana. The book has wonderful folktales and descriptions of rootwork, and once the reader becomes acclimated to Hurston's use of black English, it is a pleasure to read. Hurston provided rich commentary by embedding the texts into a narrative about doing fieldwork in the 1920s. It's worth noting that Hurston compressed the amount of fieldwork time in this book as she had spent much more time in Florida than she presents in this work. It's important to keep these types of literary devices in mind when reading her book as she includes lots of allusions, hidden meanings, and clever wordplays to develop fascinating commentary on folklore."},{"Title":"Mules & Men","review":"I read Zora Neale Hurston's novel \\"Their Eyes are Watching God\\" and wanted to read more. Hurston (1891 -- 1960) had studied anthropology at Barnard with one of the founders of modern anthropology, Franz Boas. With Boas' encouragement and funding from a private source, Hurston travelled South to collect African-American folklore. Her first stop was Eatonville, Florida, an all-black community where Hurston had spent much of her childhood. She then went South to Polk County, Florida and its sawmills and the Everglades. She went further South to Pierce and Lakeland gathering folk materials before heading to New Orleans to study Hoodoo. In 1927, she rented a small house in Eau Gallie, near Melbourne, Florida where she organized her extensive notes. Her book, \\"Mules and Men\\" was published in 1935.\\"Mules and Men\\" is an outstanding source of information about the folk-tales, called \\"lies\\", of rural Southern African-Americans. (Florida was a gathering place for African-Americans throughout the South because of the economic opportunities it offered.) She visited old friends in Eatonville, and won the confidence of people in the other communities she visited. The tales include animal stories (\\"why dogs and cats are enemies\\", \\"how the snake got poison,\\" for example) stories of pre-civil war days involving a slave named \\"Jack\\" and his master, stories of the battle between the sexes, contests between \\"Jack\\" and the devil, bragging contests, and much else. Hurston also collected songs and lyrics, including \\"John Henry\\", sermons, and hoodoo formulas while in New Orleans.But this book is much more than a compilation of folk materials. Hurston brings her material to life by bringing the story-tellers and the communities she visited to life. She writes with deep and obvious affection for the rural African-American communities of the South in the mid-1920s. Hurston's folk-tales are embedded in a fascinating story of their own as she introduces the reader to the small towns, the parties, the sawmills, the jooks, and the life of her story tellers. One of the characters that Hurston befriends is a woman named Big Sweet who lives with a man named Joe. Joe cheats on Big Sweet, and Big Sweet puts Joe right in no uncertain terms. Big Sweet and her enemy, a woman named Lucy, draw knives with potentially fatal consequences in a fight in a jook that involves Zora. Big Sweet is a strong and convincingly drawn character in her own right. The characters and communities in the book were for me even more convincing that the stories.The first part of Mules and Men describes Hurston's collecting of folk tales, while the second, shorter part discusses her experiences with Hoodoo doctors in New Orleans. Hoodoo played a large role in the lives of some African-Americans. I was reminded of Memphis Minnie's blues song \\"Hoodoo Lady\\" and of Muddy Waters' \\"I got my mojo working\\". The founder of Hoodoo was a woman named Marie Leveau. Hurston describes how she gained the confidence of several Hoodoo doctors in New Orleans, received initiation from them, and was in one case asked to stay on as a successor practitioner. Hurston relays Hoodoo spells used to kill an enemy, to make an unwanted person leave town, to get a lover or to get rid of an unwanted lover, and to bring help to those in jail. She recounts the stories of these conjures, of the Hoodoo doctors, and their clients with a great deal of seriousness. I found this section of the book fascinating but troubling and different from the folk-tales and people discussed in the first part of the book.The book is written almost entirely in dialect, but I found it easy to follow as the book progressed. Hurston wrote this book to preserve an important part of African-American culture in the United States and to express her commitment to and love for this culture. She believed this culture had its own strengths and could develop its own course and destiny internally. This is a fascinating, moving book and a thought-provoking picture of one form of the African-American experience in the United States.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"Mules & Men","review":"A fantastic collection by Zora Neale Hurtson. Includes spells, and superstions, witch craft, and some of the best short stories around. She gathers up the urban legends of the 1930-40's rural south and connects you to a culture and way of thinking that is both delightful and intriguing. At times amusing; it is written in the way of oral tradition, where people gather around and tell stories, the more outlandish, the more unique the better. Her work is simply wonderful.

I immediately saw the connection between this and the tales my father and older Blacks told around town, and this led ot my lifelong interest in folklore.This book was actually quite revolutionary. Up to this time, most educated Blalcks scorned the folk culture of their own people and black foklore collections were usually written by whites. While a few (such as Edward CL Adams and Julia Peterkin) got it right, the results were often patronzing at best and racist mockery at worst) as few Blacks of that time would be candid with white folklore collectors.Zora went back to her hometown of Eatonville, Fla to the front porches and juke joints that she knew and got it down right. The tales themselves are very entertaining as is the frame story of her adventures with the locals.If you get this and Adams' \\"Tales of the Congaree (and B.A. Botkin's Anthology \\"Treasury of American Folklore\\"), youll get a good intro to Black American Folklore.

The first two copies are owned by my Mom (artist Faith Ringgold) who is bi-coastal and keeps a copy loaded in the tape player ready to play, day or night, on each coast, and the third is for me because now from listening to my Mom's tapes I am as addicted to it as she is. This is becoming true of a lot of her friends. Whether you are doing something else or just listening, it fits in perfectly, and it is full of wisdom and laughs. It is absolutely the best, and I would buy anything else that Ruby Dee ever had anything to do with because she is the glue that makes it work."},{"Title":"Mules & Men","review":"There are several things that make this book very enjoyable. One is the collection of folklore and &quot;hoodoo&quot;, obtained from first-hand information. Ms. Hurston went to Florida for several months to gather her collection of folklore, and then to New Orleans for several more to study under various witchdoctors to gather the &quot;hoodoo&quot; information. Another is that she details her trips to these places. The stories aren't just written out and numbered; you know exactly who told them and under what conditions. I found this really helped me identify with the story much more. Finally, I'm from small-town Florida, and several of the places mentioned were very familiar to me.

This hardly meant that I even came close to \\"totally understaning\\" it. In my 20's I was able to teach it and other works by Cabell. I am now in my 70's and am able to re-read the great and not so great books of my youth. My advice to new reders is just to read it and don't be intimidated by the blend of history and faantasy, the archaic and fake-archaic spellings, and the constant anagrams. Eventually some things will be clear. They are not \\"secret meanings,\\" just additional layers. Enjoy, then (if it strikes you) dig more.Jurgen is not cheap victorian porn as at least one reviewer has suggested. It is a vicious and brutal attack on the prudish and hypocrtical criticism that are as much a reality today as they were in Cabell's day. The brutal kingdom of Philistia destroys as much \\"evil\\" today as it did in Jurgen's novel.A clue to entering Cabell's world here is his return to the garden between dawn and sunrise, where Jrgen starts his second journey through life. This dream of returning to reclaim the beauties and adventures of youth and to get a second chance may be common to all men or just to the lucky few. It was a time when the objects of our desire were not quite as beautiful as they seemed and when even our greatest adventures were not quite as great or as adventurous as they seemed then. Going back allows us to view them from the perspective of age and time, and if we have become wise, to sort them out.Cabell ended another book (The Devil's Only Son) with one charater observing that \\"dreams are the disease of youth; growing up is being cured of them.\\" Enjoy reading Jurgen. Enjoy returning to the dreams of youth.

James Branch Cabell is wonderful, and JURGEN is one of those books that delivers just what you hope it will. The hero is an aging pawnbroker who has lost his belligerent wife and sets out to find her as a matter of propriety more than will. Managing to regain his youth, he begins a year long journey that takes him to various worlds including heaven and hell. Jurgen takes up with many brilliant and pretty women along the way, but somehow is never satisfied. Then, he meets his wife Lisa again.. This was a publishing sensation in the 1920s and deserves to be again. It is funny, poetic, witty, and sometimes poignant. Cabell writes about youth, the loss of innocence, maturity and love in a uniquely refreshing and poetic way. I liked the sound of Cabell's 'THERE WERE TWO PIRATES..' so I also bought it and enjoyed it. I am currently reading his AS I REMEMBER IT, a memoir mostly of his wife, which reveals the brilliance and humanity of a real Southern gentleman of letters as much as it does the woman behind him."},{"Title":"Jurgen","review":"This was a notorious book of the 1920's, and it describesthe odyssey of Jurgen, a middle-aged pawnbroker and a&quot;monstrous clever fellow&quot;, who is miserable with his wife,and one day he is given an opportunity to search throughmany realms of fantasy and imagination looking for theperfect mate.

She was a high-spirited woman, with noespecial gift for silence.&quot; If you like that line, readthe book. If you don't, then forget it."},{"Title":"Jurgen","review":"Jurgen, an aging pawnbroker who considers himself a poet and a \\"monstrous clever fellow,\\" sets off to find his missing loquacious wife -- not because he likes her, but rather because his family and friends say it's the manly thing to do. While searching for Lisa, he enters a strange land and charms Mother Sereda into temporarily giving him back his youth and good looks. Then he uses his renewed vigor to lie and philander his way across a magical landscape, \\"dealing fairly\\" with all the women he meets, as he half-heartedly searches for his wife. Along the way he meets dozens of historical and mythical creatures and people (including Queen Guenevere, shown in the picture), first introducing himself as a duke, then promoting himself to prince, king, emperor, pope, and eventually, for a moment, even God.Despite being a vain and hypocritical rogue, Jurgen has a sentimental heart (though he can't seem to be faithful). But he is never content, even when he's married to the most beautiful woman he's ever seen, or even when he's sitting on God's throne. Thus, the story of Jurgen is about man's quest for meaning, pleasure, and purpose. Jurgen is full of human insight and amusing social satire and, for a novel written in 1919, is oh so impolite. Much of the symbolism and metaphor is crude and puerile double entendre of the \\"big upright lance\\" and \\"remarkable powers of penetration\\" type.Yet, James Branch Cabell (rhymes with \\"rabble\\") writes in a sardonic voice which is beautiful and genuinely clever and funny, especially when Jurgen talks about women:* I am looking for my wife, whom I suspect to have been carried off by a devil, poor fellow!* Love's sowing is more agreeable than love's harvest.* You talk and talk: no woman breathing equals you at mere volume and continuity of speech: but you say nothing that I have not heard seven hundred and eighty times if not oftener.* \\"You have a wife, then!\\" says Jurgen, who was always interested in such matters. \\"Why, but to be sure! Either as a Christian or as a married man, I should have comprehended this was Satan's due. And how do you get on with her?\\"\\"Pretty well,\\" says Grandfather Satan: \\"but she does not understand me.\\"\\"Et tu, Brute!\\" says Jurgen.\\"And what does that mean?\\"* For the devils, he found, esteemed polygamy, and ranked it above mere skill at torturing the damned, through a literal interpretation of the saying that it is better to marry than to burn.* When Jurgen asks if it's possible to get divorced in Hell, the devils say no because \\"we trafficked in them for a while, but we found that all persons who obtained divorces through our industry promptly thanked Heaven...\\"I also found it amusing that Jurgen, a pawnbroker with a paunch, backs up his arguments with fake scholarly citations and uses the study of mathematics to seduce intelligent women.Even a well-educated reader will miss most of the allusions in Jurgen unless armed with a source such as David Rolfe's Notes on Jurgen. These notes also point out references to Cabell's previous novels about his fabricated world of Poictesme. Fortunately, understanding of all of these allusions isn't required for enjoyment of the story, but they elicit chuckles when discovered and could be a source of much diversion for those who like to spend time studying these kinds of things.Back in its day, Jurgen was deemed offensive by the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, which tried to get it banned. This, of course, only increased Jurgen's popularity. The Vice squad lost their case because, superficially, Jurgen seems harmless enough and, according to Cabell and his publisher, complaints about the recurrent references to Jurgen's big staff, majestic scepter, upright lance, and amazing sword (which seem to meet a lot of veils, sheaths, clefts, and other dark places along the way) prove only that Cabell's detractors have dirty minds.Perhaps the real issue behind the outcry against Jurgen, however, is its disrespect of Christianity and, in particular, the Roman Catholic Church. For, when Jurgen is sent to Hell, he meets Grandfather Satan and learns that Hell is merely a construct developed by men who think so highly of themselves that they feel that their bad deeds were so influential that they cannot be forgotten and must be punished for eternity. The devils that Jurgen meets are hard-pressed to keep up with people's demands for torture, lament that Hell's population is increasing, and look for ways to stop the influx. When Jurgen gets bored of Hell, he talks his way into Heaven and finds that it's just a figment of his grandmother's imagination. His discussions with St. Peter cast an ill light on Catholic bishops and popes.Jurgen is in the public domain and can be downloaded for free at Project Gutenberg. I downloaded the mobipocket version and stuck it right on my Kindle. Besides being free, Jurgen is an interesting and thoughtful novel which is worth reading not just for entertainment, but as part of the history of fantasy literature."},{"Title":"Jurgen","review":"For a brief, gin soaked, moment in the 1920s the literati fell in love with Cabell. But although he's remained popular with readers (Jurgen's never been out of print for long, if at all) academics and intellectuals have never embraced or rejected Cabell with the enthusiasm of the 20s. Sober progressive thinkers are put off by his exquisite and affected, albeit pitch perfect, diction. Cabell's eroticism, so elegantly phrased, yet so fatuous and conventional, like a well read Benny Hill, also fails to lend itself to the academic project of boiling down sex into a wholesome social critique, sanitized and neatly packaged for use in transgressive pedagogical strategies. On the other hand, the bow tie wearing cultural right senses an affinity for the conservative Cabell, steeped in high culture, but Cabell's regrettable susceptibility to crass phallic double entendre disqualifies him from a place in the canon.Cabell has his faults of course. He suffers from the tendency of a consciously high brow author to make his writing a display of sensibility rather than a vehicle for the development of character or thought. All of his characters, improbably, from the meanest rustic to a king, employ the same elegant, oblique diction.Still, Cabell's tepid reception is puzzling. It is not clear why Cabell rates lower than say, Bronte, whom some plausibly view as another overripe, proto \\"genre fiction\\" writer. Admittedly, his distinctive voice will not appeal to every taste, but his erudition and allusiveness should endear him to academia; while his self conscious literary elitism ought to appeal to the never-in-short-supply self conscious literary elitist. Cabell is also a novelist of ideas. Big, elemental ideas, not ham fisted, but still the kind you can sink your teeth into; the kind you expect teachers and students would love to discuss. Yet Cabell appears on no lists of required reading.But it seems Cabell knew from the beginning this was to be his fate. \\"Too urbane to advocate delusion, too hale for the bitterness of irony\\". So Cabell described himself in a spurious, self-penned blurb that appears on Jurgen's dedication page. Pitched at neither the right nor the left, the high or low, Cabell recognizes that he is too accommodating of both sentimentality and cynicism, and too frivolous toward both conventional piety and its earnest, angry critics to win over either hearts or minds, the philistine or the aesthete. But Cabell does not agonize over his divided sensibility, nor does he invite our sympathy. He asks only that we not take it, or him, too seriously; a request guaranteed to ensure the marginal and precarious acceptance Cabell now enjoys among the intelligentsia, but one better suited to win the affections of readers who come to love Cabell's elegance, wit, and humble humanity."},{"Title":"Jurgen","review":"A first rule of thumb when approaching Cabell's 18-volume opus, the Biography of Manuel; every book will be about Cabell's relationship with his wife. Cabell is obsessed with marriage, and objectifies all of his female characters to fit one of his imagined female roles; nag, whore, or unapproachable beauty. Cabell's characters always return to their nagging wives, for familiarity's sake if nothing else, with never a suggestion that it might be possible to have a long-term relationship between a man and a woman in which both are creators and in which both learn from each other.The book Jurgen is from the same mold. Jurgen the pawnbroker moves from one of Cabell's stereotypical women to another. The book became well-known because of the godawful sex sequences, in which Cabell archly refers to Jurgen's sword, staff, or stick -- the resulting call for censorship made the book famous, but that doesn't mean it was Cabell's best. I thought The Silver Stallion and, in some respects, even The Cream of the Jest or The High Place to be better examples of Cabell's writing.I would recommend that anyone who likes fantasy read at least one of Cabell's books, because he writes like no one else. This book had the usual Cabell wittiness and sardonic feel, so if it's the only one you can find, certainly try it."},{"Title":"Jurgen","review":"Other reviews have given the outline of the narrative, but a good way to convey the strength and variety of the writing - not always cynical, as some suggest - is to follow the example of the reviewer who quoted the first line as a touchstone. (Sell the apples by offering a free bite.) In that respect, here are a few more snippets -\\"Good and evil keep very exact accounts\\" said the Centaur, \\" and the face of every man is their ledger.\\"\\"\\"...I wonder now if any of you gentlemen [he is talking with four archangels in heaven... never mind] can give me news of that Lisa who used to be my wife?\\" He described her; and they regarded him with compassion.\\"But he does not only talk of emotion in terms of a contrast between cosy, if imperfect, domesticity, and casual eroticism. He acknowledges passion. Queen Anaitis says:\\"For I, and none but I, can waken that desire which uses all of a man, and also wastes nothing, even though it leave that favoured man for ever after like wan ashes in the sunlight.\\" To me that ranks with Racine's famous \\"Venus toute enti&egrave;re &agrave; sa proie attach&eacute;e.\\"Incidentally, an amusing example of that casual eroticism which got the book into so much trouble is when Chloris is somewhat alarmed by his *staff* and therefore \\"Jurgen hid his staff where Chloris could not possibly see it.\\" You can see where that could cause problems in the 1920's. The great enforcer Comstock had only died a few years before and his \\"Society for the Suppression of Vice\\" was active. Today it rates nothing more than a mild chuckle and an appreciation of an alternative to biological detail."},{"Title":"Jurgen","review":"It wasn't all that long ago that James Branch Cabell attracted a huge audience for this kind of satire. He's not much read these days, and I can sort of understand why - much of what he pokes fun at here is not taught in the schools anymore, and it's too bad. On the other hand, anyone who enjoys the Harry Potter movies, or \\"Clash of the Titans\\" and such, shouldn't have too much trouble with \\"Jurgen\\". I can therefore recommend it without hesitation.Well, with a tiny bit of hesitation, mostly on account of the language. Cabell adopted a courtly tone and some rather archaic vocabulary for this piece - quite suitable to the tale, but not very familiar these days. Not impossible, but it takes a certain amount of concentration. And let's face it, for light reading, most of us prefer not to work that hard. Let me encourage you to give it a try anyway. The rewards are considerable.Categorizing this novel is pretty nearly impossible. It reads at first like an ancient folktale, with a certain sort of chivalrous adventuring in the pursuit of damsels in distress, battles with fabulous monsters and whatnot, but you can't really take that approach very seriously when the narrative makes it quite clear that our hero Jurgen is a middle-aged pawnbroker of temporarily youthful appearance, and a liar to boot. He bluffs his way into increasingly exalted rank, with increasingly exciting wives and mistresses to match, in increasingly mythic realms, until finally he replaces God for a couple of minutes. That's about all he can tolerate, and he realizes that if being God doesn't satisfy him, nothing will.I won't go into detail about just how Jurgen gets his youth back - suffice to say that he does, with the help of an ancient god disguised as an old washerwoman, and proceeds to those increasingly wide-ranging adventures. I think you will not be surprised to learn that once the thrill of romance has passed, Jurgen gets a little bored. He's a pretty decent husband to each of his wives, actually, but not exactly faithful.He's not really faithful to much else, either, except to his own opinion of himself as a \\"mighty clever fellow\\". Which he certainly is. He manages to outsmart pretty nearly everyone - women who profess their reluctance to let him anywhere near them, the men he competes with, his parents, nature myths, demons, gods, Satan and God. Lest this makes him seem unpleasant, I should point out that he's unfailingly polite and invariably careful to abide by the customs of whatever country he finds himself in. He makes friends easily and opens himself up to new knowledge on a regular basis. He's actually a pretty likeable guy, just untrustworthy. His motto, in fact, is along these lines: \\"You may very well be right, and in fact I would never go so far as to say you're wrong, but still, on the other hand...!\\" In other words, students of folklore will recognize Jurgen as part of the ancient tradition of the Trickster, along with Coyote and Til Eulenspiegel and Anansi the Spider-Man and creatures like that.Anyway, the story builds and builds through Jurgen's titles and locations until there's nothing left to do but deflate the whole business. You've read books like that before, of course, and most authors who write themselves into that sort of corner give you the impression that all they want to do is put the darned thing down and forget it. Failing that, they stick some kind of exhausted conclusion on and leave us feeling entirely dissatisfied. Not Cabell. He's got something to say, even in a carnival ride like this. It's a trifle conventional, but it works. Let's just say that I have seldom read a fantasy that returns to Earth with this much class.This may have something to do with Cabell's approach to mythic tales, which strikes me as distinctly American. H.L. Mencken once said of Cabell that his knights tend to slay dragons with the attitude of an accountant adding up a column of figures, and that's just about right; Jurgen does all these mighty deeds mostly because that's what people in his position do, and his reaction to his own prowess is something like \\"Yeah, whatever.\\" On the other hand, he's also a poet, and at various times (especially at the tale's conclusion) he can express himself with great beauty - which gives the impression that he's less concerned with what he's doing and more concerned with how it makes him feel. Given that, it makes a certain kind of sense that he wouldn't find a knight's life, or a king's or a god's, any more or less useful than a pawnbroker's, and certainly doesn't take one more seriously than the other.So, you may ask, if \\"Jurgen\\" is all about how silly stories like \\"Jurgen\\" are, what's the point? Oh, come on, you know the answer to that - it's for fun, as was a good bit of everything Cabell did. Even his response to the fact that people tended to mispronounce his name was for fun - it's up there in the title of this review, in fact. He said \\"Tell the rabble my name is Cabell\\". Which may strike us as kind of insulting until you read his work - in things like \\"Jurgen\\" it's perfectly clear that if he thought of us as rabble, he also thought of the rabble as the really important people of the Earth.Benshlomo says, You've got better things to do with your time than slay dragons."},{"Title":"Jurgen","review":"The Waking Lion Press (Editorium) edition of Jurgen can well be considered the definitive edition of \\"Jurgen\\" available today. In addition to the full text of the novel itself it incorporates the rare \\"Notes on Jurgen\\" by James P. Cover, only 850 of which were printed in 1928, compiled and extended by David Rolfe; an introduction by the same; the introduction to the British Edition, by Hugh Walpole; the \\"Note on the Notes\\" by James P. Cover; the map of Poictesme, as published in the 1928 edition of \\"The Silver Stallion\\"; a photograph of the author; all the wonderful plates by Frank C. Pap&eacute;; and a short afterword taken from an old Times Literary Supplement. The only things that seem to be missing are Pap&eacute;'s \\"Dorothy\\" frontispiece and the small illustrations from within the text. Also, the print of the illustrations seems a bit inferior to the original illustrated edition, which of course stays a valued collector's piece.Still, you won't get all of this that easy and to such a reasonable price anywhere else. Especially recommended for those brave souls dedicated to taking Cabell back into the seminar rooms. Thanks to everybody involved for making this happen."},{"Title":"Jurgen","review":"I own copies of it in four different editions. One is a really beautiful leather-bound book from Golden Cockerel Press.It helps if you read it before you hit 15 years old, I think. Like Rabalais and Tristram Shandy.

But it's Edwardian."},{"Title":"Jurgen","review":"..... than the memory of some temptation we resisted.\\"This book is a triumph for humankind and for what we are as functioning biological entities defying the cosmos - even if it is only for the tiny speck of cosmic time that we are allotted. But while we have it - yes, we are triumphant. Not only does Cabell elevate the human but he also manages to degrade all those icons we set up as unachievable envies - beautiful women (some famously from the past like Helen of Troy), kings, popes, fantasy creatures. But he even brings us truimphantly in engagements with the Devil and God itself!!! And yet, for all that, at the end Jurgen is still humbled and respectful.To me Cabell's message is go out and live life well - enjoy the physical aspects of existence, the mental ones, the spiritual ones - deny yourself none of them. But nevertheless, remain conscious of your greatest treasures - no matter how humble they may be, they are yours and you should be proud to claim them.It goes on a bit, but it is a wonderful book."},{"Title":"Jurgen","review":"\\"I have finished Jurgen; a great and beautiful book, and the saddest book I ever read. I don't know why, exactly. The book hurts me -- tears me to small pieces -- but somehow it sets me free. It says the word that I've been trying to pronounce for so long. It tells me everything I am, and have been, and may be, unsparingly...I don't know why I cry over it so much. It's too -- something-or-other -- to stand. I've been sitting here tonight, reading it aloud, with the tears streaming down my face...\\" -- Deems Taylor, in a letter dated December 12, 1920.What can I add to that? Jurgen is on my short list of very favorite books. It wrestles, in its odd way, with the fundamental tragedy of human life in general and male life in particular: We are doomed to age and die; meanwhile happiness will prove elusive. Wow, I'm making this sound awfully depressing, aren't I? But that's not right. Jurgen is humorous and fun and weirdly uplifting. Jurgen's strange adventures manage to represent all that a man may pursue and aspire to. The tale burns, but in a wonderfully brilliant way. (I made that comment about the tragedy of \\"male life\\" because Jurgen is, among other things, the quintessential rogue. His notion of how happiness might be ideally pursued differs somewhat from the ideas of the females he holds discourse with. Thus does Cabell illustrate a reality that we can either acknowledge or deny; take your choice. Enlightened people will prefer the latter.)Jurgen isn't for everyone. Some will \\"get it\\" and some won't. I once handed a copy to a person who returned it with the comment that he wasn't a fan of the S&S; (\\"swords & sorcery\\") genre. This surprised me; the book can only be described as S&S; by someone who does not look below the surface. I mention this not to mock but to warn. Jurgen may be better appreciated by those who are stirred by symbol and metaphor. We may not be prancing through a magical world as Jurgen does, but some of us will see echoes of our own dreams and nightmares in his story. If you're such a person, then Jurgen may hit you like a ton of bricks. Otherwise you'll chuck the manuscript against the wall.It's worth noting that Jurgen, in its circumspect way, managed to offend the contemporary powers-that-be. The book is obscurely suggestive without being explicit; it went over the heads of some, but others saw what was going on, and they either guffawed or objected vigorously. There were serious attempts to suppress it, which of course only made the text notorious. It was (and still is) politically incorrect, and it garnered something of a counter-cultural following for all the wrong reasons. Well, so be it. The book is great, and that's all there is to say.The tale incorporates supporting characters and environments rummaged from myth and history. You won't need to know all these background details to understand or enjoy the plot; however if you should want to follow up, some rabid fans (of which there were many) put together a collection of footnotes way back in 1928. It's long out of print, but you'll find an Amazon listing on it (Amazon lists everything!); search Amazon books for ASIN=B00085DJ0A. A copy of the notes is also posted online; search the web on the phrase \\"Notes on Jurgen\\".If you buy the book, you'll want the Dover paperback edition (ISBN=0486235076), which is a trade paperback and includes the wonderful old illustrations. Holding this edition in my hands just feels right. There's also a great unabridged audio cassette (ISBN=1574534505), rendered by a troupe of actors. They do a very nice job, switching to the most appropriate character to read the text as the book progresses.Cabell was a prolific author, with \\"Jurgen\\" being his best-known (and probably his greatest) work. If you're unfamiliar with Cabell, \\"Jurgen\\" is the book to start with. If you want to follow up, look for \\"Figures of Earth\\"."},{"Title":"Jurgen","review":"I accidentally bumped into this book when I was in my 20s. Had no idea where it would lead me. Read it practically in one sitting. I was amazed that I understood what Cabell was driving at even tho I could not have explained it coherently to anyone.Next I re-read it in my 50s. I never read books twice. Still amazed by it.The book was buried in a box, after house moving many times. I re-discovered it last night. Now in my 80s I'm reading it all over again. Amazed as ever."},{"Title":"Jurgen","review":"In the 1920s, James Branch Cabell (rhymes with &quot;rabble&quot;) was considered by many to be one of the greatest American writers, based on this novel. Tastes changed with the coming of the Great Depression; worse, Cabell never again came close to writing a book of this quality, despite his many attempts. Whether or not Cabell is a great writer (and I incline to the view that writers should be judged by their best rather than their mediocre works), Jurgen is a great book, full of insight and a joy to read. The eponymous protagonist is a middle-aged pawnbroker who is given an opportunity to relive his youth. In his travels he encounters, among others, Guenevere, the Master Philologist, the Philistines, his father's Hell, and his grandmother's Heaven. In the end he has an opportunity to question Koshchei who made all things as they are. I heartily recommend this novel. Although it is in an older fantasy tradition, it is at least as readable and enjoyable as the best contemporary fantasy, and its literary quality is far greater. I have re-read it many times."},{"Title":"Jurgen","review":"Early in his journey, Cabell's Jurgen comes to a place known as 'The Garden Between Dawn and Sunrise.' In the garden live all the imaginary creatures that humankind has ever created: centaurs and sphinxes, fairies, valkyries, and baba-yagas. Jurgen is surprised when he sees his first-love wandering around the garden, but his guide replies &quot;Why, all the women that man has ever loved live here...for very obvious reasons.&quot;Moments like this, simultaneously jaded and genuine, sentimental and cynical, are the most delightful parts of 'Jurgen: A Comedy of Justice.' Nominally the story of a medieval pawnbroker's quest to find his lost wife, 'Jurgen' becomes a bildungsroman in reverse as, on the way, its hero regains his youth and visits the lands of European myth, from Camelot to Cocaigne (the land of pleasure) -- each land shows Jurgen a way of life, and he rejects each in favor of his own sardonic stoicism, for he is, after all, a &quot;monstrously clever fellow.&quot;That phrase describes Cabell as much as it does Jurgen: the author is remarkably erudite, and, like a doting parent hiding easter eggs, drops in-jokes through the book on subjects as far-ranging as troubadour poetry and tantric sex. Cabell corresponded with Aleister Crowley in his day, and, in ours, is an influence on Neil Gaiman ('The Sandman,' 'Neverwhere,' etc.). The book itself caused quite a splash when it became the centerpiece of one of the biggest censorship trials of the early 20th century: something to do with Jurgen's very large *ahem* sword.Social satire and an idiosyncratic cynicism in the guise of a scholarly romance-fantasy, 'Jurgen' is what would have happened if J.R.R. Tolkien and Dorothy Parker had gotten together to write a book."},{"Title":"Jurgen","review":"Magically recovering his youth, Jurgen, a poet-cum-pawn broker of medaeval France, begins an erotic odyssey, in which he beds King Arthur's bride-to-be, a love goddess in her realm of pleasure, a tree nymph, the queen of Philistines, a vampire in Hell. He also gets to talk to God, Satan -- and the mysterious Katschei, creator of all things as they are. Full of puns, word play, references to obscure myths and legends of various cultures, and Americanizing the tradition of the picaresque epic, JURGEN is a delight for the Mensa set and ordinary readers alike. This edition reproduces the delightful illustrations cut for the first British publication of the work."},{"Title":"Jurgen","review":"All of JBC's books are interesting, this is among his best. Many modern readers may find his writing style unfamiar: it has quality and beauty. The themes are universal, and the sheer gnosis that the author displays is impressive. Cabell writes about the human condition, and even though we pride ourselves, in this day and age, of a certain level of cynicism, we cannot match the sardonic tone he displays, nor the depth to which his sword pierces. Much has been written regarding the Jurgen/Aleister Crowley connection, but I feel this book may indicate that Cabell really did have some practical experience with ceremonial magick after all.If you like this book, read &quot;Something About Eve&quot; which, I think, is actually better."},{"Title":"Jurgen","review":"Perhaps the finest fantasy ever written by an american writer. It will change your life every time you read it. Cabell was brilliant and Heinlein copied him more than once (compare Job: A Comedy of Justice). Cabell was sexy, ironic, consistant. Even Asimov, in his final works attempted to equal the History of Dom Manuel by combining the Robots and Foundation into a single cosmology."},{"Title":"Jurgen","review":"Jurgen, after a word in defense of the Devil, finds himself upon a Pilgrims' Progress through the world. Sardonic, cynical and droll, this tale of Jurgen's journey finds him promoted at each step of the way, through King to Emperor.The highlight of his journey is a sojurn in &quot;the Hell of Our Fathers&quot; where the resident devils are kept exhausted trying to mete out punishments which satisfy their &quot;victims&quot; as being proportionate to their sins. That the devils find the sins rather petty seems to mollify the proud parents not at all.This is a book to read and re-read. Cabell's comments upon human foibles should please and amuse"},{"Title":"Jurgen","review":"I read this 1921 book because H.L. Mencken, my guide when it comes to literature, thought so highly of it. It is perhaps most difficult to read because it is a fable and fables of course, do not consist of characters and actions which are based in reality. The book is a little hard to follow at the beginning. It is rather hard to explain what the story is about.When the book starts, Jurgen is a pawnbroker in a mythical kingdom. Knowing what actions will please an elderly sorceress, he elicits from her the privillege of living as a young nobleman in several different kingdoms over the course of a year, all under different names and noble titles. Cabell writes in a slightly tongue in cheek tone as he describes Jurgen's vanity, and most explicitly his penchant for the ladies. The most common phrases Cabell uses to describe Jurgen's sexual exploits are that Jurgen \\"intended to deal fairly\\" with a particular lady and to the effect that when Jurgen retired to a lovemaking place with the lady, the place therein was dark and nobody can see anything in the dark. Because of the darkness the old sorceress, whose shadow followed Jurden, did not see Jurgen engage in sex acts which would have displeased her. Probably my favorite part of the book is where Cabell tongue in cheek uses evasive language to describe Jurgen's sexual actions, such as on page 140. At that point in the book Jurgen is married to the Queen Anaitis. Anaitis catches Jurgen and a lady at court, a resident expert on the Kama Sutra, involved in a \\"philosophical experiment, necessarily performed in the dark.\\" Stella had asserted that a certain sexual position could only be performed in the dark and asserted that \\"in simple equity,\\" she was entitled to prove her assertions. \\"So Jurgen proceeded to deal fairly with her,\\" i.e. peformed the sex act with her. It is when he leaves the kingdome of Guenevere's father and goesto live with Anaitis that the book gets really good. Jurgen also goes to live on the outskirts of the kingdom of Pseudopolis, getting married to a tree dweller and livining in a tree. He invades the home of Queen Helen of Troy in Pseudopolis and observes her sleeping. He goes to Hell and gets married to a female vampire and has an affair with Satan's wife.The prose in this book is really quite beautiful.A strong theme of this book is how reality is so covered up by our illusions about ourselves. We think that there is a God or a Devil that watches our every move, looking for virtue or sin. We think we are that important even though we are a tiny speck in the universe. Another theme relates to Jurgen never being able to find happiness, despite the sorceress granting him the privillege of living out all his longstanding dreams of being a king and nobleman and husband of some of the most beautiful women on earth. He discovers at the end of the story that he prefers to go back where he was before the sorceress granted him all his illusions.I found it a somewhat difficult book. Particulary in the beginning of the book, Jurgen jumps from situation to situation without a certain logic that would make it easy for the reader to understand. Of course, the book is a fable and fables are not meant to be logical. The characters speak their dialogue in very beautiful language, though sometimes the meaning of the sentences are opaque.However, I think it is easy to understand the book, if you just keep reading, you can understand everything eventually if you don't worry.Cabell also constructs a phony introduction to the book written by some make believe bookish verbose academic or book reviewer. He also places some unintelliglbe blurbs after the title page, written by imaginary verbose, bookish book reviewer critics. This was all pretty funny."},{"Title":"Jurgen","review":"In 1919, JURGEN, A Comedy of Justice was published by the Robert M. McBride Co. One of its readers, Mr. Walter J. Kingsley, was offended by the book and sent a critical letter about it to the literary editor of a New York newspaper. He wrote: &quot;James Branch Cabell is making a clean getaway with JURGEN, quite the naughtiest book since George (A.) Moore began ogling maid-servants in Mayo (Ireland). How come? Dreiser had the law after him for THE GENIUS and HAGER REVELLY came close to landing Daniel Carson Goodman in Leavenworth, yet these volumes are innocent compared with JURGEN, which deftly and knowingly treats in thinly veiled episodes of all the perversities, abnormalities, and damn-foolishness of sex. There is an undercurrent of extreme sensuality throughout the book, and once the trick of transposing the key is mastered one can dip into this tepid stream on every page. . . . It is curious how the non-reading public discovered JURGEN. A few days after it appeared on the newsstands a male vampire of the films who once bought Stevenson's UNDERWOODS in the belief that it was a book of verses hymning a typewriter, began saying up and down Broadway: 'Say, kid, get a book called JURGEN. It gets away with murder.' This sold the first edition quickly. . . .&quot;A copy of Kingsley letter found its way to the office of The New York Society for the Suppression of Vice. John Saxton Sumner, its secretary, purchased a copy of the book, read it, was morally outraged and on January 14, 1920, &quot;armed with a warrant, entered the offices of the publishers, seized the plates and all copies of the book and summoned the publishers to appear in court . . . on a charge of violating Section 1141 of the Penal Code.&quot;The trial began on October 15, 1922 and after a three day trial, the book was judged a work &quot;of unusual literary merit and the case was dismissed. In January 1923, JURGEN AND THE LAW in an edition of 1080 numbered copies, was published. This work detailed the events leading up to the prosecution of the book and reported the main points of the trial.In a letter to Mary Kennedy dated 12 Dec 1920, Deems Taylor wrote: &quot;I have finished Jurgen: a great and beautiful book, and the saddest book I ever read. I don't know why exactly. The book hurts me--tears me to small pieces--but somehow it sets me free. It says the word that I've been trying to pronounce for so long.

After 1945, it disappeared from the repertories. In 1999, Michael Keith, a Cabell enthusiast, secured the original score for the Jurgen Symphony and recorded it on a CD.

However, Isobel takes it a step further by revealing the depths of her spiritual struggles in determining what God would have her do in certain situations.

This a story of God's work through Isobel Kuhn. The warfare is not only spiritual it is sometimes physical as when Japan invaded China in 1937. Satan doesn't give up territory easily and spiritual battles abound in this stirring book.

Doctor Thorne (third in the series) left me satisfied, and I can recommend it. It contains fewer of the engaging, and for me novel, nuances of 19th century Church of England politics. Instead it is a rustic tale, somewhat contrived, compensated by a set of plausible characters who held my interest. Ever since the author in the earlier \\"The Warden\\" effectively punctured my elevated opinion of C. Dickens, I've been contrasting the two contemporaries. Yes, Dickens remains one of my favorites. But, his caricatures are more exagerated than Trollope's; I can easily envision both the characters and dialogue as of the type that actually would occur, having known analogs in the rural area in which I was raised. No, it's not Great Expectations; but Doctor Thorne is good, and probably a better picture of 19th century England."},{"Title":"Doctor Thorne, (The world's classics)","review":"I was very startled when I received this edition of the book - there is no publishing information in it!

Not at all bad for a book which in its Penguin version has nearly 600 small-print pages. I worked on a military newspaper for a couple years where I did proofreading about two days a week, so I trust myself on this matter. Another reviewer suggests the Kindle edition has so many errors it had to be given up. Not so, though of course another Kindle edition may be in question. I'm talking about the one you can download for $0.00.The most confusing, and most amusing, error came about three quarters of the way through the book: \\"The horses were ordered on the next day for three, and, as two, Mr Gazebee came to the house.\\"That took me a minute to catch: \\"as two\\" should be \\"at two.\\"Once or twice I thought a sentence might have dropped out, but couldn't be sure. The book was quite readable, and of course it's a delightful part of the Barsetshire series.Most of the other Barsetshire novels have Penguin annotated Kindle versions available here for about ten dollars. I prefer those, but DOCTOR THORNE is available on Kindle only in bare bones versions. Fortunately Trollope writes so straightforwardly that missing annotations for one volume of the series is no great loss.Note, too, that for some reason the word \\"Penguin\\" must be typed in when asking for Kindle novels or none of the Penguin Kindles becomes visible to the online shopper. I don't know if this is eclumsiness or part of a war between Penguin and Amazon. The same is true for Oxford World's Classics Kindle editions.For what it's worth, the Penguin FRAMLEY PARSONAGE has eight or ten typos, almost as many as here, and the ones in the notes are worse than anything in DOCTOR THORNE, including two-line repeats on two separate occasions.

I like to be spell-bound by a master story-teller, whether his story is a comedy, a romance, an epic or detective fiction.A story-teller I am always happy to spend time with is Anthony Trollope. In neat, well-turned prose, he details the conflicts and resolutions of characters and situations like a good-humoured commentator describing the movement of pieces in a game of chess.Perhaps there are times when the chess pieces and their moves are not fascinating as they might be, and perhaps there are times when the commentary is not as sharp and concise as it might be. Such is the case you will find if you read \\"Doctor Thorne\\" after its preceding Barsetshire novels, \\"The Warden\\" and \\"Barchester Towers\\". Whereas they both presented cogent dilemmas, suspense and conflict, \\"Doctor Thorne\\" works only on the \\"Will A and B Overcome Obstacles to Their Marriage?\\" formula.Nevertheless, Anthony Trollope can still keep me reading this book happily for the third or fourth time.

Amazing how society has evolved, yes, editing mistakes - but it was FREE"},{"Title":"Doctor Thorne, (The world's classics)","review":"This is ostensibly a love story between headstrong young squire Frank Gresham and Mary Thorne, the illegitimate niece of the title character. As Trollope humorously points out at the beginning, Dr. Thorne will be seen to be the true hero, although being a middle-aged doctor he doesn't really fit the bill, so we'll have Frank and Mary's love story as well. This is typical of Trollope's humorous winks and asides to his reader, and part of the fun of entering his vanished world. Dr. Thorne and his outstanding character are really the centerpiece of this story, but the romantic struggles of the young couple illustrate the importance of blood, rank and money among the upper classes in Victorian England. The story is propelled forward and the real motives and makeup of the characters revealed as the stormy romance between Frank and Mary develops.I'm working my way through Trollope, since we never got to him in high school or college English Lit. I think that's a shame and I hope it's been rectified since I took those classes a LOOOOOONG time ago; I love his satirical eye and spot-on portraits of the pretensions of both the emerging middle-class and the declining yet still all-powerful aristocratic and gentry class. He peoples his novels with an amazing array of pompous, preening doctors, lawyers and clergymen and spouses with hilarious and apt names like \\"Dr. Fillgrave\\", \\"Bishop and Mrs. Proudie\\" and the law firm of \\"Messrs. Slow & Bideawhile\\", while affectionately yet expertly skewering their hypocrisy and very human foibles. He does the same for the aristocrats and their almighty reverance for the twin grails of \\"Blood & Rank\\" - to be honored at all costs, unless of course one becomes \\"embarrassed\\" by debt as Squire Gresham does here, and then it's perfectly acceptable to hold one's nose and sell off the eldest son and heir (Frank) to a wealthy scion of the appalling (yet necessary) merchant class - here, the hilarious Miss Dunstable, several years older than Frank and heiress to a fortune made from hawking a patent medicine called the \\"oil of Lebanon\\"."},{"Title":"Doctor Thorne, (The world's classics)","review":"John Newbold Gresham is the Member from Barsetshire, a Tory. When he dies, his son, Francis Gresham, is chosen in his place. He has married Lady Arabella DeCourcy, a Whig family, and so after the dissolution of Parliament, he fails to maintain his seat.There are many children, mostly girls, except for the eldest, another Frank. By 1854 the son has been educated at Harrow and is attending Cambridge. Dr. Thorne lives at Greshamsbury with his niece, Mary Thorne. Mary is educated with Lady Arabella's daughters, Augusta and Beatrice Gresham. She studies French, German, and music. The squire of Greshamsbury struggles with debt and poverty. Dr. Thorne arranges his loans for him with Sir Roger Scratcherd.Augusta accepts Mr. Moffat's offer of marriage. (This later comes to nothing.) Mary makes the DeCourcy cousins angry with her as Augusta's wedding is planned. Lady Amelia, his aunt, declares that Frank must marry money, (to save his patrimony). Nearly simultaneously Mary Thorne learns enough of her dubious beginnings to understand that she is duty-bound to discourage Frank's romantic leanings in her direction.As things develop, Mary is banned from visiting Gresham family members, and her uncle, in sympathy, decides to limit his involvement with the family to professional matters. Much of the plot is in the nature of a Cinderella or Romeo and Juliet story. I do not mean that Trollope needed models for his plots, just that in cases of matrimony, the issues of money and blood arose often.This is a smashing book."},{"Title":"Doctor Thorne, (The world's classics)","review":"Doctor Thorne is the third novel in the six set Barsetshire Novels. These delightful fictional masterpieces deal with life in the clerical world of Barset. Trollope completed this work on the way home from a postal inspection tour of Egypt in 1858. This novel is a little over 500 pages making it one of the \\"shorter\\" works of the series.The plot is simple. Doctor Thorne is the guardian of the beautiful Mary who is the illegitimate daughter of his deceased brother Henry. Mary is in love with Frank Gresham who comes from a local gentry family. Frank's family has fallen on hard times so his parents demand he marry a rich woman. The Greshams are related to the super rich De Courcey family who reside on an estate in Barsetshire. This side of the family is also against Frank's marrying Mary Thorne. Frank is tempted to fall in love with the wealthy and eccentric Miss Dunstable. She will, however, marry Dr. Thorne in a later novel in the series.As in all Trollope novels there are other characters. Mr. Oriel weds Beatrice who is one of Frank's sisters. Oriel is a clergyman and the couple are happy.Roger Scatchard is the man who killed Henry Thorne. Henry had fathered a child with Roger's sister named Mary. Mary's mother marries a man and moves to the United States. She never returns home to England. Scatcherd served six months in prison for the violent crime but then became a wealthy engineer. He dies an alcoholic as does his son Louis Phillipe Scatcherd. Trollope probably based the character of Roger Scatcherd on that of builder Sir Morton Peto or of railway millionaire George King.Mary inherits the Scatcherd fortune with Louis Phillipe dies of alcoholism. When Frank's mother learn of this she gives her approval to his wedding of the now affluent Mary. All ends well for the Greshams.The first name of Dr. Thorne is Thomas. This may be a reference to Trollope's brother Thomas who suggested the plot of the story to his novelist writing brother.Humorous scenes abound in the descriptions of the money loving De Courceys, a rural election and the rivalry existing between Dr. Thorne and local doctors such as the immortal Dr. Fillgrave.Anthony Trollope (1815-1882) is less heralded in America than his fellow Victorians Dickens, Thackery or Eliot but his characters are a realistic portrait of how real men and women of the middle and upper classes lived in Victorian Great Britain.I discovered the wonders of Trollope over forty years ago and have found him to be a wise, witty and wonderful companion throughout life. Dr. Thorne is a good first Trollope novel for readers not familiar with his voluminous work. Excellent and recommended!"},{"Title":"Doctor Thorne, (The world's classics)","review":"I've enjoyed the Phineas series and am enjoying this one, also. I liked the cover of the book.

Instead, this novel is pure melodrama, the story of Mary Thorne, a girl of uncertain parentage. Mary, often in the company of the Gresham sisters, with whom she has been schooled, is attracted to their brother Frank.The Greshams, of a high social level, own a dilapidated estate, and their increasing debts have left them owing many wealthy landowners and lenders. Their only hope is that Frank, who will inherit the estate, marry a wealthy woman who will solve their cash-flow problems by trading her wealth for his family's status. Frank, however, is in love with Mary.As Mary is increasingly ostracized because of her lack of high birth, she and Frank become increasingly in love. Despite other attempts to introduce Frank to wealthy, older women who might marry him and solve the estate's financial problems, he remains true to Mary. When Sir Roger Scratcherd, in poor health, decides to redo his will to honor the oldest child of his absent sister Mary, the scene is set for a change of fortunes.Though the earlier Barsetshire novels are highly satiric, casting wry glances at the church and its behavior, this novel is more rooted in day to day activities, accurately depicting the class divisions in England at the time and emphasizing their absurdities. These divisions are so ingrained in society that there is little hope for any change and even less for any recognition that they might be morally wrong. Mary Thorne is the perfect little lady, despite her lack of family \\"background,\\" and she shows those more \\"elevated\\" than she that she is more a lady than they are. The novel follows standard plot lines, and there is little doubt, throughout, that the romantic complications will be resolved as the reader hopes. The good and honest characters of low birth are rewarded, and the snobs and their heirs are brought low.Though Trollope is as good as always with his dialogue and his pointed observations, this novel lacks the punch of his earlier satires. The action and melodrama are predictable, and the ending is completely expected. Adding to the complexity of life in Barchester, this novel provides some new characters for this community (and series), and suggests new complications for future novels of the Barset Chronicles. n Mary WhippleThe Warden, Book 1, Chronicles of Barsetshire, 1855Barchester Towers, Book 2, 1857Framley Parsonage, Book 4, 1861The Small House at Allington, Book 5, 1864.The Last Chronicle of Barset (Penguin Classics), 1867"},{"Title":"Doctor Thorne, (The world's classics)","review":"Mary Thorne, orphaned (and illegitimate) niece of Dr. Thorne, has long been a favorite at Greshamsbury House--until Lady Arabella Gresham learns that her only son Frank is in love with Mary. The unhappy Mary is banished forthwith, because the Gresham family fortunes are so depleted that Frank must marry money.Frank, however, is one of the few completely honorable young men in Trollope's novels and remains stubbornly true to his love. Well, he does propose to another woman, at the insistence of his mother, but only with the virtual certainty that he will be rejected--as indeed he is. The lady is Miss Dunstable, one of Trollope's most delightful characters, a fabulously wealthy thirtyish heiress of an ointment company. She is a bold, witty woman, not beautiful, but attractive in her way, whose wealth invites countless proposals.After the rather complicated plot unfolds, the tables are completely turned, and Mary is eagerly welcomed by Lady Arabella (who, of course, has always loved her) as the savior of the family.I concede that &quot;The Last Chronicle of Barset&quot; is the best of the Barsetshire novels, but I dearly love &quot;Dr. Thorne.&quot; The character of the doctor himself is strong and sympathetic. Frank, Mary, Miss Dunstable, Lady Arabella, Sir Roger Scatcherd, and such minor characters as Dr. Thorne's rival, Dr. Fillgrave (one of Trollope's punnily named characters), form a superb cast. And the outcome is thoroughly satisfying. I probably enjoyed reading this novel more than any of the others."},{"Title":"Doctor Thorne, (The world's classics)","review":"&quot;Dr. Thorne&quot; is the third in the series of Barsetshire novels by Anthony Trollope. But unlike the first two, this has little to do with the politics of the Church of England. It is the tale of two lovers from different classes, and their struggle to keep their love alive in spite of social pressures to go their own ways. Unlike the first two novels, the plot starts out very slowly, with long descriptions of the history and conditions of the fictional &quot;Greshamsbury&quot; estate. The author even apologizes about 30 pages in for trying the patience of his readers.While &quot;Dr. Thorne&quot; lacks the crispness and economy of the first two novels (&quot;The Warden&quot; and &quot;Barchester Towers&quot;), it builds to a satisfying conclusion, and the author paints his usual precise characterizations.If you are a fan of Anthony Trollope, be patient with this one. You will be rewarded."},{"Title":"Doctor Thorne, (The world's classics)","review":"It's impossible to imagine a novel more completely entertaining than DR THORNE. You know from almost the first page how the plot will conclude, but the getting there is delicious.It is not as economically told as THE WARDEN, not as discursive (or laugh-out-loud hilarious) as BARCHESTER TOWERS. Instead it has balance and energy and the characters fairly sparkle, especially the &quot;good&quot; romantic hero and heroine. We are used to allowing the novelist a boring romantic interest, as long as we're given other pleasures along the way; but Frank and Mary may just be the most fun personalities in their own story. No mean feat, as any reader knows, the creation of virtuous characters who are also sharp and amusing enough to carry their weight. Frank's quasi-courtship of Miss Dunstable, the delightful if ugly &quot;oil of Lebanon&quot; heiress, is a brilliant stroke, and the happy ending is (very carefully) not reached until Frank has proven himself worthy of it.You feel in such good hands with Trollope. Nothing too awful will happen to anyone, at least not without much warning, and all the deserving characters will get their heart's desire. It's like sitting down after a good dinner over brandy with a friend who is incomparably witty, candid, and good-natured. It might, literarily speaking, be fluff, after all; but it's fluff raised to an art form."},{"Title":"Doctor Thorne, (The world's classics)","review":"When we ask someone if they are engaged, we are asking if they have made with their partner an explicit and reciprocal promise to enter marriage. When Mary Thorne is asked the question, she takes it literally and means something wholly different.Mary Thorne is the niece and adopted daughter of the eponymous main character of the novel, Doctor Thorne. (If you'll permit an aside before proceeding, Trollope begins the novel by addressing the question of who is in fact the main character of his novel. He doesn't answer this question, rather he leaves the final verdict up to the reader.) Though a member of an ancient Barsetshire family, Doctor Thorne's material fortunes have fallen and he cannot hope to arrange a marriage of wealth for his niece. However, this hardly matters since the doctor wishes his niece happiness, not wealth, and when prospects of wealth do come her way, he is rather perplexed as to what he should do.Another important character, young Mr. Frank Gresham, is in a similar situation, though in his case his fortunes are falling rather than already fallen. As Doctor Thorne does for his niece, Frank cares for his happiness rather than his wealth. Alas, Frank's family has decided he must marry money. He objects and declares his love for Ms. Mary Thorne. She reciprocates Frank's feelings for her but in the face of his family's opposition, and their accusations of impropriety on her part, she cannot accept his proposal.And yet Mary declares herself engaged even when she's renounced her beloved. Her heart is engaged to his and she cannot move it. He may do as he pleases, he may follow the wishes of his family and marry another. It doesn't matter, her heart will be nonetheless engaged to his with no prospect of turning to another.It is this precise use of words and this detailed development of a plot turning on the quite literal nuances of an idiom which make Anthony Trollope's books a joy to read. This chapter of Trollope's Chronicles of Barsetshire, his \\"Com&eacute;die Humaine\\", is as satisfying as the previous two, and I warmly recommend it.Vincent Poirier, Dublin"},{"Title":"Doctor Thorne, (The world's classics)","review":"OK, I'm a Trollope fan, and I sometimes wonder why these novels about social interactions 150 years ago interest me so much when I know I would have suffocated in such a rigid society.First of all, Trollope describes human behaviour in a way I can understand better than any other novelist. I suffer from mild asperger syndrome, and am often baffled by peoples' behaviour in real life. I think I get some relief from this frustration by watching Trollope's characters while the author makes their motives clear and enables me to feel real compassion for them.His novels reflect his belief that English gentlemen had found something close to the ideal system of values, and they explore the effects of someone violating those values, or of difficulties arising as they try to fit special circumstances into them.In some of his other novels, he has been accused of antisemitism, and by modern standards there is some truth to this. I do not believe it was his intention to attack Jews, but in his efforts to plausibly create characters who did not behave like English gentlemen, he used the examples he saw of people who were raised in different cultures, but were to be found in London society. This issue does not arise in Dr. Thorne, partly because it is set in the country.Dr. Thorne contains one scene that (to me) perfectly exemplifies his virtues. Dr. Thorne asks the heroine if she would like to be rich. She mentions a trivial luxury she would buy if she were. He offers to buy it for her. I will not spoil your enjoyment of her reply, but it moved me deeply.I'm sure Trollope had no idea that this novel also illustrates why Britain later lost her world empire. It was written in 1858, twelve years before the Franco-Prussian war demonstrated that Germany was the rising power that must challenge England, thanks to the Prussian education system's emphasis on technical skills, but after Prussia had achieved a higher rate of economic growth than England.A very successful railway engineer-businessman (a Bill Gates?) is drinking himself to death, and Dr. Thorne asks why.'Oh my God! Have you not unbounded wealth? Can you not do anything you wish? anything you choose?''No' and the sick man shrieked with an energy that made him audible all throughout the house. 'I can do nothing that I would choose to do; be nothing that I would wish to be! What can I do? What can I be? What gratification can I have except the brandy bottle? If I go among gentlemen, can I talk to them? If they have anything to say about a railway, they will ask me a question: if they speak to me beyond that I must be dumb.'It is not clear to me that Trollope recognized that this describes a limitation in the English gentlemen, let alone that this limitation would ultimately doom the empire. The US is definitely treating Bill Gates better than this."},{"Title":"Doctor Thorne, (The world's classics)","review":"...which is what this lovely, gentle book feels like. Smaller in scope than its predecessor (the sprawling, boisterous \\"Barchester Towers\\"), \\"Doctor Thorne\\" is more of a character study; the story of a simple man facing difficult decisions. Not that it's in any way devoid of Trollope's incisive social insights or intuitive humor. If you're a fan of this particular writer, or the English comedy of manners in general, this will be an enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Doctor Thorne, (The world's classics)","review":"Making money and a good marriage: the bulwarks of solid middle-class society, and the theme of Trollope's third Barchester novel. The good Dr. Thorne has raised his brother's illegitimate daughter Mary, and she and Frank Gresham fall in love. Unfortunately for Frank his once well-off family is now in desperate straits, and he is implored to \\"marry money\\" - which pretty much rules Mary out. He goes off to seek his fortune with the rich Miss Dunstable, but cannot be untrue to Mary, and in a very humorous chapter, Miss Dunstable calls him out.Unknown to everyone except the reader and Dr. Thorne, however, Mary will inherit a great fortune if events go a certain way, and, of course, they do. The reader is, therefore, cheated out of the \\"surprise\\" waiting Mary at the end, but the scenes preceding this of Frank going through the motions of pleasing his family while he and Mary remain faithful to each other is worth that disappointment. The chapter in which Dr. Thorne stands up to Lady Arabella (Frank's mother) and defends Mary after she's been banished from the Gresham home after being seen as an obstacle to Frank's marrying money, is a highlight of the novel. Just as good, of course, is the scene near the end where Mary defends herself against Lady Arabella. Trollope didn't think much of this novel; in fact, he couldn't understand why it was so popular with the public, but he's been about the only one to feel that way. Perhaps not as good as BARCHESTER TOWERS, it's still one of Trollope's most enjoyable works."},{"Title":"Doctor Thorne, (The world's classics)","review":"Dr. Thorne, the third book in Anthony Trollope's six book series The Chronicles of Barsetshire, can easily be read as a stand-alone novel. The plot is deceptively simple; Mary Thorne, an illegitimate child, falls in love with the son of the local squire. The son, Frank Gresham, loves Mary, but is told he must marry wealth to save the estate. The entire five hundred page novel centers on this problem; some modern readers may find the story line a bit thin for their taste. In the next novel in the series, Framley Parsonage, the story line is similar, but with an expanded cast of characters and plot twists and turns - Framley Parsonage is a more satisfying novel, in my opinion.Even so, I recommend Dr. Thorne for these reasons: Trollope was a psychoanalyst who understood more about the inner life of human beings than some of those professionals who make their living by listening to people talk about their problems. We come to know and understand Mary Thorne from the inside out and we are better for this knowledge. Additionally, few novelists equal Trollope as an observer and chronicler of wealth and class in English society, and wealth and class are what Dr. Thorne is about. Mary is poor and illegitimate. Even though she is loved by all around her, illegitimacy and poverty appear to make it impossible for her to rise in station to become Frank's wife. Yet at the time Trollope was writing his novel, great wealth could overcome all obstacles. Will Mary Thorne become Cinderella and win her prince charming? Most readers will accurately guess the outcome of the story.Trollope enjoyed conversing directly with us his readers and he does so frequently in Dr. Thorne. Henry James might have found this novelistic technique artificial, but not me. I enjoyed Trollope's comments, not only about his characters, but also about life and living. He had great sensitivity to the plight of women in Victorian Society and treated his heroine Mary Thorne with loving care and sensitivity.While Dr. Thorne is not one of Trollope's finest novels, it is still better than almost anything the reader is likely to find on the current best seller list."},{"Title":"Doctor Thorne, (The world's classics)","review":"DOCTOR THORNE is the third installment of Anthony Trollope's Barchester Cycle, preceded by THE WARDEN (ISBN#0140432140) and BARCHESTER TOWERS (ISBN#0192834320). You don't have to read the first two installments in the cycle to enjoy DOCTOR THORNE, though they are highly recommended, and will give a good background as to the goings-on in Barchester at the time that the tale commences.Dr Thorne is the oldest son of a respected prebendary (some position in the Church of England), and elder brother to Henry Thorne, a notorious drunk and cad. The Thorne family can trace its noble roots to times before the Norman invasion of England, and they are very proud of it. (If you have read BARCHESTER TOWERS, you may recall Dr and Miss Thorne of Ullathorne - cousins of this Dr Thorne.) Though he is not heir to the estate of Ullathorne, Dr Thorne is still highly respected in Barchester as a doctor, and welcomed at his ancestral home.But then trouble. Henry Thorne has seduced, drugged, and impregnated a young seamstress, Mary Scatcherd. Her brother Roger, also a notorious toper, is furious, and kills his sister's seducer. Though Miss Scatchered has not been disgraced by the affair, she too must leave town, should she have any hope of a normal, happy life. Her fiance begs her to leave the child behind in England and emigrate to America to start over. Dr Thorne arranges for legal representation for his brother's murderer, sees that Roger gets a short prison term, and takes it upon himself to raise his brother's daughter. Dr Thorne leaves Barchester for Greshamsbury to start anew, after disowning his family at Ullathorne, and establishes himself with the Greshams of Greshamsbury, the wealthiest 'commoners' in the county. Or they used to be.Over the years, Frank Gresham, Sr. has mortgaged the estate to the hilt. He has been horrible at managing his funds, and with ten children and a wife who insists on spending as though they had all they wanted, he is broke. Worse for him htough, is that his only son, Frank, Jr., has come of age and is ready to find a wife.His mother and countess-aunt have agreed: if the estate is to be spared, Frank must marry a rich woman. They scheme and contrive to marry off the young heir, but to no use. Frank, ignorant as everyone else is of the story of her birth, is in love with Dr Thorne's niece: poor, illegitimate Mary Thorne. And then the novel begins.Trollope has created another masterpiece here: never have I endured so much suspense reading a what amounts to a romance novel (though, their is plenty of politics and legal scandal for those who enjoy that too.) There are perfectly orchestrated twists, cliffhanging moments that will have you on the edge of your seat, and plenty of dramatic irony. Of course, it all turns out alright in the end - it always does, but you won't believe it until the last page.They really need to put a warning label on Anthony Trollope's novels that reads 'Careful: Addictive, may cause sleepless nights becuase you can't put it down.' Great novel, extremely entertaining, and highly recommended."},{"Title":"Doctor Thorne, (The world's classics)","review":"Volume 3 in Trollope's Barchester series moves away from the intricacies of church politics and focuses on the English caste system in the mid 19th century.The novel is called after a man whom Trollope declares as his hero: a poor country doctor with professional competence and an admirable honest stubbornness, a bachelor who lives with a lovely niece, whom he treats like a daughter. Doc Thorne is a proud man, proud to be a poor man from a high family.The niece might be considered the real heroine. She is an illegitimate child of the Doc's late brother with a woman who emigrated with another man, leaving the girl behind. The girl's social status is that of a pariah, which begins to be relevant when men start seeing her as a woman.She is a proud and smart person, with a mind at war with itself. She fully accepts the social ranking system that condemns her to be an underdog. She knows that she is a superior person in all other respects.Trollope is overdoing his communication with the reader a little here. He insists on telling us that the real hero of the novel is young Frank Gresham, the local squire's only son. Frank is just growing up in the world and needs to find his way in questions of rank and preferences. He finds out that all is not well with the estate and that he better finds a way to marry money if he wants to keep up the life style that he has grown up expecting. Or are emotions more important? One has social duties as well!The ground is thus prepared for a plot with psychological and social depth, all wrapped in satirical fun poked at pretensions and stupidity. Maybe Trollope's most Austenian novel, at least among those that I know so far."},{"Title":"Delicate Ape","review":"Written in 1944, this book gives a reader of the 21st century a sense of the post war period while being immerced in a page-turning thriller.

Because of what happened to her father, Isabel is raised with one goal, one driving motivation that forces her to drown out all of her natural needs and desires in order to attain it: gaining revenge on the hero's family. And to achieve this end, she is raised as a man. Raised to fight like a man, dress like a man, think like a man. Raised to be a warrior in the truest sense of the word... But she is a warrior with a woman's wounded heart. With this, her second book, Ms. Callen has risen to new levels by giving us a multi-faceted heroine who breaks the bounds. Isabel is hard as nails on the outside, yet vulnerable on the inside, unsure of herself and her ability to be a woman that any man - but particularly the handsome James Markham - could desire for his own. With superb writing style and excellently drawn, unique and exciting characters, Ms. Callen has written another winner in A Knight's Vow. Well worth every penny and then some!"},{"Title":"A Knight's Vow","review":"Anyone who is threatened by seeing a strong, capable, feisty heroine should probably stick to reading Snow White. For the rest of us--strong women who aren't afraid of our own innate feminine power, this book is a gem that will be treasured down through the ages. Not only is it stunningly well written, brilliantly plotted, and thrilling all the way through, it is also a bonafide work of feminist literature. This book is a prime example of why and how romance fiction can be empowering to women everywhere. The genre has changed. It's by women, for women, about women. Strong, smart, independent women who tolerate no nonsense and demand not only love, but respect and honor from their men. Brava Ms. Callen! Well done!"},{"Title":"A Knight's Vow","review":"I really loved the twist of having the heroine dress as a man and be nearly as good with a sword as her enemy/husband James. And their verbal sparring was terrific--kept me laughing and turning the pages. I also found it very touching that for all their bravado, the hero and heroine each had a vulnerable side which they had to confront in order to finally surmount their differences. Definitely one for my &quot;keeper&quot; shelf!"},{"Title":"A Knight's Vow","review":"Author Gayle Callen, who writes with enthusiasm, did not shrink from her depiction of Isabel \\"Black Angel\\" Atherstone. James Markham was also easy to visualize. Unfortunately, only Isabel had ambition in the one-note plot of A KNIGHT'S VOW. The Black Angel's attempts to achieve her goal of revenge though, were enacted through a series of scenes that led nowhere and became repetitious. Poor Isabel's low self-esteem made her a pitiable rather than a sympathetic character.Neither hero nor heroine fulfilled any need in the other, evolved, or worked together toward a common purpose. They did make numerous attempts to have sex, but were always interrupted. This tiresome devise of many romance novels rarely builds tension (let them DO IT already) so when a couple finally comes together it had better be good. Sorry to disappoint, but this consummation was not climactic. In fact, the story, itself, had no climax.Use your apparent talent, Ms. Callen. Give your characters something to do and a story to do it in."},{"Title":"A Knight's Vow","review":"The Black Angel (Isabel Atherstone)is out to seek revenge on James, the Earl of Bolton. She blames him for his father gravely wounding her father in a tournament. She has few if any female traits: dresses as a man, swaggers like a man, sword fights like a man. James has the patience of a saint. If I read one more chapter where Isabel humiliates James I think I would have put the book down. If you read the story you will also see that the front cover gives a totally inaccurate picture of the hero. Are the cover artists or publishers afraid to show a less then perfect hero?"},{"Title":"The Noodle Maker: A Novel","review":"Is it just Ma Jian or is China so bereft of soul that people have a one dimensional inner life? Contrast this with the stories of the poor in Appalachia by Barbara Kingsolver, in Prodigal Summer where relationships between people are rich, and where the idea of cremating one's very alive mother for the experience of it would be beyond contemplation.I have traveled in China both before and after Ma Jian's stories took place and did not find the nihilism he portrays to be particularly prevalent. His satire is perhaps on a par with Voltaire's Candide, but I don't find it particularly illuminating. Even people who navigate the shoals of the Cultural Revolution, the Great Leap Foreward and The Great Awakening have depths and his portrayal robs them of any dignity."},{"Title":"The Noodle Maker: A Novel","review":"Sardonic... insightful... hilarious... satirical... curious... elliptical... Gogolesque... playful... surreal... bitingly sarcastic... cosmic... bizarre... magical... Kafkaesque... touching... disturbing... profound... hugely entertaining.How many ways can a marvelous work of fiction be praised? Ma Jian's THE NOODLE MAKER deserves all these accolades, and more. This is a dead-on depiction of life's vagaries and absurdities in the earliest years of Communist China, yet it transcends both time and place to describe the human condition.Set just after Deng Xiaoping's pronunciation of the Open Door Policy to modernize and open China to Western ideas and business, THE NOODLE MAKER tells the story of two friends, a professional writer named Sheng and a professional blood donor nicknamed Vlazerim. Sheng has been charged by his Writer's Association to pen a short novel about a modern-day Lei Feng, an actual Red Army soldier who died in his country's service and was effectively canonized by Mao for his supposed good deeds while alive. Not only can Sheng not think of anyone to write about, he can only think of stories drawn from his own acquaintances, people whose actions illustrate the most unconventional responses to Deng's vision of a \\"new China.\\"Most of the book consists of stories Sheng would have written had he been granted the artistic freedom. He begins with undoubtedly his best piece, the story of a young man who buys a used kiln from an art school and turns it into an upscale crematorium, complete with corpse pick-up service and a wide range of legal and illicit music for the deceased to swoon to as he or she enters the furnace. The young man and his mother become wealthy from his business, enough so that the mother decides her time has come to move on to the next life. Other stories deal with a failed actress who arranges her own, very public suicide in the jaws of a tiger, a middle-aged editor who embarks on a series of love trysts until he encounters a textile worker who won't let go, a writer of love (and rejection) letters who comes to realize that he himself can love someone, a woman whose large breasts ruin her life and career, and a painter who lives with a philosophical talking dog.Ma Jian tells each story with panache and a wonderful sense of comic timing. His characters are absurd and their actions grotesque, yet they lovably empathetic, each in his or her own peculiar way. The characters' lives and stories are cleverly interconnected, so that as the novel unfolds, we begin to see a community, not just a random collection of individuals. At the same time, each story offers sharply satirical and wonderfully funny commentary on life in a socialist state bent on control of every detail of peoples' lives. The result is a society so full of rules, all rules are meaningless.Some readers will be reminded by this book of DEAD SOULS, or perhaps Kafka's THE TRIAL or THE CASTLE. For me, THE NOODLE MAKER was most reminiscent of Italo Calvino's IF ON A WINTER'S NIGHT A TRAVELER, a collection of short tales exchanged between Marco Polo and Genghis Khan. This is a wonderful short novel, one of the best I've read in recent years. Sadly, it may well pass largely unnoticed by the public, lacking the advertising and name recognition of far less deserving works by Grisham, Clancy, or King. That such should be the case is undoubtedly another one of life's ironies that Ma Jian's characters would have duly noted with a sigh."},{"Title":"The Noodle Maker: A Novel","review":"I picked up this book and read a few stories from it when my girlfriend was reading it. The writing is witty and very insightful to the workings and ironies of modern day china. I would recommend this book to anybody as being one of the best I have encountered in the last few years. It is rare to find a writer who can amuse you while being so revealing about the painful, beautiful, and absurd of a culture. I'm going to get my own copy to pass around and one for my mother too."},{"Title":"The Noodle Maker: A Novel","review":"Ma Jian, Noodle Maker. 1991. New York: FSG, 2004.The English translation of this wonderful book only came out 13 years after it was published (wisely) in Hong Kong. Its structure is a tapestry of interconnected fables (\\"noodles\\") emanating from the mind of an impoverished writer, the noodle maker. Between stories the reader is treated to hilarious colloquies between the noodle maker and his permanent weekly guest, a professional blood donor. The tales are wild and original, and reach quite deeply. They include a benign version of Animal Farm, The Lady and the Tiger, and a generous helping of anti-Communist commentary aimed at the stupid bureaucracy and forced rote memorization of patriotic songs with ridiculous lyrics, such as \\"Our beloved Party, you have been like a mother to me,\\" played over loudspeakers in an attempt to break up a mob engaging in gang rape outside West Friendship Park. \\"Chairman Mao's Brilliance Lights Up the World\\" was also played. Five very large stars."},{"Title":"The Noodle Maker: A Novel","review":"Ma Jian's The Noodle Maker is a collection of very loosely connected stories narrated by a professional propogandist (or \\"professional writer\\") to his friend and confidant, the 'professional blood-donor' over an elaborate dinner the blood-donor provides. The stories are about the people the writer observes on the street and knows professionally and includes such diverse characters as a painter who claims to have had a talking three legged dog to a 'street writer' who provides his services to lovesick teenagers wanting to impress their sweethearts with love letters of deep feeling. Flora Drew's translation of this volume is very fluid and satisfying.I greatly enjoyed Ma Jian's work and 'am eager to get hold of his other books, Red Dust and Stick Out Your Tongue."},{"Title":"The Noodle Maker: A Novel","review":"What do you get when you mix a career blood donor and a propaganda writer? A book that will get your blood pumping while you laugh. The characters are, uh ..... unique.What I learned: If you are considering cremation, you may want to re-think it. Plus, don't trust your love life to someone with a street cart. And, don't let your girlfriend have a cat.Banned in PRC for very obvious reasons."},{"Title":"The Noodle Maker: A Novel","review":"Two old friends - a professional blood donor (a profit seeker) and a state employed writer (an idealist) - meet up for a regular dinner. The latter compains about his latest assignment: a book about a Communist hero. He yearns to write about other people:'A young entrepreneur who runs a private crematorium; an illegal migrant who writes letters for the illiterate; a father who spends his life trying to get rid of his retarded daughter...These are people he knows, has read about or sees every day on the streets...But he is fully aware that if he wrote about these sad and feeble characters, his leaders would consider him unfit for the post of professional writer'.In a series of interlinked short stories, the writer tells the stories of these characters...An excellent translation by Flora Drew. Interesting read although sometimes I felt the hidden meanings escaped me!"},{"Title":"The Noodle Maker: A Novel","review":"Having been a big fan of Chinese and Japanese literature, I was surprised I had not read any Ma Jian until recently. Lately I have been enjoying a lot of Ha Jin, Yiyun Li, and Yu Hua; but I would place the works of Ma Jian at least on par with Ha Jin (though Ma Jian writes in Chinese and has his work brilliantly translated by Flora Drew).The novel is made up of several intertwining stories taken from the fictional 'professional writers' life. The reader is drawn into China during the period of the 'Open Door Policy'. The first story is arguably the best (Swooner), but all have a wonderful realism and eye-opening events. The characters are richly developed; most are depraved, downtrodden, or just depressed. But throughout all, the reader can glimpse supporting characters who have made peace with the life they live.I would not recommend this to an Asian literature novice; perhaps some of the stories of Ha Jin or Yiyun Li might be a better introduction to Chinese lit.This is a wonderful translation and is a well paced read."},{"Title":"The Noodle Maker: A Novel","review":"Not for everyone. Some strange and macabre stories that left me mystified. Still, it's fascinating. A great read for those who want something different."},{"Title":"The Noodle Maker: A Novel","review":"I read this book immediately after finishing Mo Yan's Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out (highly recommended) and the contrast couldn't be more extreme. Where Mo Yan's book gently pokes fun at both the Maoist era and the Open Door policy that followed it, this book is merciless. It depicts an absurd, often violent slice of life in the Open Door period. The two \\"main characters\\"- if that is the right word- are a professional writer and a professional blood donor who meet for one of their regular dinners and get into discussions about what is right and wrong with their lives, and by extension the China they live in. Each succeeding chapter tells the story of another character - an actress who stages her own suicide, an entrepreneur who runs a home made crematorium, a painter, and so on. At first it is not clear how they are connected, but their lives seem to connect in strange ways. All of the stories are very bleak and sad, especially the one about the young woman with the big breasts. The depict a China of warped values and institutional cruelty that seems like a horrible place to live. I have been to China three times (as an individual, not with tour groups)and most of the people I have met are very pleasant. I cannot say reading this book was a pleasant experience, but I am glad I read it. I greatly respect Ma Jian as a writer (I've read three of his books so far), and his views of China bear listening to. In retrospect I wish I'd read him first and then Mo Yan. I'd have been left in a much more upbeat frame of mind."},{"Title":"The Noodle Maker: A Novel","review":"DD could mean disturbingly delightful, or delightfully disturbing. Both descriptions seem to fit this book equally well. I picked this one up (random choice, I admit) on sale at a bookstore, and it was worth every penny, and more!Ma Jian captures the spirit of post Tiananmen China in this satirical novel, through a dialog between a professional writer and a professional blood donor. This is not the kind of book you judge based on reviews...its the kind of book you simply have to read, because its worth it."},{"Title":"Human rights, equality and democratic renewal in Northern Ireland.","review":"In Human Rights, Equality And Democratic Renewal In Northern Ireland, editor Colin Harvey has gathered ten knowledgeable and articulate contributors to survey several key aspects of the Good Friday Agreement of 1998 which marked a significant departure from the incrementalism and dominate political logic of British constitutionalism. The contributors include Gordon Anthony, Andrew Evans, Colin J. Harvey, John Jackson, Stephen Livingstone, Christopher McCrudden, Kieran McEvoy, Linda Moore, John Morison, and Mary O'Rawe.

I truly enjoyed using it while tutoring a fourth grade remedial reader because it was simple, yet beautifully worded and superbly illustrated. Each illustration is a marvelous nature portrait in itself. My fourth grade student (who happens to be very interested in science) savored each lovely portrait, as we talked about the animals and environments depicted in each one. Though the words are few and simple, the book avoids being overly childish. Rather, it respectfully presents the cycle of the day (morning, noon and night) and the beauty of various animals as they act in their natural environments throughout the day."},{"Title":"Morning, Noon, and Night","review":"Bought this as a baby shower gift.

I have issus wth the organization of the verses and the verses not matching the illustrations.One problem lies in that each verse cites up to five different animals and that not all the animals are pictured on the pages. This is very confusing for my four year old who asks me where a certain animal is pictured and it simply is not there. Other pages where the verse references time of day (afternoon) and no animals, show animals. Why not have pictured simple landscapes with skies that relate to that time of day instead? For example the picture for noon doesn't even show a sun, let alone a bright shining sun, it shows a close up of bison, and bison are not mentioned in that passage at all.Sometimes the animals within one passage are not even related to each other by habitat. An example is mentioning a stork, killdeer and a cardinal in the same passage. Yes, they are all birds but they just aren't in the same habitat, preventing them from being depicted in an illustration together. I'd have prefered mentioning three ocean dwelling creatures within one passage, even if some were birds, some fish, and some ocean dwelling mammals.I do love picture books that feature seasonal themes or time-of-day themes. I also love books that feature animals.I have never seen such an annoying arrangement of verses and such a mismatch of words with illustrations in a picture book for young children. For this confusion and annoyance, I grant one star. I dislike it so much that I can't stand to read it to my children and am donating it to my local library."},{"Title":"Sailing Through Six Sigma - Book & CD Set","review":"&quot;I have been certified as a Black Belt in a plant of Johnson Controls who manufactures Trim Covers during the last 2 1/2 years in Cd. Juarez, Mexico and when I saw the title of Sailing Through Six Sigma had the curiosity to see its content just to know more about this field that has captured my efforts during this time. My surprise was that this book is more oriented to the deployment of Six Sigma as a business strategy in any company who wants to be world class or simply to survive in the near future improving its processes, than the full exposition of a variety of statistical techniques. Although I knew how to deploy the strategy in our plant, I was not aware of the full implications of the deployment of Six Sigma as a business strategy. Reading this book helped me to see exactly what is needed, when is needed and how to do it and the people responsible to do it. Specially, the chapter of how to perform successfully a Six Sigma project since the very beginning to its conclusion was outstanding because during the time I have been involved in performing projects, my concern has been also how to be succesfull in this issue. So the book's structure is well planned and esy to follow, specially the formats are helpfull to see how to go from one step to the next one in order of importance.

The graphic artist is wonderful. I could hear Tom Peters already ranting about the presentation and design of the book especially when compared to others. The first chapter provides a nice Six Sigma introduction devoid of the sales hype that exists in other Six Sigma books. It succinctly answers the what's, the who's, the benefits, the how's, and the whys of Six Sigma. The factoid I liked best in this chapter is that Six Sigma isn't twice as good as three sigma; it's 20,000 times better.

This is a key work regarding the Pilgrims, their names, places of origin, vital statistics, and family relationships and group sheets. More, perhaps, has been written about the Pilgrims than any other small group in our history. And yet they are extravagantly praised for doing that which they never even attempted nor intended to do, and through historical misinformation are given attitudes and attributes which they did not possess. The pilgrims are still confused with the Puritans who settled north of them around Boston Bay. This biographical work will draw a true distinction between the real truth and the fallacy regarding the Pilgrims, which were as much a force in England and Holland before they crossed the waters, as when they finally came here to what would become the United States and made it their legacy. Chapters include Plymouth Rock and the Pilgrim Saga; the Postmaster at Scrooby; Ye Lord's Free People; Scandal in Brownists Alley; At the Green Gate, Leyden; The Merchant Adventurers; A Waighty Voiage; Mutiny on the Mayflower; Babes in the Wilderness; New Plimoth Planted; Yellow Feather, the Big Chief; Cold Comfort for Hungrie Bellies; Liquidation of Wessagusset; Unsavorie Salte; the Undertakers; Purge of Joylity; Into ye Briers; Minister Trouble; The Pilgrim Company (a list of names, kin, and vital statistics); Officers of the Old Colony and of the Pilgrim Church (a roster); and more. This work has been written using excerpt from the colonists diaries and letters, and has as much to do with the background of who and what they were in England, and Why they left to embark on a new life, fronting untold hardships to become the white Ancestor Americans. The period of History referred to in the book is generally the years 1600-1665. Some of the name mentioned in the rosters are Christopher Jones; Isaac Allerton; Mrs. Mary Morris; Moses Maverick; Thomas Cushman; William Bradford; William Brewster; John Carver; George Laggatt; Francis Cooke; John Crackston; Moses Fletcher; Samuel Fuller; John Goodman; Degory Priest; Thomas Rogers; Edward Tilley; John Tilley; Thomas Tinker; John Turner; William White; Edward Winslow; John Billington; Gregory Armstrong; Richard Britteridge; Peter Browne; James Chilton; Richard Clarke; Humility Cooper; Francis Eaton; Edward Fuller; Richard Gardiner; Stephen Hopkins; Edmund Margeson; Christopher Martin; William Mullins; Henry Samson; Myles Standish; Richard Warren; Thomas Williams; John Alden; John Allerton; Thomas English; William Trevore; William Latham; John Howland; William Butten; Edward Dotey; and several more just in the Mayflower roster. Many of these men have their wives listed, and it seems that most had at least three wives. Again this is a pivotal genealogical work for research on the early colonists, where &amp; when they were born, and how and when they died."},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"Oh the clothes, the fame, the pain....and all given up for the boys...a foundation of guilt?

There it was...the spine of Krasnow's &quot;surrendering to Motherhood&quot;. I picked it up and over the course of the next six months I did it over and over again each time I visited the coffeehouse. I finally purchased that copy, and have read and reread it. It has been a lifeline to my own sanity, a guaranteed chuckle when I feel like sobbing and has given me a thread of hope that I am not alone in my longing to sit all day and watch my girls at play.

Although she professes a respect for other women's choices, the message of this book is that anything less than a stay-at-home mother represents a disservice to one's children. As a full time professional and mother of 8&amp;10 year old children, I don't buy it - and given that Ms. Krasnow managed to pump this book out between egg-scraping episodes - I don't think she really does either."},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"The author hits me where I live. Iris Krasnow reflects to me the conflict between being career driven and following my heart and probably my biology. In the early days of motherhood I rapidly forgot why I ever worked late in the evenings or on weekends. Eventually, I could not imagine leaving my baby for few hours. It absolutely felt like I was surrendering to my destiny: mommy and nurturer of the family. In several different ways, the author attaches words to this emotional shift that a new baby creates, and out of the storm she finds that there is a logical truth. We are here to be companions and guides to the children that we create. When we can be clear about our own drives, we find that focusing on the little people in our lives is our fullfillment and never a sacrifice"},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"This reads just like a magazine article: light, chatty, and lots of little personal anecdotes and mini-descriptions of other women's experiences. I sped right through it. Four kids so close together, though, is pretty intense. And, apparently, they are all still quite young. It doesn't seem as if she has a lot of perspective, time-wise that is, to talk from. Some of us spread our kids out more, and do juggle stuff just fine. Her all or nothing conclusion seems rooted in her choice to have so many kids so quick. Also, I'm the mom of only boys, too, and I felt a little uncomfortable with her implied assumptions about them being so different from girls. Bottom-line, she seems to have really bought into Ozzie and Harriet, to the exclusion of the real world."},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"I am inspired about my responsibility as a mother of two energetic little girls. Thank you, Iris for writing a book that affirms the worth of women, smart and capable women, who set aside other aspirations to be home with their babies. I've listened to many mothers of grown children speak fondly of that frenzied season of life when their babies were little, as if longing at times to recapture even a moment of it all. And I've heard regrets about not having really been there enough. But, I've never had any woman complain to me that she was there for her children too much.I'm glad we as women have more choices today; but I think all parents, mommies AND daddies, need to be careful that we don't live too much for the future. I think C.S. Lewis makes the point well in his classic &quot;Screwtape Letters,&quot; that God would have us set our hearts on eternity and the present, pondering the future only &quot;just so much as is necessary for NOW planning the acts of justice or charity which will probably be [our] duty tomorrow.&quot; Iris Krasnow does a wonderful job sharing some of those priceless moments of living in the present, &quot;being where you are when you are there,&quot; with her four boys. As parents we have the difficult assignment of providing for our children, not just materially, but emotionally and spiritually. Children can't be put on hold. We moms and dads have been chosen to love, nurture, and provide for them for a few short years and we should consider it a high calling. We should do all within our power to do the job well, and that in itself is a noble and ambitious task.I would never want to add to any mother's guilt (don't mothers feel guilty enough already?) for taking advantage of some help with her duties. Everyone needs a break once in awhile. But I think Iris is right in calling her choice a &quot;surrendering to motherhood,&quot; for she is letting go of her past life and giving freely the attention (the love) her little people need from her today."},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"A book that generates the kinds of strong-minded opinions seen in these reviews merits the quick read required to get through Surrendering to Motherhood. Although I don't agree with Iris' opinions in all areas and didn't require as much time in life as she did to recognize the pure joy and peace-amidst-chaos that accompanies motherhood, I found her book full of powerful insights, intriguing explorations, and beautiful experiences to which I could relate. Some view the surrender of self to a higher purpose as a weak-minded sellout. Choosing to prioritize family over one's self requires greater strength, integrity, wisdom, independence, and confidence in one's identity and purpose than any other role that can be filled by a woman. This kind of surrender does not exclude women who work as Iris notes. She does a wonderful job of exemplifying how surrender to motherhood results in complete fulfillment and a peace with one's identity that cannot be fully understood without allowing priorities to be reorganized."},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"This book is nothing but HEIGHTS of Hippocrisy and audacity by an upper class lady who has slept with all the men in the world and ultimately by the age of 40 produces 4 kids and hires a full-time nanny cum house keeper andstill manages to make millions by writing crap stuff ....She frequently quotes Baba Dass and other Spiritual Teachers to make us feel she is an intellect .Don't waste your precious time reading 200 pages of non-sense .This is just a biography of this hippocrite self indulgent upper class woman.That's it !"},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"Iris Krasnow paints an honest picture of the struggle moms face between career and home. &quot;Surrendering to Motherhood&quot; is an affirmation for at-home moms struggling with their decision to stay home with their children. It is also a wake up call for career women who have chosen the workplace. It is a reminder that children grow up too quickly, and that it is up to us to capture and savor these precious years. Most rewarding for me were memories Krasnow shares from past interviews with celebrities and politicians, and descriptions of day to day interactions with her own children. There is much pressure on women today to &quot;have it all&quot;. Krasnow reminds us that in staying home with our children we do &quot;have it all&quot;."},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"I think this is what I was looking for when I picked it up off the shelf - a book that is honest about how tiring and difficult parenting can be, and at the same time realizes the glimpses of the spiritual one can find through the most exhausting and seemingly menial tasks. (a bit like the Quotidian Mysteries and Kathleen Norris). I really felt this book shaping me as I read it - giving me a new way to view the prospect of motherhood. Krasnow is honest about the difficulties and the grime, so I can trust her when she also talks about the gifts and the wonder.There was only one gap in the book for me - the role of fathers. Krasnow did describe the difficulty she experienced in her marriage and alluded to the role having 4 children so quickly played in these problems. She described how she and her husband worked on their marriage and held it together.However, throughout the book, she talks about parenting and the highs it brings her without reflecting on her husband's role in raising the boys. What highs does parenting bring him? Is he ever around? I would have expected more &quot;together my husband and I did this great thing with the kids&quot; or &quot;after we had all the boys in bed, we reflected on the day together and such-and-such that little so-and-so did and what the boys meant to us&quot;. Maybe Krasnow decided she wanted to appeal more to single mothers and cut much of the mention of her husband's role in parenting the boys out of the book. All I know is that part of parenting is learning to share the children and the caretaking with your mate, and this was not addressed.Back to the positive, after you begin to read the book it turns into a real page-turner, which is rare for a book of its genre. Krasnow includes enough of her life to make it feel like a story, so it keeps you interested until the end. She also includes excerpts from her interviews with some very interesting figures (Barbara Bush, Yoko Ono, Queen Noor, etc. etc.) from her days as a journalist. These excerpts flow very nicely into the story. Krasnow also shares some insight she has gained about her own parents, including her pain of losing her father. These become assets to the book as well.All in all, I would highly recommend this book to others. I am hoping to find another book that will fill in this one small gap for me. The book really is 90% excellent and 90% is pretty darned good in a book oriented to &quot;parentintg/self-help/spiritual&quot;, a field that too often produces fluff and feel-good-moments that don't last because they placate instead of actually re-shaping you."},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"I would hardly call writing books (she has written two others since Motherhood, I believe), going on book promotion tours, and have nannies and household help &quot;surrendering&quot; to motherhood. Please. She has merely shifted gears and is now surrendering to being the stay-at-home mom cheerleader, without any of the discomforts, the problems, or worries that millions of other women face. And just to add, many women would love to be able to stay at home with their children, at least while they are very young, but can't afford to."},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"Women old enough to remember the l950's will realize there's nothing new here. Anyone who thought the backlash was over will revise her thinking after reading this book.Krasnow waxes poetic on the subject of stay-at-home motherhood and makes a few good observations. What she doesn't do is explain what the woman who sacrifices all for family is supposed to do if she finds herself a single mother with a husband who doesn't pay child support, or a 55-year-old displaced homemaker with nothing to show for her troubles but an ex-husband who's found a younger model and grown children who seldom phone. The author fails to explain why only women are expected to put themselves in this precarious position. I could have sworn it took two people to create a child.One senses a certain amount of dishonesty here, in that the author has managed to turn out a book while preaching the joys of total self-surrender to family.To be fair, Krasnow writes well.

I got a lot from this book, it reminded me of the importance of not rushing through my life but instead enjoying it. It reminded me to enjoy the stages my kids are going through. She emphasizes the power and the freedom we have as mothers.

Her shift from full-time working woman to stay at home mom wasn't an easy one. For those of us who have also found this shift challenging, this book provides validation. Ms. Krasnow emphasizes finding the joy in the mundane, learning that all day, everyday is not fireworks but that there are many, many small joys. An enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"Iris Krasnow captures perfectly the world many of us entered in the late 1970s, when we said to ourselves, &quot;I can have it all!&quot; Then life happened and we matured and realized having it all comes at a price. I loved reliving with Iris all the same dilemmas: wrong-choice boyfriends (but oh the passion!), ego-stroking job offers, baby duty or business suit? I didn't even mind the constant name-dropping, which I suspect helped her get this book published in the first place. Sometimes her angst got tiring, especially toward the end of the book, when she started rambling. But she has the ability to laugh at herself and grow, so I was able to forgive some of the pontificating. And she landed in the same place as I did (and others), overcoming self-absorption and finding spiritual nourishment in family and religion. I hope Iris keeps her intellect sharp and uses it again to enlighten readers in a few years, when the boys reach adolescence and she and Chuck face new challenges and milestones."},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"Be careful what you wish for.

Mostimportantly, she has captured why we have madethose incredible choices. To walk away fromthe known world of career to the unknownworld of motherhood takes courageand strength. Krasnow has both."},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"I came to this book because I had picked up The Secret Lives of Wives at my library and in the first couple of pages realized this author had a history of an approach to marriage and motherhood that I needed to understand in order to fully appreciate her investigation into wifehood. Plus, I was writing a paper on working moms and the (still persistent!) cultural message that \\"we can't have it all,\\" despite the fact that the approximately 70% of American women in the workforce might feel that we are in fact doing a fine job being an employee, raising our kids, participating in family life, and more or less being well-rounded people and contributing members of society. So I admit my approach to Surrendering to Motherhood was antagonistic from the start, and not much in the book persuaded me to feel otherwise.The strength of the book is the memoir portion, when Krasnow keeps the focus on her own life and her own struggles with spirituality. Her transient thrills with est, meditation, and the Bohemian California lifestyle, her pursuit of the \\"high life\\" in Chicago, then Dallas, then Washington, D.C. which reveals to her that all that glitters etc. etc., and her finding of a true spiritual path in her Jewish heritage, which provides her with a depth and meaning for which she'd apparently been ardently searching in various failed love affairs and public acclaim--all of this comes off as sincere and eminently readable. In fact, anyone who has pursued ambition and found ambition is not all--or pursued love and found love elusive--can identify with Krasnow's struggles. That she eventually diagnoses and blames the promises of second-wave feminism for this emptiness is not something I agree with in principle or identify with personally, but I'm not going to argue with her about what she internalized or what she felt.Nor will I argue with her that motherhood is or can be a deeply spiritual experience. If the root of all respectable spiritual traditions is love and connection, the realization that there is no Other, then parenting is the ultimate of experience of that immersion in love, whether it's your own biological kid you've incubated or your child who came to you by other means. (Krasnow, incidentally, doesn't address adoption, surrogacy, IVF, or guardianship as viable parenting options with as potent a spiritual pull; for her, motherhood is gestation, period.) As the mother of a current 18-month-old, I had to laugh at Krasnow's accounts of how the relentless demands of a very small being pretty much demand that you Be Here Now, another mantra of the spiritual path that one has to experience to understand. Her personal struggle to lay to rest her ambition for public approval and admiration to be fully present for and available to the four small beings in her life was heartfelt and believable.My quarrel with the book was when Krasnow, while still identifying herself a feminist, commits the faux pas of assuming her experience is both representative (don't *all* women want to just stay home with their kids? Don't you? she asks the reader at one point) and ideal. The least palatable parts of the book are those in which Krasnow can't help but apply her own system of values to the women around her, and while she professes to respect women who actually do want to leave the house and have their own careers, she really seems to be secretly judging and pitying anyone who hasn't made her choice. Feminism has succeeded in establishing that the personal is political, but the personal is also personal; if we are to achieve real equality, then we all--and women especially--need to respect each other's choices and make every effort to make those choices real. Krasnow doesn't seem to understand that her embracing of domesticity is actually very different from her mother's because she has the fortunate choice of choosing to stay home with her kids (with the help of nannies, babysitters, and housekeepers, it must be said). She freely chides Simone de Beauvoir or Betty Friedan because she, Krasnow, actually likes housework and marriage, not seeming to realize she might feel very differently about them if they had been her only possible path and not a choice she made because she had the good fortune to a) have a successful career to put on hold and b) a spouse whose income can support the family + help. What's least palatable about the book is Krasnow's repeated repetition on the virtues and rewards of motherhood, for her, without once acknowledging how very fortunate she is to *have* the choice to make. Without this acknowledgment, she starts to sound like the rest of the voices of the backlash, who just want women to go back into the home and stop trying to make the personal political.The other drawback to the book is that Krasnow's one revelation--that motherhood is her way to Be Here Now--and she doesn't seem to ever realize that it's HER way, not THE way--is arrived at somewhere between the first third and first half of the book, and thereafter is a point that simply gets repeated without much elaboration or insight. The narrative of her life with her husband and boys doesn't have much structure, after that, other than to repeatedly point out how very lucky and blessed she is, which becomes a little tiresome. I can see where Krasnow is coming from; someone who feels that she was pressured to have a high-profile, high-powered career while relegating her kids to child care might feel the need, in book length, to explain and justify her point. But I would have had a lot more respect for Krasnow, in the end, if she'd been able to sustain her feminism and envision spiritual motherhood as a viable option that each woman, each mother, is allowed to pursue and integrate into her life in her own chosen way."},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"Arrived earlier than stated and in great condition. I borrowed this from a lending library and didn't have time to finish it...so I ordered from Amazon. It is worth having my own copy to enjoy!!"},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"I really enjoyed reading this book. Iris is a very interesting person and I related to her struggles with \\"feminism\\" and \\"inner meaning\\". She is the mother of 4 boys and some insight about motherhood can be gained by reading her book, depending upon where you are in motherhood. I have a new baby and read this book trying to gather information from different perspectives to decide for myself if I should go back to work. While I think I have benefited from reading this book - another mother's opinion for sure - her book is in no way an authoritative, final say. While her quest for finding \\"herself\\" and \\"her soul\\" has been deep, she admits that her attempts have been shallow. She does not seem to be very discriminating about what will help her find meaning. She says that motherhood is the \\"lasting high\\". But how does she know? When she wrote the book, all her boys were still small. (And I suspect the real high for her was writing the book!) I worry that when when my kids are in school, I will feel empty and let down, having given up a satisfying career for children now grown and independent. Daycare is not so terrible. And as she said the small years are fleeting. Is personally watching my kids all day necessary? She has not answered this question for me, but it is interesting to read how she answered it for herself. She doesn't admit it, but it seems the items that identify her lack of surrender: taking time for herself each day, accepting help, maintaining her career to some extent while staying at home, is also part of the story, and perhaps the better advice."},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"In chronicling her journey from driven career-woman to driven mom, Iris Krasnow makes some valuable points, such as the importance of enjoying one's children on a day-to-day basis, and the value of living in the here and now. However, she takes an enormous leap in implying that to do this requires one to &quot;surrender&quot; to housework and childcare and give up, or drastically curtail, many of the career interests that a woman had before bearing children. The life at home advocated by Krasnow, involving cleaning up children's messes and ignoring more adult interests, sounds suspiciously like the depressing 1950s myth of fulfilled womanhood that Betty Friedan worked to dispel in The Feminine Mystique. Her advocacy of such a life is also more than a little disingenuous, given that Krasnow is actually working nearly half-time as a writer and has a significant amount of childcare available. I wonder if her joy in the life of a housewife and stay-at-home mom would persist if she did not have her career as an intellectual outlet."},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"I was introduced to this book by my husband.He was listening to a radio talk show, while driving to work. Their guest was Iris Krasnow, the author of Surrenderig to Motherhood. He apparantly liked what he heard, because he came home, raving about this book. He insisted that I MUST read it. He claimed that it would make my life as a mother oh so clear.I finally agreed. He bought me the book and waited expectantly. I told him that I must first READ it before gaining insight. I started into this autobiography of sorts. I don't know what exactly I was expecting, but it certainly was not this.I honestly did not like this book. I forced myself to finish it, just to make my husband happy. I did not feel as if I had gained anymore wisdom or insight in my role as a mother. I stay home with my children of my own free will, I would sacrifice everything for them. Yet, it nearly took the death of Iris Krasnows firstborn child, to realize that she was missing out on everything.I cannot see what was the huge sacrifice that Iris Krasnow made. Nothing is too good to let go of for your own flesh and blood. Besides, she supposedly had the perfect life. College in sunny California, Jet Setter jobs in Chicago and Houston. A perfect journalistic opportunity in Washington.She fell in love with and married the so called perfect man. Maintained the perfect size 6 body. I mean this woman had absolutely no complaints. Good jobs, lots of money and a great loving and supportive husband. And to top it all off, she was in her late thirties when she had her first child. Far from being a young chick.This woman had and has it all. She is happy and content with her life. She has accomplished many dreams in her forty some years. Staying home and raising your children should be a given. Especially if you have the means, as Iris Krasnow does. I truly do not see that she had much surrendering to do.Stay home and raise your children? Yes, that would be great and perfect. I am sure that anyone given the means would jump at the opportunity to make their children first priority. But unfortunately some people live in the REAL world. That is not always what one can do. Sometimes surrendering is out of our hands."},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"Sorry to all the previous reviewers, but I cannot say that I liked this book.

Don't make my mistake, and read it too."},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"I do not share Iris Krasnow's driving ambition, nor her good fortune at being financially well-off. In fact I am about as different from her as one could possibly get. But I do relate to her in one way: I have found myself needing to be in the process of surrendering to motherhood.I have had to struggle to allow myself to let go of expectations (from myself and others) to &quot;do something worthwhile&quot; with my life and &quot;contribute to society,&quot; i.e., have a successful career. I have also had to struggle to let go of this mindset that says that I always have to be looking forward and away, rather than just appreciating the moment. I have also had to struggle to give of myself, a struggle even when it was in my own best interest.She affirms, from her personal experience, that it is *okay* to choose this path. It is valid, as well as fulfilling and honorable. That's a nice thing to hear when you've grown up in a culture that has no respect for and devalues the woman (or man, for that matter) who wishes to make her children, rather than her career, the priority in her life.Iris herself is quite a character, and though she does tend to be unnecessarily (and sometimes tediously) verbose, I enjoyed reading about her career and often fruitless search for truth and happiness. She is simple and honest and does not take herself too seriously, speaking of her missteps with tenderness and forgiveness toward herself."},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"This book is almost insulting to us \\"real\\" moms out there. I am a stay at home mom of 3 under 3 who was fortunate enough to be able to walk away from a big career with even bigger potential. I was hoping for some words of wisdom to make the transition a bit easier. But, alas, all this one has to offer is self-piteous name dropping and repetitive stories of a search for spirituality. Get over yourself. Her writing is insulting at times. Although I agree having so many kids so close is not a walk in the park, and definitely takes some surrendering, I also know that life would be much easier with the \\"staff\\" she was able to employ with her 4 boys. Get real, Iris."},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"And yes, I am a mother -- of three, sorry, not four sons. And I &quot;stay home&quot; having come to my own version of the surrender implied in her title. But as I read I got more and more annoyed. You just can't glamourize motherhood, even by writing about picking up egg from the floor. It is not, and it will never be, intellectually stimulating. I have to agree with other reviewers who called it disingenuous and pointed to Krasnow's many other vocations besides motherhood. But what really irked me throughout was the repetition of the same &quot;wonder of motherhood&quot; speeches... I'm reading Mary Kay Blakely's American Mom right now and it's much better. Also, let's face it, being an expert on stay at home parenting when your oldest is about 8 doesn't exactly cut it."},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"In this memoir, Iris Krasnow describes her long search for inner peace and personal satisfaction, and how she finally found it as the mother of four young children. As a memoir, the book is very interesting, and Krasnow has some interesting observations about the difficult balancing act that women who value their professional lives and their children face.I was vaguely disappointed by the book, however. For as much as Krasnow emphasizes the joy she finds in motherhood, she spends well over half of the book telling about the glamorous life she led as a professional woman. I couldn't help think that she was sounding a bit defensive in the &quot;I'm happy now and I don't need those thrills anymore,&quot; while going on at length about just how thrilling her life was. Also, she does end up sounding a bit patronizing toward women who choose to continue their professional lives--unintentionally, I imagine--but describing them at one point as &quot;dabblers&quot; in motherhood sounded a bit judgmental from someone who was professing to advocate tolerance for all choices.All in all, there is much inspiration in the book, and lots to think about for mothers and mothers-to-be. But don't read this for advice, or expect to be told how you can find similar enlightenment."},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"This book was an answer to my prayers, literally. When I was suffering from wondering \\"what if...\\" flights of fancy (\\"what if I had pursued a glamorous career instead of committing to my family\\", etc. etc.), this book convinced me beyond any shadow of a doubt that I not only missed NOTHING, but that I gained EVERYthing, with my choice.The last few chapters of the book had me weeping....I felt something inside me just \\"click\\" with the RIGHTNESS of it all! Someone actually did live the life I had always dreamed of and fantasized about, and in the final analysis found her absolute fulfillment in \\"surrendering to motherhood\\".Through the author, I lived that life, and saw how shallow and fleeting the joys would have been. What an incredible gift!I've read some of the reviews, and I am really surprised at some of the ugliness. First, the reviewer who wasn't even a mother had NO business commenting. Sorry, but truly you have to be a mother to \\"get\\" surrendering.Secondly, I noticed a lot of snide, snarky remarks about her having nannies and book tours. Well, I'm most definitely NOT of the \\"Nanny\\" class of people, and none of that bothered me in the least. Actually, it was really refreshing to see that money and glamour does not bring you happiness (I mean, I already KNEW this, but it was just really a huge confirmation for me). I can say that because her book made it so REAL for me.Perhaps she is just a really gifted writer, for this book to have touched me so, but whatever the case -- I am immensely thankful that I found this book.I might not identify with the lifestye that the author is probably accustomed to, but her feelings about motherhood and her precious children? That cuts across all class and money lines..."},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"Some of her stories are interesting, but I quickly got bored of her mentioning the same star's names over and over. She seems to enjoy name dropping. I also didn't understand why she jumped into marriage and childbirth and then did her motherhood vs career soul searching. I don't think she really solved her problems. Whats she going to do and feel when her boys grow up?"},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"This book was such a disappointment to me. I believe there are many avenues to spiritual growth and that motherhood is certainly one of the most powerful. However, the author's ambivalence about motherhood screams from the pages. Much of the author's pages are devoted to judging and condemning those who have had made different choices from her: non-mothers. Of course, let's not forget that the author is permitted to make such bitter, judging statements about non-mothers -- after all, she's &quot;been there, done that&quot;!Please. Hatred is hatred, no matter how prettily you package it. I don't want the kind of spirituality the author professes to have. I know from experience that motherhood is wonderful and deeply fulfilling. However, if I had to base my opinions solely upon this book, I would read between the lines and imagine motherhood to be a teeth-clenching, agonizing task which causes one to be envious of those without children -- causing one to skillfully toss angry, acidic comments their way .... I think I'll stick to Thomas Merton and Mother Teresa's books on spirituality. They are kinder and more loving to those who are unlike them."},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"I bought this book because I'm a huge fan of Surrendering to Marriage. After reading it, I was left feeling like there should have been more. It was more about her personal transition, whereas Surrendering to Marriage was larger in scope. Not as inspirational or encouraging as I had hoped, but still had a good theme: If you have children-BE THERE! Invest the emotion and effort it truly takes to raise a healthy (mind & body) human being."},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"I enjoyed this book. It helped me to relax and enjoy my young boys instead of continuing to daydream about the career I had and wonder what I am missing out on. Thank you for writing this and I will be reading Surrendering to Marriage next."},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"This book is, quite frankly, horrible. It conveys the \\"struggle\\" of a self-indulgent female from an upper-middle class background who has to make an agonizing \\"choice\\" between a high-powered career and motherhood.After spending several years studying and partying at a prestigious university, the author went on to pursue a high-powered career that left her feeling \\"empty\\" and \\"spiritually unfulfilled.\\" After studying transcendental meditation and attempting other dubious New Age panaceas, she tried something truly groundbreaking--she married a well-to-do male and started producing babies.Come on! I find it hard to feel sorry or sympathetic for a woman who has never known true hardship or struggle. This book has nothing to say to millions of women for whom the combination of work and motherhood is not a choice but a necessity. I recommend reading Barbara Ehrenreich's \\"Nickel and Dimed\\" to understand the choices women have to make in the REAL world. \\"Surrendering to Motherhood\\" is nothing but a 212 page guilt trip aimed at both working women and the men who love them."},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"As a mother of three boys under five - including a set of two year old twins - I felt I was reading about my life.

I too, like the author, had a really dynamic, fast paced career prior to having children. At first, giving it up to stay home was a miserable experience while probably the most worthwhile thing I've ever done. This book helped give me strength to keep at it and enjoy it. I have to say, I had to get half-way through the book to get to the really good parts...as the first half did the job of setting the scene for what was to come by talking about the author's career life and background. I could see where this part could be off-putting for some, especially those who aren't upper-middle class career oriented women. However, I felt like the author knew me, knew my struggle, and her story was empowering."},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"The entire book could have been successfully summed up in 50 pages. The main point was life changing, but getting there seemed long. She seemed to repeat herself over and over, as if to make the point she was successful."},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"I liked this book for it's openness and honesty. It may not be &quot;cool&quot; to stay at home with our children, but no other job in the world could come close to the importance of full-time parenting. This realization came to Ms. Krasnow not as a bolt of lightening, but as a gradual unfolding. I applaud her for baring her soul and for putting the message out there at a time when it's become normal and natural to leave something as precious as our own children in a &quot;center&quot; while we tend to &quot;important business.&quot; I hope Ms. Krasnow's book will help put right a very wrong trend in our country."},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"This book was just what I needed! I have a 2 1/2 year old, 1 1/2 year old and am 5 months preg. Most days it's been hard to find happiness in all the messes, meals, mood swings, etc. that I have to shoulder. But Krasnows view of motherhood is overwhelmingly uplifting in an era when a woman wants to pursue her own childhood dreams. If your having trouble finding happiness and reassurance that being a mother first is truly the most important thing you could and should ever do, this book is great!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"Surrendering to Motherhood : Losing Your Mind, Finding Your Soul","review":"This is pretty sickening.

Annette Sanford is a wonderful storyteller and her stories are poignant and interesting. I have just recently been introduced to this writer by a fellow librarian... I don't know how I missed her books and stories. I highly recommend it to friends... especially those who have lived in Texas. For three years, many years ago, I lived in East Texas and I would not give anything for the experience. It helps me appreciate Texas writers and there are many good writers in Texas."},{"Title":"Crossing Shattuck Bridge: Stories","review":"If you enjoy the special talent that can bring a wonderful tale filled with word-perfect dialogue, wit, and wisdom, and deliver it within the form of a short story, you will be hard pressed to better this collection. \\"Crossing Shattuck Bridge\\", by Ms. Annette Sanford is a series of ten stories that you will enjoy without exception. This is her second collection of her work the first book was published in 1987. The time between the books is the only rational reason I can find why this writer's work is not more widely known. The readers and fans of short story fiction are missing excellent writing.Many of the stories are entered by the reader after the pivotal event has occurred, or a lifetime of habit is about to be disturbed, and not necessarily with negative consequences. An example of the latter is, \\"Housekeeping\\", that is as charming and funny a story as you will find oh so rarely. \\"In The Little Hunky River\\", which closes out the book has a great cast, however 80 year old \\"BoPeep\\", owns this story. She is part Mother, advisor, surrogate, and the fount of knowledge for a family badly damaged by an accident. She is one of those old souls who not only appear to know everything; she understands it all as well. When she has offered a loan, and the person asks what if he does not return it, she simply replies she will not die until he does.This Author has a way of writing that is best experienced by reading her work. She has a style that strips every unnecessary word from her prose, gives the reader all they need, and maintains every detail. She does not have to tell you what someone was thinking, nor does she ponderously establish that a person's thoughts may have shifted to the past for a moment why they contemplate what they will say next. Her work reads as though there is much more written on the page. The magic of it is that she places in the reader's mind the story she wishes to tell without holding your hand the entire journey.Unconditionally recommended."},{"Title":"Clown Skits for Everyone","review":"Clown Skits for Everyone, by Happy Jack Feder, is an excellent resource. It contains a (very) short introduction on make-up &amp; clown character, &amp; then launches into the meat of the book - a collection of skits suitable for one and/or two clowns. Some skits are 'classics', while others are variations. All are funny and quite 'do-able' even for beginning clowns. The book is interspersed with nuggets about character, character development, entertaining, working with other clowns, audience control, etc. Frankly, as a professional clown, I don't know *where* the negative reviewer is coming from."},{"Title":"Clown Skits for Everyone","review":"So I was expecting a lot more. This book does not have a big variety of skits like I hoped. It lacks creativity and doesn't give the skills needed to easily create your own. I was hoping it would give better suggestions for everyone to create a variety of skits. This is more like an intro and some ideas."},{"Title":"Clown Skits for Everyone","review":"I cannot tell you how horrifying it was for me to read this awful book about clown skits. Feder obviously has no comprehension at all of the world of the clown. Mr. Feder, my father was a clown. I know what it's like to be a clown. Believe me, it's not all fun and games as your book would suggest. I hope no one who reads the book will buy into its misinterpretations and stereotypes that you portray. I'm sorry for every true clown you have offended."},{"Title":"The American Art Book","review":"I thoroughly enjoy reading The American Art Book. The layout is just wonderful - it is simple, but very informative. I keep it on the coffee table and flip through it all the time. It is so well organized, and keeps my interest. I would recommend this book to anyone from avid art lovers, to book collectors, and to people who just enjoy learning about artists and their work. I especially love the large prints which allows the reader to really SEE the work. So many books overload you with much information that it is easy to lose interest. The American Art Book provides enough text to give the reader a good base understanding of the artist. I don't think I will ever tire of reading this book. A great thanks to Jay Tobler for this work!"},{"Title":"The American Art Book","review":"What an incredible collection! An expertly guided tour through the always fascinating spectrum of American art over the centuries. I found the reproductions of works stunning, and the accompanying texts both accessible and stimulating. And kudos to editor Jay Tobler for choosing such a broad representation of artists -- introducing the reader to new and intriguing figures in the midst of celebrating the greats. This book is a must to own for lovers of art or American cultural history -- and for anyone interested in learning more about it. It's so much more than your usual &quot;coffee table&quot; book -- it's like having your own museum of treasures to revisit -- and trust me, you will."},{"Title":"The American Art Book","review":"I am not an art critic or claim to have any expertise in art but I do find The American Art Book by Jay Tobler an excellent way to relax and view the world of art in compleley different setting. The compilation of artists is very complete and provides an outstanding cross section of artists within our american culture. As I read the book I can't help but think that each artist sat down with Jay and described to him in the artists words what the piece meant to them. The candor and symmetry of the writings are spendid and truly allow you to understand and relate to, not just the art work but also the artist."},{"Title":"The American Art Book","review":"The American Art Book, edited by Jay Tobler and published by Phaidon, is the one BIG American art book that has it all! The bountiful range of entries is astonishing to experience -- and at long last gives us a truly full spectrum three century survey of all of what is American in American art. The reproductions are beautiful, large and representative. We are spared tedious artspeak -- and instead offered just enough text to ground the work and its maker in time, place and space. The carefully selected reproductions, one to a page, are insightfully juxtaposed as page spreads that illustrate work not often seen together in the same building -- much less the same book. In The American Art Book we are finally able to SEE how all the pieces of the tapestry fit together as one. There is, quite simply, no better survey of art in America, and probably never has been.Rarer still, when was the last time the best book on American art was also the most reasonably priced? This is an art book you can afford to own, without disappointment or apology, no matter your budget. You'll see work you have never seen before by artists you know well. You'll discover artists you never knew existed whose work is pure revelation. And you'll make scores of connections you never knew existed before now. There is nothing bad to say about The American Art Book. Once you see it you'll wonder why no other art book in your library delivers so much."},{"Title":"The American Art Book","review":"This book has occupied the center of my kitchen table since I received it. I find myself drawn to it at all times of the day and night.

I am astonished at the range and variety of American art and feel quite ...patriotic!"},{"Title":"The American Art Book","review":"Jay Tobler and a well-choosen group of art world insiders have compiled an impressive and definitive survey of American Art over three centuries. Wide-ranging but tightly choosen, this book includes all manner of visual arts (painting, sculpture, photography and more) and establishes the figures who matter most. Wonderful descriptive captions accompany each image. A unique coding system on each entry refers readers to influences and similar works. Most importantly, the often segregated folk artists, who are after all the most &quot;American&quot; of American artists, are accorded full and equal treatment here. This book is also amazingly underpriced considering the number of high quality color photographs within. The carefully selected images establish just what is &quot;American&quot; in American Art."},{"Title":"The American Art Book","review":"The American Art Book is an incredible compilation of fantastic art. It is accessible to artists and anyone who can appreciate art. The text which accompanies each piece is wonderfully written and provides detail without being too technical. It feels like the artist is sitting with you and telling you all of the interesting things about the work.I love that I can just pick up the book and always find something I haven't seen before. Jay Tobler has done a wonderful job choosing interesting and unique art from all genres and providing informative and interesting text."},{"Title":"The American Art Book","review":"What a break through title! The large color plates and pithy comments are just right for this American art novice to appreciate. This is the perfect introduction to American Art, where the reader can &quot;enter&quot; the book anywhere, or look up a particular artist with ease. The definitions, in the back of the book clarify any questions that may have arisen when perusing the first part of the book. My favorite is the definition for folk art. It was perfect.

The fact that such a 'tome' is so accessibly priced is a godsend....Unfortunately, in representing the scope of 'American' art per se, I do find it to be incredibly lacking. There exists hardly any representation of artists from minority groups in America....where are Native American artists, such as Pablita Velarde, and Jaune Quick-to-See Smith?...or important African Americans, such as James Biggars, or Bettye Saar?...to me,this book like may others, reinforces the notion that most 'important' artists in America are Anglo Saxon males.

What I liked: The only contemporary biography of Admiral David Glasgow Farragut.Roller-coaster or walk-in-the-park? This should be an historical roller coaster, but Mahan's turgid style turns the bio into a tedious walk-in-the-park.The book is free. At that, it is worth the download. Were it 99 cents, it would be overpriced.2.2. What I did not like: Mahan's style. Whenever Mahan had an idea, legions of words issued forth from his pen and trampled it to death.2.3. Who I think is the audience: Die-hard naval history buffs.2.4. Is the book appropriate for children to read? Yeah. It'll put 'em right to sleep.2.5. On the basis of reading this book, will I buy the author's next book? I suppose I have to read The Influence of Sea Power Upon History, 1660-1783 'cause I am a die-hard naval history buff, but after reading Admiral Farragut, I ain't looking forward to it. It will be a chore, not a pleasure.2.6. Other: Mahan presents a wealth of historical information that I have not seen anywhere else: 1) Farragut's service as a young midshipman aboard the USS Essex in the War of 1812; 2) Farragut's decision to move his residence from Virginia to New York on the eve of the Civil War (both Farragut and his wife were southerners); 3) the fact that Farragut ignored his orders and bypassed rather than reduce or capture two forts on the Mississippi delta to take New Orleans (after New Orleans was taken, the forts fell from lack of supplies); Farragut's cooperation with David Porter on the Mississippi; and 4) the details of Farragut running his ships into the harbor at Mobile.Congress created the ranks of rear admiral, vice admiral, and admiral specifically to reward Farragut for his wartime accomplishments.Mahan's style reflects that of the 18th century more than that of the 19th century."},{"Title":"Admiral Farragut,","review":"This is an enjoyable book that covers a lot of ground from Farragut's youth to shortly after the Civil War. Well written and hard to put down.

Depending on how much they now about history and the news they might recognize Harry Houdini and Ruth Bader Ginsberg from the faces on the cover, and maybe Judith Resnick. But they will not recognize most of the faces any more than they will recognize most of the names of the thirteen distinguished Jewish Americans for whom author Doreen Rappaport and illustrators Cornelius Van Wright and Ying-Hwa Hu have picked for this book. For example, I recognize the name Jonas Salk, but I do not know his face the way I do Albert Einstein.In his Author's Note at the beginning of the book Rappaport says that the first Jews who fled persecution and violence to come to the New World arrived on the \\"Sainte Catherine\\" when the ship landed in the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam in 1654. After the American Revolution there were about two thousand Jews living in the United States, while in the 1830s and 1840s more than 200,000 German Jews arrived. From the 1880s to the 1920s more than 2 million Jews from Eastern Europe fled anti-Semitic violence to make a new life in America. The common denominator of their experience was that each wave of Jewish immigrants found themselves barred from certain professions, schools, neighborhoods, and organizations. Sometimes there were actually laws barring them and sometimes they were unwritten codes reflecting such prejudices. But the stories told here are about those who broke through these barriers to become successful (Rappaport points out the Jewish women face the double exclusion of religion and sex).Each two-page spread tells of one key scene in the lives of each of these thirteen people, whether it is Harry Houdini (Ehrich Weiss) plunging into the Mississippi River with his wrists manacles together or young law student Ruth Bader being barred from entering the Lamont Library on Harvard's campus. The other people young readers will meet in this book are Asser Levy, who wrote petitions against unfair treatment by the governor of New Amsterdam, Ernestine Rose, who demanded women should have the same rights as men and be given custody of their children if divorced, Solomon Nunes Carvalho, who took daguerreotype-types of the terrain when John Fremont was mapping out a railroad route through the Rocky Mountains, Jacob W. Davis, who created what we now know as Levis Strauss jeans, Lillian Wald, who started the Visiting Nurse Service in New York City's Lower East Side, Pauline Newman, who led a strike of garment workers in New York City when she was only 19, Lillian Copeland, a Olympic champion discus thrower, and Ira Hirschmann, who pleased for Turkey to accept \\"illegal\\" refugees fleeing Nazi Germany.At the end of this 2005 publication young readers will find themselves on more familiar ground, with Salk inventing the polio vaccine, Ginsberg ending up on the U.S. Supreme Court, Resnick dying on the space shuttle \\"Challenger,\\" and Spielberg creating E.T. In the back of \\"In the Promised Land,\\" Rappaport explains about the research done to pick each pivotal event in the lives being told, while Van Wright and Hu talk about the difficulties of painting people for whom there are no known paintings or photographs. Selected Research Sources are provided where young students can find out more about these people in books or On-line. This particular trio has collaborated on a similar volume, \\"We are the Many: A Picture Book of American Indians,\\" which teacher and students should find of interest as well."},{"Title":"In the Promised Land: Lives of Jewish Americans","review":"Here's a new approach to biography: a retelling of pivotal moments in the lives of notable Jewish Americans in In The Promised Land: Lives Of Jewish Americans, a picturebook for grades 2-4, embellished with drawings by Cornelius Van Wright and Ying-Hwa Hu.

I'd hope for something more interesting than what I could easily find myself, some unique -- or at least not easily accessible -- knowledge of the city. This book provides neither.It's also riddled with inaccurate \\"now\\" pictures; there are at least three instances in Minneapolis where the \\"now\\" picture was taken at least a block from the original picture -- and from a completely different angle.I'd recommend Larry Millet's \\"Twin Cities Then and Now\\" as a much better alternative."},{"Title":"Minneapolis-St. Paul Then and Now","review":"This book is a collection of old photos matched to new photos supposedly taken of the same locations as they appear today.Unfortunately, there are some very blatant errors. Certain photos look, at first glance, like the same location. But quite a few are actually not. And some that do match the location are taken from a different vantage point, making it hard to understand what exactly you are looking at. I do not believe that the authors reside in the Twin Cities, which may explain the sloppiness.The photographs (both old and new) are nice, hence the two stars. But Larry Millett, a local architecture critic, created a far better volume which was impeccably researched and meticulously rephotographed. Skip this one, and seek out Millett's \\"Twin Cities: Then and Now\\" instead.+"},{"Title":"Minneapolis-St. Paul Then and Now","review":"Great book to read up on things of Minneapolis and St. Paul.

It is basically a summary of Virginia Tech's Media Institutions course (which, as Dr. McAllister announces the first day, is entirely dedicated to anwering the question &quot;How does the way media is funded affect the content of that media?&quot;) The book uses basic, real world examples to illustrate concepts and is written in a very conversational tone, much like the way Dr. McAllister lectures.The scope of the book is very broad; it touches on all major categories of media which are touched by advertising. It is an excellent survey or introductory book. It is not laden with undefined industry or academic jargon, so I would recommend it to people who have no formal training in media theory. However, as an academic research publication, it is not a book that should be approached as light, before bedtime reading material.If nothing else, this book should completely change the way one watches television, read the paper, etc. and should sensitize the average consumer to the deregulation and merging of major media companies (AOL/Time Warner, for example). Dr. McAllister manages to present the information in a non-threatening manner rather than taking the cynical, fear-appeal tone that many other authors use in their &quot;big-media-is-bad&quot; diatribes.A good companion book for this is Ben Bagdikian's &quot;The Media Monoploy&quot; which focuses more narrowly on the newpaper industry."},{"Title":"Holz als Rohstoff fr den Musikinstrumentenbau","review":"A 1988-book presenting woods used in musical instruments,compiled by one of the foremost wood anatomists of ourtime. Hardcover, 22,9 x 30,4 x 1,2cm, 44 pp, illustrated by black&amp;white halftones. The woods treated are separated in six categories, by application. For each application a brief survey is given of what wood properties are desirable.Amount of data given per wood varies. At best is provided: German trade name, scientific name, (occasionally) a synonym, other trade names, natural distribution, general appearance of the wood, properties, typical use. Most woods are illustrated by a 8x12 cm photomicrograph of the end grain (transmitted light), of excellent quality.By today's standards of lavishly illustrated books perhaps a trifle sober. Color photographs of flat sawn and quarter sawn woods would have been nice, as would have been photomicrographs of tangential and radial sections. Might also have contained a little more in the way of detail useful in identifying the treated woods. Nevertheless it does contain a great deal of information, presented very concisely."},{"Title":"Oregon Geographic Names","review":"Own this book if you love to take road trips in Oregon.

Estes has a profound gift of story telling and of kindness and warmth. I could listen to her stories all day long. She is a master of both the academic study of stories and fables, and of their telling. She is a Jungian psychoanalyst, and the parallels between stories and their relationship to the psyche becomes self evident when she is at work- I doubt that many others could come close, and still keep you feeling warm.When I finish one of her works, I just look forward to the next one!

There's no real life without touching the great universal themes -tales of loss and resurrection, love and sacrifice, of courage, betrayal and persistence, good and evil. - Her voice is as she feels and thinks: it's warm and wise but also playful and fun.

As usual, Clarissa Pinkola Estes manages to make the wisdom of the ages available to us here in the 21st Century, and to offer it in a thoroughly enjoyable, entertaining, incredibly inspiring, and always kind manner.

It deals with the many animals one might find on a farm. Cows, ducks, pigs, chickens, horses, geese, sheep and more, are all here and presented with eye pleasing photos.We see babies with their mothers, and have a chance to see what types of food they eat. (Baby animals nurse, of course.) We also get to see what a sheep looks like before, during, and after it is shorn.That said, there is no way that this is a book for just beginning readers. First there are too many words on some of the pages and some of the vocabulary is a bit sophisticated. Words like : orange, goslings, milking, through, webbed, oily, and noise.Three Stars. Good book with attractive pictures of farm animals. Should be of interest to older babies thru 1st Graders.

Solamente despu&eacute;s de la deposici&oacute;n del poder de los terratenientes y los capitalistas podr&iacute;an construirse las estructuras econ&oacute;micas que tomaran como su punto de partida las necesidades sociales y econ&oacute;micas de la poblaci&oacute;n trabajadora.Una discusi&oacute;n tuvo lugar en 1963-64 entre diversos grupos en el liderazgo cubano. El modelo econ&oacute;mico sovi&eacute;tico, que en la pr&aacute;ctica manejaba a la gente trabajadora como t&iacute;teres en una funci&oacute;n, hab&iacute;a influenciado a algunos dirigentes. Abogaron por copiar los m&eacute;todos sovi&eacute;ticos. Estos m&eacute;todos fueron expresados en jerga seudo-comunista, pero eran el contrario del comunismo.Otros, guiado por Che Guevara, el Ministro de la Industria, promovieron una estrategia comunista basada en los principios desarrollados por Marx, Engels y Lenin. Che luch&oacute; por un modo de organizaci&oacute;n que facilitara el desarrollo m&aacute;ximo de la participaci&oacute;n voluntaria y que fuera cada vez m&aacute;s plasmada seg&uacute;n la consciencia social de las masas de trabajadores y campesinos. Esta discusi&oacute;n implic&oacute; necesariamente el an&aacute;lisis de la naturaleza del valor en s&iacute; mismo, as&iacute; como de las instituciones econ&oacute;micas de la sociedad cubana y las pol&iacute;ticas del gobierno mismo. Todos estos elementos de la discusi&oacute;n fueron descritos en el libro de Carlos Tablada publicado en 1987, &quot;Che Guevara: Econom&iacute;a y Pol&iacute;tica en la Transici&oacute;n al Socialismo.&quot;Waters proporciona un resumen de los temas en el libro de Tablada y explica c&oacute;mo &eacute;stos son conformes al curso del desarrollo de la revoluci&oacute;n cubano y de sus logros: la liberaci&oacute;n de la tierra del apret&oacute;n de terratenientes par&aacute;sitos, de la mecanizaci&oacute;n y la modernizaci&oacute;n del sector azucarero, la electrificaci&oacute;n del campo, la campa&ntilde;a masiva de alfabetizaci&oacute;n, el proscribir de la discriminaci&oacute;n racial, las trancadas hacia la emancipaci&oacute;n de mujeres y el desarrollo r&aacute;pido del sistema sanitario para cuidar de las necesidades m&eacute;dicas de la poblaci&oacute;n entera. Estos avances sirven como v&iacute;as para la formaci&oacute;n del nuevo ser humano, lo cual es el objetivo de la revoluci&oacute;n.Aunque los principios comunistas avanzados por Che Guevara no fueron plenamente adoptados en la pr&aacute;ctica, hubo una renovaci&oacute;n de las ideas del Che en el contexto de la &quot;campa&ntilde;a de la rectificaci&oacute;n&quot; lanzada en 1985. Los proyectos del trabajo voluntario fueron restablecidos, la democracia en los lugares de trabajo fue reconsolidada y se expulsaron a los bur&oacute;cratas corruptos. Era una fase importante de la recuperaci&oacute;n revolucionaria y demostr&oacute; la fortaleza de la base proletaria del estado cubano."},{"Title":"Che Guevara y la lucha por el socialismo hoy Cuba hace frente a la crisis mundial de los a&#241;os 90 (Spanish Edition)","review":"Hace m&aacute;s que una decada despues del derrumbo del el opositiva de comunismo-el 'socialismo actual', o sea el estalinismo usar la palabra precisa-Cuba todav&iacute;a existe como ejemplo que puede hacer el pueblo trabajador controlar nuestro propio destino.

Explican, tambien, que en los anos 80, la direccion de la revolucion cubana se dio cuenta que el partido necesito empezar un proceso de rectificacion para coregir muchos errores que resultaron de copiar el sistema de la union sovietica durante los anos 70.

It's just annoying.) 13 of the 36 \\"easy\\" puzzles are printed on grids at least 5 lines too large (leaving 5 or more completely empty rows or columns across the top & bottom edges together, or across the right & left sides together).Medium puzzles are on 30 x 30 grids. Of the 26 medium puzzles, I count 12 which have 5 or more completely empty lines at the top/bottom edges or the right/left edges. All of those puzzles should have been put on smaller grids to begin with. One of the more egregious examples is puzzle #45, a very simple 30 x 15 puzzle printed on a 30 x 30 grid (thus graded as \\"Medium\\"), but with 8 empty lines across the top and 7 empty lines across the bottom.Hard puzzles are on 35 x 35 grids. There are 38 in this category and 9 have the same problem of being printed on grids at least 5 rows/columns too large.A major problem with this book: there are quite a few puzzles that do, in fact, require you to guess. An absolute no-no in a logic puzzle book!More minor quibbles with the book:lower grade paper used (thinner and grayer than in other similar books I've enjoyed)the heavy bold grid lines (the ones used every 5 squares vertically and horizontally) don't extend into the clues section. So you have to be especially careful, for example, when working on the bottom section of a 35 x 35 puzzle that the squares you are filling in line up correctly with the line of clues at the top of the puzzle. The bold grid lines every 5 squares usually alleviate this issue, but not when the bold lines don't show in the clues at all!the completed images themselves are, to my mind, inferior to what I've encountered in other puzzle books. Puzzles titled TV Set, Brick & Trowel, Screw Head, Paint Can, Sugar Bowl, and Skull are examples that would have benefited from more detail and/or better definition.I don't exactly hate this book; it would be more accurate to say I really haven't enjoyed it. I give it one star because it is by far the worst book of its type that I have encountered.Save your money, find another book or dig this one out of a super-bargain bin!"},{"Title":"The Official Book of Hanjie","review":"This set of puzzles suffers from several faults... The grid squares are too large, the paper is too coarse, and even on some easy puzzles, you are forced to guess, in spite of the author's admonition that you should \\"never guess!\\" In addition, I found that some puzzles have ambiguous solutions... that is, they have more than one solution.The author should, at a minimum, have run these puzzles through a solver application (they can be found online) to eliminate the guesswork and multiple solutions."},{"Title":"The Official Book of Hanjie","review":"I have been playing these pencil puzzles for over 15 years, and I have never seen a book with so many illogical puzzles.

The author has tried to construct on the regular 5 block grids, but he can't seem to get the hang of it, so on almost every puzzle, you have rows and columns, sometimes up to three or four on each side, that you have to black out. This makes the 5 block grid almost useless for counting and placement. The easy puzzles are too easy and the hard puzzles have too many puzzles that you have to guess where to start. I am really, really sorry I wasted my money on this book, and I recommend that nobody else do it.The only reason I gave this book even ONE star is because Amazon won't let me do this review without a star rating.

I got so frustrated everytime I had to leave an unsolved puzzle behind and move on to the next one. I really started wondering if I was too dumb for this.

If you are already familiar with these puzzles, though, I'd opt for a different book."},{"Title":"The Official Book of Hanjie","review":"If you like these kind of puzzles this book will disappoint you. If you have never tried them before, this book might turn you off from ever discovering the enjoyment this kind of puzzles can be. The maker of this book is definitely not an artist. The pictures you end up with are inaccurate, poorly designed, and/or just plain stupid. The first puzzle, for example, is a rectangle hovering over a heavy line that is thicker at the ends, and he calls it a TV set. Then there is a \\"Left Arrow\\" which is an arrow pointing left with random white spots in it. After the fourth puzzle I look at all the answers in the back and they don't get any better. Even the picture on the cover is a good example of a bad design. While it looks nice at first glance, the tree has poor branch structure, and who would even know or care if you made any mistakes. Not to mention there is no color or shading, the pictures are black and white.If you would like to learn and/or enjoy number graph picture puzzles I would stay away from this book. I would recommend puzzles by Kenji Onishi which are much better."},{"Title":"The Official Book of Hanjie","review":"I have loved this type of puzzle for a long time.

As other reviewers mentioned, some of the grids are way to big for the puzzle (lots of padding). But my biggest complaint by far is the fact that some of the puzzles are indeterminate. In fact, the very first puzzle I did in the book forced me to guess. I'm guessing this book was a quick cash-in by the author. Obviously, he didn't do his homework on this one."},{"Title":"The Official Book of Hanjie","review":"The puzzles are not well thought out and must have been done in a hurry. Every other Hanjie book I have done is far better than this one. It's not even fun."},{"Title":"The Official Book of Hanjie","review":"These puzzles are solved by filling in a grid following number clues at the edge of the grid. If the numbers at the edge of the grid are 2, 4 and 9, then in that row/column, you will fill in 2, 4 and 9 consecutive blocks. At the completion, your completed grid will show a picture with your colored in blocks.If you're looking for a \\"Hanjie\\" puzzle book, this isn't a great choice. This book fails in two ways.First, and most importantly, a true Hanjie / O'Ekaki / Nonogram puzzle must have ONE and ONLY 1 solution. In some of the puzzles, you have a series of blocks that can be completed two ways - both \\"proper\\" solutions to the puzzles (Ex: in a 4 block square, you could either fill A and D *or* B and C)...1..11 A B1 C DSecond, this book is not designed for someone learning how to do this type of puzzles. As an example, the 5th puzzle in the book (marked as Easy) in most other books would fall in the Difficult section. Rather than completing the puzzle following the numbers, you are required to make assumptions (\\"If I assume this block is filled in...\\"), complete a portion of the puzzle until it DOESN'T work, then erase and mark that assumption wrong. This is not acceptable for puzzles marked as Easy. While this may work for experts at these puzzles, and is expected in the harder puzzles, when you combine it with the improper creation of the puzzle(see the first issue), the puzzles become much more trouble than they are worth.If you're still interested in finding a good book, try searching Amazon and the internet for \\"O'Ekaki\\" and \\"Nonograms\\". The author Tetsuya Nishio makes a couple great books."},{"Title":"The Official Book of Hanjie","review":"Had I bought this book ten years ago I might have been happy enough with it, because it was hard to find pixel puzzles back then. Now that they are readily available, this book doesn't make the grade.The biggest problem is the unused columns in the grids. It is annoying to have multiple empty rows, sometimes on all four sides. I don't understand why grids of the proper size were not used. This is the first pixel puzzle book that I've had that had these annoying empty rows. Not only is it a bother to have to mark them before you even start the puzzle, but it also makes counting the squares harder. Counting squares is not the fun part of doing these puzzles.Secondly, the pictures created are boring and poorly designed. Sometimes I have to look at the solutions to see what the picture is meant to be. This is after I have correctly solved the puzzle. Other books have pictures that are much more clever than the arrows, hearts, lamps, etc. in this book.Some reviewers have commented that the squares are too big. I rather like that. I can do thses puzzles without wearing glasses, and the big grid amkes it less likely that you will accidently color in the wrong row. However, the typeface of the numbers in the clues are harder to read than a plainer typeface would have been. Also, I don't like the shading in the clue area.I know nothing about the puzzle creator, but I just get the feeling that he does not have a lot of experience with solving or creating pixel puzzles. There is an amateur feel to the puzzles and the pictures.I intend to work all the puzzles in the book, but I would not consider buying another book from this author. If you want good pixel puzzles buy books by Tetsuya Nishio, which are available from amazon."},{"Title":"The Official Book of Hanjie","review":"Hate this book.This was my first first Hanjie/Picross/Nonogram/etc book. I bought it several years ago. I solved only 8 puzzels before putting it down in frustration *and* boredom, and have avoided the genre for years, due soley to this book. I recently got a free Picross app for my phone, and loved it enough to buy the pay version. After solving all 384 puzzles in the app, I dug out this book and dusted it off, willing to give it another try. Which resulted in me coming here to post my 1 star review...Logic puzzles (at least easy and medium difficulty) should not make you guess. This book fails.Logic puzzles should not be ambiguous - have multiple 'correct' solutions without providing the desired picture (at ANY difficulty). This book fails.Puzzles should be rewarding, and the reward (other than the sense of accomplishment) for Hanjie puzzles is the completed picture. The pictures should look good or interesting. This book fails. Is it rewarding to make pictures of asymmetric arrows (yes, multiple puzzle were of an arrow, just pointed in different directions), a box, or a crooked 'X'? A significant number of the pictures had filled in or unfilled squares where they should not be. It is as if the author did a really bad job of scanning in grade school crayon drawings, and didn't bother cleaning them up. Fail.\\"The Official Book of Hanjie\\"? Official? With whom did they register to make it official? Would not an \\"official\\" puzzle book have more than the very basic instructions? Fail. Fail. Fail.The only place where I disagree with some other reviewers is in that this book might be ok for some skill levels. Some say ok for beginner. Some say ok for expert. I say ok for none. Beginners would be bored with the over simple, uninspired puzzles, and extremely frustrated with the ambiguous/cheat ones. Experts would mostly be bored. And even if you are an expert, it isn't any more fun to have an ambiguous puzzle. Or lame pictures.At all costs, avoid any book that this author (Timothy E. Parker) publishes.Burning this book is too good for it.Thanks for your time. And, in case I've forgotten to mention it, don't buy this book."},{"Title":"The Official Book of Hanjie","review":"I was disappointed with these puzzles.

It is absolutely frustrating. I spent so much time filling the large grids on poor quality paper only to find that the puzzles were either too easy or completely illogical.

It is concise, well organized and offers just the right amount of well thought out information. In other words for the traveler packing light, it doesn't weigh a ton.While I do prefer the Eyewitness Guide series for pre-trip planning and research because of all of its excellent maps, photos, detailed information and &quot;how-to&quot; information, it was the AAA Spiral Guide that I carried around with me all over Paris. The Eyewitness Guide (my constant companion before the trip) never left the hotel room.The AAA Spiral guide gives excellent suggestions about what are &quot;must see&quot; and &quot;check out if you have time&quot; attractions, and even suggests possible daily itineraries based on the geographic areas of Paris. I found that my list of &quot;to do&quot; was very similar to theirs. Also, most of the travel guides that I read had separate sections in the back for restaurants, shopping, hotels, etc. The AAA Spiral Guide organizes these topics into the different geographic areas of Paris. This was a much more logical and welcome organization in actual practice. The Guide also has a small but excellent section of &quot;how to&quot; information.Overall, I am looking forward to using the AAA Spiral Guides again for future travels. I believe the title list is short at present, but hope to see it expand.Bon Voyage!"},{"Title":"Paris (Aaa Spiral Guides)","review":"My wife and I used this travel guide extensively while in Paris. It served as our bible, tour guide, and street map. It is laid out in a very clearly and the sprial binder makes it very easy to flip to any page. It is filled with clear, color pictures and maps. The guide is broken down into various regions throughout Paris with each section highlighting Must See Attractions, and then At Your Leisure sites that are also in the area. It also has a very nice reference on how to see a region in one day. A subway map is on the inside back cover, and a regional map of Paris is on the front inside cover. Other nice features are sections called 'Finding Your Feet' - which provides great information for when you first arrive in London (either by plane, train, boat, etc..) and a 'Practicalities' seciton that talks about currency, clothes sizes, basic French phrases, etc.What really made this book stand out compared to other Paris travel guides was it included detailed street maps of these regions. Those proved invaluable for us once we started walking around the area. The book is compact, and fit inside my coat pocket comfortably.My only gripe is that for some of the attractions, it did not have the right opening and closing times - and it suggested a shortcut to the lines at the Lourve by getting off at the Tuileries metro stop. Unfortunately, this is one stop too early, but the street map easily showed us the way.If you only want to carry one compact tour guide for Paris - I would highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Life of Rossini, (Washington paperbacks)","review":"An early work of Stendhal, who was an avid opera goer throughout his life. Opera music created a similar feeling to love in his soul. He preferred Italian opera and goes through a history of music in different European countries, including making sweeping generalizations about Italian and German music. He obviously favored Rossini and anything to do with Italian life and customs. His great sensibility made him a keen music critic and he makes surprisingly accurate comments. He reviews every single opera extensively. A great combination of a literary work and music history, and a good read for students of music and literature alike. A truly unique work as I do not know of many great novelists who dabbled in music as well. As with many other more modern writers, Stendhal is more interested in describing how the music made him feel, rather than a strict exegesis of the music itself."},{"Title":"Life of Rossini, (Washington paperbacks)","review":"I purchased this book solely as a reference for a report I was doing in college.

Yet another biography, focusing on her political as well as personal activities.I expected to be bored by this book, as I'm very familiar with the queen's life and unimpressed with what I know of the author. But he held me entranced all the way through, both with information I didn't already have, including quotes from her journals, and cogent analysis of the effect she had on the political activity of the time (and vice versa). The style is more than a bit dated, and he downplays some of the controversial aspects of her life; for example, he portrays her relationship with John Brown as simply that of mistress to devoted servant. But the sheer readability, combined with the perceptive insights into the life of a complicated woman, made this book well worth my time."},{"Title":"Queen Victoria","review":"lytton strachey is my favorite non-fiction writer. he writes non-fiction that is flawless and beautiful. some of the writing in this book is as good as any writing i've seen anywhere. but who cares? who cares? what a shameful culture has been fashioned that has no room for this."},{"Title":"Queen Victoria","review":"This is an okay book. There were moments where I had to restart a paragraph because I ended up getting lost. It was the first book I read on my Kindle, so maybe it was getting use to that. It dragged from when Prince Albert died until the end. I felt like it was cut up quite a bit, as well. The Kindle version was apparently edited by a volunteer and it was free, so maybe it was that.

This book broke away from tradition and provided a deeper look at the Queen and all those around her by abandoning the notion of promoting a person's successess and strengths and instead paints the portrait of a human with weaknesses, motivations, strengths, and stuggles. The reader sees the Queen in relationships that become history and see the impact of personality in making decisions.The book is engaging especially once Victoria moves beyond childhood and becomes Queen. The portrait of Edward and Victoria's relationship is vivid. The story provides a rich understanding of places in the lives of the royal family that continue today, namely Balmoral, and give a glimpse at the royal family culture that can be seen in current events. It is more than a book about Queen Victoria.Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Queen Victoria","review":"Giles Lytton Strachey was an early 20th century writer and biographer who developed a reputation for writing biographies that dealt with individuals as people, rather than the events they were associated with. His 1921 biography of the British monarch, Queen Victoria, is a highly readable insight into this long-reigning queen.Many public domain books can be slow to read, with language that is sometimes archaic when compared to contemporary writing. This is not the case with Strachey's work. Not only does it thoroughly cover Victoria's life from childhood to death, but it is an engaging read that explores Victoria's relationships, both personal and professional. I particularly liked reading of the love between Victoria and her husband, Albert, much of which is detailed in Victoria's journals and letters. I also enjoyed Strachey's turn of phrase and his ability to create such effective word-pictures of this fascinating monarch and her life.If you have any interest in history or curiosity about British monarchs I think you will enjoy this book. I certainly did - far more than I expected to."},{"Title":"Queen Victoria","review":"strachey became famous for his 'eminent victorians' which has the reputation for being a hatchet job-but he was looking at the previous generation from the disillusioned, post-WWI perspective, and he treats florence nightingale et al more like prodigies than monsters. when he undertook to write about the eponymous queen herself, people expected it would be another exercise in target practice-even his mother tried to discourage him, saying that 'if she was stupid, it was not her fault.' But in the event what he produced is one of the most sympathetic, if slightly condescending, biographies ever written-and absolutely one of the most accomplished. it is a chronicle of victoria's 60+-year-long political career and emotional life, a series of portraits of all the personalities in her life-including albert, his curious replacement john brown, disraeli-him, it is true, strachey clearly did not like-a completely non-pedantic reflection on the growth and eventual shrinkage of the british empire during her reign-and the whole thing is done so subtly, so gracefully-and, at the same time, so forcefully-that you may find yourself talking about nothing else but this book and queen victoria for days afterward. one of the most successful marriages of rigorous scholarship and beautiful style in english literature."},{"Title":"Queen Victoria","review":"A readable and fairly brief account of Victoria. Frequent passages from Victoria's girlhood diary and letters make Victoria's early life particularly vivid reading. Also fascinating is Victoria's relationship with her government, and her tendency to cling to the current prime minister and despise the Opposition, whoever they might be.The enigmatic Prince Albert, and his evolving relationship with Victoria, is presented well. Strachey makes some startling suggestions about what Britain might have turned into, had Albert lived longer (answer: Prussia).This book is elegantly written, and free of the psychobabble one might expect from a more modern book.The book is not boring. Although Victoria is always proper, there is plenty of adultery and dysfunctional family behavior among her many adult children."},{"Title":"Queen Victoria","review":"I enjoyed this detailed book about Queen Victoria's life. It had a lot of detail, but the writing style was a bit dry and old-fashioned (the book was written a while ago). It also didn't have as much detail of her life after Prince Albert died, which was unfortunate. It was sympathetic to her and generally very informative. I would recommend this book highly to people seeking to learn more about Queen Victoria, but not to someone seeking &quot;light reading&quot; as it is a bit hard to read due to the older writing style."},{"Title":"Queen Victoria","review":"This life of Queen Victoria set a new standard for biographies when it was written and it still reads very well today. To the modern ear some of Strachey's language may at times be a bit dry. That aside this is an excellent study of the development of Victoria from infancy to old age. The entanglement's of family and the influence of key ministers is well covered and documented . Especially interesting is the treatment of Prince Albert and the Queen's relationship.I found this to be quite an informative book and would highly recommend it to anyone with a curiosity regarding this period of British history."},{"Title":"Queen Victoria","review":"Brings Queen Victoria into a very different light , shows that shes a woman above all , the book touches the love story of the century gone that was her marriage to Albert"},{"Title":"Queen Victoria","review":"I went into this book after watching most of the films about these two interesting humans. I am English, a romantic like the Queen so naturally I enjoyed her in this work by an English author. Being English by heritage with a great-great GM right off the \\"boat\\" as they say, the in depth details were enormously exciting and seeing the many reference volumes; I knew he was getting the real scoop from history and not from gossip or plain fancy. It made me want to own everything volume about her and also of \\"them\\" but money is an object so I have to stay with freebies. This is a \\"must read\\" for anyone who really wants a true depiction of her life in the Royal Court leading up to and beyond the Victorian Era. So, for the money, I recommend this e-read to anyone interested in a none sensational account without the sexual exploits of the Court and of Prince Eddy also know as Bertie. I know him to have been a scoundrel but also not knowing that much about these royals after 1901 other than the four kings that lead up to Q. Elizabeth II or Q. Bess, I hesitate to say more and so won't. There are so many other books I want to read but time won't allow. This one was enough to whet my whistle for her Highland Journals and letters to her Minister's which I bought here too with pictures of her galore and most of those closest to her. I love all the illustrated books although I would have preferred her picture on the cover to have been a young Vic not an old Dowager. She isn't attractive in the slightest and this settled it as she was a very homely Queen. I love her with all she was and wasn't."},{"Title":"Queen Victoria","review":"Very good book.

It was well written, engaging and descriptive without being boring. I'm so glad I stumbled across this book. It has inspired me to find other biographies of the royal family. The only drawback, in my opinion, is that a third of the book was essentially a biography of Prince Albert. However, the book also eloquently gives a tangible picture of who she was as a young woman before the throne and how she matured as a daughter, a wife, a mother and the Queen of England."},{"Title":"A Greek-English lexicon","review":"Just to add comment on all the discussion concerning printing.

I took a risk but found that the \\"big\\" Liddell, 8th ed., published American Book Company (New York: Cincinnati: Chicago) was typeset and not the undesirable offset. At a savings of about $100, I got the best version (the big Liddell) of the best lexicon (Liddell & Scott) with the clearest printing (typeset). There is no better lexicon for pagan or sacred writings in the classical or koine Greek."},{"Title":"A Greek-English lexicon","review":"This review is for the Abridged Liddell-Scott Lexicon...I own the Intermediate sized Liddell as well, and I must say I actually prefer the smaller one. When I took a class where we read &quot;The Apology of Socrates&quot; by Plato, my professor recommended avoiding the Intermediate edition. At first I thought perhaps he was wrong, and I used it to translate some passages. After spending a lot of time sorting through it, I found that I agreed with him. The Intermediate Liddell does have locations of word use in original sources, and has slightly more vocabulary, but for the beginning and intermediate Greek reader, the Abridged Liddell is preferable. Navigating through the abridged edition is far easier and it often assumes a lesser knowledge of Greek, thus it includes some conjugated forms, which then point you to the correct verb. So as you can see, the abridged edition should suit the needs of most classical Greek students. Also, the editors took care to make sure that virtually every New Testament word is included.Are there drawbacks to the Liddell-Scott? The Victorian English often gets frustrating. We rarely use words like hither and thither anymore. Also, when more morally explicit Greek words are defined, their definition is in Latin. Also, the original printing abnormalities, such as certain parts of letters being cut off from words, remain.Learning Greek is a rewarding, but daunting task. The task is often made more difficult by grammars and lexicons that assume the reader knows more than he or she does. The abridged Liddell is perfect for the average student. When you want to dive in deeper, learn word origins, search sources, or just want to say you own the most complete Lexicon out there, you should buy the full size Liddell-Scott.

Though I will point out that it is invaluable to anyone who has completed the fundamentals and finds themselves reading multiple dialects. The gentleman is right again in saying that a little Liddell, or Middle Liddell is more appropriate for the beginning Greek reader; there is absolutely no reason to spring for the full Lexicon at that point. A reader who has, however, stuck out two or three years and moved beyond the fundamentals should make all efforts to aquire this Lexicon. The 3 rules of Greek reading [1. know your Principle parts they will save your sanity 2. the Lexicon is your friend and 3. above all else, the first thing to do when encountering any Greek is to supress panic] don't change whether you've read two years or twenty, but you can outgrow your lexicon, and any serious readers (if you've stuck it out for three years or more, your serious) should invest in this lexicon.

Some say it is best to wait until more advanced study is required, but waiting several years at my age is perhaps overly optimistic. Generally I find the Intermediate version very useful, and I have it sitting on top of the Big One. I am sure the large version will be of considerable use, but it won't be travelling with me. I also have the small version which fits well into my luggage.The use of Victorian English does not worry me (we can all change \\"hither\\" and \\"thither\\" into more likely expressions), but the smallness of the print and its lack of clarity is a bit of a problem. I have decided that when I use the unabridged edition it will be in the daytime, and on sunny days at that! I am very thankful for a little magnifying set-up that I made when using Reading Greek as a textbook- very clear but very small print. My spectacles help too of course!A CD-ROM version may be useful to some people, but I much prefer books for frequent use. The computer is in a different room from where I do my real work. I couldn't stand having one of these monstrosities looking at me as I study Greek.So far I am very positive about the large version of the lexicon. It can hardly have five stars because it has some inadequacies, but it is better to have it than not.

Reading some reprints can be like looking at a photograph of a photograph. You might consider finding an older typeset copy of the LSJ. Although this means buying a used book, it may be easier on your eyes.You cannot, however, identify a typeset copy by edition number, publication date, or ISBN. I browsed a copy of the 9th Edition (0198642148) published in 1961 and printed in 1992. It was offset and looked like the printer was running out of ink. I purchased a copy of this same 1961 edition printed in 1978. My copy is typeset. It looks fine.Whether a copy of the book is offset or typeset seems to depend upon who printed the book and when it was printed. At one time the University of Oxford printed its own books.

I don't know when the University stopped printing its books, but I don't think that any copies of the 9th Revised (1996) Edition of the LSJ (0198642261) were printed by the University.I can't say as a hard and fast rule that all copies printed by and at the University are typeset; however, before purchasing and shipping anything this big and expensive, I would contact the seller and ask the seller where and by whom that copy was printed."},{"Title":"A Greek-English lexicon","review":"Logos Research software has now made this edition in electronic form, all the supplements are integrated in the main text.

My major gripe is that it is rather poorly made. The edges of the very thin pages stuck together and each page had to be separated by hand or flicking the pages. The paper is sliver thin, and some of it was creased in the binding - upsetting in a $160 book. On reviewing the front, I noted that it was printed and bound in China and can't help feeling that if it were printed in Europe or the US it might have been better quality.

I've long felt it inadequate, but today let's try a controlled experiment. Can we use it to read the first two pages of Xenophon's Anabasis?(Xenophon's \\"Anabasis\\" has a reputation as a straightforward narrative written in a very clear style--it's what schoolboys used to cut their teeth on, before teachers grew worried that it was too boring to keep students interested in Greek.)In these first two pages (OCT edition), here are three basic questions about words that are not very clearly answered by the abridged lexicon. Page 1: lines 15-16, epi is used with the dative to mean \\"in the power of\\" someone, a meaning omitted by the abridged lexicon. Page 2: line 19, the accented form of the reflexive pronoun hoi is used, but the abridged lexicon gives only the enclitic form; line 23, amphi is used with the accusative in an only vaguely local sense (made clear in the intermediate lexicon, s.v., A/C/5, but impossible to guess from the \\"Little Liddell\\").If you can't read the opening of Xenophon's Anabasis with it, then, somebody has to say it, so I will: this book is NOT VERY USEFUL FOR ITS INTENDED PURPOSE.

I specify this because this group of reviews also includes reviews of the \\"Middle Liddell\\" and the \\"Little Liddell,\\" which Amazon seems to have jumbled together.Liddell & Scott's Greek-English Lexicon is a monument to lexicography. Methodologically, though, it needs a complete redo. Whether anyone will ever accomplish this is a good question. I have seen the suggestion in a scholarly article that the most feasible way to create a new comprehensive lexicon of Ancient Greek is to compile it online, in the fashion of the Perseus Project. Such a project would be the ideal source for a new printed Greek lexicon with up-to-date principles of organization, not to mention modern English equivalents to replace the large number of thoroughly antiquated equivalents found in L&S.;This lexicon is certainly indispensable for serious students of Classical Greek literature. It is also useful for reading the Septuagint (Greek Old Testament) and patristic writers (for the latter, see alsoA Patristic Greek Lexicon). Another use which many might not have considered is for reading Coptic literature. Coptic is the latest form of the Ancient Egyptian language, and a great deal of religious literature was written in it during the first millennium or so of the Christian era. A good deal was translated from Greek as well. Whether translated or original Coptic, it made free use of Greek borrowings, much as English does. There is no lexicon devoted to literary Coptic Greek, but Liddell & Scott often have the meanings of words found in Coptic Greek, even if it's the 20th one in the list! Unless and until a complete dictionary of Coptic Greek is prepared, L&S; will continue to be a necessary tool of Coptic scholars as well as classicists."},{"Title":"A Greek-English lexicon","review":"Excellent resource.

Each entry has at least one English definition but often many more, Greek contexts, and citations from the literature in which the word is found.As with any classic, critics abound.

The full lexicon was also offered with the supplement included ............ That discount is no longer offered but this dictionary is still the cheapest major, standard lexicon of any language available...there is no bigger English-Greek lexicon. Eventually, any Greek student who wants to read beyond the elementary authors in the curriculum will need at least to consult this volume. It is unwieldy...like all major dictionaries...and can be annoying to use on the eyes. Sadly, there are no other choices at present...though we yearn for the day when computer technology will replace the printed codex and allow for (a much needed, but immensely difficult) a thorough revision of the lexicon. Its etymological notes are obviously valueless today. Beginning students will better appreciate the intermediate version of this book which lists irregular principal parts of verbs separately. Note that the intermediate version is based on the Eighth, not the Ninth, edition of the lexicon...as if any intermediate student notices or cares."},{"Title":"A Greek-English lexicon","review":"The Big Liddell is a very valuable resource, as a number of other reviewers here have observed.

In fact, you might consider building a special shelf or desk just to hold the book.2 - The offset printing flaws mentioned by other reviewers is a significant problem. Portions of some entries are not even legible.The Big Liddell is the kind of book that would be much more valuable in digital format than in print.

The &quot;little Liddel&quot; is the best version for the beginner since it contains, e.g., irregular forms of verbs whose aorist and/or perfect principal parts cannot be predicted from the present principal part. The &quot;middle Liddel&quot; contains fewer entries but provides more room for etymological information, thus making the little Liddel best for use during Greek exams and the middle Liddel best for those whose interest includes a knowledge of the history of a word's usage. The big Liddel (the book for which this review is written) is an excellent reference on account of its completeness and the coherent way in which the entries are written. Although the Liddel and Scott Lexicon is a work of scholarship located in the tradition of late 19th century classics scholarship, that is, the editors regularly give the Latin translation of the Greek before the English (since until recently it was assumed that a study of Latin would accompany a study of Greek), the work has enduring value to both scholars and those for whom an interest in Greek is merely an enjoyment. The big Liddel will not disappoint if you're willing to make the financial investment."},{"Title":"A Greek-English lexicon","review":"Excellent resource.

They just summarize the text in arid words, and then skip to the next philosopher in the chronicle order. Writers of those textbook seem to think that we should rever the philopophers, do not understand them. Reading through them only gives us the superficial impression and worse, the knowledge we&iexcl;ve got is likely to be evaporated to the oblivion. We can&iexcl;t imagine that those philosophers lived their own life and breathed the air just like us. But the texts they left to us have what to say. And it&iexcl;s closely related to its own time. To understand those texts, we need to know their worlds, for the text says about the world it&iexcl;s written. Greek philosophy and literature also should be apprehended with such background knowledge. For example, there were no professional philosophers isolated from the rest of the society in Archaic Greek world, like professors of philosophy we could see in our Universities. Greek philosophers told about their worldly affairs. So Aristotle was mastered that much various fields from political sciences, ethics, aesthetics, cosmology to botany. In other word, we should know their life to figure out what they say at all. Greek philosophy was not isolated from the society unlike contemporary philosophy. This book should be definitely helpful to know their time. As the title of the book implies, this deals with how the Greek saw their world. Each chapter describes the way they see elements of their world from the religion, the state, the individual, to the art. With closing the last page of the book, I bet you could illustrate what was the life of the Greek in your mind."},{"Title":"The Greek view of life","review":"I read this book prior to beginning a course on Greek mythology, and I'm finding its insights into ancient Greek culture helpful as I follow my lessons."},{"Title":"The Greek view of life","review":"The quarrel of the philosophers with the myths is not that they are not true, but that they are not edifying. The opposition between science and religion was developed early in ancient Greece. Plato, the deepest thinker, was also the farthest from popular faith. The Greek religion involved a belief in a number of deities who were personifications of the powers of nature and were founders and sustainers of civil society. The harmony which was the essence of Greek civilization was a temporary compromise.In the Greek conception the citizen was an aristocrat. In the majority of the Greek states slaves were a greater part of the population. The states Crete and Sparta were practically military garrisons. The majority of the Greek states were in a constant state of flux. The Peloponnesian War represented a contest between democratic and oligarchic states. Plato based his REPUBLIC chiefly on Sparta. The constitution of Athens was political equality imposed on social inequality. The Greek states were not well-organized.The fusian of the idea of the beautiful and the good is the control point in the Greek theory of art. Primarily, Greek sculpture was an expression of the national religion. Music was the center of Greek education. Music is a union of melody and rhythm and poetry. Poetry was viewed as a storehouse of practical wisdom. To represent suffering as the punishment of sin is the constant bent of Aeschylus. To justify the law of God against the presumption of man is the central idea of Sophocles. In Greek tragedy the general point of view predominates. The Greeks sought to create and maintain essential harmony."},{"Title":"Magic Lantern Guides: Nikon N90s * F90x","review":"Subject material is explained poorly, probably due in part to an inadequate translation from the original German text.The (mostly bland) pictures do not illustrate how camera features were utilized to get the 'ideal' image.

Its extremely factual, almost a bit to much with the who's connected to who chain of command type explanations, but hey, the author is a reporter for the New York Daily News so if she has the dirt why not throw it in. Also, if you like South Beach, it's interesting to get a perspective of how it all started. The story unfolds in sort of like the Rat-Pack in Vegas type film with a ballsy NY City boy hitting Miami by storm.Being from Westchester NY myself I know a few of the names mentioned in the book and owning hospitality properties in Hollywood Beach Fl. I also do the back and forth thing and visit South Beach often. You do see many of the NY faces in the South Beach hotspots almost as if the two cities are somehow connected and not 1700 miles apart.The thing is, Chris may have gone almost as far, maybe just as far if he had stayed legit, but hey then we may not be reading about him. The book does undoubtedly prove that anyone can do anything, including rise to the top of a starlit hotspot city, fool people all over the East Coast, hook up with supermodels, mingle with Madonna and J-Lo, murder and fall from grace like a led balloon within a few years.By Kevin Kingston, author of: A 20,000% Gain in Real EstateMy Blog: The Real Estate Investors BlogAt Bloglines"},{"Title":"Mob over Miami","review":"I haven't received it yet .....? all paid for but still yet to have even an e-mail to let me know its been dispatched"},{"Title":"Mob over Miami","review":"I thought this was a great book.

A shiftless thug with no legitimate accomplishments to his name bludgeons his way to nightclub fame in Miami, destroying lives along the way and exacting a huge toll on society.Paciello and his buddies were gangster Staten Island wannabes with none of the intelligence or style of any of the wise guys they emulated from several generations earlier. Mob Over Miami is rampant with tales of awkward shootings in broad daylight, conspicuous firebombing of competitor nightclubs, and fights that more often than not were the equivalent of sucker punching a deaf and blind man. What a fake Paciello was: his muscles were fake (he was a steroid abuser); his Italian name and heritage were fake (he's German); and, most flagrantly, his business acumen was fake and earned at the barrel of a gun. Still, those things didn't stop lowlifes like Madonna, Ingrid Casares, and Niki Taylor from their abject worship, even when Paciello's criminal past was impossible to ignore (e.g., he was part of a botched burglary attempt that left a housewife answering the door shot dead in her own home).The only good thing to come out of these graceless accounts of criminal ineptitude is when these worms tuned on one another or, better yet, rubbed one another out (e.g., Paulie Gulino). Unfortunately, Paciello sang quickly and loudly enough to authorities to evade punishment, and is allegedly in the Federal Witness Protection Program.Michelle McPhee did a fabulous job of making this story entertaining while somehow giving her subjects as much dignity as she could, given what she had to work with. Mob Over Miami is nowhere nearly as tabloid-ready as it probably deserves to be. It's easy to see that the author was passionate about her subject matter, and she wove a riveting tale that made you forget that Paciello is more Joey Buttafucco than John Gotti. She's a tough New Yorker, too, which lends the tale a healthy dose of credibility and flair."},{"Title":"Mob over Miami","review":"\\"Mob Over Miami\\" details the rise and fall of one Chris Paciello, who, through a combination of luck, toughness, street-smarts, and charisma, became a major player in South Florida's nightclub scene after he left New York.

I will state, however, that, in my opinion, the author, Michelle McPhee, is without a doubt one of the best true crime writers around today.

Action packed non stop. Her writing took you flawlessly from one story to the next. I don't know what that other reviewer was talking about when he said the author jumped around chronologically. For the most part she stayed steady on track the whole way through.She sucked you into the story and held you there making you experience all your senses. She described everything in detail so that a mental picture formed while she took you on a ride through a young kids life of minor crimes to a huge crime ( I won't give it away) and then you ran away with Chris Pacello to Miami where he started a new life for himself. His life crescendoed then fell when an ........well you know what I won't tell you and give it away.

He delivered his share of beatdowns as well. Trying to avoid the heat of New York, where he was aligned with various low-level street crews of wannabe wiseguys, he fled to South Beach, Miami, where he had various contacts and was able to open up a successful club, starting a massive snowball that would go uphill in a hurry before tumbling down.This book is a good indication of the difference between careful, career criminals and those who make good only to destroy it in a hurry. Paciello's reign was short, and he wasn't helped by the buddies who ratted him out. This is not a flattering photo of anyone but rather a presentation of thieves who would rob anyone and everyone they could, rob their own friends, and screw you over without thinking.The book is certainly serviceable of its kind, written by a Daily News reporter with typical poetic touches here and there, but overall a decent read. Included are photos (usually mug shots) of some of the characters like Mikey 'Flat Top' and 'Messy Marvin', hardly a fascinating portrait of the criminal mind. If the picture of Paciello is at all accurate, it's doubtful he will remain in Witness Protection very long. Recommended for true crime mob addicts, as well as anyone who lives in Brooklyn (Bensonhurst, Dyker Heights, Bay Ridge) or Staten Island, since you'll recognize names, places, and events."},{"Title":"Mob over Miami","review":"I picked up this book because I needed something to read on the Beach and the story was interesting because I am from the same place as Chris Paciello was from. I never expected to enjoy the book as much as I did. Michele McPhee left no stone unturned and kept me wanting more. I remembered most of the stories that she relates and it was fun reading about the New York haunts that I myself, have been to. I really recommend this book and hope Ms. McPhee writes another one. It really is a shame though, that the &quot;rats&quot; who are involved in the same crimes that others own up to, are let off the hook so easily."},{"Title":"Mob over Miami","review":"If you like crime stories, you will like this book about a small-time thug who leaves Brooklyn for Miami and becomes a celebrity. Unfortunately, one particular crime was more heinous that most, the cold-blooded murder of a housewife in a botched robbery. Years later this comes back to haunt Chris Ludwigsen/Chris Pacello.Pacello becomes involved in a nightclub in South Beach that becomes very hot. He changes his image from a mafia goon to a suave nightclub owner to the stars. It's amazing how far he travels from his past. A few changes to the wardrobe, new hairstyle, talk a little less Brooklyn, continue the steroids and have something the celebrities want, a really hot nightclub in a great party town and you're good to go. Of course, you can't take the city out of the boy so there are run-ins with his first partner, an arson and a few beatings that must be administered. A small price to pay to date beautiful women in my book.But once he thinks he has it all, his world comes crashing down as he is arrested and tried for the murder. This book does a great job following the twist and turns in the trial as well as the intricacies of the underworld hierarchy. While this is not a work of art, if you enjoy reading about the crime world, or you enjoy celebrity name-dropping, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Mob over Miami","review":"This is well written book mostly about Chris Ludwigsen, who skipped from one NYC mob crew to the next in his early years. A guy who could never be made, because he wasn't Italian. It centers around a couple different crews, mostly the bath house crew associated with the Bonnano's under Consigliere Anthony Spero. Ludwigsen skipped around with variuos members of the crime families, Bonnano, Colombo( the one's who hepled pull off the goodfella's stock scandal. It also goes into who killed Gus Farace. Chris Ludwigsen leaves NYC and starts nightclubs in Miami(pulling off robberies and stuff that helped him become the night club king in Miami's south beach area. His downfall would come from New York over a botched robbery done with others in 1993 that eventually leads to him being taken back to New York and finally flipping to testify..probaly mostly in future cases..especially the government trying to nail Colombo boss allie boy persico. In all it's a good book, well written, but not as profound as say Donnie Brasco.

There are separate chapters on volcanoes, earthquates, floods, pandemics, mass extinctions, etc. One should bear in mind the author's long standing opposition to the Alvarez hypothesis of meteoric impact as the defining cause of the Cretaceous Mass Extinction. They give only one side of the story. And their objections to the now widely accepted Alvarez Theory have all been satisfactorily answered. Aside from this, however, this is a well worthwhile book. It's later chapters are devoted to human impact on nature, ozone depletion, carbon dioxide build up, and the exponential curves of population growth, energy consumption. &quot;Ignorance is the essence of the problem that humanity faces...&quot; is how they phrase the current problem, finally concluding that now is the time to &quot;Think Globally and Act Globally&quot;.

I just recently read ''Snow Dog'',another Kjelgaard favorite of mine, and now I see where Chiri came from. Read ''Snow Dog'' first to get the full story of Chiri's history. This is by far Kjelgaard's greatest work. If you are a dog lover,like me, or you need a thrilling adventure book this is a must read. And thank's Jim for all of your books,they are all captivating and thrilling."},{"Title":"Wild Trek","review":"This is the sequel to \\"Snow Dog\\". These are my favorite books by Jim Kjelgaard. Intrepid trapper Link Stevens and his semi-wild dog Chiri are in for a big adventure when an injured ranger rides into their camp. The ranger is tough, but his arm is badly broken and he cannot complete his mission: to find a naturalist and his pilot whose plane crashed in the unexplored virgin wilderness of the Caribou Range to the north. Link sets up the ranger in his cabin and sets out to find the downed plane. Link and Chiri's home territory is sparse and hungry this year. It is early spring. After a bad winter of trapping, Link is amazed at the bounty of nature he finds as he and his dog journey north on foot. The Caribou Range is mythic and virgin territory. Link only knows of two others who earlier ventured there, and never returned. A sign of earlier visitors to the Caribou Range is a grizzly Link is forced to kill. Its body contains the remenants of an arrow fashioned from spent ammunition. Things get complicated when Link finds a human footprint. This book is filled with even more outdoor adventure, survival, and natural beauty than the first book, \\"Snow Dog\\". It is really exciting reading."},{"Title":"Wild Trek","review":"This wilderness adventure story starts slowly, but the action picks up once our hero, Link Stevens, finds the men he was sent in the mountains to find. Thats when the chalenlege of bringing these men to safety begins. The story begins when Link Stevens volunteers to retrieve two men who crashed a plane in the mountains. Link brings his loyal wolf\\\\dog Chiri. After some time Link finds the men alive, yet one of them has gone crazy from the isolation. Link must then battle the elements, wild animals, and all of the challenges of the mountains. all the while his dog Chiri helps greatly in this struggle.

I love this book!"},{"Title":"Wild Trek","review":"Wild Trek is a story about a trapper, Link Stevens, and his loyal companion a snow dog named Chiri. Wild Trek tells the story of Stevens and Chiri as they travel together to find a Naturalist and a Bush Pilot who are stranded in the far out reaches of civilization because their plane crashed in the remote back country of Northern Alaska. Stevens and Chiri must cross the Caribou Mountains, a place from which no man has ever returned, to save these men.From the first page of the book, I was hooked on Alaska. The author Jim Kjelgaard describes every detail of the Alaskan landscape with much detail and color. Stevens and Chiri experience many ups and downs during their journey to safety. There were many turning points in the story; just as soon as one problem was solved another one would arise, creating new challenges to be overcome.Wilderness survival books are my favorite and this is by far one of the best I have read. If you like wilderness survival and action packed stories then you will like Wild Trek. Read this book and join Stevens and Chiri as they try to return the stranded travelers to civilization."},{"Title":"Wild Trek","review":"How could I forget Chiri the husky snow dog in the novel ... Snow Dog. I 1st read the book Snow Dog as an 11 year old back in the 80's. And it went on to be one of my childhood classics. I read it no less than 22 times (believe). And I had no idea there was even a sequel, until I stumbled on it here on Amazon.Wow.And \\"Wild Trek\\" doesn't disappoint. Uniting Link and Chiri once again.Lets face it, the lead character Chiri on his own sells this book; without having to read far into the blurb. Once I knew it was him, my mind was made up to purchase the book.A great vivid, romping, wilderness adventure, with enough predators -- cougars, and wolf packs to worry about as you plowed in. Sadly, there's no book 3.A definite recommend.

He set a record for most home runs in a season by a third baseman.He also holds the record for most home runs in a career, and on magical day in Chicago he belted 4 home runs on consecutive at bats. The reading of this book was truly a pleasure.Ranking tied for second on the best of 1999 in my reviews, you'll be hard pressed to find another book like this. The true book for the serious Phillies fan and for those true baseball purists. I can't say enough great things about this book!"},{"Title":"Mike Schmidt: Philadelphia's Hall of Fame Third Baseman","review":"&quot;Although I have not personally attended a game in well over 35 years, I can appreciate the personal heroism and character attributed to Schmidt by Dr. Kashatus."},{"Title":"Mike Schmidt: Philadelphia's Hall of Fame Third Baseman","review":"The author does a nice job recounting Schmidt's career -- that is to say, his research was good. That being said, there's a temptation when someone writes about his boyhood hero (and the author expresses his admiration for Schmidt in the introduction) to put the subject on a pedestal no matter what, to apologize for perceived problems, or, worse, both. Unfortunately, the author falls victim to both temptations, and the book suffers because of it. The book will serve those who don't know much about Schmidt fairly well. For those who know more about him, you won't learn much that is new. The book also lacks meaningful analysis about Schmidt's career. In summary, I expected more on this subject and from this author, and I was disappointed."},{"Title":"Mike Schmidt: Philadelphia's Hall of Fame Third Baseman","review":"The danger when someone writes about a childhood hero (which the author admits in his introduction) is that the author can idolize the subject without question, apologize for certain aspects of his baseball life, or worse, both. Kashatus' book is well-researched, but it falls prey to both temptations. The result is a somewhat saccharine effort whose goal is to lionize Schmidt without much critical analysis regarding Schmidt's approach to the game and the fans. If you don't know much about Schmidt, then the book might be helpful, but if you do, you'll be disappointed."},{"Title":"Mike Schmidt: Philadelphia's Hall of Fame Third Baseman","review":"As far as the book itself goes, it is a very factual, general account of Michael Jack and his career. Mostly gleaned from old newpaper clippings and quotes, it reads more like a history book than anything. (although I was able to skim through it in just an hour at the library). Not being a fan of baseball whatsoever, this biography actually did nothing for me. So why the 4 stars?I'll tell you why. I am from the Philadelphia area and am very familiar with our reputation as fans. I am a Flyers, Sixers, Eagles and Phillies fan, I will never sell out no matter how bad those clowns are and no matter where I live. Schmitty always whined and cried about the treatment he received there and there's one little passage in this book thats worth your time to read.One snowy morning, Michael &quot;2 Bad knees and a dream&quot; Jack was chasing after his daughter when 2 kids saw him and excitedly started yelling his name.

I loved his amiable characters and intriguing plot of mixed identities and mottled muddle of Tudor lifestyles. This is not one of his greatest books, yet it still contains a Twain essence which lends itself to make it nonetheless enjoyable to read.I especially loved the development of Tom and Prince/King Edward. The ingenuity and pluck of these two boys made their switched places seem plausibly possible as they had to learn to cope with their new surroundings. Tom, in my opinion, did a much better job of this by actually pretending he was the royal monarch instead of insisting he was none other than himself, which Edward consistently did and therefore reaped the consequences. I also loved how Twain brought all of the characters together in the end and unraveled the twisted plot in a nice and tidy conclusion.Although I liked this story very much, I thought that Twain did not put as much brain power into this tale as he did in, say, Huckleberry Finn. Although the book is very fun and adventuresome, I find a lack of consequential meaning. There is a plethora of criticism on royal and base habits alike (sometimes it is a bit overstated as in the tremendous ceremony for the smallest things, like the king dressing in the morning). But when it comes to universal meaning of human nature and internal conflict, The Prince and the Pauper falls short of my expectations. Granted, Mark Twain does not write in the soul searching style of Conrad or Shelley, and if he did I probably wouldn't read his books, but I would have liked to have come from reading this tale with some sort of scholarly thought to take with me other than to wonder what it would be like to switch places with someone else (which is actually very interesting to think about).Even though I found The Prince and the Pauper a little less than intellectually stimulating, I loved the sketch it made of its colorful characters and of Tudor England. I very much enjoyed strolling through its pages and witnessing a wonderful and entertaining story of mixed identities and subsequent adventures. It did make me wonder what it would be like to walk a few miles in someone else's shoes, and then it made me realize that mine, smelliness and all, are truly the best fit for me."},{"Title":"The Prince and the Pauper (Mark Twain Library)","review":"The Prince and the Pauper was written in a very good style, it kept up with the society and language of the time period very well. Also, it displayed the stylish and luxrious lifestyle of the royality, along with the power. It was quite enjoyable in that it provided discriptions of the pomp and simplicity of the plot. However, numerous parts of the book were very tragic and depressing, and showed a little bit too much of the hardships put upon the characters, and could be a little inappropriate at times."},{"Title":"The Prince and the Pauper (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Since the prince and the pauper know nothing of each other's life works,the book can be quite funny at times with the boys getting into some hilarious situations.9"},{"Title":"The Prince and the Pauper (Mark Twain Library)","review":"OK, but not worth the read.

It was a bit uninteresting. Lots of old English, but it is well written by superb author."},{"Title":"The Prince and the Pauper (Mark Twain Library)","review":"The Prince and the Pauper was a classic example of early literature. It was written like every other Mark Twain book, in old English dialect. I could understand it, but at times I had to read some areas over again to get what he was saying. I read this book for a literature assingment, and I did not enjoy it. Some areas of the book are funny and quite charming, but overall the story is really hard to get into. If you like fairy tales or stories from medievil times, this is the book for you. I really think I could have read a book better than this one with my time though. I also recommend: &quot;Princess: A tale of life under the veil in Saudi Arabia&quot; By: Jean Sasson"},{"Title":"The Prince and the Pauper (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Beloved by readers young and old, yet somewhat discounted by scholars and critics, \\"The Prince and the Pauper\\" is atypical among Twain's novels. Forgoing the bawdy and irreverent humor common to his other works and indulging in a somewhat moralistic tone, it was the one book that received wholehearted approval from his normally censorious wife (who, with the Clemens children, staged it as a family play for Christmas). It rightfully has become a children's classic.The larger-than-life characters (caricatures, really) and the fantasy element are what ultimately endear the book to so many readers. From Tom's ogre-like father, John Canty, to the heroic and hermitic Miles Hendon, members of the supporting cast frequently steal scenes from the principal players. Tom and Edward, on the other hand, are largely servants to the plot, but manage to offer fulfillment of a different kind: the unfortunate but likable misfit ascends the class system with some amusing mishaps, while the haughty, spoiled, and somewhat undeserving brat is brought low--and both boys learn from the experience. Twain's purpose, as he told William Dean Howells in a letter, is to force the prince-turned-king to undergo \\"the exceeding severity laws of that day by inflicting some of the penalties upon the king himself,\\" and there is the satisfying schadenfreude of watching Edward being served a taste of his own medicine. As he did (to better effect) in \\"Puddn'head Wilson,\\" Twain supplements the idea that all men are created equal with a plot that pits nature against nurture; these two kids, while both deserving of society's kindnesses, are nevertheless products of their upbringing.As both children's fiction and a historical novel, \\"The Prince and the Pauper\\" is not without its faults. The faux Shakespearean dialogue is more faux than Shakespearean, and I am sure that some young readers will find it difficult or tedious. (I can't recall if it posed any difficulties for me when I read it as a child.) In addition, Twain can't help but show off his research notes from his source material, primarily to convince the reader of the authenticity of the prince's more extreme experiences; the effect, however, can be a bit clumsy. And, aside from a few relatively innocuous political comments regarding the author's contempt for monarchies, there is less of the grown-up content to be found in the Twain's other novels often read by children (such as the superior \\"Connecticut Yankee,\\" or \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and its sequels).But don't let the book's faults spoil the fun. Even 125 years later, this enduringly famous story of switched identities retains the wholesome charms and riveting melodrama enjoyed so much by Twain's own family, and just waiting to be enjoyed by yours."},{"Title":"The Prince and the Pauper (Mark Twain Library)","review":"A world away from Mark Twain's more popular Tom Sawyer/Huck Finn novels, THE PRINCE AND THE PAUPER takes place during the 'second quarter of the 16th century' in Tudor England's London. As young boys from polar opposite social situations become accidentally switched, the reader is treated to an adventure story with a fairy tale-like simplicity and obvious lessons. Mark Twain's wit and humor is on prominent display throughout this one, with all of the situations and characters speaking towards the now ridiculous-seeming way of life and social structure of the seriously brutal 16th century. Really a satirical look at the unjust facts of life from that long ago time, this book is both amusing and potentially educational. One thing though, Did peasant women really used to drown unwanted kittens?? Don't think PETA would stand for that today..While it is a relatively short and easy story, some young or inexperienced readers may find the Old English writing difficult and annoying. However, if you stick with it, most will find that after a while it becomes easier to digest and makes for a very pleasant read. A children's story with valuable lessons even today. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Prince and the Pauper (Mark Twain Library)","review":"The story takes place in a country called Whales, or in a small city called England. The two main characters are Tudor and Tom. Tom was a pauper, and Tudor was a rich prince. Much time later the pauper and the prince get wswitched in their lifestyles and now have to live each other's life! What I liked most about the book was when Tom and Tudor get mixed up, and also it talks about each other's lifestyle and how thry get through it.What I didnt like about the book is the old english talk. It is is English but it is very hard to understand and it doesent make sence. The words seem to run together and it can get annoying.My favorite character is Tom Canty. he is the pauper who lives in the huge village below King Henry the 8th's castle. He is a beggar and when he comes home, he usually comes home empty handed with no foodor drink to provide the starving family with.Many nights he would come home and get a beating by his father because he didn't bring it home. But one day while the prince was in the village church praying, he heard the soldier being mean to Tom and came out quickly to tell him to stop then he saw Tom. Unhealthy, bruised and pail. \\"What is your name lad\\" asked the prince to the pauper. \\"Tom\\" said he \\"You look pail, let me take to the palace and get fed. One of the passages that really meant something to me was when Tom was thrown down on the ground by the soldier, and the prince came out to save him then took him to the palace. What I would say to someone about this book is that it is a very good midieval story with plenty of action. But what I don't understand is that after the prince becomes a prince again, Tom doesn't get to live in the castle anymore. My strongest reason for reccommending this book to someone is that it is great historical fiction and deals with kings, princes, and paupers. Well that is all I have to say! thanks: Oh yeah there is one more thing: this book is so weird that Think spongebob would like it!"},{"Title":"The Prince and the Pauper (Mark Twain Library)","review":"The Prince and the Pauper was written by Mark Twain in 1882. Although 33 chapters and 209 pages are sandwiched between this book's covers, it is a work that is meant to be chewed slowly, and digested carefully. The Prince and the Pauper is a literary feast, but if you aren't careful, you will get indigestion.Set in England, during the reign of Henry the Eighth, this tale is enticingly sweet. Twain's story begins in not one place, but in two utterly diverse locations: the king's palace, and the lowly, cramped rooms of Offal Court. In one situation, a lofty lord is born, but in the other, humble Tom Canty arrives to trouble his family with another mouth to feed. The entire nation rejoices with the birth of the prince, but no one heeds the pauper. Later in the story, lovable, loyal characters such as Miles Hendon and princess Elizabeth are brought out of Twain's vast menagerie of actors. The protagoni, the Prince Edward and Tom Canty, act entirely different from one another, but look exactly alike.Trouble first begins when Tom and Edward playfully switch places, and Tom is left in the palace as the real prince leaves seeking entertainment. When he is harassed, a heroic warrior jumps to the misplaced monarch's defense. Meanwhile, poor Tom Canty of Offal Court is belabored by the wearisome customs of the court. Without warning, the King Henry the Eighth dies, leaving his \\"son\\" to the throne. Back in the streets of London, the prince is captured by Tom Canty's father, who takes him for his own son. With Miles Hendon hounding his steps, Canty falls in with a band of vagabonds. Fortunately, the prince escapes, but only to be attacked by a crazed hermit who thinks that he is a\\"mere archangel\\" with a claim to the papacy. Slowly the time passes for poor, nervous Tom Canty, with his coronation drawing closer. After a while, he develops a taste for life at court, and begins to fear the possibility of the real prince's return. Recaptured by John Canty, Edward re-escapes to Miles Hendon, who is on a journey to recover his rightful lands from his treacherous brother, Hugh Hendon. In all of his travels, the prince, (who now considers himself king because of his father's death) realizes how cruel English punishment really is, especially when Miles is put to the pillory, and bears the lashes of the whip. Finally, the day of coronation is at hand, and Tom Canty is actually looking forward to the pomp and glory of the ceremony. Proudly he greets his people, without a thought to his old family, until he spots his mother with the crowd. At Westminster Abbey, he was about to accept his crown, when the actual prince shouted out: \\"I forbid you to set the crown of England on that forfeited head. I am the king!\\" In a moment of truth, Tom Canty proves that Edward is really all that he claims to be, explaining their foolish exchange of clothing. The populace is amazed, and Edward inherits the crown of England.Twain seizes one with a gentle jolt, and seals him into this book, welds the entrance shut behind the reader by simply stating the facts: \\"In the ancient city of London, on a certain autumn day in the second quarter of the sixteenth century, a boy was born to a poor family of the name of Canty, who did not want him. On the same day another English child was born to a rich family of the name of Tudor, who did want him. All England wanted him too.\\" This charming way to draw a reader in is a shining merit to the genius of Mark Twain. As the artist builds up to his dizzying climax, he follows each event of his protagoni's lives carefully, building their characters until the reader feels the same joys and pains that they feel. Peacefully the book begins, and serenely it ends. Nothing could possibly improve this classic but greater recognition. You will assuredly return again and again to the Prince and the Pauper, with greater relish each time."},{"Title":"The Prince and the Pauper (Mark Twain Library)","review":"(...)This book is about two boys who were born on the same year, same day, but are still very different. One was the prince of England, while the other was a peasant. One day, the prince was taking a walk around his castle, when he saw a peasant being kicked around by a gaurd. the prince brought the boy into his castle. Then they noticed how similar they looked, and decided to see how they would look in each other's clothes. Thats how the problem began. The prince mistakenly was kicked out of the castle, and the peasant remained trapped within the castle.(...)The things I liked about this book were when the prince and the pauper were at the ceremony being asked questions, when the pauper changed clothes, and when the royal adviser thought that the prince has gone mad.The events that I didn't like about this book were when Miles Hendon was being tortured, when the prince was forced to steal, and when the prince was about to be killed by the hermit.My favorite part of this book was when prince Edward and the pauper Tom got back together."},{"Title":"The Prince and the Pauper (Mark Twain Library)","review":"This novel by Mark Twain is truly a timeless piece of literature.

I very much enjoyed reading the book, and I feel that most people would find the book humorous, full of adventure, and fun to read."},{"Title":"The Prince and the Pauper (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Mark Twain was a true American original, one of American ltierature's titanic figures . He was also, as anyone who bothers to dig beneath the \\"guy-who-wrote-Tom-Sawyer-and-Huck-Finn\\" surface knows, a man with distinct and perhaps slightly provocative opinions. One of the things he most detested was monarchy, once calling it \\"the grotesquest swindle ever invented by man.\\" In his later highly controversial novel A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court, he took on the concept in a vicious and fearless adult satire. In this, a prior novel, he did the same while aiming principally at younger readers. The story, while featuring a lot of Middle English dialect, is written in fairly simple and straight-forward prose, opening the book up to readers young and old. The oft-forgotten original subtitle, A Tale For Young People of All Ages, perfectly sums up the merits; while it may have been written primarily with a young target audience in, adults can easily enjoy and appreciate it. Though of novel length, the style recalls classic fairy tales and will probably be appealing to any child who likes to read. Adults will note and appreciate the deeper meanings and Twain's ever-present wit. The book is very well-written; though a master writer, Twain was sometimes prone to clumsy prose in novels - but not here. The Prince and the Pauper is practically a tour-de-force of character development and suspense . Reccommended to younger readers looking to broaden their horizons and Twain fans of any age.As a final thing worth mentioning, many reviewers have commented that the dialect -- which Twain uses in nearly all his writings, which is part of the reason he was such a great writer, not to mention why he is American literature's true father -- is hard to understand. If these assertions have bothered you, however, rest assured; they are greatly exaggerated. There is not that much dialogue, and word meanings are usually obvious - even to children; we must remember the audience after all. Most children who would read this would probably already be familar with these elementary colloquial phrases from King Arthur stories. Even if not, Twain foresaw this - and was helpful enough to include a useful appendix."},{"Title":"The Prince and the Pauper (Mark Twain Library)","review":"This book is a sublime \`drama' of errors. The prince and the pauper change clothes and are mistaken by the whole population for one another. The prince lives a life of a vagabond and the pauper a royal one. In other words, all men are equal; one has only to change the garments. And, \`So evanescent and unstable are men's works in the world.'This book gives a fair picture of England in the 16th century, worth a Defoe or a Swift: the immense chasm between the rich and the poor, a heavily biased and corrupt judicial system and extremely cruel punishment. \`It was a crime to be hungry in England.'People were hanged for trifling larcenies and slowly boiled for alleged poisoning. \`Witches' were burnt at the stake: \`My good old blameless mother strove to earn bread by nursing the sick; one of these died, the doctors knew not how, so my mother was burnt for a witch, whilst my babes looked on and wailed ... drink to the merciful English law that delivered her from the English hell!'The rich chased their farmers away by foreclosures (changing farms in sheep ranges), making instantly beggars of them. They risked heavily to be sold as slaves.This book is a bittersweet Breughelian comedy about human injustice, cruelty and ultimately generosity.Not to be missed."},{"Title":"The Prince and the Pauper (Mark Twain Library)","review":"The Prince and the Pauper is a classic tale of switched and mistaken identities when two young boys who are similar looking in appearance happen to meet each other and decide to change appearances. Despite the fact that the two look similar, the two boys have led quite different lives--one boy living a poor, destitute life with an abusive father, and the other, living a life of luxury. Once the two boys decide to switch to see how each other looks, they seemingly do not know that it will be hard to switch back. Mark Twain's ability to establish a children's story with a sense of royalty and fantasy intermixed is clearly attributed to his forte as a great versatile writer, both of satire and comedy, as well as fantasy. While the story has a simple idea and basis for its course--the idea that two boys must learn how to live in the \\"others\\" shoes for awhile--the greater strength and stability is to depict a strong moral in the story, which is that we often do not know or appreciate how hard things can be for someone else in life.Another fun aspect of this work is simply the trademark satire from Twain. He has a way of making fun of the idea of royalty in a dignified and subtle way, and has fun once the two boys are in the \\"others\\" world. Not only this, but he has fun \\"overdoing\\" some of the scenes for both boys. Tom Canty is distressed at the process of how much trouble it is to do anything without the \\"Royal Court\\" helping him with an everyday task, from taxing to simple. The king is ashamed at the ill treatment he receives from mean citizens of the town, and despite his protests of being a king, no one listens.Each child gets himself in unwittingly bad circumstances that he wishes himself out of, and each must find ways at adapting to their new life. For instance, Tom Canty cannot believe the power that his words has in the court of law, and he is both shocked, and impressed, by his ability to literally change the course of those condemned to death. Although frightened at first, he learns to manage his new station in life. Meanwhile, the poor king has to life an unaccustomed life of poverty, and must deal with all the malevolent allies of poor Tom's father, despicable individuals who rob, cuss, steal, and are vulgar. Generally, he struggles, but is aided by a generous man named Miles Hendon, who helps him through all the difficulties.Perhaps another moral evoked from Twain's tale is that of not thinking yourself better than another person, despite your or their station in life. The boys seem to have to deal with this by the book's end, and learn their ways, having a greater and deeper appreciation of the opposite point of view.There is plenty of adventure, imagination, and humor to keep you entertained in this book. At times, several scenes do get a little confusing, but overall it is a rather quick and simple read. The Bantam Classic edition also has footnotes to explain terms in the index, and fairly big print easy for reading."},{"Title":"The Prince and the Pauper (Mark Twain Library)","review":"If there's anyone out there who's familiar with \\"The Princess and The Pauper\\", they should explore this novel and will find it a little more interesting. Mark Twain sorta trades in the modern life of boyhood to the twists of old day England.We are taken to 16th-century London where two boys are born at the same time in different societies: one to royalty and one to poverty. Their names are Edward Tudor and Tom Canty.Fifteen years later, not much has changed for these two boys. Edward lives in a beautiful part of London where there are fancy houses with bright colors and dazzling decor. Tom lives in a poor neighborhood with a house so broken and small for his large family. Their only way to make ends meet is to beg for food and money. But it isn't long until these two strangers meet and how it'll change their lives forever.Just after meeting, the two talk like good friends about their lives and they even trade each of their clothes, but then things take an unexpected turn. Mistaken for a peasant, the prince gets thrown out of his own home and is taunted by a nearby crown, while Tom is now mistaken for the prince. They try to tell others about their identities, but they are seen as crazy or out of their minds. So without other options, Tom and Edward will have to learn to be like other and keep out of harm's way.\\"P & P\\" is nothing usual from the mind of Mark Twain, and it's certainly different from any of his other novels on boyhood. It felt more like a historical tale mixed with a little pinch of fairy tale feeling. On the other hand, it was and is an enjoyable tale on trading places. There's a lot of excitement and twist, as well as the journey of these two boys. Older kids should truly check this novel out to get in touch with the fairy tale. This tale manages to be both realistic and venturing, without being too obvious.Final Verdict: An amazing tale of two boys that has spirit, adventure, and emotion."},{"Title":"The Prince and the Pauper (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Mark Twain is arguably the best storyteller in American history, and this story is one of his most endearing tales. Unlike \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Huckleberry Finn\\", it has no claim on the title of \\"THE great All-American Novel\\", because it is not set in America, or even at a time in which America existed as an entity; at the time of this novel's setting, the American colonies were only beginning to be settled. It is, however, both one of the most moving of Twain's novels, and one of the most enjoyable.Given the quality of some books that I have rated at five stars in the past, I'd have to say that if it were allowed, this book would be rated at seven stars out of five. There are few books that I enjoy rereading more than this one."},{"Title":"The Prince and the Pauper (Mark Twain Library)","review":"The book was well packed arrived on time to do the report and was a good read."},{"Title":"The Prince and the Pauper (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Twain's classic socio-economic fairy tale may not be his strongest or best-written work, but it is certainly profound and clever.

If anything, the pauper-prince and Miles would have been accused as imposters, and beheaded at the Tower of London the next day.Also, if the book actually ended as it did , the king would have to silence Tom forever.One way or another, no happy endings can exist.And, given what happened during the actual Edward VI's reign, it is likely that Tom would have made a better king."},{"Title":"The Prince and the Pauper (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Mark Twain's, The Prince and the Pauper is a classic look back into sixteenth-century English society. Tom Canty is a young boy who is born into poverty and is forced to beg in the streets of London by his father. Edward Tudor is the Prince of Wales, heir to the throne. Both of these boys were born on the same day but grew up in opposite ways of life. One day Tom is dreaming about being a prince and starts walking towards the royal palace. When he reaches the palace the guards try to stop him but Prince Edward sees Tom's condition and invites him to his quarters to hear what Tom has to say. While they sit there they begin to realize what strong resemblance there is between them and decide to switch clothes to fulfill Tom's dream of looking Princely. All of a sudden Edward storms out of the room to denounce the guards who did harm to Tom, only to be mistaken as the poor pauper and locked out of the royal palace. From here on out the two boys experience what life is like in the other's shoes. Mark Twain does an outstanding job of developing each character and showing how each must learn new ideas to deal with their latest way of life. Unfortunately I did find myself losing my concentration while reading this book. This easily could have been due to the fact that the way Twain wrote The Prince and the Pauper was actually on a very easy reading level, which would lead me to recommend this book to readers of middle school age who enjoy adventurous tales like The Boxcar Children or The Hardy Boys."},{"Title":"The Prince and the Pauper (Mark Twain Library)","review":"The Prince and the Pauper is Mark Twain's historical novel of mistaken identity. In it, Prince Edward and a filthy, destitute urchin who looks exactly like him inadvertently switch places. The majority of the book is spent following the boys, particularly Edward, as they attempt (or not) to regain their rightful places.This book features numerous historical characters, and Twain researched them and the time period well. There is a great deal of social commentary here, as Twain has quite a lot to say about some of the more ruthless laws that England has had. He also delivers a rather ironic commentary on the social classes of the day.The Prince and the Pauper is entertaining, although it suffers from slow pacing. There's entirely too much time spent with people carrying on about how each imposter has gone mad, and how he must be humored, and how this will put him to rights again. It grows tiresome, as does Edward's continual attempts to assert his kingly rights while dressed in rags. His learning curve is a straight line.All in all, The Prince and the Pauper is an entertaining enough book, and certainly it inspired innumerable inferior derivatives like few works have, but it doesn't quite measure up to Twain's later work of historical fiction, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court."},{"Title":"The Prince and the Pauper (Mark Twain Library)","review":"It's a book everyone knows but hardly anyone seems to read, notes Jerry Griswold in his introduction to the Penguin edition of this book. Even well-read people who recognize the importance of Mark Twain often regard \\"The Prince And The Pauper\\" as kiddy lit. Well, it is written for children, yet in a clever and immersive way adults can enjoy, too.Tom Canty is a 16th century London street urchin who dreams of becoming a king. Edward Tudor, Prince of Wales, dreams of escaping his royal confinement. One day Tom stumbles into Westminister and meets Edward. Both are struck by the fact they are practically mirror images of one another. Edward changes clothes with Tom for a lark, then goes outside to upbraid a guard for cuffing Tom. Big mistake. Now Edward is the street urchin, foolishly protesting his kingship, while Tom adjusts to the royal life.Twain wrote this in 1881, between \\"The Adventures Of Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"The Adventures Of Huckleberry Finn.\\" It's darker than the first but lighter than the second, evidence for the theory Twain charted a steady course in his life from cheerful cynic to bitter nihilist. The overall tone of \\"Prince\\" is fairly light, with a style that sends up Sir Walter Scott's roundabout locutions. But dark moments occur with bracing frequency, especially as the story rounds on Edward in peasant's garb. He watches executions by fire, witnesses casual crimes, and hears of the depravity people endure under his father's reign.\\"The world is made wrong,\\" young Tudor observes. \\"Kings should go to school to their own laws, at times, and so learn mercy.\\"There's comedy, too, much of it in what Tom Canty undergoes. In one episode, he discovers it takes a small army to get him dressed in the morning. He also meets another youth whose job is to absorb the corporeal punishment when the young Prince fails his education, a youth who fears he could become unemployed by Tom's instinct for mercy. \\"My back is my bread\\" he cries.The novel is a fun ride and a trip for the imagination, but somewhat indifferent as an adventure story. The main business Edward faces is escaping Tom's cruel father, who turns up rather illogically in several places before disappearing without a word. A subplot involves a down-on-his-luck soldier Edward meets in his wanderings, Miles Hendon; yet the relationship between him and Edward is never explored satisfactorily enough to explain Hendon's selfless loyalty to the boy. Canty's part of the tale falls by the wayside for the book's second half, and never resumes until nearly the end. The novel's conclusion, while satisfying, just sort of happens without any build-up.All these are admittedly the kind of criticisms that occur to one who is really engaged by the book. \\"Prince\\" is very much a pleasure to read, a stylistic detour for Twain that still connects with the kid in all more than a century later."},{"Title":"The Prince and the Pauper (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Mark Twain is one of America's best authors. Unlike books like Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, which chronicle life in 1800s America, The Prince and the Pauper is set in England in the 1500s. But The Prince and the Pauper is like those two other classics in one way--the story is a true boys' adventure story that captures amazingly accurately how kids would act if the story actually happened.The Prince and the Pauper tells the story of poor London child Tom Canty who always pretended that he was a prince. One day, he goes to the palace and meets the crown prince Edward Tutor. It turns out that the two look exactly alike. On a whim, the two boys change clothes. Of course, this leads to disaster. Prince Edward is immediately cast out of the palace by a guard, and Tom Canty is mistaken for the prince. Neither knows how to act, both are afraid, and the people around both think they are mad.As one might expect, Tom Canty gets on better than Edward. He lives every child's fantasy of suddenly becoming rich and adored. Edward has more trouble. He cannot believe that people do not recognize him for the prince. He has to rely on a kind stranger who takes him in despite his apparent madness. However, he learns self-reliance and the meaning of true justice while living among his subjects.Both the prince and the pauper wind up better for the adventure that they had, and as in a good adventure book, both live happily once their difficulties have been resolved."},{"Title":"The Prince and the Pauper (Mark Twain Library)","review":"The Prince and the Pauper written by Mark Twain is an adventurous, exciting book. The book takes place in London around the 1500's. Two boys were born on the same day, Tom Canty and Edward Tudor. Tom Canty was born unto a poor life, and as a boy growing up, \\"Tom's reading and dreaming about princely life wrought such a strong effect upon him that he began to act the prince.\\" And just his luck, did he happen to some across the Prince of Wales, after suffering the hard blow of the soldier knocking him into the crowd. The Prince of Wales is Edward Tudor, the other boy born on the same day but born into a rich and wealthy family. As a result from the encounter, the two boys decide to switch places, as the Prince of Wales says to Tom Canty, \\"Doff thy rags and don these splendors.\\"The book describes the boys' adventures throughout the experience of living each other's lives. As the Prince of Wales lives as the pauper, he is introduced to and learns about many different people such as the Canty family, Miles Hendon, a troop of Vagabonds, Hugo, the peasants, the hermit, and others. And as Tom Canty acts as the Prince of Wales, he experiences living the higher life of royalty, being treated with respect and given so many opportunities and choices.Through having the plot be that the characters switch places, the book is more exciting because the reader could act in the character's place and experience the lifestyles and adventures involved with each person's life. Other than being able to understand better each person's lifestyle with the type of writing, using dialogue in Old English adds a stronger effect to bringing everything back in time to understand the setting. Although at times, the Old English could get confusing.Overall, I thought that this book was interesting because it explains the lifestyles of different people in London around the 1500's in a way that is fun and easy to understand. Although at times, I did feel as if it carried on too much about things that were insignificant. Other than that, the book was good and I would recommend that it be read, if you are interested in adventure.Other adventure books written by Mark Twain, such as The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, were also interesting, but I enjoyed reading The Prince and the Pauper more because it contained more excitement for me."},{"Title":"The Prince and the Pauper (Mark Twain Library)","review":"This is one of the most difficult books I have ever read.

It has comedy and you have to maintain a certain degree of imagination, whimsy, and fantasy in your reading to fully appreciate Twain writing this novel in between his classics Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. Of course in real life, this wouldn't happen but it made for good reading, not only for kids but also for oldsters and academic types if they simply lounge back and enjoy the story. In his biography, I was happy see that Twain became very successful later in life, was world-renowned and appreciated, and also paid off his bills (now-a-days, the course seems to declare bankruptcy and not accept responsibility).A fun read - I passed it on to my daughter."},{"Title":"The Prince and the Pauper (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Most people are familiar with the basic situation of this classic story, but there is much more to Twain's original version than to its many adaptations. Of course, the crucial fact of these two boys being born in such different circumstances at the same time and identical in appearance and meeting as they do is pretty fabulous, but then, it is intended as a fable. At root, this is a story about the arbitrariness of hereditary nobility in general and monarchy in particular, and in true Twain fashion there are many biting and hilarious scenes. However, Twain fails to be true to his own theme in his resolution, which basically amounts to \\"...and despite what you would expect from everything that's happened so far, they all lived happily ever after.\\" It would have been much more powerful and memorable had they failed to prove their true identities and the pauper had remained king, and the king a pauper...but I suppose a lot of readers wouldn't have liked that ending (which would have been the point!). But in any case, Twain's story is well worth reading just as it is.Norman Dietz's lively narration of this audio edition is an excellent way to experience this classic."},{"Title":"The Prince and the Pauper (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Though the violence and vocabulary levels are rather higher than I would expect in a children's book, The Prince and the Pauper deserves a place on every family's shelf. The plot has many little twists and turns that keep it unpredictable. Despite the older English used, the story is easy to read as each sentence flows smoothly into the next. It is packed with historical tidbits, from laws against stealing to the process of dressing the prince. Many of the incidents resulting from the mixup between the boys are very humorous, and the descriptions are delightful. While many readers wish more of the story was focused on Tom's adventures, I appreciated watching Edward's learning and the growth of his character. Overall, the only thing I didn't love about this book is that Twain gives Edward a different reason for his reforming and just rule than that of his faith. As it is so filled with history (Henry VIII, Edward Seymour, etc.), The Prince and the Pauper would make a good launching point for a unit study. Recommended for highschoolers.A note on this edition (Reader's Digest): The cover is beautiful and durable, the font is easy to read, and the pages are thick to resist wear. My favorite part is the helpful footnotes and long historical notes at the back, almost doubling the book's value as historical fiction (they may be in other editions, but they weren't in the ones I had previously read). This was worth a lot more than I paid for it, and I would love to get the rest of the series."},{"Title":"The Prince and the Pauper (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Poor little Tom Canty and Edward, Prince of Whales, could little expect what adventures would ensue the day they innocently exchanged clothes as a means of satisfying their boyish fancies.

Still, I enjoyed this book tremendously!!!"},{"Title":"The Prince and the Pauper (Mark Twain Library)","review":"\\"The Prince and the Pauper\\" is a rather dull story about a prince and a beggar whose physical appearances are uncannilly similar that accidentally switch identities due to trying on each others clothes and being separated by fate at that moment, with the nobility believing the prince had gone mad with a lapse of memory rather than believe he was someone else. The story details how the beggar deals with the situation of trying to ajust to the life of a prince under those circumstances, and how the prince deals with living the life of a beggar. Events occuring to each of the two during their role reversal is long winded and uninteresting with the book's ending being predictable, and the story often depends on annoyingly implausible behaviour of supporting characters. I thought it would be interesting to read the book as I have an original 19th century printing, but I was suprised to find a Mark Twain book to be so boring. I got a good amount into it and then just read the Cliffs notes for the rest. Thumbs down for this one.

These two boys looked very similar and also they were the same age. There was one difference, Edward was born into a Royal family but Tom was born into a poor family. When Tom walked by the palace, the palace guards took him off the palace grounds. At that time, Edward saw the situation and made the guards stop. The Prince, Edward, invited Tom into the palace and gave him some good foods. Edward wanted to change his life style. Tom&iexcl;s life looked good because he always had stress from his palace people and he could not get freedom. Edward and Tom switched their clothes in the palace after Edward heard about Tom&iexcl;s life and family. So, Edward became a poor guy and Tom became a prince.This novel compared two different life styles, which were the life of a prince and the life of a pauper. With changing their positions, the two boys learned how to fit into the two different lives. In the novel, Edward became a poor guy, so he had a really hard life with Tom&iexcl;s name. When he tried to return to his position as a prince, nobody believed him, so he had to conquer the hard life, but he met good friends during the line trial. Tom also had a hard time becoming a prince. At first, he liked the rich life and was happy. Most of the story was about Edward and Tom&iexcl;s changing life styles. Mark Twain compared the two lives and told us that nobody could change their own life on purpose because people were given their birthright before they were born. Although there is a lot of old English, this book, the Prince and the Pauper, is fun to read and all ages enjoy it. This is a good book, but it can be difficult for people whose second language is English because there is a lot of old English, so they cannot understand well. I think this novel is valuable to read because we can learn not to be disappointed in our life. We should be satisfied with our own life.

Twain was a great story-teller in his own right with the ability to inject his own feelings into the book. This book is very much a satire attacking the life under a tyrant. And although the book was written in a good-humored state, one can see the sourness behind it all.The book started out with a prince and a poor lad, who really looked alike, switching clothes. They soon found themselves into very uncomfortable positions as the two had to step into the life of the other. The pauper was very much uncomfortable with all the regal etiquettes imposed and followed in the royal court. And the Prince flowed into the streets, still believing and telling everyone that he was the Prince of England. This only made himself look like a clown, soon the Prince found himself in the company with a bunch of thieves, gangs, and pickpockets. He even drew a spanking from the pauper's vogabond father, who believed the Prince was his son Tom Canty. The two's lives would soon come to at a criss-cross at the coronation of the Prince, and many interesting things ensued.Overall, this book was well-written, well-told, and well-described. I give it a four stars instead of a five because there are small segments in the book that are quite boring, but nothing major that lasts more than 5 pages at a time. This book is definitely a classic that is worth reading."},{"Title":"The Prince and the Pauper (Mark Twain Library)","review":"What does a poor man with an eighth grade education know about the life of Britain's royal family? Not much. I seem to recall enjoying Twain's more famous works when I read them years ago. This book I could not wait to finish, just to get it over with.An unlikley meeting between a pauper and the king-to-be makes the two wonder what it would be like to live in the other's shoes. When they switch clothes, they find they look remarkably similar. The king-to-be leaves the castle to experience life outside the castle while the pauper experiences the pressures of royal life. This causes Twain to write in a style that is far from \\"life on the Mississippi\\". While the twists that eventually bring the rightful king to the throne are moderately exciting, the story is bogged down in Twain's attempts to sound sophisticated.I truly have to strain to say something postive about this book. If you are interested in the plot, maybe you should rent the Disney movie. Buying the Cliff Notes is another strategy. Judging by many of the other reviews, I am not alone in my feeling."},{"Title":"The Prince and the Pauper (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Mark Twain, the writer who began American literature--and without whom there may have been no J.D.

In the end, despite switching places to become less miserable, the boys each discover something that they hadn't thought of.

All have different situations, some more unusal than the next, but no matter the person, we all have struggles.I liked this story. It was interesting and had wonderful descriptions of everything-especially in the royal court. It sounded SO beautiful. On the other hand, some of the dialogue was hard to understand because of the old language.

I have re-read it many, many times, most recently to two of my children (who also enjoyed it), and it continues to be rich and engaging. Since the language is true to the era of the story, however, it may put some readers off. Others will find that the archaic language enhances the tale.A beggar (Tom Canty) and a prince (Edward Tudor), who look so alike as to be twins, meet and swap clothes for a lark. But an accident of judgment stretches the lark into an adventure, and the adventure into a nightmarish struggle of life and death, honor and dishonor.Hasn't everyone wished to be royalty at some point in their lives? And especially if you were the poorest of the poor, like Tom Canty, wouldn't it be your dearest wish as a child? This is a great and yet fearful adventure, superbly detailed and believable.

It is a book about Edward, the Prince of Wales, and Tom, a poor boy from the streets of London. Tom ventures out to the palace to meet a real prince, which was his lifelong desire. Edward rescues Tom from a crowd that jeered at him because of he was clothed in rags. The two become friends. They switch clothes and realize that they look exactly alike! But then everyone mistakes Edward for being the poor boy and Tom for being the prince. The boys are separated.Tom is thought to be the Prince by everyone in the palace. When Henry VIII dies, Tom is declared Edward VI, King of England. He denies it and tries to tell them he is a pauper, but they think he is mad and teach him what he needs to know to act like a king. Tom learns to enjoy being king, but wants to return to his home and family.Edward goes on a quest to find his way back to the kingdom and Tom.

Miles rescues him from another crowd that is about to throw him into the Thames River. He decides to take Edward in with him. Together, they travel to Miles' old home and then to the palace to declare Edward's rightful place as the prince.I enjoyed this book very much.

This book is hard to criticize because it is written by one of the greatest authors, has around for so long, and it is considered a classic. The story is about one prince (Edward Tudor) and one pauper (Tom Canty) who meet each other and end up trading places. At the time they don't realize the resemblance between them, so once they switch places and go off, no one will believe their true identity. This book shows the adventures of these two boys with the roles they end up in, one it the gutters and one in the palace. The main message and theme behind this book is about the natural human fault of judging people merely based on their outward appearance. My overall opinion was that this was a good book and it was fun to read. Yet there were some aspects that I think needed more improvementOne of the aspects that I think needed more developing was the characters At first I was a bit disappointed because, unlike all of the other Mark Twain books I have read, this one had very little character description. There is not much that you know about the two characters and you don't feel connected to them. There was nothing that you could relate to with Canty and Tudor and while reading the book the only image that you had of them was a very vague image. This was why it is pretty hard to get caught up in this book. I believed Mark Twain left a lot about the characters so that he could focus and develop more on the plot and adventure of the story than who they characters actually were.In the book, Tudor is constantly being kidnapped by the pauper's father (John Canty) , who believes that Tudor is his son , and in return Tudor is always running away. After a while of this wild goose chase between Canty and Tudor it gets repetitive and tiresome to the reader. In this book Mark Twain focuses more on the situations of Tudor then those of Canty. He also wrote more about Tudor then Canty. I found the situations with Canty in the princes place were much more interesting and humorous then the situation of Tudor. I would have enjoyed this book more I think if there had been more scenarios and stories about CantyThis book is recommended for all ages yet I found parts of it hard and difficult to understand. The language that all the people in the book speak is old English. There are chapters in the book that is just conversation. I found this incredibly hard to understand by reading it through just once. The only reason that I understood the conversations is because I am familiar with the old English writing style (Shakespearean style) and have had past experience reading books in this style. To someone who would read this type of book for the first time, I think that they would hardly understand any of the conversations between people. Yet the author Mark Twain wrote this book in a great way. This is why it appealed to lots of audiences. For example, Mark Twain's description of the palace are not like usual boring ones, his descriptions are fun to read and you can almost exactly picture things that he is describing. Also his wording makes it easy to keep reading and reading as if each sentence flows perfectly to the next.The book also had many strengths, in contrast to what I thought would happen, this book did not become predictable. Every chapter has a new twist or turn. The story was also very humorous. It was very amusing and hilarious what Canty did in the prince's position. For example at his first dinner he begins drinking the rose water, which is intended for washing his hands. He also says that all the ways of royalty are strange and annoying referring to when the official \\"food taster\\", tastes his food before he eats it and the long, grueling task of putting on clothes which involves a long chain of people who pass an article of clothing down one by one.I would recommend this book mainly to people in high school or older. In my opinion it is too childish for an adult reader, and I think many adults would get bored. The adults that would enjoy this I think would be those who are \\"young at heart\\", and enjoy fictional fairytale like stories. The humor, marvel, and intrigue that this book contains is for a younger audience. Also the difficulty of the language in the book is too hard for children to understand (below 7th grade). I believe that if this book were to be rewritten in modern English it would be a perfect story for a child at any age."},{"Title":"The Prince and the Pauper (Mark Twain Library)","review":"The Prince and The Pauper by Mark TwainA palace.

Since they are the same age and have the same features, this should be easy...not! Edward sees what he has to do to be a beggar. Tom finds out that being a prince is no joke. Mark Twain's colorful language tells you a lot about how the families feel when the boys are born. For example, on page 7. \\"Tom Canty was born to a family who wore raggedy clothes and lived in a one room house. To them the newborn was just another unwelcome mouth to feed.\\" When Edward was born, as you can imagine, there was a huge celebration! See the difference? There's a huge one!When the book ended, I thought of it as a river because I wanted to book to never end like a river keeps flowing. The characters are so real that it feels like you are in the book holding on to their hand. When they have a problem you want to help them and you start to care about them. The character's problems are not childish, but they are not like problems we have. In the book they are a bit more unique. The illustrations fit wonderfully with the book because it helps you understand the book better. Under the illustration it has a sentence about what the picture is about. It usually is the most important sentence on the page. The incredible details create powerful mind pictures.

Movies like Garfield 2, Face-Off, Big Business and Double Dragon have been based on this trick. Where did it all start? Probably with this children's classic by Mark Twain. Set in Renaissance England, it tells the story of two boys who look exactly alike, except one is a prince and the other is a poor boy. The two meet each other, exchange places, and have loads of fun. All ends well as they each regain their proper places with more wisdom and friends than before.The text of the book is readable by most elementary school kids, though the length is quite long for a children's work.

Then, each of the two boys have to live through a terrible life of each other. The Prince is beaten, called names, starved, and has to live the life of a beggar. Tom or the Pauper has to go through laws, diplomacy, languages, and royalty. Both of them are considered mad as they try to tell the truth to everyone.

They obviously go through many trials and ordeals - the pauper trying to learn the ways of royalty, and the prince having to witness and undergo the results of some of the ridiculous laws and practices of the period.Like many of Mark Twain's books, this is another satire that makes fun of the values that society holds to be important. In this story, Mark Twain points out how people place so much importance on outer appearance. A prince and a pauper, who, despite their outer resemblance are very different people, switch places, without anyone noticing. There is more to a person than their looks, and this is one point stressed throughout the novel.The one complaint I have about this book is that there wasn't enough written about Tom Canty, the pauper who became a prince. I found his situations much more interesting than those of the true prince, but this was only a minor point.I would recommend this book for ages 12 and older. Younger people could read the story, but miss the underlying meanings in certain situations.

These three extraordinary people were Boris Pasternak, Marina Tsvetayeva and Ranier Maria Rilke. Rilke, who is revered as a god by both Pasternak and Tsvetayeva, is seen by them as the very essence of poetry, itself.None of these three correspondents is having a good year: Pasternak is still living in Moscow, attempting to reconcile his life to the Bolshevik regime; Tsvetayeva has been exiled to France with her husband and children and is living in the direst financial straits, with each day presenting a new hurdle in the struggle to simply \\"get by;\\" Rilke's situation is perhaps the worst of all...he is dying of leukemia in Switzerland.Pasternak and Tsvetayeva have already exchanged years of letters filled with the passion and romance of poetry, itself. Although Pasternak saw Rilke briefly in 1900, Tsvetayeva has never laid eyes on her idol. These three poets are, however, connected by a bond far stronger than the physical. They are kindred spirits, and each find repetitions and echoes of himself in the other.Tsvetayeva quickly becomes the driving force of this trio. This is not surprising given her character. She's the most outrageous of the three, the boldest, the neediest, the one most likely to bare her inner soul to its very depths. Tsvetayeva's exuberance, however, eventually has disatrous effects.Although Pasternak and Tsvetayeva consider Rilke their superior by far, these are not the letters of acolyte to mentor, but an exchange of thoughts and ideas among equals. If you've ever read the sappy, sentimental \\"Letters to a Young Poet,\\" you'll find a very different Rilke in this book. Gone is the grandiose, condescending Rilke. In his place we find an enthusiastic Rilke, one filled with an almost overwhelming \\"joie de vivre,\\" despite his sad circumstances.As Susan Sontag says in her preface, these letters are definitely love letters of the highest order. The poets seek to possess and consume one another as only lovers can. But even these lovers haven't suspected that one of their trio is fatally ill. Pasternak and Tsvetayeva are both shocked and devastated when Rilke dies.Love, many people will argue, is best expressed when the people involved are able to spend time together. There is, however, something to be said for separateness, for there is much that can only come to the surface when the lover is separated from the beloved.These letters can teach us much about Rilke, Pasternak and Tsvetayeva. They can also teach us much about the very depths of the soul...both its anguish and those sublime, angelic heights...areas not often explored by anyone, anywhere, at any time."},{"Title":"Letters: Summer 1926 (Helen & Kurt Wolff Book)","review":"This book, the March/Sept. 2001 edition, is for me like a hot springs swimming pool for the tired body, what spring is to the birds, what rain is for parched meadows: a sensory experience that brings well-being to the sore human soul. The jacket cover comments by John Bayley and Mark Rudman give an accurate idea of what the correspondence was between these three writers 80 summers ago: yes, the letters among them are literature, and yes, reading them might make us weep for a vanished golden age of culture. But this collection of letters and poetry is for us today, addresses our global conflicts now; Rilke and Tsvetayeva knew that they were writing for the future; Pasternak knew that, too, but in these letters Boris comes across as more firmly rooted in the present moment (perhaps because he's best known as the author of a novel, Dr. Zhivago, immortalized by a David Lean film in the mid-1960s).I know nothing of the Russian and German languages and cannot judge the translation as a \\"correct\\" one, but the reader who benefits from this book is one who wonders what people felt and how they lived during a time when the Soviet government was ratcheting up the tension that led to the period of the commissars and Stalin. When I began reading this book, I knew little about Rilke and Pasternak, and had never heard of Marina Tsvetayeva. But these writers--as human beings--were no different than anyone else in that they were subjected to the same pressures as anyone living in poverty and fear. Rilke, Pasternak, and Tsvetayeva reacted to their circumstances with beautiful words. They have proven to me--beyond a doubt--that even under the worst governmental regimes, the intelligence we give to our emotions and the joy we have in verbal expression will triumph. Today, we merely die of complacency.Ultimately, this edition is Marina Tsvetayeva's book: her genius is evident in every phrase of her two essays inspired by the death of Rainer Maria Rilke--80 years ago, December 29, 1926--essays of lyrical prose-poetry translated beautifully by Jamey Gambrell, and appended to the end of the correspondence. The reader cannot simply turn to the back of the book and read Tsvetayeva's essay \\"Your Death\\"; one must read everything that comes before.

The book is an update of the original _Who Made All Our Streetcars Go_, including new material on Baltimore's current light rail system. The book also includes a series of vignettes about streetcars, which bring life to the history portion. In addition, there are hundreds of photographs, illustrations and maps.&lt;P&gt;This book reads more like a story than a history book, and I enjoyed it very much because of the accessible writing style, the subject matter and the photographs. Anyone interested in streetcars or old-time Baltimore should find this book fascinating."},{"Title":"Robert Maxwell, Israel's Superspy: The Life and Murder of a Media Mogul","review":"This book is an entertaining work of fiction, but expecting to know more about Robert Maxwell after reading it is tantamount to expecting to be an expert on World War II after watching \\"Inglourious Basterds.\\"Dillon and Thomas, the authors, spend (or waste, depending on your viewpoint) a lot of time tracing tenuous (and spurious) connections between people who may, or may not, have had access to that person, who may, or may not, have once had a meeting with someone who may, or may not, have an axe to grind with Robert Maxwell. Or knew him. Or met him once. Or may have seen him on TV once. Or may know nothing at all. They gleefully cite, time after time, Seymour Hersh's \\"The Samson Option\\" (thus sparing themselves the unpleasant necessity of, you know, doing, like, actual research)--apparently blissfully unaware that \\"The Samson Option\\" was almost wholly discredited years before this book came out.The book's only value is in showing just how big a bogeyman Israel's Mossad has become to conspiracy nutjobs (or cynical entrepreneurs who know what'll sell) like Dillon and Thomas whose understanding of international politics and espionage seems to have come entirely from Ian Fleming. The Mossad (which--SPOILERS!!!---according to the authors, offed Big Bobby Maxwell after he put the screws to Israel to cover his debts) has become, in the minds of people like the authors, a vast and omnipotent shadow conspiracy capable of, oh, all KINDS of shenanigans and responsible for more than YOU'LL ever know, that's for sure. You can almost hear the authors' voices dropping and saying ominously, \\"The world will probably never know the true story.\\"And the whole thing is written in a sort of breathless, hush-hush, anonymous-sources \\"I can't tell you who REALLY said it, but I know it's true\\" style that I remember all too well from accounts of nefarious goings-on in the girls' locker room from junior high.Ludicrous. And, by the way, utterly unsubstantiated.Robert Maxwell was one of the biggest crooks of the 20th century. No question about it. Crooked as a dog's hind leg. And more than a little reminiscent of a James Bond bad guy. And, as a globetrotting con man with lots of fingers in lots of pies who was willing to do damn near anything to make a buck, certainly had more than his share of friends in high places, low places, and shady acquaintances in a lot of countries. But it strains credulity to imagine that he did all that he did on behalf of Israel just to turn around and try to blackmail them. Let's face it, the guy did what he did to make money for himself.The danger of a steaming chunk of egregious garbage like this one is that, by making someone like Maxwell into a fictional character, it obscures what we can--and should--learn from cases like this one. If you're genuinely interested in Robert Maxwell, and in learning about the conditions that made it possible for him to do what he did, I recommend Tom Bower's excellent \\"Maxwell: The Outsider,\\" and the follow-up volume, \\"Maxwell: The Final Verdict.\\" Written by a genuine investigative journalist who actually does know what he's talking about, these books are scrupulously-researched, well-rooted in fact and in public-domain documentary evidence, and quote no mysterious (and probably fictional) anonymous sources. But more than merely accounts of Maxwell's life, they are also a scathing indictment of Britain's loophole-ridden financial laws, culture of secrecy, old-boy network, and willful blindness--the very conditions that allowed a conscience-less macher on the make like Maxwell to make off with more than a billion pounds sterling, which he promptly lost.Read Tom Bower for the real investigative journalism about Maxwell and Jeffrey Archer for good thriller fiction based on Maxwell. Avoid this book, which is neither."},{"Title":"Robert Maxwell, Israel's Superspy: The Life and Murder of a Media Mogul","review":"Robert Maxwell was surely one of the 20th century's most interesting rogues, and both his life and death contain many mysteries. But the single most shocking revelation in the Dillon/ Thomas (not to be confused with Dylan Thomas) book is that the authors have managed to be wholly uncredible as they tell their tale.The obvious, open source, information is frequently wrong and shows that the authors never visited most of the places they describe. A single example will suffice: They that Sandia National Laboratory is part of the &quot;Los Alamos complex&quot;. It isn't; they are separate and have been since the mid 1940s. Albuquerque, NM is said to be in a bowl ringed by mountains with cool air coming from Los Alamos; sorry. No. ABQ is not in a bowl and Los Alamos is 90 miles, as the road twists, away.Bill Casey and Bill Colby are cited as prime interviewees for the book, which sounds plausible until you realize that by the time the authors started work Messrs Casey and Colby were dead. A good interview trick if you can do it. Of course the authors never reference a &quot;fact&quot; to a specific source except to quote the ubiquitous Ari Ben-Menashe who shows up in almost every anti-Israel book on the market.There is an undertone and an overtone of real anti-semitism or at least anti-Israel feeling throughout the book, off putting of course. But it also undermines what little credibility the authors have left after you realize that nearly every page contains at least one obvious error of historical or geographic fact.Don't buy it. If I could have rated it zero stars, I would have."},{"Title":"Robert Maxwell, Israel's Superspy: The Life and Murder of a Media Mogul","review":"I doubt if I will ever read another book about Robert Maxwell. This book has more information than a lot of people, presuming the innocence of just about everything, would want to cope with. Among the people listed as interviewees in the front of this book are Efraim ---, six other former members of Mossad, William Casey, and William Colby. The death of William Casey was famously reported in VEIL by Bob Woodward, published in 1987, after Casey had a craniotomy and had been taken to Mayknoll to die. \\"He contracted pneumonia and was hospitalized on Long Island. There, the morning of May 6, the day after Congress began its public hearings on the Iran-contra affair, Casey died.\\" Woodward interpreted Casey's death as a kind of silence which fell in line with the question: What hurts, sir? \\"What you don't know,\\" he said. (Veil, pp. 506-507). This book, ROBERT MAXWELL, ISRAEL'S SUPERSPY/ THE LIFE AND MURDER OF A MEDIA MOGUL, (2002), was written in the spirit of William Casey's final interview. If the factual basis for some of its assertions seem a bit ghostly, you might blame all the Bills, or other outrageous bills, or the authors, Gordon Thomas and Martin Dillon, or anyone who seems to know more than any trap-door possessing Prosecutor's Management Information Systems software salesman with investments in newspapers, scientific journals, and an account in the Bank of Bulgaria could keep track of, at the age of sixty-eight, or after November, 1991, when Robert Maxwell, also, was dead.A society which employs Certified Public Accountants presupposes that people will be able to keep track of certain things, certainly money, for sure, and who people are, though this book finds a certain glory in how easy it is to fool official guardians of the identity assumptions with simple tricks. Obviously, this works best at places like Numec, a company specializing in reprocessing nuclear waste, in Apollo, Pennsylvania. Anybody ought to be able to figure out how likely it is that the following events, prior to December 1982, but reported as background information, might have actually occurred:His two companions were described on their cards as scientists from \`The Department of Electronics, University of Tel Aviv, Israel'.There was no such department.The men were LAKAM security officers whose task would be to see the best way of stealing fissionable waste from Numec. All three spent four days in Apollo, passing many hours touring the Numec plant, sitting for more hours in Shapiro's office. What they spoke about would remain a secret. On the fifth day Eitan and his companions left Apollo as unobstrusively as they had arrived.A month later the first of nine shipments of containers of nuclear waste left Numec. Each container would bear the words: \`Property of the State of Israel: Ministry of Agriculture'. The containers would carry a stencil stating they had full diplomatic clearance and so were exempt from customs checks before they were stowed on board El Al cargo freighters to Tel Aviv.The containers were destined for Dimona, Israel's nuclear facility in the Negev Desert. (pp. 55-56)One way to be a Mogul, buying companies close to bankruptcy and investing enough to turn them into successes, is described in this book as just the starting point for how \\"Robert Maxwell was the Barnum and Bailey of the financial world, the great stock market ringmaster able to introduce with consummate speed and a crack of his whip some new and even more startling financial act. But increasingly his high-wire actions had become more dangerous - and long ago he had abandoned any idea of a safety net.\\" (p. 34). Maxwell's arrangements with Vladimir Kryuchkov, head of the Soviet KGB, who had been involved in the August plot to oust Mikhail Gorbachev from office, made certain bankers insecure enough to want Maxwell to pay some of their loans. Maxwell thought 400 million pounds might be enough \\"to stave off his more pressing creditors. He asked Mossad to use its influence with Israel's banker's to arrange a loan. He was told to try to do what his fellow tycoon, Rupert Murdoch, had done when he had faced a similar situation. Murdoch had confessed his plight to his bankers and then renegotiated his debts, which were almost twice what Maxwell owed.\\" (pp. 13-14). Actually, Maxwell must have owed far more than he told the Mossad. A Daily Mirror headline in the photographs section, after the \\"Maxwell Dies at Sea\\" picture, reported, \\"Maxwell: 536m pounds is missing from his firms/ The increasingly desperate actions of a desperate man.\\"Assuming that much, the rest of the book is written around questions raised by Efraim.\`If the truth about Robert Maxwell surfaces and he is destroyed in the process, who else will be compromised? How great will the damage be to Israel?' (p. 15).Americans might be interested in this book for judging the current chances for success of American policies that seem to parallel the desperation of Robert Maxwell, but might cause Bill Casey even greater pain, if he were still in charge."},{"Title":"Robert Maxwell, Israel's Superspy: The Life and Murder of a Media Mogul","review":"What Carroll and Graf Publishers desperately need is 1. a fact checker and 2. a proof reader.

Beyond Muckraking this book is mostly fantasy and conjectured accusations that for the Maxwell hator or for the uninformed may well seem accurate but the truth is far more likely to have nothing to do with Maxwell being murdered by the Mossad.

This book is *fascinating* and explosive, not least because of the very well documented coverage it provides of how Israel's intelligence service, the Mossad, used Robert Maxwell to penetrate not just the U.S. government, including the Department of Justice, the military, and the national laboratories, but many foreign governments including the Chinese, Canadians, Australians, and many others, with substantial penetration of their intelligence service databases, all through his sale of a software called PROMIS that had a back door enabling the Mossad to access everything it touched (in simplistic terms).Also shocking, at least to me, was the extensive detail in this book about how the Israeli intelligence service is able to mobilize Jews everywhere as \\"sayanim,\\" volunteer helpers who carry out operational (that is to say, clandestine) support tasks to include spying on their government and business employers, stealing documents, operating safehouses, making pretext calls, and so on. I am a simple person: if you are a Jew and a US citizen, and you do this for the Israeli intelligence service, then you are a traitor, plain and simple. This practice is evidently world-wide, but especially strong in the US and the UK.The book draws heavily on just a couple of former Israeli intelligence specialists to address Israeli use of assassination as a normal technique (and implicitly raises the possibility that it was used against Senator John Tower, who died in small airplane crash and was the primary \\"agent\\" for Maxwell and Israel in getting PROMIS installed for millions of dollars in fees all over the US Government).Finally, the book has a great deal of detail about the interplay between governments, crime families, Goldman Sachs and other major investors, and independent operators like Robert Maxwell who play fast and loose with their employee pension funds.This book is not boring. Far from it. It is shocking, and if it is only half-right and half-accurate, that is more than enough to warrant its being read by every American, whatever their faith."},{"Title":"Robert Maxwell, Israel's Superspy: The Life and Murder of a Media Mogul","review":"Really quite a shocking story of a media giant, whose true passion was international geo-political manipulation and personal greed.

Maxwell's loyalties are to himself and to Israel; Senator John Tower is in his pocket; and so forth. The United States, apart from furnishing the likes of Tower, furnishes the intelligence stolen by Israel and the subsidies that keep that country in business stealing from its patron. Maxwell is a kind of super sayan (singular form of sayanim) and the book to some degree is an expose of the extent to which these volunteers-for-Israel around the world do damage to their host countries.The Maxwell-Mossad team steals spy software PROMIS from the United States, Mossad puts an undetectable trap door in it so Mossad can track the activities of anyone using it, then Maxwell sells it around the world (including back to the U.S. -- with the trap door). When Maxwell finally goes bankrupt, the losses are passed on to \\"the little people,\\" while Israel and Maxwell's protected heirs remain in the black, at least materially. Thomas/Dillon present, in thrilling mystery adventure mode, the theory that Maxwell became a loose canon to his beloved Israel, among other things hitting on Mossad for a bigger pay-off, and its agents assassinated him.The authors, both top-notch investigative journalists, base their study on official documents and on interviews -- what they uncover is bound to shock and put on the alert anyone who loves his country, respects honesty, good will and just about any other virtue within its borders."},{"Title":"Robert Maxwell, Israel's Superspy: The Life and Murder of a Media Mogul","review":"One of the best spy/Mossad books.you will not be able to put down this book once you start it."},{"Title":"Robert Maxwell, Israel's Superspy: The Life and Murder of a Media Mogul","review":"This book ties together many pieces of the Israeli puzzle from Post-World War II until the early nineties.

Serving as both personal and professional biography of Robert Maxwell, this book purports to expose a lot of national and international secrets related to organized crime, the global sex trade and drug trade, international finance, and the inner workings of many national governments, including the US, Israel, Russia, and the UK. All of these aspects of the world community touched upon, and were touched by the life and activities of Robert Maxwell. Born under a different name, he escaped Eastern Europe before the Nazis got him, went to the UK, became a military officer, and used his skills, accomplishments and self-boasting to claw his way to the top of the world media industry. Along the way he made money with and off many people, until it all caught up with him the year leading up to his death. And so we have a biography of one of the world's greatest white collar criminals, who traversed the halls of government capitols around the world. All told, a great book, and one I would normally give 5/5 stars. But seeing the strong and valid criticism of other reviewers, criticisms that I found compelling at times, I am going to give this book 4/5 stars."},{"Title":"Robert Maxwell, Israel's Superspy: The Life and Murder of a Media Mogul","review":"This is the story of the downfall of Robert Maxwell, a man who had almost everything that a simple mortal could dream with, a family, a billionary business, fame, important business and political contacts but with a huge megalomaniac complex that pushed him to play several dangerous games with the espionage of Israel, the industrial espionage and the underworld factions of the East mafias but his biggest mistake was when he try to play the blackmail game which put in jeopardy the security of the state of Israel and the Mossad agent around the world forcing then to \\"eliminate\\" this personage.Even though this is a wonderful work of investigation, I have some doubts about the sole responsability of Israel in this crime because of his several contacts within the Wall Street, the City of London moguls, the eastern mafias and the most important polititians of the world that he could put in danger with his downfall as a businessman or as a blackmailer, also it is very suspicious that many close collaborators died of sudden death or dissapeared."},{"Title":"Robert Maxwell, Israel's Superspy: The Life and Murder of a Media Mogul","review":"The book left out important information that reveals the author's biases. John Loftus, in \\"Secret War Against the Jews\\" (published BEFORE Thomas' book) noted that Maxwell had a cellmate in prison who was to become the future Foreign Minister of Czechoslavakia, who was instrumental in 1948 in supplying arms to the nascent state of Israel, that turned the battle in its favor. The Foreign Minister, Clementis, supplied Israel with everything he had, in defiance of Stalin. In 1952, Stalin hanged that government, including eleven Jews and Clementis. Clementis' support was garnered in part by Maxwell's exposure of a Communist coup that the government was able to monitor and deflect. Further, when that Czech government faced risk, there was absolutely no support from the United States or Great Britain forthcoming. Such detail is important because it was available to the author Thomas, but was ignored by author's choice. One can speculate in various ways about the rationale for that choice (including, possibly, bias, or sloppiness).Another troubling issue is the role of the MI6 in destroying Maxwell's credit with the banks and driving him into ruin. That charge has been made explicitly elsewhere, and is based on the idea that they discovered he was a double agent serving Mossad. It is supported by the one detail Thomas gives in favor, namely the refusal of any British lawyer to take on Lloyd's of London, which screwed Betty Maxwell of her life insurance policy (pressure?). However, Thomas does not explore this angle whatsoever beyond the one tantalizing detail, that again seems like a calculated omission.Thomas gives Maxwell responsibility for the creation and development of the Russian Mafia. Even though Maxwell may have been the potentate of Bulgaria, it seems excessive to place all that at his feet, even if he was involved with Mafia money laundering. Would the former KGB who formed the Russian Mafia not have been involved in illegal business had it not been for Maxwell? It takes a stretch. It certainly takes more than Thomas gave.The best part of the book was the little details which shocked. For example, Yuri Andropov, fmr KGB then USSR head, was born Jewish. Another example: John Tower accepted a retainer of 200k per year to give Maxwell access to any part of the US government (how could this Texan be so brazen in his corruption?). A third: Tower was the guy Lee Oswald wrote to from the USSR when he wanted to be repatriated, comprising \\"Tower's role\\" (supposedly) in the JFK plot.Summary-- good read, and food for thought, but beware of the British agenda behind it."},{"Title":"Robert Maxwell, Israel's Superspy: The Life and Murder of a Media Mogul","review":"Authors continue to use material from by ostrovky, an agent who worked for the mossad and then wrote an unking book about them, inorder to portray the mossad.

The thesis in and of itself is nothing new to students of the conflict: namely that British tanks were inferior to their German opponents in armor (Quality and thickness), firepower (main tank weapon, and fire control) and reliability. What is new is the perspective from a crewman and his contemporaries. The narrative is a sad story of official indifference and political infighting that cost unnecessary lives during the fighting in the ETO. Unfortunately, these insights are somewhat clouded by a confusing and contradictory work. For example, the 75mm medium-velocity gun on the Sherman series is rightly derided for its lack of penetrating power; however, later it is lauded for its overall usefulness (due to the effective HE round it fired) without reservations. The reader is left to wonder, &quot;did crews think the weapon was effective or didn't they&quot;? The text is unclear on this point and often repeats its assertions although they are reworded. This doesn't normally bother me in larger books, but in a work of only 200+ pages it shows some inattentive editing. The author's opinions of the British leadership in the armored branch at this time, that very few understood armored warfare, are impassioned and validated by other research and make interesting reading. If you are a serious student of WW2 armored warfare you will find some value here. A general interest reader may wish to wait for another edition."},{"Title":"Death by Design: The Fate of British Tank Crews in the Second World War","review":"Much has been made in the popular press and on the History Channel in the past decade about the purported inferiority of the American-built Sherman tank in the Second World War. In particular, Belton Y. Cooper's Death Traps (2003) made the claim that the weaknesses of the Sherman were due to bureaucratic idiocy that bordered on criminal negligence. Unfortunately, both Mr. Cooper and his supporters seem unaware of Peter Beale's Death by Design, published five years before Death Traps. Beale, who served as a British tank officer in the Second World War, delivers an impassioned case against those in his country who designed, built and led British tanks into battle. Death by Design is everything that Death Traps is not - written by someone who actually served on the tanks in question, well-researched and well-argued. Indeed, Death by Design largely succeeds in making its case that despite Britain's tremendous lead over Germany in tank technology in 1918, it squandered this lead in the interwar period and failed to produce a tank that was on a par with German designs until the closing days of the Second World War. Beale's book is also an excellent indictment about what happens when a military organization rejects feedback on its weapon systems, when weapons design is divorced from tactical doctrine and commanders are not properly trained to use the weapons available. Compared to the British experience with their tanks in 1939-44, the American problems with the Sherman in 1944 appear very minor and transitory.Up front, the author states that he believes \\"the development of British tanks before and during the Second World War was a disgrace.\\" He then goes about making his case in a fairly efficient manner. Death by Design is divided into eight chapters, with the first two discussing the atrophy of the British army in the interwar period and the missions that tanks are designed to fulfill, which was far from clear-cut in the 1930s. Like most Western countries, the British starved their army for resources during the interwar period and what funding was available went to the Royal Navy and the air force, not tanks. Pretty much the only tank development going on was at the firm of Vickers, and much of that with an eye to export. Even though the British army established an experimental mechanized force in 1926, doctrinal development was muddled during the interwar period and the result was requirements for light tanks, cruiser tanks and infantry tanks. British pre-war thinking about tank actions proved wildly incorrect. The third chapter, nearly one-quarter of the book, goes into great detail about the \\"sad tale of British tank development, 1919-45.\\" As the other concludes, \\"a large amount of effort was spent in projects that resulted in nothing useful; and of the tanks that were delivered to field units something like 75 percent were useless as battle tanks at the time they were delivered.\\" It was not until the Comet appeared in early 1945 that the British army received a decent tank with sufficient firepower, protection and mobility. In the next chapter, the author discusses the development of British tank guns, which seriously delayed the deployment of a good British tank. Although the 2-pounder was a good gun for 1939, the British were very slow to deploy new weapons such as the 6- and 17-pounder and even slower to get them fitted onto tanks. British tank designs were seriously hindered by small turrets that could not be upgraded to accept bigger guns, compared to the German Pz III and Pz IV medium tanks that were better configured for mid-war upgrades. Official resistance to arming British tanks with 6-pounders dithered until the 6-pounder was itself outclassed by bigger guns.The final chapters deal with the British tank-manufacturing industry, training and the issue of customer complaints. The author notes the arrival of the American-built Sherman virtually as a God-send to the hard-pressed 8th Army in Egypt and generally describes the Sherman in positive terms. Throughout the book, it is apparent that the author has really done his homework and backs up his claims with well-researched facts. At times he does use loaded language, such as calling British politicians such as Stanley Baldwin \\"murderers,\\" when \\"incompetent\\" would have sufficed. Yet, the reader will be left with little doubt by the end of this book that a fair case has been made and that a complete generation of British tanks has been found wanting. In addition to the well-crafted narrative, the photos throughout the book are excellent and help to support the author's case. Overall, an excellent book that should be in the library of anyone interested in Second World War tanks."},{"Title":"The Generous Man: How Helping Others is the Sexiest Thing You Can Do","review":"What a funny, brilliant book! The author is a genius and an optimist, and it is thrilling to gain insight into not just how the world works but how the world can be better.

It is the story of a young Quaker girl in Philadelphia in the 1800s. She hates her Quaker bonnet because it is black and plain, while her best friend, Cecelia (not Quaker), gets to wear pretty blue bonnets with flowers--the style of the day. Her mother scolds her for not taking better care of her bonnet and being proud of her Quaker religion. One day, while walking by the docks, Hannah is pulled aside by a black woman in hiding. She asks her to tell her family where she is and to get help. The woman says \\"I knew I could trust you by your Quaker bonnet.\\" Hannah returns home, they rescue the woman through the Underground Railroad, and she is proud to be a Quaker!

Part of the reason I was excited by the program is that I have used the natural language method before, in the French in Action series, and found it excellent.The Dos Mundos program is intended to be used in a classroom setting and I would not recommend it for home study. Unlike the French in Action series, it does not include extensive home video material that can take the place of an instructor. An instructor comfortable with the book and the natural language method is critical to success with this program.I find that the natural language method, presenting all of the material in the new language and explaining in the language, prevents early language errors caused by translation and gives immediate satisfaction of being able to speak more than rote phrases. Dos Mundos is the only complete natural language program currently available for Spanish."},{"Title":"Dos mundos (Student Edition)","review":"I agree with everyone else here.

Not only is the layout very confusing but the resources within it are definitely substandard. For a beginning Spanish text it's extremely hard to get into whatsoever. To understand half of the books &quot;instructions&quot; you'll need a seperate Spanish&lt;--&gt;English dictionary just to figure out whats going on. This book seems to be based on the assumption that you can guess everything from the confusing little pictures sprinled throughout the pages. The dictionary in the back is *not* up to the task and the sections on grammar are short, confusing, and nonintuitive. And whatever this &quot;natural approach, which this text requires in the classroom is, it's terrible. Grammar is almost totally ignored to the detriment of the student. In addition, a CD-ROM is NOT provided with the book as standard, you must buy it seperately which pushes the price up considerably. The accompanying workbook and audio tapes are also non-intuitive and confusing. If you must use this book for a class then you'll need plenty of supplemental materials NOT connected to this book."},{"Title":"Best of London (Lonely Planet Pocket Guide London)","review":"London can overwhelm, but this small book makes it manageable for first-time visitors as well as London junkies. There's an overview, sorting the commonly-visited tourist sites by type (sights, activities, kids' activities), as well as shopping, eating, and entertainment listings that provide enough information for a few days' visit. I even found a few gems listed that, in the course of many years visiting London, I had not known about--the Geffrye Museum is a good example. The maps are not as good as the A to Z or Benson's maps, but they work pretty well, and there's a handy Underground map in the front. A bus map of central London might have been helpful, though I'm not sure how they'd cram it in.

Unfortunately the poor review also contributed a rating of one star, which is averaged with the good review to yield an overall rating of 3 stars. The effect of this is to perhaps cause a modern shopper to purchase the older edition of this work edited by Willi Apel, instead of this more up-to-date volume.It seems that the negative reviewer is reacting to the presence in this dictionary of new entries such as &quot;Bluegrass Music&quot; or &quot;Rock 'n' Roll,&quot; as if the inclusion of such entries automatically removes other entries relative to 'classical polyphony'--evidently a topic close to his heart. Polyphony is covered in the Randell edition by it's own entry and through numerous other articles such as &quot;Counterpoint,&quot; &quot;Palestrina style,&quot; and others. Just as a modern dictionary of English must cover the language as it is really spoken, including slang and profanity, a modern music dictionary must also cover music as it really is. A good dictionary cannot assume the ascendency of one particular type of music or musical point of view, and ignore all other trends and developments. The expanded treatment of &quot;Blues,&quot; for example, is especially welcome. No service would be done for modern readers if common musical terms were ignored by the editors.Both editions of this dictionary are fine references. The Apel edition served the prior generation of readers very well. The new edition by Randell builds on the strengths of its forerunner and adds much new information.

It gives thorough descriptions of brain structure with vivid analogies that allow lay persons to easily visualize and relate to the brain. For example, it begins with the motif of sailing through the cerebral spinal fluid, a virtual journey used to explain the anatomy of the cerebral cortex. The book contains a detailed history of neuroscience from the time of Aristotle to the beginning of the 1980's. It tracks how technology drives our ever-changing picture of the brain. It acknowledges the benefit of war (and other injuries) to brain science. The theory of localization arose from studying the behavior of post war vets and the functions lost as a result of brain trauma. While localization explained a few behaviors, it cast the brain as a computer, hardwired and unchanging. The author realizes that partitioning of brain space is necessary for neuroscientists because the brain is too complicated to study all at once, yet points out that these partitions are often interrelated in different tasks. The reader will find multiple accurately labeled diagrams, and where possible, photographs or other imaging pictures to show the anatomy of the involved portion of the brain for certain tasks. The discussions refer to a large volume of case studies and biological studies, showing both sides of an issue fairly and allowing the reader to judge. Importantly, it lists some of the unanswered questions raised by research. The book is partitioned into sections on overall brain anatomy, vision and movement, rhythms and drives, stress and emotion, learning and memory, and madnesss. The Brain lays down the basics of the brain, including neuronal signaling events, neuronal growth, and development from fertilization to adulthood and builds on these concepts to piece together the human brain. Restak takes on each sensory input to the brain separately, beginning with vision.Vision and MovementRestak breaks vision into many manageable subsets and explains not only what occurs in each subset, but also how each piece works with the others to create a synergistic sensation. He downplays localizationism by including sections on sensory replacement. He begins this by relating the story of a blind professor that uses an array of vibrating pins set against his back to send visual information to his brain through a somatosensory pathway. This experiment and many others suggest that a given cortex of the brain associated with a certain \`sense' is capable of processing multiple types of sensory information. Tactile determination of the environment allows blind persons to construct a map of the world in their brain just as easily as one can tell the size difference between a quarter and a nickel. Because the book was published in the mid 1980's, it does not cover the progression of our picture of the brain.The author treats movement with as much care as vision. He takes a close-up look at how vision and movement work together to allow an uninterrupted view of the world. Because of the amount of information coming to the brain from the body about the world, the brain must decide which signals to acknowledge and which to ignore. This book poses convincing theories on how the brain does this. The importance of this synergistic decision making process involving multiple sensing modalities is shown in the medical cases explored in the work. Interventions and treatments for neuronal disorders are discussed, but lack any ethical argument. The author simply states that some people think it is unethical to change the brain artificially, but does not mention how intervention can be viewed as unethical.Rhythms and DrivesRestak explores cyclic nature of the functions and activities carried on in the brain and body. He invokes examples from natureto substantiate his claims. Further, experiments are presented that test how varying these cycles affect the body, particularly in jet lag. The effect of our modern industrialized and urbanize life style is discussed thoughtfully with physiologic data to support the claims. The book then pivots around the hypothalamus to discuss stress and emotion.Stress and EmotionMany urges such as violence and feelings are regulated in the brain. The author includes several scenarios concerned with showing how the hypothalamus is involved on a physiologic level. Stress and emotion have physiologic manifestations. Pain is treated deftly, and the book offers a clear conceptualization of the pain event.Learning and MemoryLearning methods are discussed alongside curious stories of people with highly functioning memories. Anatomical description of the nerves heading to the hippocampus and amygdale suggest they affect memory, but do not as accurately as current research. I would have liked to see how brain cells change when they learn.MadnessWhen the brain malfunctions or does not process information correctly, mental illness can result. The author discusses schizophrenia in exhausting detail, allowing the reader a glimpse into the life of a schizophrenic individual. Other disorders are glossed over.This book is a phenomenal tool to understanding the brain because it painstaking covers most brain functions. However many of the ideas proposed in this book have been amended or replaced. Innovations in real-time, minimally invasive imaging technologies since the book's publication have allowed closer looks at the ever-changing brain. The author leads readers away from localizationism and covertly steers them towards brain plasticity. The brain as a plastic, malleable organ explains many of the odd examples contained in this book, specifically sensory substitution. Another experiment covered in the book that hints at brain plasticity involves a girl who wore lenses to invert the light heading into the eye, making the world appear (visually) upside down. After some time her brain learned how to function normally with the inverted input. Readers interested in catching up on current thinking on the brain plasticity can do so by watching the subsequent PBS series: The Brain Fitness Program and reading The Brain that Changes Itself by Norman Doidge (Viking, 2007)."},{"Title":"The Brain","review":"A basic primer on the brain,and since this was published, we have grown expoentially in more discoveries about the brain and psychiatric disorders."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"This is an interesting little book.

Kay and the wart are somewhat good friends and live sometime during the 1300-1500's. One day the wart ventures into the woods nearby looking for his friends lost hawk and finds a friendly wizard named Merlyn. Meryln comes back to the manor and teaches the wart about magic and turns him into many different animals to talk to ohters. However, Kay isn't being taught with the wart and becomes jelous. The wart asks Merlyn to change both of them for at least one time, but he can't. So they go on their own adventure with Robin Wood rescuing several lost members of the group of forest bandits. in a castle the two boys find that the queen owning the castle is evil and captured their friends. They get caught in the castle by a giant but get saved by Merlyn. When the boys got to the manor Sir Ector, Kays father tells them that the King has died and the person to pull the sword excalibur from its anvil will be king. They journy to Central England and the two boys try to pull out the sword alone. The wart pulls out the sword when Kay isn't looking and Kay takes the credit. Sir Ector isn't convinced and has both boys try again, and the Wart pulls it out and becomes king.My opinionon on this book is that this a good book overall, I especially like the twists it made to the more commonly known legend and the characters in the book.

Wart calls Sir Ector father, but it is Sir Ector's real son, Kay, who is destined to be knighted and Wart his squire. The Magician Merlyn is the tutor of both Wart and Kay, but he puts most of his efforts on Wart.The Sword in the Stone is book 1 of a 4 book series, The Once and Future King, by T.H. White (Terence Hanbury White) about King Arthur. There actually is no direct refernce to this story being about King Arthur until the end except for a few name drops here and there which one wouldn't even suspect if they weren't familiar with King Arthur's tales. It was pretty obvious who would eventually get named King Arthur.This book was written in the 1930s like Lord of the Rings, but reads very differently. The Sword in the Stone is basically written for the younger fantasy readers. First off it's rather short and secondly there isn't the character development or plot developments that you expect to see in adult epic fantasies.Wart's education from Merlyn consists mostly of observing the world from different animals like owls, badgers, ants, etc. They all play a part in the end in helping the true sword owner pull the unnamed sword (at this point at least) out of the stone.Well I can't say this was one of my favourites, but I did buy the entire The Once and Future King series on my e-book and I am a sucker for mythology, so I'll definitely finish it. It's an easy enough read that I don't really need to force myself to read it. I'm sure a younger audience (the target audience of this book) who aren't as familiar with King Arthur would get more out of this book than adult readers."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"So much fun.

Wart grew up in the castle of Sir Ector, with Sir Ector himself, and his son Kay. Wart is taught by the famous wizard known as Merlyn, how to be a man. Merlyn sends Wart on many magnificent and magical adventures, transforming him from one creature to the next and sending him on spectacular journeys and quests all through the land.The Sword in the Stone was a book that was easy to pick up and get right into, but also easy to put down and feel like you could almost fall asleep if you read one more page. It would change from interesting to dull consistently throughout the book. There were parts that were very detailed, and exciting, but other parts that were very boring, and hard to understand.The detail was so incredible that as you read you feel as though you are right there with the characters. The details help you to imagine things like Merlyn's blue and gold-starred robe to the exact movement of the sneaky snake as he approaches Wart. The exciting parts of the book tell fantastic fantasy stories that let your imagination run wild. The &quot;Wizard Duel&quot; between Madame Mim and Merlyn goes on for page after page as the two struggle to defeat one another. They use their enchantedpowers and fight for hours on end, until Merlyn thinks of a despising plan, and takes care of Madame Mim once and for all.There are parts in the book that start to get boring and can lose your attention quickly, but as soon as you are about to put the book down,Merlyn has once again performed his magic, and Wart is experiencing yet another splendid adventure. There was a part where Wart and Robin Hood travel with their army to fight against the Anthropophagi (a wild variety of ferocious beasts). They walk throught the woods for days before reaching their destination. This really bores an interested reader. There were many sections of the books that seemed confusing to me. I didn't understand the part where Merlyn transforms Wart into a bird and Wart flys down to the barn to talk with the other birds and hawks.

It had a plot line that was uneventful and I lost interest constantly. The book had a good idea behind it but the final result was rushed and in need of detail. The book started out nice and slow describing life in the middle ages but as the middle to the end comes along, the best parts seem to leave as fast as they come. Wart, the main character, was seemed to be too childish for his age and his upbringing. He is constantly making choices that cause the book to loose its charm and originality. Merlin has a certain appeal to him and does not and is not getting the attention and time he disserves. Through out the plot line there was description (a little bit here a little bit there) and they were very good. But you can't make a good book on a couple of good parts. The middle ages theme was great and I thought it gave it some spunk, The author tells mindlessly of every thing of a young boys life in the middle ages. During the book there was some parts that were not rushed -and almost dragged out- but otherwise were not in enough detail for you to get the picture and understand it fully. In conclusion I think that The Sword in the Stone had the right though but was too rushed to its point across."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The Childhood of a Legendary KingThe tale of King Arthur's youth is an enthralling one.

He changes into four animals and he turns invisible by Merlin, Warts tutor. The adventures he goes on are amazing. He goes to a giants castle and goes to Morgan le Fay's castle to rescue Friar Tuck. Coming out they had to fight big bird-lion things. The book had no real conflicts.I don't really like reading, but this book is interesting. If you like fantasies then you would like this book.

I had to read it for school and I'm going into 10th grade which doesn't make any sense to me. The plot seemed to be directed at 4th graders but no 4th grader would understand the language. I might have given T.H. White a little more credit had this been entirely his creation, but he didn't make up the story; it's an Arthurian Legend (obviously). He even stole some lines from Shakespeare! All he did was write it, and the writing was unbearable. Unless you enjoy mind-numbing boredom, don't waste your time on the Sword in the Stone."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"i thought this was the most boring uninteresting book i was ever fourced to read in enlish class, if it were up to me it wouldnt even get one star!!!!!!! If you are lucky enugh to have to option of not reading this book, u should take advantage of it"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"\\"Sword in the Stone\\" is the must-read book of Arthuriana, an imaginative fantasy romp that has inspired all our ideas about the venerable Merlin and about King Arthur's boyhood. White infuses the book with whimsy, poignancy, and a mixture of early 20th-century England and medieval times.Sir Ector's ward Arthur (known as \\"Wart\\") has no idea what he's in for when he accompanies Ector's son Kay out on a hunt. When a bad-tempered hawk escapes and refuses to come out of a tree, Wart ends up staying behind all night in the hopes of recapturing it. But he's interrupted by an odd old man called Merlin and his talking owl Archimedes. Merlin captures the hawk -- and then comes home with Wart. Soon he is firmly established as tutor to the two boys.But they soon discover that nobody is quite like Merlin, and the lessons he has to teach Wart are more than just math and Latin. Merlin transforms Arthur into a fish, an owl, a hawk, and sends him on bizarre journeys with Robin Wood (Wood, not Hood -- a common mistake) and his band of Merry Men, a duel with an evil witch, a gathering of trees, a fumbling King and the Questing Beast, and capture in a sinister giant's castle.T.H. White was a wonderful author, and an even better comic author. His characters are fully fleshed and endearing (even the nasty ones), but at the same time there is a delightful lightness to them. There isn't a speck of realism in the entire book -- chronology is bent and spindled, magic and realism are twisted together, and readers won't care at all. In a sense, \\"Sword\\" seems almost to exist in a parallel universe where animals talk, Robin Hood chit-chats with the once and future king, and carnivorous humanoids roam through Britain.\\"Wart\\" is a good hero -- quiet, unassuming, thoughtful, and occasionally puts his foot in his mouth. His foster brother Kay is also good -- Kay is hot-tempered and a little loud-mouthed, but he is a nice person at heart. Merlin is the perfect crabby gray wizard, eccentric and unashamed to use his magic in a perfectly casual manner, and constantly a little befuddled due to his ability to live backwards in time. He'll endear himself to readers from the first page onward. There are dozens of equally funny characters: The always-questing King Pellinore and his Beast, the worried Sir Ector, the walking mustard-pot, the crabby but kindly owl Archimedes, and many, many more.White's writing goes at a slightly uneven clip: Sometimes it zips along quickly, at other times it crawls. He displays plenty of knowledge about medieval times, and seems a little too eager to reveal it to the readers. But his descriptions and dialogue are delightful, a mix of the modern and the medieval. There are some extremely frightening scenes, and some (such as the having to put down a fatally-injured dog) that will make you cry.Readers will come out of this book feeling like they have made a number of memorable, kindly friends. It's a must-read for anyone who loves the legends of Arthur."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"Finding a COMPLETE version of this book is difficult. When the Sword and the Stone was grafted onto the rest of the series to form the Once and Future King, T.H. White removed several scenes from the book. Growing up enjoying the Walt Disney version of the film, I was disappointed when I read the Once and Future King. Where was the wizard's duel between Merlyn and Madam Mim? Surely, Disney didn't come up with that on their own.Well, the truth is these lost parts are still out there if you wish to find them. Some of the lost episodes include: Kay and Wart taken captive by Madam Mim, a wizard's duel between Merlyn and Mim, Wart and Kay battle a giant who has taken King Pellinore captive, Wart becomes a snake, and Archimedes takes the Wart in bird form to meet his mother Athene and hear a song from the trees. The version I found that still contained these passages was published in 1963 and features Disney illustrations on the cover. I do not know if other versions include these chapters, but the Once and Future King does not.Some speculate that White thought these episodes to be too childish and light-hearted, but I think they are wonderful. The Sword in the Stone is a very difficult book for children. I believe it needs these light-hearted moments to offset the preachy life lessons. Don't get me wrong, I think the lessons that can be learned from the book are innumerable, but everyone needs a little fun with their learning.If you are looking to read the Sword in the Stone, I encourage you to seek out the oldest version with the chapters still in tact. They're worth it."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The Sword in the Stone is a truly wonderful book. It is the classic story of young King Arthur, but told in greater depth and detail, and filled with wonderful, humorous characters. The tale so many times retold suddenly becomes fresh and original, as T.H. White's stunning narrative sweeps the reader into the world of Midieval England, and makes the old story come alive in a new and delightful way. Never before has anyone been able to make the old characters of Arthur and Merlyn, Sir Ector and King Pellinore come alive in such a real and fantastic way. The story is brought to life, and is better by far then the traditional telling of the tale. White does not only tell the simple story of the sword in the stone- here he tells the story of the boy who pulled it out. He goes back and tells us about the growing up of this boy, that we might better understand why it was he that was meant for this destiny, and what it was that shaped him for this task. And throughout the entire story, the book sparkles with humour, wit and charm, which is all the better because it is told in Old English. There are too many books these days written in modern language, using slang and twentieth century dialect, so the Sword in the Stone is a delightful change of pace. And while the Old English sounds perfectly authentic, it is not overly used, and is never difficult to understand. My nine year old sister understood it perfectly, when I read it to her. All in all, this story is the best retelling of any Arthurian legend that I have ever read. I would encourage anyone who has an interest in King Arthur to read this book."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The Once and Future King, which is built upon and uses text from the Sword in the Stone, is one of my favorite books. Much like the Hobbit is a sometimes silly preamble to the Lord of the Rings, The Sword in the Stone is the less serious story of King Arthur as a boy that sets the stage for the novel, The Once and Future King. And like the Hobbit, while it can be occassionally silly- a deadly serious and powerful story is just below the surface.White was clearly impacted by the struggle to hold views of evolution and a God-centered world view, and was also clearly impacted by the tensions of war torn Europe. He weaves some fun stories of Robin Hood, life in a hawk mew, and light-hearted jousting in with all his explaining and metaphorizing, though. I can't imagine not liking the vivid imagery and exotic story-telling, and if you are a fan of any of the other initialed British writers you'll certainly feel at home with T.H. White. Read the Sword in the Stone- it won't take much time, but then by all means read The Once and Future King one day for the real masterpiece."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"This is the book I read as a child and loved, then read again as a man and loved more. It is part of how I see the King Arthur legend. I will never part with my copy, and I will read it to my son when I have one."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"A boy named the Arthur, called Wart, livng during the Middle Ages, is taught by a magician about the past, present, and future, and about all creatures living on the Earth. When the opportunity arises for the Wart to become King, he must recall everything he has learned to pull the magic sword from the stone and become the new leader of England. I enjoyed this book because it had so many exciting battles and page turning adventures. Even a small bit about Robin Hood! The plot really doesn't appear until the last few chapters, where you realized that every story within the book was connected all along. It is nice to know that there are fun and interesting books to read about the Medeival times. I think that if you are looking for a book with lots of adventure, this is truely one that you should read."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The Sword in the Stone is set in the Middle Ages, in a time of knights and magicians. Actual historical details are presented in the context of a fictional story. It is about the upbringing of young King Arthur. With the help of his tutor, Merlyn, Arthur experiences adventures, which help him to see life from different points of view. These other perspectives of the world will help him when he becomes king. Merlyn is training Arthur with quests, and a little magic. The quests Arthur accomplishes help him to be a more understanding person. Merlyn subjects Arthur to many different situations, some of which include; being turned into animals, meeting new people, and seeing different people living different lives. A key revelation about the magic of Merlyn occurs the first time that Arthur is introduced to his future tutor. While eating a meal, a mustard-pot gets up and walks to Arthur's plate, adds some mustard, and returns to its place. Later, Merlyn explains the order in which he lives his life, which is different from most people. As most people live time forwards, Merlyn lives it backwards. The significance of this is that it open's Arthur's eyes to a completely different way of looking at life. This is an example of one of the many perspectives Arthur will gain from Merlyn's influence. This slightly whimsical way to introduce lessons for Arthur's life is part of what makes this story so popular. Merlyn explains his perception of time in one sentence, stating, &quot;If you know what's going to happen to people, and not what has happened to them, it makes it so difficult to prevent it happening, if you don't want to have it happen,&quot; (39). This quote is essentially the reason Merlyn is tutoring Arthur. Merlyn's goal is to prepare Arthur for what is going to happen in the future. This gift of Merlyn's came in handy later in the story when Kay, Arthur's brother, and Arthur leave without telling their father. Sir Ector searches for them until he thinks of consulting Merlyn. &quot;The magician for the sake of peace and quietness to go with his nap in, had used his insight to tell Sir Ector exactly what the boys were doing, where they were, and when they might be expected to come back. He had prophesied their return to a minute,&quot; (162). Part of what makes this book so fun is the fantasy that someone can be looking out for us and protecting us while we are impetuous youngsters.While this was an entertaining and educational story, there were many unnecessary details. These frivolous details made for long stretches between the action sequences. I would recommend this book to those readers who prefer careful attention paid to details. For me, the stage setting tended to drag the story down a little. I would have enjoyed a little more action and frivolous and magical events. I like the way the character of the Wart was developed. I was able to notice his leadership ability and maturity level early on, and follow them as they progressed through the story. If knights in shining armor, castles, and mysticism fascinate you, this is the book for you. The Sword in the Stone is the most well known re-creation of Medieval England for young adults. It is a classic story that has been enjoyed by many generations and no doubt will be enjoyed by many, many more."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"\\"The Once and Future King\\" is a delightful series of stories, but this is by far the superior, and first off the rank. It is the story of Wart, a hapless orphan boy, and his adventures once his new tutor Merlin arrives on the scene (some of you may be aware of the Walt Disney animated movie of the same name).This is real adventure stuff and is appealing to both young readers and grown ups alike. Wat and his friends have all manner of exciting escapades as birds, as fish, and as combatants with witches, and in the background there is all the fanciful goings on of a very disorganised medieval castle.There are many novels which deal with the Arthurian legend, some well, most tastefully, and some take themselves entirely too seriously. This is just plain good fun and well written too. Enjoy yourself!"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"&quot;The sword in the stone&quot;I would definitely recommend T.H. White's &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; to anyone faintly interested in The Dark Ages or The Arthurian legends, althought I think someone between the ages 12-25 would appreciate the book more. I say this because I don't think a young child or an adult would enjoy reading, or care for T.H. White's ideas on the simple subjects about some of the parts of everyday life that aren't usually thought about out loud. Some other people I know who are reading &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; think it is boring, but I think you just need to be in a reading mood to comprehend what you've read so you may enjoy this exquisite book.This is the first time I have absorbed any of the Arthurian legends. In my history classes studying The Dark Ages we never really spent any time on the legends or similiar thoughts about that time, because we were pressed for time. So, now, since I liked T.H. White's &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; very much, I have a good impression on all the legends about this mysterious era.Don't be fooled if you have seen the Disney movie &quot;The Sword in the Stone.&quot; It has the same general plot, but the book is mucher better (like most movies that come from a novel). The book is not just directed toawrds the taste of children, and there is much more of the story that the movie didn't present to it's audience.&quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; is a particular tale about King Arthur of England as a young boy. He is not the king in this story, though. Young Arthur has the nickname Wart(not as a mean gesture, but because it rhymes with Art, which is short for Arthur). This legend tells about the Wart, with his wizard tutor, Merlyn, who turns the Wart into animals to teach him about life lessons. He learns a lot from the animals he converses with. He learns things about the history of the world, the theory of life and education, courage, and respect for all types of living creatures. I think that it is quite interesting what these animals tell him. The Wart also teams up with Robin Wood (probably kwown to you as Robin Hood) and his clan and has an adventure that helped make him valiant. This lessons will help him become a magnificent king.I have always enojoyed historical fiction by authors like John Steinbeck and James Mitchner. I consider this book more of a historical fiction than a legend. I say this because during the story, it tells many historical facts about The Dark Ages, an era that I am not too familiar with. What I mean by historical facts, are not dates or names of battles and wars, or anything along those lines, but of such things that were part of the everyday life back in those days. Such things like castle structures and purposes, archery and jousting techniques, and all sorts of similar parts of their life. Mr White's reseach about this time has paid off greatly. His novel seems very complete because of the wonderful correct details about all aspects involved in the Wart's life.I love how T.H. White tries to explain the simple things that just happen without any thought involved. He explains things like how a human would fly like a bird, swim like a fish, or slither like a snake. The Wart doesn't have the instinct to do any of these tasks, so Merlyn teaches him. Someone would think it would be easy to fly, because the birds make it look easy, but I bet it would be very hard and weird. To the animals the skill comes naturally, and without thought, but it wouldn't come easily at all to a human being.Mr. White also tells the reader his theories on how some things came to be. For example he tells why all embryos look alike with their feeble hands and heavy, large heads. It doesn't matter if they are going to become a tadpole, an elephant, a peacock, or a human; they all are identical. He says that God told the embryos (in the 5-6 day of creation) to choose their specialties, and when alive they all would transform into that thing. I enjoy seeing these types of theories, true or not, about all sorts of the little and big things in life.If any of the ideas I have put across seems of interest of you, I recommend &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; very much. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"In The Sword in the Stone by Terence Hanbury White, fantasy and adventure are woven together to create a picturesque and suspenseful story set in Medieval England. The Sword in the Stone recreates the life of young King Arthur as he is taught how to be a gentleman by Merlyn, the powerful but absent-minded magician who lives life backwards. Young Arthur, who is commonly know as the &quot;Wart,&quot; finds himself entwined in many adventures, such as being magically transformed into a fish, a hawk, and a badger. He also meets the likes of Robin Wood, Maid Marian, and Little John on a dangerous adventure he goes on with Kay, his brother. All of the adventures he experiences in the book are part of his training. Merlyn wants him to view life from all different perspectives so that he will be prepared to become the king of England.While Arthur's older brother Kay is preparing for knighthood, it is discovered that King Uther Pendragon, the ruler of England, has died. There is word that there is a sword stuck in a stone which bears an inscription saying that whoever pulls out the sword is the &quot;rightwise king born of all England.&quot; Arthur stumbles upon this, not knowing it is the sword, and manages to pull it out, using everything Merlyn taught him.Merlyn is the key to The Sword in the Stone. If you removed his character from the book, you wouldn't have a story anymore; just a vague picture of a boy named Arthur. Merlyn personifies both humor and wisdom. The fact that he lives life backwards instead of forwards- knowing what will happen next as opposed to knowing about the past- makes him all the more important in this novel. He already knows in advance what the future holds for Arthur, and his training of the boy is really to prepare him for ruling England.Although The Sword in the Stone centers around a young boy's coming-of-age and story elements normally considered juvenile, this novel would be more appreciated by a mature audience, due to the wordiness. Those interested in Arthurian legend will love this book's twists on tradition. The novel starts at a crawl and then suddenly picks up pace, hurling one adventure after another at the reader. This sudden change is difficult to adjust to at first, but slowly you see that it is all part of T.H. White's genius. Arthur's life progressed in this same way, beginning slowly and then picking up speed, as he became tangled in Merlyn's world of magic and whimsy.I found The Sword in the Stone to be quite an engaging book once I got past all the fancy vocabulary and focused on the story. I admire how T.H. White took a historical legend and incorporated so many humorous fables. He was obviously a well-educated man who had a deep passion for Arthurian legend. The novel held some personal meaning for me, since I can relate to Arthur's never-ending need for knowledge, intellect and maturity.Give T.H. White's The Sword in the Stone a try. If you cannot swallow a mixture of imagination, satire and realism all in once shot, you might not want to attempt it. If you do happen to enjoy it, though, I promise you will want to read it repeatedly over time."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"Pretty much everyone has seen the Disney cartoon, but T.H. White's The Sword in the Stone is a story that must be read. Nowhere in the movie do you get delicious bits like:\\"The cottage had a brass plate screwed on the garden gate. It said: Madame Mim, B.A. (Dom-Daniel) Pianoforte, Needlework, Necromancy.\\"Or how about the casual mention of Merlin in running shorts ... Merlin knitting his beard into the nightcap he's making ... Merlin's dishes washing themselves up, shouting, \\"Hey! Let's dunk the tea pot!\\"Or a falcon who's been mewed up too long and cannot keep from quoting all the bloody passages of Macbeth? (My personal favorite bit of deliciousness, since I have a similar character in my story.)Most people pick up the story of King Arthur from the day in the churchyard, when young Art pulls the sword from the stone and is hailed by all of Merry Old England as their sovereign lord. T.H. White, however, looks back to the innocent childhood of England's once and future king, the days when outlaws like Robin Wood (read: Hood) roamed the Forest Sauvage and knights spent their entire lives questing mysterious beasts.While certain passages did drag on and I felt like someone should remind White that young readers aren't interested in philosophy, and he harped about evolution more than once, this would make a wonderful read-aloud ... Ay say, the dialogue is absolutely lovely, what?"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"This is my first T.H. White book, and WOW I love it! The story was written in the 1930s, published in 1938. Around the time of CS Lewis and JRR Tolkein. I would say this book is unique and outstanding of the Narnia and The Lord of the Rings series. It is not comparable to any other books I've read. The Disney motion picture version of the book does not give away anything. I have the DVD and I find every detail of the plot is surprising. It is a great read for both children and the adults. I strongly recommanded it for readers of all age."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"I didn't really want to read this book at first, because it was for an English class of mine. When I started reading it I was pleasently suprised! I ended up enjoyng this book very much! I would recomend reading it to anyone looking for a humorous adventure story.My favorite character would have to to Merlin. Merlin is a good wizard. He plays a huge roll in this book. Merlin made this book funny and much more interesting. Why wouldn't T.H White put him in more of the story? My only complaint of this book would have to be Merlin not being even more invloved and humorous!This story has evry interesting character development also. Kay, Wart's best friend, future knight, and Sir Ecotr's son, is the character I enjoyed watching develop the most. Kay came across to me as a snob at the start of the book. Later in the book he shows his true colors when he crys to Wart. At the end I didn't like him again when he lied about pulling the sword from the stone, but then when he confessed that it truely was Wart I liked him again.I really enjolyed this book. It turned an unwanted English project into something I can look back and love. I would definately recomend this book.

White. He said it was a classic piece of fantasy and that I needed to read it. Obviously, I had heard the title before, but aside from that, I knew basically nothing about the book. I was hoping to read something great - and in White's defense, maybe the book is great, but it's not at all what I was expecting and because of that I was sorely disappointed. T.H. White's \\"The Sword in the Stone\\" is a children's book. Despite that, it's a tough read both because it takes place in a medieval time period, and because the book itself was written (I'm assuming based on its first copyright date) back in 1939. For my tastes, the book is slow, uninteresting, and a chore to read. I suspect that this exact telling of the story is the basis for Disney's children's movie by the same title.If you're looking for a child's story and don't mind the antiquated language, then you may enjoy the book. If you're a fan of current fantasy and are looking for something to read, I don't know that I could recommend the book."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"T. H. White wrote The Sword in the Stone. He was one of President Kennedy's best and brightest. The Sword in the Stone is a fantasy novel, intended for adults, mostly due to the difficult working. It's purpose is to tell a story and to entertain. The title is self explanatory for anyone who has heard Arthurian legends before, but if not, it becomes obvious towards the end of the book.The Sword in the Stone tells the story of a young boy called the Wart who's adventures with the wizard Merlyn helped prepare him for his last adventure as the Wart and his first as Arthur. Wart is raised on a manor with his adopted father Sir Ector and stepbrother Kay. Kay gains an increasingly important role in the end. He and Wart slowly grow apart to the extent that he serves as one of the few antagonists. The language used in the book is one of the few challenges that I had with the book. I had a hard time with the way the book switched back and forth from Modern English to Old English. One of the main arguments in the book is \\"Might versus Right, or Strength vs. Justice.\\"I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historic fiction or fantasy. Despite the confusing grammar, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. The author did a great job of creating three dimensional characters and a complex but not confusing plot.

It is filled with magic and strange creatures a plenty. It is not just fun for children, but the whole family! I enjoyed this book because of all the interesting animals and giants Merlin and young Arthur meet."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"Mr. White created a world that took some time to get used to. Having not read a children's classic in awhile, I had to get used to the vernacular all over again. Once I was able to follow it, the stories unfolded and I couldn't get enough. Mr. White truly knows how to get you to step into another world with ease. He takes all different kinds of characters and historical people to make this story work. I was truly pleased.The Young Wart, Arthur, was shy at first. He knew what his station in life would always be due to the fact that he didn't know who his parents were. Sir Ector was kind enough to take him under his wing. Yet there were certain things Wart knew he'd never do. Or so he thought. Merlyn was a fantastic character! I loved seeing a new take on Merlyn. The other characters of King Pelinore, Sir Ector, Madam Mim and others brought the cast to a completion. The range of their personalities were fun to watch unfold.The adventures were so much more fun than the Disney movie. I was truly impressed with how much was followed yet the things that were left out were my favorites. The beginning dragged for me but by the end, I was sad to see it end. This was a fun romp in period fiction and I am curious to see what else was written by this author. I wouldn't read this to anyone under the age of 10 only since there is some coarse language used. There were times I was surprised I didn't burst out into song with all the bits of songs that were part of the story!"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The Sword in the Stone is about a young boy called the Wart and all the interesting things he learns. His tutor, a magician named Merlyn, changes the Wart into many different animals. While he is an animal he learns there are many ways to look at life. He realizes life beyond castle walls is different and harder than most would think. The Wart becomes a well-educated young man who is very gentle but not afraid to stand up for what he believes. The book was very enjoyable because it always kept me guessing and had a good plot. The book kept me interested becasue the chapters never started slow and climaxed toward the end; for the most part the entire chapter was fun to read. I wanted to keep reading because the plot was never dull. In one chapter the Wart is on an adventure with Robin Wood; then in the next chapter he is watching an exciting jousting match. If you like a strong plot and exciting chapters, you will really enjoy this book."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The book &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; by: T.H White, is about a young boy named wart along with many friends going on long journeys during the Middle Ages, through out royal land and castles, getting lost in the woods, and meeting strange mystical people along with meeting Merlin the magical magician. I really liked the book &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; because I found it very exiting and extremely interesting because once you get into it, it's very hard to put the book down. It's a book for all people because it has action, science/fiction, and comedy. Even though it is a short 288 page book, there is still a lot of action and there is definitely a lot of Medieval people, events, etc. The best part of reading &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; is that there is a lot of things to learn about and there is a lot of interesting parts in the book. If you really like a book with character and exiting action, comedy, and interesting facts, you should read &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot;. I really think that the author &quot;T.H White&quot; did a very well job with keeping myself and everybody interested in the book and making it an extremely lovable book. In conclusion, I think &quot;The Sword in the Stone&quot; is one of the best Middle Ages books to read, it's an educational book, and especially, I think that more people should read it and get other books written by T.H White, because he writes the best medieval books."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"There are parts in the book that start to bore you at times. T.H. White puts anachronisms to make it more interesting. The book was not very thrilling. The book can seem like it is never ending. But I'd say that this book is plain boring. It does have some adventure. I did not like it. I DONT RECCOMEND IT!"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"Well iu thin that this book should've had a first book. Its very confusing and boring its so long I did not like it !!!!!!!!!!!"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"This was the absolute WORST book that I have ever read. It the dullest, most boring thing since I learned algebra. After the first chapter, I already wanted to kill myself. But I gave it another chance. And another, and another, and another. I was continually dissapointecd. DO NOT WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY ON THIS ABORATION OF A BOOK!"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The Sword in the Stone is a fantastic book to read for several reasons.The first reason is the title, which sounds like an exciting adventure story. As soon as I looked at the cover with a magician and a young boy on it, I knew it wouild be something I would be interested in. The short summary on the inside of the cover told me enough about the story to know that I would read this from end to end. The other thind the summary told me was that the book was about King Arthur, who I've always wanted to read about. I picked out the book and immediately decided that this was something I would read.The main character is young Arthur. He is a young boy who is typical of young people in his time. He is brave, thoughful of others, and very respectful to his elders. When his tutor, the Magician Merlyn, begins his education, Arthur's curiosity and talent for learning become apparent. Even so, Arthur and his brother, Kay, run and play as normal kids would. Not too much is made of the fact that Arthur is adopted.It would be fair to say that Arthur is shown to be somebody who will grow into greatness but will be perfectly normal getting there.I really like this book because it is a fast-moving story with a great deal of adventure and magic. Arthur's adventures put him into all kinds of circumstances and problems. In fact, each adventure is a unique hapenning. The way the author weaves adventure and magic into his tales makes the book hard to put down. I especially liked the time when Merlyn turned Arthur into a bird. When Arthur was locked in a box and almost cooked by a witch, I enjoyed how Arthur used a goat as a messenger. This kind of descriptive writing made me feel like I was inside the book. I wouild have to say that this book is an exciting, magical adventure story, which I enjoy greatly."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"We got this book for my son's assigned summer reading from his school. The book itself is good and discussion worthy, and will make a good classroom topic, hitting upon some controversial topics. The book itself has some wear, but for the cost was a pretty good value. It had a bit of a musty smell, like it came from an old school or library. But, hey; it was used, so we weren't expecting perfection.I'd buy from this seller again. And, my son would recommend the book to others for a good read."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"I'm only in the middle of the book, but it is fantasic! My school teacher is reading the same book and can't put it down. She even reads in the middle of class! This is an amazing book to read and I am so wanting to read more and more every day. It's wonderful and an adventure with every new page. If you are most enterested in King Arthur then read it. It will tell you more then enough info about King Arthur. It is one of T.H.White's most fantasic and fanous story. It was amazing!"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"Young Arthur, (known to everyone else as &quot;Wart&quot;,) learns from his tutor, Merlin, stuff that he could only dream about before, coming to life before his eyes. Like watching Jousts, turning in to fish, birds, and other animals, and going on adventures with Robin Wood,(commonly known as Robin Hood.) but makes mistakes, gets injured, and learns from them. And all of this only helps in his future life, and his quest, which is his destiny. I rated the sword in the stone a 5 because It was a extremely good book, and the only things that might affect my judgment is the fact that sometimes they use old English. It is sometimes hard to understand because some of the wording is a little old, and, and stuff like that. But T.H. White is able to incorporate a story of king Arthur, and a story full of distinct, funny and odd people, (basically, a comedy,) in to one great book. Another reason that I think that it is a good book because T.H.White gets really in depth throughout the whole book, he can describe every detail, in other words, he can really &quot;Paint a perfect picture.&quot; So all in all I say that if you are interested in King Arthur at all, you should definitely read this book! It does not matter if you are twelve or twenty-one, thirty or seventy, you will truly enjoy The Sword in The Stone. It is definitely a top ten on my list! If you like The Sword in the stone as much as I do, then I recommend reading The Once and Future King, also by T.H.White."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"I must admit, at first I wasn't keen on the idea of reading a novel based on Arthurian legend for English. Despite my love of the Disney cartoon, I felt certain that the book would be dull and slow-moving, with little or no comic relief, and cardboard characters. I was sure that knights and swordplay would hold no interest for me. Yet, as soon as I picked up The Sword in the Stone by T.H. White, I changed my mind. This well-written book was engrossing, lively, and humorous, three qualities which, based on my preconceived notions of the book, I never would have expected a novel on Arthurian legend to have.I grew up watching Walt Disney's cartoon version of the book, and it was always one of my favorites. But can you trust a Disney cartoon to be the same as the book? Because they always change the story so that it will appeal to younger audiences, it is difficult for Disney to stay accurate. To my surprse, the movie is actually rather true to the book.T.H. White's vivid characters really bring this fabulous story to life with lovable, animated personalities. As you follow Arthur (affectionately nicknamed &quot;Wart&quot;)on a series of wonderful, wild events under the tutelage of Merlyn, you grow to enjoy spending time with this eager character who is anxious to learn and is always up for an adventure. Merlyn, the slightly eccentric old magician who lives life backwards, and who has come to the Castle Savauge to tutor Arthur and Kay, is lovely, as well. Then there is the crazy, fun-loving King Pellinore, who spends his life on the trail of the Questin' Beast. With his many excellent portrayals. T.H. White makes you feel as though you've made some new friends.The unique plot of this book is one of the things that keeps you constantly wrapped up in it. From becoming a fish, to rescuing friends with Robin Wood (NOT Hood) and Maid Marian, to going on a possibly deadly boar hunt with the whole village, Arthur does it all. You are sure to be enthralled as Arthur sees what it's like to be an ant, an owl, and many other creatures. The fun, frolicking plot is like no other, so it always keeps you interested and waiting for more. And, of course, there is always the happy ending, which I won't give away for those of you who do not already know what it is. The plot is different in that it has several small dilemmas, rather than one major obstacle for Arthur to overcome. So, if you are looking for a suspenseful book that will keep you on the edge of your seat, this is not the book for you. But if you are looking for a comical book with a playful, whimsical plot, energetic, delightful characters, and an all-in-all happy mood, The Sword in the Stone is your book of choice."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"It has been many years since I read the works of T.H. White, and it was quite by accident that I came across the Philomel edition of The Sword in the Stone, while browsing the bargain section at a used bookstore. I found this edition for two dollars (and in very good condition), and decided to purchase it so that I could share it with my young daughter. The book brought back fond memories of summers spent at my grandparents' home, and of reading the numerous works of children's literature in their home library.The Sword and the Stone is a wonderful work of fantasy, of Arthur's childhood and tutelage under the great wizard, Merlyn. It is full of fun and adventurous exploits, giving readers and anyone interested in Arthur a fantastical glimpse into Arthur's life during childhood. The Philomel edition is especially recommended for the beautiful, detailed, full color illustrations by artist Dennis Nolan. There are seventeen full-page color illustrations which enhance one's reading pleasure. A captivating read indeed."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"THE SWORD IN THE STONE is just about the best fantasy that I have ever read. It is a story of the childhood of Wart, later known as King Arthur, and is filled with delightful adventures that fulfill childhood dreams-such as becoming a owl and being able to fly. Not only that,but this book is also filled with the wonder and the wisdom of T.H.White. To read it is an undescribable experience.I recommend it uncondoitionally to all lovers of fantasy"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"The book &quot;The Sword In The Stone&quot; written by T.H. White was a very exciting and interesting book. The book was about a young boy named The Wart brought up in a wealthy family of his father, Sir Ector, and his brother, Kay. He met a wizard who became his tutor but not any ordinary tutor. This tutor, Merlyn, turned The Wart into different animals and what-not to give Wart the greatest adventure of his life. I really liked this book because it was really exciting and kept you on your toes. The adventures that Wart was faced with were exciting, fun, and entertaining. One of the adventures that I liked the most was the first one The Wart was sent on. He was turned into a fish and seemed so vulnerable then because he needed to learn how to swim and to get used to the water. It was exciting! Even when the book started to get a little bleak the author would always come back with a new, fun adventure to keep you on your toes. There was only one point that I didn't like. The author would spend one out of about every five chapters just describing the scenery and the place they were in. That got rather monotonous to read.I would recommend this book to a skilled reader but no one under the age of ten. This book was wonderful and fun-filled, and if you love excitement and fantasy this is a book for you!ALWAYS, Ken"},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"This was a wonderful book to read,and I too was surprised and pleased at how much of the novel Walt Disney kept in his cartoon version.(Disney was either very faithful or very unfaithful in his adaptations.This is much more faithful than some.)Wart needed a lot of education,and Merlyn knew the right way to teach Wart the way to be a king.The different lives Wart led as an animal showed him the basics of human nature,as he realizes that animals and humans aren't too different at all."},{"Title":"The Sword in the Stone","review":"Do what we will, we always become who we are meant to be. We hold a lot of power within us, but not enough to fight our fates. Fascinating theories and themes such as these are presented and strongly portrayed in T.H. White's The Sword in the Stone. The inexorable power of destiny is beautifully illustrated in this book, which takes us through many adventures of the boyhood of legendary King Arthur.Readers gain a respect for young King Arthur (identified in this story as \\"the Wart\\") from the very start. Though the Wart is treated somewhat unkindly by his guardians, Sir Ector and Kay, he does what he knows is right in all situations. These situations include the first main incident of the story, in which the Wart bravely stays a whole night alone in a dark forest, simply to retrieve a servant's loose bird. He also keeps his head and his priorities straight despite his older brother Kay's naggings and his envy for Kay's station in society. The Wart is somewhat confused and unsure of his purpose in life, but soon his main guardian Sir Ector hires a wizard named Merlyn to tutor and educate the boy. Thus marks the beginning of the future king's great adventures and learning experiences. Putting to use his magical powers, the wizard educates the Wart by transforming him into several different creatures so that the boy can see life from various points of view. One day, as Arthur is trying to find a sword for Kay to use in a jousting match, he comes across a sword in a stone (which is the title's derivation). He struggles to pull it out for quite some time, then senses that something strange and unusual is in the air around him, something magical, and the sword easily slips out. His family and all the townspeople are shocked and somewhat dismayed when they hear the news, but nevertheless the meek, submissive, experienced Arthur inherits the throne. The ending ties up many loose ends and brings the whole story together in one great, triumphant, fulfilling close.Strange and contradicting as it may seem, I both dislike and love this detailed book. I dislike it because I feel that many parts are too long and drawn-out, especially descriptions of places and the Wart's out-of-body experiences. I love the story because it is very creative and poses thought-provoking theories and pieces of advice about life. I enjoy the humorous parts of this book, which are sporadically sprinkled within both casual and serious situations. I think that the young king's experiences are relevant and can be beneficial to many who seek different viewpoints of life.I personally recommend The Sword in the Stone to people who read at about the junior-high or high-school level, roughly age twelve and up, who are interested in Arthurian legend. I especially recommend it to males, as I feel that it is generally a male-directed book. I state this because there are very few female characters involved in the story, and those are very minor (yet not inferior) characters. It is possible that this is due to the fact that the author himself is a male. Nonetheless, The Sword in the Stone contains many important themes which will be beneficial to all types of people who choose to read the book."},{"Title":"Sue Barton, student nurse (Comet books)","review":"Sue B beats Cherry Ames hands down.

Sue is especially doubtful about this. Then, one night she herself is rushed into surgery for an emergency appendectomy. Then, while recovering on the ward, she suddenly comes up against a delirious patient who is trying to escape from the hospital. Can Sue stop her --even if the situation puts Sue herself into danger?This is a wonderful story.

Or ...This book goes way beyond the Sun documentation. It looks at many aspects of concurrency. Including how to make a thread safe class. Which is one of the basic things you need, given that Java is object oriented, and a typical program makes classes specific to its needs. Here, the guidelines are concise, requiring that you focus on defining the class's invariants and the variables that define the state of the class. The book does not seem to explicitly talk about the concept of a finite state machine. But that is essentially what you might want to consider for each of your classes that will have multithreaded access.Also well worth attention is the chapter on multithread performance. Germane with the increasing availability of multicore processors. The chapter has a lucid explanation of the costs of having too many threads.

I would strongly recommend that if you are going down the multi-threaded path, you *need* to get this book... Java Concurrency In Practice by Brian Goetz. This bridges the gap between what the reference manuals say and how things work in the real world.Contents:IntroductionI. Fundamentals: Thread Safety; Sharing Objects; Composing Objects; Building BlocksII. Structuring Concurrent Applications: Task Execution; Cancellation and Shutdown; Applying Thread Pools; GUI ApplicationsIII. Liveness, Performance, and Testing: Avoiding Liveness Hazards; Performance and Scalability; Testing Concurrent ProgramsIV. Advanced Topics: Explicit Locks; Building Custom Synchronizers; Atomic Variables and Nonblocking Synchronization; The Java Memory Model; Annotations for ConcurrencyBibliography; IndexThis book picks up from the regular documentation on how specific synchronization and threading features work. Goetz does a relatively light introduction to the topic, and then starts into practical issues that you'll encounter in real programs and applications. For instance, a specific component, such as a collection, might be thread-safe. But what happens if that component is part of a compound function you've written? The compound function may well have \\"features\\" that you don't expect when running in the wild, since the threading issues now have to be considered at a level higher than the specific component. And being that you rarely have a clue as to how your program will mix with others, a bad design can lead to nasty intermittent threading bugs that are nearly impossible to consistently recreate. Goetz goes beyond the \\"write your code this way\\" material to explain how both code *and* design have to work in concert with each other to make sure a multi-threaded application behaves the way it should.I was also impressed with the number of examples, both good and bad. By having a large number of \\"don't do this\\" samples, it's likely you'll see something that might be common practice in your coding style (but that will need to be changed). He also summarizes the material in gray call-outs within the flow of the text, so you can quickly grasp the one or two line concept that needs to be remembered and internalized in practice.In a single word, this book can be summed up as \\"practical\\". Everything is focused on how things really work, and how to avoid common practices that will lead to major trouble.

Sadly, this domestic edition suffers the same fate, albeit not as badly as some Low Priced Editions; it's merely annoying. Truth be told, other domestic full priced editions also have translucent paper; but I still don't like it, and the flimsy through-view paper in this book stands out.

I had this book for a while but didn't bother to read from cover to cover until recently - while it was certainly neither an easy nor quick read, it was certainly well worth it. Before starting on this book, you will need at least some understanding of how concurrency works in Java at a basic level. The preface to this book clearly states that this book is not an introduction to concurrency (for which authors recommend the threading chapter in The Java Programming Language by Arnold) nor is it an encyclopedic reference on this subject (for which the authors recommend Concurrent Programming in Java by Doug Lea). The book starts off with fundamentals and then moves onto structuring concurrent programs, testing concurrency programs and lastly advanced topics such as building custom synchronizers. In general, the writing is clear and understandable for the most part although at some points in the book, it does become a bit of a tough read which I would expect in any concurrency text due to the depth and complexity of this topic. There are lots of examples in this book. I tested out pretty much all of them without any issues. In addition to illustrating how to write concurrent applications, this book also gives examples of how not to write them and explains why - which is great for remembering and every day usage. If you are interested in Java concurrency from a practical standpoint and not from theoretical side (which most practictioners would be), I think this is the best book in the market. I was never too excited about concurrency in Java but this book actually piqued my interest due to which I intend to check out the book by Doug Lea for more indepth treatment of this topic. Well deserved kudos to the authors. Two thumbs up."},{"Title":"Java Concurrency in Practice","review":"This book is awesome, I'm almost done reading it.One thing though: to truly benefit from it I think you should have some experience in software design and coding multithreaded applications, and needless to say that you should feel comfortable with the Java standard library. for instance you will not understand the importance of client side locking or saturation and cancellation policies without proper experience in software design and multithreading.The book covers almost everything you should know to write safe, high performance, efficient and scalable multithreaded applications, it drills down into most of the important classes in the Java concurrency library (java.util.concurrent), and explains how and when to use them. I love how the book is consistent with the previous Effective Java book (has many direct references to it) and how it puts emphasis on correctness and scalability. The book was written by my favorite Java gurus (Josh Bloch, Doug Lea), if you don't know these guys yet - you should. Bloch wrote most of the standard library, and Doug Lea's signature appears on most concurrency code in java.Written for engineers, you can expect to also find benchmarking of different concurrent components, some formulas to measure and calculate optimal thread pool sizes, and many formal definitions and guidelines to live by.Awesome. must have."},{"Title":"Java Concurrency in Practice","review":"I like the clear style of writing which balances simplicity of expression with the complexity of the material. After reading the first two chapters I am pleased by the ease with which the authors introduce this complex subject. They are interested not only in \\"correct\\" code but also performant code that is truly thread-safe, emphasizing design principles with simple code examples. The narrative parts are easy to understand by anyone familiar with the Java language."},{"Title":"Java Concurrency in Practice","review":"If you program in Java you need to read this book. Even if you don't program in Java, 70% of this book holds true for non Java development too. Mr Goetz is clear, concise and will teach you how to program today's software applications correctly. Or at least defensively with an eye towards being performant.I come from the embedded system realm where most of what Mr Goetz talks about, at least in theory, is second nature. However in Java, second nature for c/c++ doesn't mean you know how to do the same things in Java. Mr Goetz will get you there. From locking, to local copies, to shared spaces to Java specific executors - Mr Goetz covers it all. What I particularly enjoyed was his section on performance. Too often, when writing concurrent code, one tends to over protect. In Java Concurrency we are taught how to gain performance and still be safe. To say that the concept of scaling was well covered would be an understatement.Quite frankly, this is one of the best programming books I've ever read. Up there with Code Complete. It will change the way you think about programming - for the better."},{"Title":"Java Concurrency in Practice","review":"This is the best book on java.

For example, I knew what the textbook definition of a volatile variable was, but I never knew why I would actually want to use one. Now I know when to use them and when they won't solve the problem.Of course, JCP talks about the Java 5 concurrency library at great length. But this is no paraphrasing of the javadoc. (It was Doug Lea's original concurrency utility library that eventually got incorporated into Java, and we're all better off for it.) The authors start with illustrations of real issues in concurrent programming. Before they introduce the concurrency utilities, they explain a problem and illustrate potential solutions. (Usually involving at least one naive \\"solution\\" that has serious flaws.) Once they show us some avenues to explore, they introduce some neatly-packaged, well-tested utility class that either solves the problem or makes a solution possible. This removes the utility classes from the realm of \\"inscrutable magic\\" and presents them as \\"something difficult that you don't have to write.\\"The best part about JCP, though, is the combination of thoroughness and clarity with which it presents a very difficult subject. For example, I always understood about the need to avoid concurrent modification of mutable state. But, thanks to this book, I also see why you have to synchronize getters, not just setters. (Even though assignment to an integer is guaranteed to happen atomically, that isn't enough to guarantee that the change is visible to other threads. The only way to guarantee ordering is by crossing a synchronization barrier on the same lock.)I've seen hundreds of web site crashes. Every single one of them eventually boils down to blocked threads somewhere. Java Concurrency in Practice has the theory, practice, and tools that you can apply to avoid deadlocks, live locks, corrupted state, and a host of other problems that lurk in the most innocuous-looking code."},{"Title":"Java Concurrency in Practice","review":"Very simple -- if you need to write a concurrent Java application you must have this book.The book teaches you more than just the theoretical aspects of concurrent programming such as exclusion mechanisms, liveness and safety issues, it shows the correct way to do it in Java.A comprehensive tutorial of the concurrency package provided in j2se 5 and 6 is given, and I think it is a crucial aid for writing correct and maintainable concurrent code in Java.The advanced topics in the book give you a better understanding of the inner workings of Java and even the inner workings of compilers and modern processors and this is done without going into redundant details.The only comment I have about the book, is that I would expect at least a chapter or two about parallel and distributed programming and the available Java frameworks that support it."},{"Title":"Java Concurrency in Practice","review":"I have been programming in Java for years, and yet I've generally ignored or otherwise avoided dealing with concurrency and synchronization at every opportunity because I found it so daunting. This book broke down that barrier for me and helped me to understand what I needed to do to write correct concurrent programs. In particular, the book provides concrete instructions that I was able to apply to projects that I am working on right now.I would highly recommend this book to any Java programmer, as you are probably missing out on part of the capabilities of your language (and/or writing incorrect programs!) until you read this. It's probably not a bad lesson for developers of concurrent software in any language, but the concrete instructions regarding Java were really the most valuable part of the book to me."},{"Title":"Java Concurrency in Practice","review":"For me, the most helpful feature of this book are the advices about what not to do -- Best practices on Java concurrency.

A lot of practical examples are given under the context.Most of \\"new\\" components in java.util.concurrent package are explored and analyzed, for what the thoughts are behind, why the design came the way it is and what balance it achieves. These components can be used as a basic building block for composing more sophisticated solutions to meet your application concurrency requirements.Though the theories behind concurrency are not trivial, the book presents them in a very clear, concise and easy understanding way.

I have been a little disappointed. The book provides a great deal of do's and don'ts but at times (only sometimes) does not provide sufficient explanations. Essentially, the book makes final conclusions at the end of each sections but in some (certainly not all or most) cases, it does not provide sufficient examples, scenarios or details to backup the conclusions so it leaves the reader wondering how in the world did the author come up with the conclusion.I will provide you with a concrete example:On page 34, topmost paragraph, the authors state \\"and a thread otherthan the publishing thread were to call assertSanity, it could throw AssertionError\\" then they elaborate but on the symptom: \\"The problem here is not the Holder class itself, but that the Holder is not properly published. However, Holder can be made immune toimproper publication by declaring the n field to be final, which would make Holder immutable;\\" rather than provide a concrete scenario of how the problem would occur. This leaves the reader trying to come up with a a sequence of events that will cause the AssertionError. In general, sometimes, after 30 mins or so, I would figure it out, but sometimes, as in this case, I can not.On the other hand, the book does provide major practical benefits. For example, I had to refer to the book twice in one month, once to review the caching algorithm using FutureTask and one to trouble shoot a ConcurrentModificationException in JBoss from session replication. Hence, any book that I would need to refer to, however frequently or infrequently, deserves at least 3 stars. It would have been 4.5-5 stars if the explanations/justifications came with more detailed step-by-step replication procedure for all rather than for some. That could turn the book into a 500 page monster so I guess I understand why the authors didn't. Using the above example, I wished they had provided more scenarios of how/why ConcurrentModificationException is caused, in addition to the excellent example they provided (logger.info(\\"....\\" + set) would generate the exception since set.toString() iterates thru the elements and other threads could be modifying the set)."},{"Title":"Java Concurrency in Practice","review":"I find this book one of the best to find out about java and its concurrency.I use it as a reference book.The first time you read, its hard to follow.

I have a number of Java certifications, but I would never have known about classes like AtomicInteger and AtomicReference without reading this book. It is definitely important to get the most performance possible out of your programs, especially in a service-oriented environment with lots of whining customers and little budget for hardware upgrades.I was really impressed with the ExecutorService framework for fixed thread pools. I was asked to create a pooling mechanism simulating an application server that can be used for standalone testing. I originally created and managed the threads myself in an array, but this book gave me the information for making more use of the Java API in keeping the code clean. Using Callable instead of Runnable is great for getting results from your processes after they complete, and Future gives you a hook for cancellation/interruption.There is a really interesting discussion on JVM shutdown. I have sometimes had processes that threw a Runtime exception but still held a database lock, causing deadlocks and contention later on. This recommends doing the final resource cleanup in the finally block of the \\"run\\" method. However, what if a \\"grid\\" monitoring process forces shutdown of my application? Would the Object's final() method insure that that my resource was cleaned up so that no lock is still held by the grid's JVM? The answer seems to be that the final method is less reliably called than the finally block, and that you should make your tasks \\"interruptable\\" by polling an unbounded queue or calling the thread's isInterrupted() method frequently. My questions aren't all answered on this, but I still have another 150 pages to go in the book."},{"Title":"Java Concurrency in Practice","review":"Before purchasing this book I borrowed it from a friend. Unfortunately he needed it back before I could finish, but it didn't matter because I had already decided it should be part of my Java book collection. It fits right in with my other two favorite Java books, Effective Java and Java Puzzlers. This book does a great job of explaining concurrency in the Java language and the best practices. The book not only gives examples of what you should do, but also what not to do. The majority of the book describes Java concurrency practices at higher levels, but the last chapter also describes the Java Memory Model for those wanting to tie it all together.

For me the main issue is the shocking discovery of the complexity involved in doing even basic multi-threading programming, in a world of tutorials and even books that try to convince you on the contrary.Also, this book clarifies a lot of obscure semantic points in the threading classes (for example, the handling and \\"rethrowing\\" of interruptions) and open your eyes on subjects hidden in the specs that most developers will never read nor understand at all (like most thread visibility issues.)With that foundation, the description of the Java 5's \\"util.concurrency\\" package is pretty solid; the book is not focused on the \\"how to use\\" (you can check the javadocs), but on the \\"why\\" of the several provided implementations, so you can deduce the \\"where\\" to apply them (the book's authors also participated in the design of those concurrency utilities.)At risk of sounding repetitive, this book is a must read for any Java developer since most of them are currently involved directly or indirectly in MT programming (for example, inside a servlet environment.)"},{"Title":"Java Concurrency in Practice","review":"This book is really great. It briefly explains basics while not stick to them, continues with useful hi-api classes for everyday usage and ends with advanced topics..

This book does for concurrent programming in Java what Geary's series of books did for graphical Java - it moves concurrent Java programming out of the realm of applets containing bouncing balls and into that of providing real solutions for professional programmers.This book is not meant to be an introduction to concurrency in Java. Its intention is to offer practical design rules to assist developers in the difficult process of creating safe, fast, and high-performance concurrent classes. While many of the general concepts in this book are applicable to versions of Java prior to Java 1.5, most of the code examples and all the statements about the Java Memory Model assume Java 1.5 or later. By \\"later\\" I mean that some of the code examples use library features added in the not-yet released Java 1.6. After the introduction, which consists of Chapter 1, the book is divided into four parts:Part one, \\"Fundamentals\\", (Chapters 2-5) are about the basic concepts of concurrency, thread safety, and composing thread-safe classes from those concurrent building blocks provided by the Java language. Chapter 2, \\"Thread Safety\\", and 3, \\"Sharing Objects\\", include nearly all of the rules on avoiding concurrency hazards, constructing thread-safe classes, and verifying thread safety. Thus, these chapters emphasize theory and have less code than other chapters in the book. Chapter 4 , \\"Composing Objects\\", covers techniques for composing large thread-safe classes from smaller thread-safe classes. Chapter 5, \\"Building Blocks\\", covers thread-safe collections and synchronizers, which are the the concurrent building blocks provided by Java. To conclude the section, the authors work through the steps of building an efficient, scalable result cache that could be used in a web server. A summary of the most important rules presented in Part one occur at the end of the section.Part two, \\"Structuring Concurrent Applications\\", describes how proper use of threading improves the throughput and responsiveness of concurrent applications. The topics covered in this section include identifying tasks that can be run in parallel and programming them as such, proper termination of tasks, using thread pools for greater efficiency in multi-threaded systems, and finally improving the responsiveness of single-threaded systems, GUI's being the most prominent example.Part 3, \\"Liveness, Performance, and Testing\\" is concerned with ensuring that concurrent programs actually do what is expected of them and do so with acceptable performance. The authors describe how to avoid situations where a thread waits forever, also known as a \\"liveness failure\\". Also included in this section is an excellent explanation of the use of the \\"ThreadLocal\\" class and how it makes it much easier to manage the process of associating a thread with its per-thread data.Part 4, \\"Advanced Topics\\", covers issues that will probably be interesting only to experienced developers. These topics include explicit locks, atomic variables, nonblocking algorithms, and developing custom synchronizers. Any of these techniques, explicit locks in particular, can cause chaos when done incorrectly. This book shows how to use these techniques safely and with confidence.One of the things that makes this book so good are the many code examples. There are only snippets of entire programs included in the book itself in order to highlight the portions relevant to the concurrency issue being discussed. The code examples are either good examples, questionable examples, or bad code examples and are decorated with \\"Smiley Faces\\" that are either happy, concerned, or unhappy depending on the quality of the code. The full versions of the code examples, as well as supplementary examples and errata, are supposed to be available from the book's website. However, at the time I am writing this, they are not yet available.Overall, I would say that this is the most complete and accessible resource on concurrency in Java I have seen in print. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Java Concurrency in Practice","review":"Concurrency is hard and boring. Unfortunately, my favoured technique of ignoring it and hoping it will go away doesn't look like it's going to bear fruit. Fortunately, Java 5.0 introduced a new bunch of concurrency utilities, that work at a higher level of abstraction than marking blocks as synchronized and fields as volatile. Unfortunately, there haven't been that many books on the subject - even the good Java 5.0 books (e.g. Head First Java or Agile Java) make little mention of them - Thinking in Java being an honourable exception. Fortunately, JCIP is here, and it is authoritative stuff. And it's (mostly) very easy to understand. Plus, at 350 pages, it's not an enormous chore to slog through. It even covers changes to the upcoming Java 6.Before tackling this book, you should have at least some idea of pre-Java 5.0 concurrency. You don't need to be a threading master, though, as the first part of the book covers basics like deadlock, atomicity and liveness. This was my favourite part of the book, as it comes with lots of small code snippets, both right and (horribly) wrong, and pithy design guidelines. It's rather like Effective Java in that respect - although the material on threading was probably the weakest part of that book, so this is a definite improvement.The second part deals with thread pools, cancellation strategies, and GUIs. This is also excellent. Part three covers performance and testing. The last 75 pages are for advanced users and goes into a fair amount of low level detail (including a discussion of the Java Memory Model), which may be of interest to experts only.I would be lying if I said that reading this book will demystify concurrency completely. Who wrote which bit of the book is unclear (although readers of Effective Java will probably spot parts of the text that seem rather Joshua Blochish), but while it's mostly very clear, some parts of the text are a little murkier than other. Perhaps this is to be expected given the subject matter. But for the most part it's surprisingly easy reading, and very practical to boot.Let's face it, short of aliens landing and introducing a radically new way of computing, multicores are here for the medium term at least, so thread-dodging wimps such as myself will just have to get used to it. That being so, this book is going to be installed as one of the must-read books in the Java pantheon."},{"Title":"Java Concurrency in Practice","review":"The book is by far the best one on Java concurrency. There is really nothing out there that has such comprehensive coverage of this topic. Doug Lee's book is a bit theoretical and somewhat dry, but would be a nice complement to this book if you want to think some more about concurrency. This book has a very strong practical vector. Coverage of Java 5 concurrency features is very thorough. The book is extremely well-written, relatively easy to read.The book stands on par with such established Java book jems as Josh Bloch's \\"Effective Java\\", Eckel's \\"Thinking in Java\\" and Rod Johnson's J2EE books.All in all, this is a definite must have for any Java specialist."},{"Title":"Java Concurrency in Practice","review":"We've been reading a pre-release version of this book as part of a local study group and I'm very impressed with the treatment.Concurrency is perhaps one of the hardest issues to understand well and it's equally difficult to explain all of the issues, but Goetz et. al. do a very nice job of explaining clearly the different ways a multi-threaded process can fail and then providing concrete design philosophies that will help address those problems.In my experience, concurrency books often fall between providing too little detail (\\"just add synchronized to everything and all should be well\\") to providing too much (\\"details of how the Java Memory Model actually behaves on a multi-processor machine\\"). Java Concurrency in Practice seems to find a nice balance, e.g. thoroughly explaining why you need to worry about how values are \\"published\\" between threads but without swamping you with so much information about the details of how this is done by the VM that you're left gasping for air.For me, this is a focus on the practical aspects of building multi-threaded applications in real world situations. In such cases, you need to fully understand the potential pitfalls and then you want to have a list of specific design methodologies which help avoid those failings. Java Concurrency in Practice does a nice job of providing both."},{"Title":"Java Concurrency in Practice","review":"This is clearly one of the top notch Java books like Doug Lea's original \\"Concurrent Programming in Java\\". And like CPIJ it is scary. Can one ever get the concurrency aspects right enough? Are the books of other authors trustworthy (enough)? There is so little help from the language itself and the IDEs to get things concurrency correct. And the authors show in many examples, what all can go wrong and that our old \\"Von Neumann machine\\" intuition is plainly wrong and often highly misleading. With the inevitable concurrency, Java is in fact a language for advanced programmers. Things will in practice get worse due to the increasing ubiquity of multiprocessor computers even on the desktop.The book is written by leading Java experts. It cites and uses in an unusually extensive ways some of the other classics in our Java world:Arnold et al. \\"The Java Programming Language\\",Lea \\"Concurrent Programming in Java\\",Gosling et al. \\"Java Language Specification\\" andBloch \\"Effective Java\\".It is helpful but not mandatory to know them. Better it is to have them handy to be able to quickly look things up. Most other referenced works are original articles.\\"Java Concurrency in Practice\\" is written in a readable style - though the material is presented in an unusual dense way for an Addison and Wesley Java book. Expect an information density more like an O'Reilly one, but a lot lower than a Springer one. Anyhow the book gets easier to read as you and your understanding progresses.The presented material relies on and explains the new concurrency features of Java 5 and even Java 6. But it is not a tutorial of the new concurrency classes. It is a high level introduction from the usage pattern point of view. It explains the new classes only as far as is necessary.One of my favorite chapters is on testing concurrent programs. Yes, it is possible to make unit tests for concurrent classes. No, it does not look like it is much fun though. But, you get a good head start. Besides peer review you also find some testing help in static analyzers like \\"findbugs\\".In summary I recommend this book as one of the core Java books. I still wish the world is - with respect to multithreading - easier and less intimidating."},{"Title":"Java Concurrency in Practice","review":"Brian has a winner here. I was fortunate to obtain a preview copy from Brian Goetz and have devoured the book. This is the first book that I know of since Doug Lea's Concurrent Programming in Java, that addresses Java threading and concurrency with such vigor.Each section has a solid example that will also stand up in the real world.The book was put together very carefully, with great attention to detail, as is essential for a book about concurrency.One of the best parts of the book was Brian leading me on all the time. He would show me a piece of code as a solution to a problem, and I would think of ways that it could cause problems. He then addressed those problems on his next page, but caused other problems. This carried on until the final solution, which was always elegant beyond anything I have written :-)A solid 5 star rating for this book!Definitely a good meaty book for Java Specialists."},{"Title":"Java Concurrency in Practice","review":"As an experienced programmer (since 1973) with 9 year Java experience, I strongly recommend this beautiful small book for the professional Java programmer. This book has an excellent balance between academic formality and practicality. To gain confidence in exploiting the power of Java threads, do not loose the chance to read and keep as reference this book.I take the chance to publicly thank all the authors for sharing their knowledge with an excellent, clear and concise style."},{"Title":"Java Concurrency in Practice","review":"This book is a tour de force. The subject matter is intrinsically difficult and frighteningly susceptible to detail. I knew I had gaps in my knowledge when I started to read it, but the extent of my ignorance was chilling.The book chooses a very thoughtful level of abstraction which gives the reader the opportunity to absorb the essential problems and patterns without straying too far from the inconvenient realities, at the same time teaching a kind of framework for analysis of multithreading issues. It is a very well organized book that will serve as a fine reference after providing the initial learning experience. The book's focus on the Java 5 concurrency library makes both the lessons and the library accessible and easy to exploit. The lessons are deep and varied and without exception practical.Practising multithreaded programming in Java without reading this book is like doing aerials without a net. If you choose not to read it, good luck, and I hope it doesn't hurt too much."},{"Title":"Java Concurrency in Practice","review":"The authors correctly point out that this topic, once the realm of advanced programming specialists, is now of concern to all programmers. Technology and the Java language both demand that software artisans understand concurrency and building thread-safe applications. The authors begin with some basics concerning concurrency and defining terms. This is essential since it seems an area where every software engineer seems to have their own definitions and assumptions. With the ground work complete, the authors continue on with various approaches to thread-safety and design considerations.Included is a discussion of GUI development considerations, performance considerations, and testing strategies. Within an advanced topics section the authors cover explicit locks, custom synchronizers, and the Java memory model with respect to concurrency issues.The writing style is clear, concise, and readable. Well worth the investment for the beginner or advanced student and sure to be referred to again and again in the future."},{"Title":"Java Concurrency in Practice","review":"I have purchased or been given about a hundred tech books over the past two years and read nearly none of them -- except for this one. With the multi-core era upon us, the topic couldn't be more timely and I can't imagine this book being written any better. This is the book I read when I have a spare minute, and I always learn something I can't imagine how I lived without knowing beforehand. Bravo Brian et al."},{"Title":"Java Concurrency in Practice","review":"It is extremely good book. Might be hard at times, but more because topic itself is kinda complex. Book is really well written."},{"Title":"Java Concurrency in Practice","review":"It's a great book that everyone should read. You'll definitely wind up stopping yourself from some common mistakes that result in the ever-so-common \\"WTF?!?!!?\\" reaction when debugging for a couple hours and seeing things working just fine, but not working on and off in production. Yeah... then it dawns on you that there's a synchronization issue.This book helps keep those kind of issues in mind much, much better.The only downside to the book is that it's a complete bear to read. It's just an exceedingly difficult book to work yourself through. I actually finished two other books while reading it. It's just really heavy without any real breaks in there to keep it entertaining.Again... great book, but in a next revision I hope the authors take some time to just make it a bit of a lighter read."},{"Title":"Java Concurrency in Practice","review":"This gem of a book is a comprehensive and authoritative coverage of one of the most mentally intimidating programming concepts - concurrency.The JDK Concurrency API has done a great job at simplifying the concurrency issues.

Great job!"},{"Title":"Java Concurrency in Practice","review":"Goetz did a really nice nice job in putting together lots of issues on how to deal with concurrency in Java, not focusing only the util.concurrent/Java 5 API but how to make other aspects of the platform (such as frameworks, servlets and swing apps) to use them.

But without knowledge of the people, the times, and the events leading up to these documents, we often fail to see their signficance.In this book, Paul M. Angle, one of the country's foremost historians, presents the most important of our historical documents as they should be read -- against a vivid, stage-setting narrative that recreates the scene in which each paper was born, describes the people who were there, explains why the document came into being.These illuminating comments, with Edward A. Wilson's spirited illustrations, give us front-row seats at the most dramatic scenes in America's past. And suddenly the forty-six documents presented herer become as significant and inspiring to us as they were to the patriots who wrote them.From the simple, two-paragraph Mayflower Compact drawn up by the Pilgrims in 1620 to the stirring Inaugural Address delivered by President Eisenhower in 1953, By These Words presents and interprets the vital writings and speeches which have marked more than three centuries of American thought and progress.Here are the words that voiced the colonists' resentment of tyranny, culminating in the immortal Declaration of Independence. Here are the arguments that secured freedom of the press, freedom of religion, the right of labor to organize. Here are the conflicting beliefs that brought on the Civil War. And finally, here are the important documents of the last thirty years, concerning our entry into two world wars and our emergence as leaders of the free world.By These Words is an inspiring book -- one that renews our will to preserve our freedom and democracy -- one that will have an honored place on the family bookshelf of every American home."},{"Title":"By These Words","review":"the worlds of angle by shaggey for I can sing it with the song or with out the song ok"},{"Title":"Animal ecology, (Text-books of animal biology, ed, by Julian S. Huxley)","review":"Elton's Animal Ecology was originally published in 1927 as one of the first textbooks on animal ecology. To this day I still can't find any ecology book like it and none are written so clearly, which is particularly surprising for its age. Elton synthesized many of the traditional natural history observations into ecological concepts that are still adhered to today. Not all of its ideas are original, but his success in emphasizing general themes in ecology surely is unique, especially for the time. He also emphasized the dynamic nature of ecological systems, and cleared distinguished the field of ecology from related fields. Ecology textbooks since then have been more focused on cramming as much information into one book without much concern for overview. Since I have been studying ecology for years, I see how many of the ideas in ecology today were alluded to in Elton's book, and basically ecologists since then have not conceived many revolutionary ideas, instead that have been accumulating data to support the old ones, and expanding concepts when necessary. There is still much to be learned from this book and current trends in the field today follow what Elton predicted or recommended 80 years ago."},{"Title":"The Boston cooking-school cook book","review":"If you want to cook and bake like your mother, grandmother, and great grandmother did than you will want this book.

Wendy has shown how the Lakota Indians have rebuilt the spiritual bridge to their own equestrian roots with parallel stories of healing and strength. I enjoyed getting to know the individuals Wendy profiled, and reading about their courage, as well as hers.

At least that is Wendy Baker's take on Donna's healing. She doesn't attribute it to the horses; she attributes Donna's healing to the Lakota culture and the Lakota community.The book concentrates on 9 Lakota Indians and 3 Lakota families and their stories about the importance of the horse in Lakota culture.It's by no means a comprehensive book; it's primarily a picture book with stories. And it isn't about the healing power of horses in the Lakota culture.Many people believe that there is a real spiritual and a healing connection between horses and humans, but this book is not a source for that information."},{"Title":"Healing Power of Horses: Lessons from the Lakota Indians","review":"Very nice book.

It takes us through a series of vignettes primarily in and around the lives of Randy, a voraciously sexual west-coast ad designer who grew up in an Orthodox Jewish east coast baker family, and Paul, a sometime east-coast actor turned Swiss-trained California psychiatrist with his share of tragedies and struggles to cope with.The stories and timeframes shift over 21 years, as we learn what makes up Paul, Randy and the people they are intimate with - spouses, parents, lovers, bosses, friends - and gain insight as to why. The fact Paul and Randy shared a chance common acquaintance, years apart, leads to some healing and emotional unblocking for both, in an almost mystically unconscious way.The artfulness of the prose and dialog is slightly strained at times when the author or characters describe feelings and relationships, but I didn't mind because I chalked it up to the shorthand way the psychiatrist author can get to the essence of relationships. In fact, readers may see their own relationships in simpler, more pure terms as a result, with some liberation of their own undercurrent feelings. (Maybe the book is intentionally a bit hypnotic or neuro-linguistically programmed?)If you've ever wondered what therapists get out of therapy, you'll be interested. This book is a fascinating meditation on the way relationships can, but sometimes don't, help heal pain (internal or interpersonal) that may in turn have been caused by relationships and what happened in and to them. And it does this 98% by story and character.Recommended, if this review speaks to you."},{"Title":"Best of Prague (Lonely Planet Pocket Guide Prague)","review":"I had this book with me on a recent trip to Prague.

It was relatively thin and small, so it was not a pain to carry it all around the city. The maps were probably the most useful for us.

Despite all of today's problems (a looming conflict with Iran, celebrity antics, etc.), it's still possible to find hope for a solution. And yeah, constructing a cockroach suit to survive nuclear fallout isn't exactly a solution, but it does shed some light on the utter absurdity of our current dilemmas. As Dean, the novella's protagonist, says, \\"One day you go to bed happy. The next day your dad dies. In a stupid, stupid way.\\"Later, after Dean encounters a woman who also owes her life to insects, we eventually come to learn that as devastating as the planet's destruction might be, it doesn't have to be all misery and loneliness. Even when just about every living thing has been annihilated, there still exists a potential for new life. In this case, that new life might turn out to be far stranger than any Darwinist can conceive.A few have pointed out that Extinction Journals isn't perfect, and upon first reading, it did feel too rushed toward the end. After reading it again, this was far less of an issue. As is the case with many short novels, characters aren't always fully fleshed out, but the re-read demonstrated that this isn't necessarily detrimental to the book either.If you're looking for a fresh, freakishly funny read, look no further than Extinction Journals. Your inner insect won't regret it."},{"Title":"Extinction Journals","review":"\\"Extinction Journals\\" is a hair raising journey through a post-apocalyptic United States.The narrator survives a nuclear holocaust with the help of an intricate cockroach suit he builds.

He also meets another survivor who managed to survive with the help of an ant colony and who is now the queen of that colony.The writing is gripping and the characters are unique. I was hooked and wished the book was longer (it's a little over 80 pages long). Johnson's imagination is vivid and inventive."},{"Title":"Extinction Journals","review":"\\"Extinction Journals\\" is a novella that mutated from a short story, according to its author, Jeremy Robert Johnson. This insect-sized gem of bizarro fiction features Dean, who survives a nuclear war thanks to his suit of living cockroaches, and a little supernatural assistance from a manmade god named Yahmuhwesu.The story takes place in the blasted and scarred remains of the U.S., which is the ironic setting for Dean's enlightenment. His father's death put his life on hold. The challenge of surviving nuclear devastation forces him to live again.Brought to us from Swallowdown Press, the book itself is like a wonderful bug: charming on the outside, with its petite size and fabulous cover art; icky on the inside, with its strange typesetting, particularly of dashes. The extra pages at the end have been put to good use, hawking other bizarro books, including Johnson's \\"Angel Dust Apocalypse.\\" That one's going on my to-be-read list, now that I've had a taste of Johnson's peculiar and witty word stylings.\\"Extinction Journals\\" is a fast read and a good introduction to the bizzaro genre for those who care to delve into it and can endure the inevitable thoughts of crunching cockroach carapaces that will echo in their minds after the last page has been turned."},{"Title":"Extinction Journals","review":"Jeremy Robert Johnson, whose work I was first introduced to via the excellent short story collection \\"Angel Dust Apocalypse\\", has once again created exciting new fiction which, quite literally, shows no boundaries. With \\"Extinction Journals\\" Johnson has taken the concept which first appeared as a short story in ADA and turned it into an original, very satisfying short novel of just over 100 pages. The plot is extraordinarily fresh and innovative, and the images range from clever, to funny, to frightening. Really, you couldn't ask for anything more in a book which you will read in one sitting. It is entertaining, yet still maintains the ever present iceberg theory that more lies underneath the surface.Johnson's work continues to amaze me, and it also gives me hope for the new world of literature that is on the horizon. I hope to see JRJ standing over the trembling body of the old literary guard with his Liston knife in hand, and, with a flash of the blade, signal the dawning of a new era in the written word."},{"Title":"Extinction Journals","review":"One reviewer felt that the author got bored with the story and rushed the ending. If there is one thing that you can learn by reading bizarro (and related genres) it is to be prepared for the unexpected. Things don't always end like you'd expect them to. What seems rushed may just be an unpredictable way for the author to conclude the story. Is that a cop out? Maybe sometimes.. but in this case, no. Any writer will tell you that many times the path that they had expected the story to go.. often changes. The story often writes itself.. the characters do things that are unexpected..even to the author.Well, now to EXTINCTION JOURNALS. This is the follow-up to the short story that was in the collection ANGEL DUST APOCALYPSE. It concerns the end of civilization thanks to an idiot president (remember, folks. this is fiction! hmph). Nuclear war comes and there are minimal survivors. One is a man who fashioned a suit covered in cockroaches.

It was an original story, and so creative. I loved the idea of the cockroach and twinkie suits. The two things that would survive the apocalypse. Maybe the president should have used stale twinkies? I loved it! His internal thoughts, and even the sparse dialogue with the other few survivors, were seamless and I really just fell into the story. The ending was pretty quick to come, but I think I sort of realized about fifty pages in, that the book was more of a short story. There was no real climax that I noticed (aside from the attack of the army ants..), and I believe it could have been so much more if more of Dean's past had been explored, figure out more about the father he so obviously missed. I wanted to know more about why he made the suit, why other people did. I got a vague idea that the world knew the nuclear holocaust was imminent, but still. It was a very interesting idea. It probably wouldn't have felt the same if Dean was too informed, too lucid, but I do miss the details. The only drawback was when he met Mave. I was so disappointed in how the book ended. I wanted to love it, I tried to, but the last ten pages just didn't do anything for me. The ant debacle turned a great book, into a silly one. Though I believe the author is very talented.

Strange in a good way.The book opens at the Washington Monument, where the cockroach-covered suit that saved Dean (our hero) from the nuclear holocaust is eating the president. Who is wearing a Twinkie-covered suit. After finally prying his suit away from the president's body, Dean begins his frankly bizarre trip across what's left of the United States. On the way, he meets something very like a god, but more confused, a man wearing someone else's skin and, finally, Mave, who is the queen of an ant colony.The books at a headlong pace, crashing through its short, weirdly sweet narrative with the force of an \\"Indiana Jones\\"-style boulder. Dean's trek across the nuclear wasteland of America is lonely and brutal, but even though he is becoming closer to his cockroach suit, he refuses to allow himself to sink too far. In these respects, the book is good -- extreme and \\"out there,\\" yes, but not to the extent that it becomes unpleasant. And it's funny.But there are a few problems. Despite the fact that the bulk of the novel is spent with Dean and Dean alone, the reader leaves the book feeling that he is still largely unknown, or not quite present. His acceptance of the new state of the world is so easy, he seems to be almost in a state of shock. And while he does have a few exhcanges with other characters, these also feel somehow sterile -- as if everyone's still a bit off and their personalities haven't had a chance to kick in yet.But overall, it's a very good book, and one of the better representatives of the Bizarro genre that I've encountered.

So inspiring, I wrote a song based off of it for my band."},{"Title":"Extinction Journals","review":"Jeremy Robert Johnson's Extinction Journals begins with a true bizarro scenario: a man in a suit made of cockroaches accidentally devours the president, who is dressed in a suit made of twinkies. But by the end of the book, being dressed in a suit of cockroaches almost seems normal.As the protagonist wanders through the bizarre, surreal landscape of post-apocalyptic America, he encounters other \\"survivors,\\" other people who saw what was coming and prepared: a woman in steel-toed boots and an iron apron, a man encased in cement, a man wearing his neighbor's skin. The images in the book are sometimes serene, and other times haunting and nightmarish.Its only fallback: the end of the book seems very rushed. It feels like a lot more should have been discussed, that there was a longer life to the story than is written. But despite the odd pacing, Johnson's prose is graceful and clear and the book, up to the sweet, hopeful ending, is a brilliant read and well worth your time."},{"Title":"Extinction Journals","review":"Basically its a handful of creative little sequences thrown together.

If you can find it cheap, go for it."},{"Title":"Extinction Journals","review":"really interesting concept, a man in a suit made of cockroaches roaming about after what appears to be a nuclear houlocast, but it was too short for my taste. i wish it had more of a tale and that the conflict wasnt resolved in (seriously) 4 pages. had alot of potential left untap, but since this was a continuation to a short story in \\"angel dust apocalypse\\" i dont suppose it was meant to be more than another short story with the same character."},{"Title":"Extinction Journals","review":"this bizzaro book will keep you reading and you can finish it easyily within an hour or so. coat of cockroaches eating the president and talking to the rapture about what to do next now that no one is left. cool read, better get a couple of more because this one wont last long"},{"Title":"Extinction Journals","review":"So this book was not quite what I imagined. A very short little novel, about the end of the world, and surviving by wearing a suit made from roaches. I like strange, but even to me this was out there. Just not for me, I could have easily skipped it."},{"Title":"Extinction Journals","review":"I've read Jeremy Robert Johnson's earlier work and, though while I've found many of his stories very entertaining, his writing remains bland at best. His style has no real spark to it and reads like a million other things out there. I was hoping that he could improve a little on this with his latest work, Extinction Journals. While his ideas remain fresh as ever, his writing remains unchanged. Also, while the story begins out strong with many possible directions it could go, halfway through it seems like he grew bored with the current story and rushed toward the ending. That's why I only give this three stars and I recommend reading Extinction Journals because I still haven't lost all my faith in JRJ quite yet. Hopefully future works will show much more promise."},{"Title":"Extinction Journals","review":"Absolute rubbish. I can't understand the positive reviews and multiple stars. This book had no story line and no ending. I feel sorry for the tree that was cut down to make this waste of time. What's worse, I actually ordered this book from a store and am unable to return it. It will definitely be sold at my next garage sale.The main character has no depth whatsoever and the plot goes no where painfully slowly. The idea of creating a suit to withstand the end of the world actually had potential, but tragically this novel does not work."},{"Title":"Extinction Journals","review":"This is hilarious. The satire in this novelette is biting & caustic as it should be. You don't have to be an ikthyologist to enjoy the level of \\"racism\\" displayed by the bugs as they connect to the humans. Are we really so small minded, the readers are forced to ask themselves. The answer should be obvious."},{"Title":"Extinction Journals","review":"Like Jeremy Robert Johnson, I seem to have a fascination with the apocalypse. Thus Extinction Journals slots into the bookshelf alongside J.G. Ballard's Hello America, Denis Johnson's Fiskadoro, Jonathan Lethem's Amnesia Moon. Phiip K. Dick's Dr Bloodmoney and Cormac McCarthy's The Road. As a stylist he's not up there with Ballard or McCarthy but Journals is a rip-roaring read infused with both dread and humor. If I have a complaint it is simply that it is too damn short."},{"Title":"Extinction Journals","review":"...is the life of a man wearing twinkies meets a man wearing a suit of cockroaches. It warmed my heart to read who got eaten. (You must buy the book to find out.) JRJ has become THE author to watch on my 'authors-to-watch' list. This was my first contact with his work, and I've read it at least four or five times since. I've loaned it out to friends (it's on loan as I write this review, as a matter of fact,) and I've told nearly everyone I know who would be interested in this book. So, I'm telling you, too. Buy it!PS-The fact that he is closely associated with The Mars Volta is synchronicity at its best for me as well."},{"Title":"Extinction Journals","review":"A truly original story, from a fresh voice in fiction. A must-read for any readers looking for something new."},{"Title":"Extinction Journals","review":"\\"Extinction Journals\\" picks up where the \\"The Sharp Dressed Man At the End of the Line\\" leaves off. For those of you unfamiliar with that story, it can be found in Mr. Johnson's short story collection, \\"Angel Dust Apocalypse.\\" Without giving too much away, we meet Dean in the last days before World War III, a young man who believes that he can survive the aftermath of a nuclear war if he's wearing a suit made of cockroaches. As the story ends, Dean is proved correct.\\"Extinction Journals\\" follows Dean around as he makes his way through the nuclear bomb ravaged wasteland of what was once the USA. He struggles to find food and water, all the while wondering if his \\"suit\\" will, out of desperation and hunger, turn on him. Along the way, he meets a new god, borne out of mankind's collective unconscious. Neither Dean nor the reader is sure whether or not he's hallucinating, but considering he just survived a nuclear war we have to give him some leeway.Ultimately, Dean meets other entomologically enlightened individuals who are struggling to put some sense to this brave new world. At that point, they must decide how life will exist, post-humanity, or if it will exist at all.JRJ has a knack for characterization, even if those characters are a bit twisted. Dean is a nice enough guy, but one has to really be out there to conceive of fashioning a suit out of cockroaches in order to survive a nuclear war. And JRJ's descriptions of the nuclear wasteland are convincingly real, making you shudder (and question Dean's desire to live to see it).The story was way too short. While readers don't need to be familiar with the short story that preceded this novella, it definitely helps. Adding it as a preface, while driving up the publishing costs, would have enhanced the reading experience for new readers of JRJ's work.I also had a feeling of repetition between Dean's encounters. It was as if he were stumbling upon the same old irradiated buildings he wandered into earlier.Lastly, I was hoping for more of an exploration of the relationship between Dean and his suit. I really couldn't get the sense that the symbiosis between man and roach was evolving until the very end. Maybe evolution itself works like that. Rather than gradual changes, we get abrupt \\"do or die\\" situations.While I enjoyed this book, I feel that, for the reasons stated above, it falls a little short of JRJ's previous works. Newcomers should pick up his earlier works first before coming here. Fans of JRJ's work will still want to add this to their collections."},{"Title":"Extinction Journals","review":"This was the first book by Jeremy Robert Johnson I ever read, and it made me a fan.There's been a nuclear holocaust and Dean believes he is the lone survivor. Of course there's a lot of radiation around, so Dean needs to protect himself from the environment by wearing a suit of living cockroaches. This makes for a pretty surreal existence, but author Johnson grounds the story with Dean's ruminations on lonliness, and his quest for connection in this burned out world.He eventually finds a companion- a woman who has survived with the help of her suit of living ants. They also meet an alien god thing, and someone who doesn't wish them well at all. For all its weirdness, it's a very humane story about a cataclysmic ending and a strange new birth. It's savage and crazy and also touching and emotional.I recommend this book to adventurous fans of science fiction that want to take a journey outside the box."},{"Title":"Extinction Journals","review":"This book was written as a follow up to a short story published inAngel Dust Apocalypse. I purchased it a few months ago and kept putting it aside, I found it in my bookcase last week and am so glad with my choice. Another off-beat page turner by Johnson. A little more sci-fi than I was expecting, but I give extra props to his sense of humor with the book's post-apocolyptic setting. Overall a fun short read for someone looking for something different!"},{"Title":"Extinction Journals","review":"Take the old adage, \\"Only cockroaches will survive a nuclear war\\", and build a unique, hilarious, disturbing, and surreal apocalypse story around it. That is what Jeremey Robert Johnson has done. Interesting from beginning to end, Johnson's 'Extinction Journals' takes you on a strange but thought provoking ride through a nuclear wasteland and though I enjoyed the book very much, I feel, as many other reviewers have stated, that this story had so much more potential for a fully engrossing sci-fi drama but fell a little short. That aside, I can still appreciate the work and always wish for more. Highly Recommended!!"},{"Title":"Extinction Journals","review":"If you're looking for a quick tasty treat, go for this. I figured that armageddon would be sad, but I forgot how funny it would be. Plus, politicians get what they deserve."},{"Title":"Extinction Journals","review":"It's one thing to be weird. Anyone can do it. Except maybe Will Smith or Ben Affleck. They are both just too damn white. However, it is a whole other thing to be weird and make it entertaining, enthralling even. Few people can take a suit of cockroaches, God (maybe), and an ant queen (kind of), throw them into a post apocalyptic setting and have it form a consistently entertaining AND coherent whole. Johnson does just that. Bravo, sir, bravo."},{"Title":"Extinction Journals","review":"Extinction Journals is probably the most creative tale to come out of this recent explosion of post-apocaylptic literature. Did you like the heart in The Road by Cormac Mccarthy? Well this story has plenty of heart and a survival suit constructed of cockroaches that has plenty of sci-fi authors scratching their heads and wondering why they didn't think of it first.In this tale Dean and his suit of cockroaches make a weary trek across a post-apocaalytic American wasteland. Dean struggles to find food for himself as well as for his suit and encounters exsitential lonliness all along the way. He also encounters people who had similiar ideas for suits including, the president in a Twinkie suit, someone wearing a suit of cinder blocks, and black guy wearing other people's skin, to name a few. None of these suits really worked so well. He eventually meets a woman with a similiar suit made of insects. The ending is a surreal and hopeful one for not only the audience, but the protagonist as well, considering the hopelessness he faced along his journey.Jeremy Robert Johnson is a great writer and a figurehead in the Bizarro scene. I'm personally looking forward to reading more from him."},{"Title":"Extinction Journals","review":"Visceral. Weird. Cerebral. Unique. Bizarre. No, you can't pick just one because this book is all of them and more. Do you want to read great science fiction? This book is for you. Are you an academic looking for an entertaining deconstruction/critique of society's relationship with deities and with itself? Buy this right now. Is bizarro the genre that toots your horn? Extinction Journals has to be in your collection or you can't say you like the genre. Are you tired of the bland, talentless writers flooding the market nowadays? Don't fret: Jeremy Robert Johnson is here to rescue you with a short blast of top-notch literature.Extinction Journals tells the story of Dean, a man who survived the nuclear holocaust thanks to a customized business suit he coated in cockroaches. With everyone else dead, Dean is forced to deal with his loneliness, fear, beings coming down from the sky and the physical effects of a radiated atmosphere. As if all that wasn't enough, the cockroach suit, which Dean has to take care of when it comes to water and food, starts developing a collective mind of its own.JRJ's prose is brutally poetic, technically impressive, and wildly entertaining. The only flaw you'll find in this tome is its length. You'll want much more of Johnson's work when you're done with this, so go ahead and buy We Live Inside You as well. You won't regret it."},{"Title":"Extinction Journals","review":"Extinction Journals by Jeremy Robert Johnson is a very cool post-apocalyptic piece of bizarro fiction. It's about this guy named Dean who makes himself a suit of cockroaches. This enables Dean to be one of the few who survive the nuclear holocaust that follows.Dean meets some other strange people in his ruined world. He meets (and his suit eats) the President, who survived by wearing a suit made out of Twinkies. Then he meets Yahmuhwesuh, who is an avatar of the collective unconsciousness that has been incarnated as a result of the nuclear destruction. Somehow, Yahmuhwehsus gives Dean the ability to communicate with his roaches, and Dean sets out on a journey for survival.I really enjoyed this one. It's a great, exciting read. And it's funny, which is always a plus with me. While I really loved it, I will point out that it is contained in The Bizarro Starter Kit (Orange), which is actually cheaper than the individual volume, so it would probably be better to get that instead."},{"Title":"Extinction Journals","review":"In a much cooler high school than one I've gone to, Jeremy Robert Johnson's,Extinction Journalswould be required reading in Biology 101.Who is Dean? He is one of very few survivors in the post apocalyptic D.C. area, and he relies solely on his suit of cockroaches to keep him alive and unaffected by the radiation that threatens him. A little self-deprecating and surprisingly very level-headed despite his ever- constant nagging conscious, Dean should consider himself a hell of a lot better off than he thinks he is.As Dean begins to gain confidence, encountering along the way compassion, love, and a uniquely powerful foe, JRJ's writing alternates between strange, yet witty and humorous, and tender, due oddly to some highly evolved insects. He dissects the basic view of the human condition and inserts the primitive, rather other-worldly nature of a different species, fusing a vision that is at first frightening and then harmonious.At first I stumbled a bit over JRJ's usage of words separated/by/a/forward/slash that dotted the prose, yet I came to understand it as an important and distinctive concept for the journal. Not having read anything else by JRJ, I don't know if this is a usual trait or used only in the Journals. Either way, it seems to say that one word would not do, and to find that it is thrown in sparingly made me anticipate it happening again.Somewhat strange and riddled with over-powering elements of doom,Extinction Journalsis a random thought-provoking, highly intelligent read."},{"Title":"Extinction Journals","review":"A man traveling through an apocalyptic landscape by way of his custom, living cockroach suit, after said suit has devoured the President?

And I was immediately, irrevocably hooked.\\"Extinction Journals\\" is the continuation of a short story from his collection, \\"Angel Dust Apocalypse\\" (which is also a fantastic read, fwiw) entitled 'The Sharp Dressed Man at the End of the Line.'A man, Dean, encased in a suit made of cockroaches, finds his way in a just-after-nuclear-war world. While the man himself doesn't exactly \\"grow,\\" in the traditional protagonist fashion, his suit does, becoming gradually self-aware. And then they meet a woman covered in ants...I have long been a fan of post-apocalyptic fiction, and Johnson delivers something different in a scintillating package. \\"Extinction Journals\\" covers most of the traditional tropes, but in a new, surreal, and utterly enjoyable way; much like Palahniuk. There is something of Pat Frank's paranoia, Palahniuk's execution, and Matheson's slanted view here.It may not be to everybody's tastes, as the variety of reviews here show, but you can't deny his writing prowess. He is clearly a unique and powerful voice. So, come on in, and let a little insect sex into your life."},{"Title":"Extinction Journals","review":"Jeremy Robert Johnson's novella Extinction Journals opens with a man in a suit made of cockroaches eating the President--who is in a suit made out of Twinkies. And if that's not a great scene for the first sentence to describe, I don't know what is.Extinction Journals is an awesome survivalist story that at times seems to have been written under the influence of something illicit, but manages to find a common ground between genre conventions and the call of surrealism. The best thing about this book is the juxtaposition of relatively normal survivalist scenes and the surreal conversations that turn up with the people and creatures our protagonist comes across.And boy are those some great scenes! I'm not going to give spoilers, but when the collective unconsciousness of the human race comes up, pissed that the people he represents are dead, I was happy. Things were good in my life right then. It's like a perfect fusion of man and insect. Maybe it does get a little rushed towards the end with the creation of a villain late in the story, but the ride to get there isn't hurt in any way."},{"Title":"Extinction Journals","review":"Interesting post-apocalyptic novella about a man who survives a nuclear holocaust by wearing a suit of cockroaches.

The review is for the value of the information in the book. This is a very helpful book for Christians who are struggling with questions and looking for answers that may not be readily available in church dogma. I found it a valuable addition to my library of spiritual books. Read it for yourself and see if it doesn't speak to something in you. Incidentally, Kim Michaels still posts the dictations from Ascended Masters on his website for anyone to read for free. You can see for yourself by visiting his AskRealJesus website."},{"Title":"I Am a Thinking Christian","review":"This author has much to say about eliminating the \\"sacred cows\\" that hold back many Christians from questioning their faith and growing in their understanding of God. This is good stuff and should be read and considered.However Mr. Michaels's secondary goal of bringing Christianity and materialist science together by simultaneously slaying the \\"sacred cows\\" of science falls flat. From the first mention of science Mr. Michaels paints science as being on a mission to disprove the existence of God. In reality material science doesn't care one way or the other whether God exists but he insists on an ad hominem attack painting scientists as some evil cabal out to murder God. The book's discussion of scientific theories starts out amateurish then quickly devolves into a stale argument in favor of intelligent design with Mr Michaels lining up the science straw men of the big bang, evolution, etc. so he can punch and kick his way through these \\"holy cows\\" that science supposedly clings to in fear. I read half-way through and couldn't stomach any more of the same ID arguments I've read before. Is this really what a \\"Thinking Christian\\" is supposed to...\\"think\\"?What struck me about this book is that when discussing theology Mr. Michaels has many good rational points about letting go of literal interpretations of the bible and considering that perhaps your tiny slice of the religious pie is not the *only* way to salvation. But when he starts discussing science he falls off a precipice of logic into an abyss of ignorance. Not only are the scientific theories presented poorly but so are the counter-arguments. They expose Mr. Michaels's utter lack of understanding of the subjects he is discussing. Mr. Michaels, I agree with you that science has been up-ended before by new theories (from Einstein and others) and it will, no doubt, happen again in the future. But that theory, the one that will up-end science once more, it will not be Intelligent Design. I'm sorry.For a much richer take on this subject let me suggest _Evolution of Faith_ by Phillip Gulley. Much smarter discussion of this subject matter in my opinion."},{"Title":"I Am a Thinking Christian","review":"This book was very helpful for my spiritual Path. I often post a link to it in Christian and Spiritual forums when people are confused about the conflicts of the age of reason and the past doctrines that simply don't make sense.

In the Afterword the author provides many of her sources which would make excellent follow up reading. Also included are photos pertinent to the period.

Beaulieu and his Boston and Maine Railroad","review":"This book covers in a unique way the period when railroads were still making the transition from a ubiquitous public carrier to a limited market high volume transportation mechanism (one that the Boston and Maine never fully made). It was a period of optomism that technology and good management could change things even in the face of the decline of the New England mill economy.But this is no dry economic tome. Neal covers the Boston and Maine through a series of vignettes of the diverse work force that keeps a railroad going. Each is interesting and well written. With a perspective of 50 years in the future we can see Neal was overoptomistic and maybe not challenging enough at times, but book freezes a railroad in time in a manner which can sustain multiple readings. My dog eared copy is a prized treasure."},{"Title":"High green and the Bark Peelers;: The story of Engineman Henry A. Beaulieu and his Boston and Maine Railroad","review":"High Green and the Bark Peelers is an absolute must to read for anyone interested in the history and operation of the Boston and Maine Railroad. With permission of the railroad, Neal was able to travel around and capture the every day life on a New England transportation icon. The railroad was so impressed with his work that they too advertised the tome all over their system. A very rare wall poster for the book hangs in my own den and may be the only remaining example. Fortunately, the book is not too hard to find as it was popular enough to warrant two printings and also the railroad donated free copies to any library that requested one. Though the work is un-illustrated, Neal's writings form a clear snapshot of what it was like to work in various departments of the B&M in the late 1940's. It was moments frozen in time for all to remember. Neal's work was so good that other railroads soon stepped up to the plate for similar works. However, personal issues engulfed the man at home and soon after he took his own life in a tragic ending to his own story. Only High Green remains today as a testimony of the man."},{"Title":"Henry's List of Wrongs","review":"Novelists should be daunted by moments when a character describes his feelings. Shepherd, however, has the worst debriefing habit I've ever seen. Characters often discuss a scene that has just passed before readers' eyes, gambling that what the character says will align with what the reader feels. In this novel, people often say how much they were moved. What happens, however, if the reader wasn't, or, worse, if the scene before left the reader flat? In Shepherd's novel, we are supposed to believe in Henry's transformation. Through righting a list of wrongs, Henry \\"The Assassin\\" Chase is supposed to rediscover the idealist he once was. It's a fun premise, but for me the \\"supposed to\\" was its most vivid element. I never reacted as Shepherd thought I should, and who moves a reader by proffering he or she ought to react?"},{"Title":"Henry's List of Wrongs","review":"The book starts off well enough, but after the prologue, it goes waaaay downhill. If I hadn't lived in Kansas (where a lot of the book takes place) I would have put the book down after the first couple of chapters. It's painfully obvious the author wants this to be a movie - why he didn't simply write a screenplay, I'll never know. I expected the words &quot;extreme close-up&quot; to pop up any second. The dialogue is mostly fluff and cliche, and the characters are stock. The &quot;guy who lost his heart&quot; meets &quot;the wacky girl&quot; and blah blah blah. &quot;Wacky Girl&quot; has a past, which takes the reader all of 5 seconds to figure out. The reader can't help but picture Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock or Sarah Jessica Parker saying these lines (and that's exactly what Shepherd wants you to do). If this was only a movie, and I saw it, I would have found it mildly amusing. Since it was a book, I simply found it completely annoying. Apparently, this book is going to be a movie soon (there's a schocker). But with &quot;Life Or Something Like It&quot; failing at the box office, I can't help but see this one doing the same. Save your money, and check it out at your local library."},{"Title":"Henry's List of Wrongs","review":"I finished this book, threw it across the room and yelled a swear.It's drivel based soley on melodrama that really goes no where. No hurtle is crossed, nothing is lost, and nothing is really at risk. The guy is a jerk, he decides not to be a jerk (a big step) and goes about doing it. In the process of not being a jerk, he's a jerk. Everyone forgives him with almost no resentment or question, and we are supposed to be moved by this? Bugger off!"},{"Title":"Henry's List of Wrongs","review":"WOW.....it's great to see a book written with such verbal skill. John says with a sentence what many authors waste pages attempting to do. He writes with the assumption that his readers can grasp the picture, the scene, and the characters without pounding them with excess words. It's a confidence in his readers' intelligence that I appreciate. I enjoyed this first book by JSS from the first word to the last - it's hard to put down, and I love books like that. He leads us down the path of disastrous mistakes that a young Henry makes in the name of love, and then throws us onto the road to redemption filled with intrigue, mystery, love, and second chances. Henry is a fast and memorable read - you'll love it! What a great first book.....keep them coming!"},{"Title":"Henry's List of Wrongs","review":"I'd like to say some good things about this work given that it's written by a local author, but Henry's List of Wrongs doesn't offer me any reasons to do so. This book reads like a bad first novel, one that should have been shoved in the back of the top desk drawer and left alone. The characters are completely two-dimensional. I didn't believe in Sophie at all, and Henry's transformation from a basically good and hard-working high school kid to total corporate shark is impossible to comprehend; at least, the author never develops the character enough so that we accept the change. Much of the dialogue here is clunky and unrealistic. That astounds me, because in places the novel appears to have been constructed in sort of a \\"screenplay ready\\" format. You could almost write in \\"cue the score\\" or plan a laughtrack moment in places. At least one of the chapters feels added on (the second scene featuring Henry, Sophie, and the girlfriend that Henry dumped after he made into a highly-coveted fraternity at his university). I grow increasingly tired of modern novelists who have to use the tired pop-culture references as short cuts to character and scene description, especially the hackneyed use of Tom Cruise, Marilyn Monroe, etc. This novel has been purported to be about how men really think and feel, but at its core it reads like another Danielle Steel weeper, only with basketball references. *** Not recommended ***. And if this is the best of what's out there in fiction for men these days, you'll find me back with the Chilton's car manuals and woodworking books, thank you very much."},{"Title":"Henry's List of Wrongs","review":"I will start this review by saying that the dust jacket claims that Mr. Shepherd writes his book in the attic of the home he shares with his wife, while in his Acknowledgements, the author claims that he writes in his basement. I know. This seems mundane and trivial, but I believe this silly little discrepancy is like a billboard for everything that's wrong with the book. Mr. Shepherd can't decide which is cooler: the attic or the basement.Because this book is all about cool. Consider this phrase from the novel's opening line: \\"brain belch of accidental brilliance\\". Apart from being an inherent contradiction in terms, this phrase also sums up much of what's wrong with Mr. Shepherd's prose. He can't decide what to say or how to say it.There are parts that are undeniably well written -- a paragraph here, a line there -- but there are also times where the novel actually repeats itself and its descriptions. Likewise, the tone varies from the hip and tongue-in-cheek voice of a ne'er-do-well to the lofty proclomations of a formal, literary narrator. Again, the author doesn't know what to sound like. While the basic premise is moderately intriguing, it is made monotonous and trite by this uneven writing and the unsalvagable dialogue. Every character sounds the same: like the confused, yet pleased-with-himself author.And finally, the premise, I said, was intriguing, but the story is absolutely ridiculous. Sure, Mr. Shepherd has captured high school's idiosyncracies quite well (in addition to his own distaste for teenagers), but the tale just doesn't hang on these well-written backdrops with anything close to approaching believability. Henry's experiences with the Girl of His Dreams, his reasons for becoming the Assassin, his reasons for writing The List, well, it's all melodramatic sophism, and it plays out weakly.Ignore this pretentious and contrived first novel of \\"redemption.\\" Instead, check out Invisible Monsters or Motherless Brooklyn."},{"Title":"Henry's List of Wrongs","review":"Henry Chase is from Kansas - a shy boy who loves the most beautiful girl in school. He turns into a Wall Street tycoon years after she has broken his heart and returns to Wichita to show her what she missed. Instead, Sophie Reilly takes him on a journey to purge his past transgressions and start over. Along the way, he falls in love with her and in the end, saves her just as much as he is saved.A man wrote this book, so there is no time wasted on cheesy romance - which I truly appreciated! I didn't like that everyone seemed so capable of forgiving his evil ways. He plowed through 6 in a long weekend for Pete's sake!!! But, it was a nice touch that Elizabeth popped back into the picture in the end and Henry got to make the real choice to be with Sophie."},{"Title":"Henry's List of Wrongs","review":"I really loved this book (I know I didn't give it 5 stars, but that is because it was a little too hollywood). It got me. The opening chapters, the part about Henry's teen life are so dead on that I still can't believe it. The book has a silly premise, but Shepard himself knows that. It works the vast majority of the time. It is quick and sweet read. My biggest complain is the subplot of Sophie's secret past. It is a little too much. The reality of it seemed a bit cartoonish and ended too neatly. Still, the rest of the book works. I was surprised by the ending and enjoyed it. It made me laugh (particularly the line about Starsky and Hutch from the Nigerian grad student at the college) and made me a bit misty. It ain't perfect, but it sure is sweet. It seems Jim Carrey will starring in the movie. Perfect."},{"Title":"Henry's List of Wrongs","review":"This book pisses me off - that it had to end, that is. I've read my share of works by friends and strangers, published and non, but I've never been anything like this tickled before. What a wonderful creation.The back cover blurbs were too tepid. Swear to God, this is a Monster good book. And fer Chrissake, it will actually make A Difference in the world. After reading this book, people are gonna THINK about redemption. Some people are actually gonna try to make the world a better place, I'm sure of it. But forget the &quot;message,&quot; what about the story? The story is great. I read this baby with my heels dragging furrows and my fingernails scritching the walls, trying to avoid ripping through it all in one sitting, to keep it slow so I could savor every brilliant nuance.I read a helluva lot and this was the best read in a LONG time, delight after delight. From the Dept. of Trite But True: I laughed, I cried. (But mostly laughed.)Lest I sound too Pollyanna, I'll close with a bloody, heartfelt critique: As noted in the Acknowledgments, apparently Mr. Shepherd spends time with family and friends and does, in fact, have a life outside writing. And that's just wrong... when he could otherwise be spending every waking minute concocting his next sparkling masterpiece.Pick up at least one copy, you'll be loaning this one out. And Mr. Shepherd? Take a bow, man."},{"Title":"Henry's List of Wrongs","review":"Sometimes God just hands you one - as John Scott Shepherd does with this masterful job of telling the story of Henry's wheeling, dealing business prowess and his repentence. &quot;Henry's List of Wrongs&quot; is extremely well written, enjoyable to read, and a gripping protrait of Henry's deals and business philosophy."},{"Title":"Henry's List of Wrongs","review":"This writer is based in Kansas City and this is his first novel. If he had waited 20 years to explore the same idea, I probably would give it five stars instead of four, because the concept he explores is so profound, I think it takes a heap of life experience to do it full justice. Still, it's a fine achievement Mr. Shepherd has produced. His hero, Henry Chase, is 27. As a teen, his life was difficult and he suffered a psychic wound to his heart and ego which led him to become a callous S.O.B., but a financially successful one. He cheats and lies and intimidates and seduces and dumps people to get ahead, and it works great for his first six years out of college. Then he has a moral crisis, and with the help of a mysterious, seemingly wise woman, Henry decides the only way out is to borrow one of AA's 12 steps and try to make amends. He and Sophie, the mentor/shrink/antagonist/love object who spoke up just in time for Henry to decide to live, journey from Wichita to Philly to NYC and back again. Henry seeks forgiveness, sometimes gets it, sometimes gets punched. Sophie has surprising secrets of her own, and in the end, needs the new Henry to try to save her. I needed 60 pages before I knew I would stay to the finish, but I am glad I did. Not every encounter with Henry's victims is credible in all aspects, but the heart of his efforts has a resonance. There is some humor, and some sensual moments as well, but this is a tale of self-redemption with a little help from a friend. And a tale of some false information and false assumptions and how each leads to both good and not-so-good ends. Call it a coed buddy novel, a road novel, a psychological comedy...there are elements of all those things inside. A love story, too. But if you ever had a parent who drank too much, a friend who betrayed you, a road not taken that turned out for the best, a teen love who spurned you, a parent who died too young, a road taken that turned out for the worst...you will find moments with which to identify in this excellent first fiction from a guy to keep an eye on. John Scott Shepherd could become quite a writer as he journeys on."},{"Title":"Henry's List of Wrongs","review":"The good part of this novel is the plot premise. The idea that someone's life can be changed from a single moment in time to something completely different. Unfortunately instead of exploring something interesting the author John Scott Shepherd randomly shifts views every 15 or 20 pages into something different. While I think this can be effective it is overused by Mr. Shepherd to create a book that becomes almost sterile. The book to me has very fake emotions and becomes almost contrived; you may not know what comes next, but you definitely know that something unexpected is coming. A previous reviewer for Amazon stated it perfectly that this reads like a movie script. However withstanding all of this the book is an Average light read with a good premise, which can be enjoyable sometimes."},{"Title":"Henry's List of Wrongs","review":"Henry's List of Wrongs has a lot of things going for it. The dialogue is quick and full of wit, the pace is steady, and the general acerbity of Shepherd's cast of characters is something often sought after, but rarely achieved in contemporary fiction.However, I find myself thinking that the work could have been much more fulfilling. Shepherd tends to pull out of scenes too soon after their zeniths, leaving his reader satisfied and usually moved, but a bit put off by how quickly the story has changed focus. It almost seems as though Shepherd gets tired of each section before he's taken the opportunity to fully explore it. I also found myself thinking that some of the redemption Henry does find comes a little too easily, as Shepherd tends to rely more on physicality as a sign of wrathful disposition than the thought and dialogue he can clearly write very well if he's so inclined.Nevertheless, I recommend the book. Not only is it a good way to spend a few hours (as it's a beautifully-quick read), it's compelling enough to make you walk around for the next few days wondering what you could do to fix things.Oh, and to those who've purchased the movie rights:Henry - Christian BaleSophie - Sabrina Lloyd"},{"Title":"Henry's List of Wrongs","review":"This book had enough twists and turns to make it fun and interesting.

In a moment of blind panic, Henry Chase realizes that he's done a lot of damage in the past ten years while he tried to make his life something he can flaunt in the face of his high school love. But Henry realizes it's gotten him nowhere. Sophie, a would-be psychologist and part time hotel maid, urges Henry to make a list of the bad things he's done and do his best to correct them.I enjoyed Sophie quite a bit, although she got pretty weird toward the end. Unfortunately for Henry, little revealed in the book shows him as The Assassin, except for his past exploits. I wish there'd been a little more Assassin in Henry throughout the present portion of the book, just for comparison. Besides, he's kind of a spineless wimp, it seems. But, it's a good read otherwise, and the way it is written keeps the reader entertained."},{"Title":"Henry's List of Wrongs","review":"Shepherd's first book was a very good book and a fast read. He keeps you interested with interesting twists and turns and a surprising end. I've read it could become a movie and the plot would make for an interesting movie also.

I look forward to reading John Scott Shepherd's future books."},{"Title":"Henry's List of Wrongs","review":"What a tremendous debut! The author is apparently also a screenwriter, and you can see it in the sizzling dialogue and compelling characters. Henry is a guy who has sacrificed his soul on the alter of dealmaking, and relishes his reputation as &quot;The Assasin,&quot; right up to the morning when his conscience implodes and he meets a most unexpected woman -- a quirky but beautiful muse who comes to him as a chambermaid but turns out to be much more -- whose own past contains a great hidden pain. These two embark upon a quest, and together explore redemption, forgiveness, passion, and even love. Along the way, there's lots of intrigue and lots of mystery, a fistfight in a fountain, a secret sausage pizza, and a couple of Feds in hot pursuit.*I hear they're making this one into a movie, and I can certainly see why. I'm already waiting for Shepherd's second novel. Don't miss &quot;Henry's List of Wrongs.&quot; Tremendous."},{"Title":"Henry's List of Wrongs","review":"When a friend first recommended \\"Henry,\\" I was, to say the least, dubious. It seems like there's an unwritten rule which states that any time a man incorporates romance into a novel, it must be first and foremost, extra special sappy, syrupy, insipid ... and just plain stupid. Henry's List of Wrongs is anything but. It has an edge the likes of which we haven't seen since Jerry MaGuire. It's contemporary, very sexy, and very, very smart. That said; if \\"Henry\\" fails to melt you cold, cynical heart in the first ten pages - as it did mine - it surely will by the last ten. In short, I loved it."},{"Title":"Henry's List of Wrongs","review":"This book reads like a script for a TV show or bad movie. While entertaining at times, nothing stands out. The characters are paper thin and the plot is unbelievable. A guy goes from being a nice kid to a complete a-hole with a killer instinct over the course of ten years and then reverts back to a nice person again in a matter of days. The maid helping him has a surprising past that is not believable at all. I kept waiting for a bombshell to be dropped about who she really is and instead it was a dud. The whole time I read this story I kept thinking about the tv show, my name is earl. Not really an original idea. If you like a quick read that require little thought, then go for it."},{"Title":"Henry's List of Wrongs","review":"I'm currently in the middle of this book and enjoying it thoroughly. The dialogue is dead on and some of the situations are very funny. What I'm getting from this story is that we all should be so lucky to get second chances to make past wrongs right no matter how much we have to \\"suck it up\\" to do it. Henry, \\"The Assassin\\", is a marvelous character once some of the layers are peeled away and Sophie is the friend everyone should have when traveling on the road to redemption even though some of her behavior is pretty disturbing at times. I'm looking forward to finding out what her secrets are. Overall, this is a very funny and very poignant book... a real page turner from me. Also, the acknowledgements in the back are just as hysterical as parts of the story. The author has a wicked sense of humor."},{"Title":"Henry's List of Wrongs","review":"It would be easy to dismiss this book as slick and facile. As others have noted, the plot feels a bit too much like a screenplay, with each madcap complication conveniently, smoothly, and often unconvincingly resolved. However, the relationship between Henry and Sophie is wonderful. The dialog in their scenes together saves the book. It's dead on, witty, sometimes laugh out loud funny, and sometimes very affecting. Sophie saves not only Henry, but the book."},{"Title":"Henry's List of Wrongs","review":"For weeks I was haunted by my chance run in with this book at my local bookstore, the blurb on the dustjacket snagged hold of me and had me thoroughly intrigued.

Its what its all about, and how refreshing it was. I found myself crying, deeply moved, laughing out loud and hating when I had to set it aside.John Scott Shepherd has written a beautiful story that is not only well written and hilarious but so raw and real. It is a refreshing read that will not only entertain but poke and prod your own heart, begging you to take an acount of your own life. Even if the sole objective in approaching this book would be to entertain, it delivers, but whether one expects it or not, it delivers so much more.Anyone who has a heart will love it."},{"Title":"Henry's List of Wrongs","review":"Henry's List of Wrongs is an amazing book!

Just the premise of the book - a man with his housekeeper/psych student (a woman he's attracted to in a way curiously different from any other woman he's known) on a mission to right the wrongs of the past ten years - is intriguing and Shepherd doesn't disappoint: He expertly packages the idea up into a brilliantly wrapped gift that you first savor unwrapping slowly, but then can't help but tear the paper off in a frenzy to see what's inside.At 17, Henry has just let all the \\"bad\\" in his life pile up. It might spoil someone's fun to write what the \\"bad\\" was or to give away too many details so I'll try to refrain. When Henry felt himself die inside, \\"the Assassin\\" is born. The Assassin doesn't literally murder people in a physical way, but he does carelessly do anything in his keenly intelligent imagination possible to wreak havoc on peoples' person lives, stomping dreams in the process.Ten years later, Henry is told something about his past that makes all the devious workings of the Assassin blaringly real and very ugly to him, and he breaks down yet again. Sophie, a housekeeper and psych student who happens to be near him when he realizes what an awful person he's become, helps him to write a list of wrongs and promises to accompany him as he seeks forgiveness for the Assassin's wrongs.This book IS very funny, and sometimes unexpectedly so - it'll make you laugh out loud. It's also sad and mysterious and full of hope, adventure, and about becoming the kind of person one can trust and be proud of. Henry realizes the Assassin doesn't have to be completely assassinated - some of his talents come in use in a positive way when he decides he'll do anything to help Sophie, who has helped him through his List of Wrongs."},{"Title":"The Scholar and the Gypsy","review":"A rare treat. Howard-Johnston (an Oxford Byzantine scholar) and Ryan (a journalist) traipse around (mainly) Armenia in 1988 in search of undiscovered 6th century Byzantine fortresses. Experienced travellers both, and fine writers, their eyes are not simply focussed on Byzantine remains; they offer smart and funny observations of village life, modern Turkish society and its uncomfortable relations Armenia and Kurdistan and, hilariously, each other's idiosyncracies. The result, for anyone interested in Byzantine or Armenian history, is a rich stew of history, geography, and humorous travelogue.The better part of the search takes place in eastern Turkey; however, a short section near the end brings the two to Anakara and the headwaters of the Meander River, Istanbul and, very briely, Bulgaria.Ryan, no Byzantine specialist, tells the tale of how the Scholar drew up an idiot's map for him to follow in their travels, and how easy to use it was. The same map (actually four) are included and are indispensable to following the story. A handful of black and white photos illustrate the text; I could wish for more, but they are sufficient.Howard-Johnston, clearly an expert on the strategic geography of the region, is not above recording his surprise at gaining new insights from actually travelling through landscapes that force him to rethink earlier conceptions. That's refreshing.If you enjoyed John Ash's Byzantine Journey, you'll enjoy The Scholar and the Gypsy."},{"Title":"Clever Girl","review":"\\"Clever Girl\\" (a pretty generic title, considering the tone and subject matter of the book) details protagonist Sarah Clevtoe's struggles to be a functioning person after suffering multiple sexual abuses early in her life. The story begins during her adolescence, an already confusing time for most kids without the added weight of being used as a communal blow-up doll by her fellow classmates. She goes on to become a good student, but fails to excel or even do a fair job at cultivating a career or a relationship not based on her acquiescence to filthy sexual desires of various loser men. I won't give away what happens after Sarah's ugly behavior on a train, but suffice it to say that the book loses any charm or depth it had in order to drag the reader down beyond any capacity to like, feel sorry for, or even care about what happens to its main character. Likewise, despite the considerable reasons for her low-self esteem and worth, though, it's hard to relate on any level to Sarah for any length of time as her narration is swollen with self-pitying helplessness, and an endless number of overly wordy yet totally unnecessary descriptive passages.The thing is, Tania Glyde is a gifted writer. It's clear that she is talented and has a knack for colorful prose, but again, its over-usage brings the book down, like she (Glyde) is trying way too hard to prove how big her considerable vocabulary is. On top of that, the sexual subject matter, while potentially riveting just becomes stale, predictable and even downright gross at some points--and I am really not a prude. I can count on less than one hand the number of books I've found completely repugnant with little to no redeeming factor and this is at the top of the list. At one point I physically gagged (what about? Let's just say it involves the attempted self-diagnosis of a nasty female problem through ridiculous and unrealistic means).Honestly, I could go on and on about the problems I had with this book, but instead I'll just leave it at this: read it if you are in the mood to be depressed, disgusted, disturbed AND confused--the ending is an incomprehensible mess designed to shock and awe the reader but instead just leaves you relieved the dreck is finally over.The first star is for the respect I have for any author's hard work, no matter how I feel about the end product; the second because Tania Glyde's talent for words is apparent despite the fact she tried way too hard to convey the beauty of such an ugly story."},{"Title":"The Boy Who Picked the Bullets Up","review":"Labelled &quot;fiction,&quot; this book has a hair-raising feel of the author having been there...in that war we remember as Vietnam. &quot;Gripping&quot; is an understatement, as the narrator (a young Marine medic) whipsaws schizophrenically between loving men's bodies while on R &amp; R and working frantically to heal men's mutilated bodies while on duty. Among the war memoirs with gay themes that I've read, I rank it #2 after T.E. Lawrence's &quot;Seven Pillars of Wisdom.&quot; The book also leaves one with a realization that all the current hoohah about &quot;gays in the military&quot; is peacetime mickey-mouse. In wartime, it seems that the brass don't care who sleeps with whom, as long as the troops get the job done. This searingly honest and uncomfortably original novel deserves to be back in print and made into a film."},{"Title":"The Boy Who Picked the Bullets Up","review":"\\"The Boy Who Picked the Bullets Up,\\" by Charles Nelson, is a novel that follows the military and sexual adventures of Kurt Strom, a gay professional baseball player who serves as a U.S. Navy hospital corpsman with Marines during the Vietnam War. The story is told in a series of letters from Kurt to his loved ones. Through Kurt's letters, the reader follows him from his family home in Louisiana to training at Camp Lejeune and to the war zone in Vietnam.Kurt's Vietnam service includes time at both a hospital and with a front-line unit, as well as duty with a special unit designed to work with local Vietnamese militia and civilians. These diverse experiences result in a rich and complex set of encounters with both U.S. military personnel and Vietnamese people. The story offers a fascinating look at the various levels of the U.S. military presence in Vietnam.This is a big, bawdy, outrageous novel that reeks with the smells of sex and violence. Kurt himself is a fascinating and very \\"politically incorrect\\" character. He is certainly no noble poster boy for gays in the military. On the contrary, he is lusty and sexually aggressive--just the type of amoral predator that inspires antigay fear. He also has a nasty racist streak that comes out in the form of many foul slurs and slams. Kurt's language is richly spiced with many cultural references, both \\"high\\" and \\"pop\\"--this, combined with his frequent Wildean comments, gives the book a remarkable flavor.Through his protagonist, Nelson delves into the psychology of both military homophobia and military homoeroticism. It's an unflinching and sometimes graphic look at male-on-male sexuality in a wartime environment. The sex in the book is at times a site of abuse, dishonesty, and conflict. Nelson also rubs the reader's face mercilessly in the horror of war, with graphic accounts of nightmarish deaths and disfiguring injuries. The book also gives often revolting details on such medical procedures as changing a colostomy bag.\\"Boy\\" attains a genuine epic sweep without losing an intimate human focus. In its relentless satiric and comic vision, together with the outsider perspective of its protagonist, the book reminds me somewhat of Ralph Ellison's classic \\"Invisible Man.\\" Indeed, as a gay military man Kurt is a different sort of \\"invisible man.\\" Furthermore, the level of detail in the book gives it a feel of authenticity comparable to that of some of the gripping Vietnam War memoirs I have read. Both horrifying and hilarious, this book radically expands the canons of both gay male fiction and Vietnam War literature."},{"Title":"The Boy Who Picked the Bullets Up","review":"This is a powerful novel that starts out very mildly and picks up to the point where the narrator's experiences in Vietnam are seen in a poignant and humanitarian light.

Of course, it can be read on many levels ncluding a serious critique of the racism and inhumanity of the American troops in the Viet Nam War, but Nelson used the epistolary style to show how American gay men in the seventies compartmentalized their lives. The protagonst, Kurt. has revealed (\\"is out\\") his sexual orientation only to his gay friend Paul. Only to Paul can he write about his full personhood including his very joyous sexual seductions. To his other three correspondents, famly members and a close heterosexual friend, he writes as if he were a straight man. He wrtes dutifully about the horrors of being a medic at war. Nelson wanted to show the devastation on an individual caused by the forced compartmentalization (I have correspondence with him which states that as his goal.) Today we might describe Kurt as being in the closet, but actually it is society that has locked Kurt in. He can have sex with other soldiers; he just can't say he is gay. He can't even consider a relationship. Naturally he is filled with anger and hate which explodes manly in his racism. No other contemporary American gay novel reveals such an insight into the life of a gay man at that time."},{"Title":"The Boy Who Picked the Bullets Up","review":"To say that this book is both a powerful story about war and a great erotic novel is to risk masking it as some hack's attempt at gravitas.

I was in my early twenties then, I'm in my midforties now. Although stripping wasn't an ideal job, I got just about exactly what I wanted out of it. Now I have a miraculous career as a cabaret and burlesque performer and teacher, and I always want to pay homage to my roots in the adult entertainment industry.Being involved with this book was an amazing experience. As an activist and out stripper I've been interviewed and photographed and handled by the media a bit, and Marilyn was scrupulously honest and respectful with all of us. I was thrilled with the results when I saw the book, and it means a lot to me that the women I worked with in that era are represented so simply and clearly and realistically. The pictures tell stories words just can't.I'm writing this review very late in the game, considering how long ago the book was published, but I just wanted to take a minute to give Marilyn props for being an ethical documentarian. A lot of them aren't."},{"Title":"Dancing Naked in the Material World","review":"Marilyn Futterman is a photographer and this is largely a book of her photographs. Almost every other page contains a photograph or photographs and most of them are of women dancers in revealing costumes. Yet seldom are the pictures eroticized. They are documentary in nature. All are black-and-white and many use available light. Other were taken with on-camera flash, and still others were taken in a studio setting.The text accompanying the pictures are the dancers own words. They talk about why they do this work and how they feel about dancing and the customers they dance for. Some are more articulate and insightful than others, but all are thoughtful and personal.The book ends with an article, \\"Stripping for a Living,\\" by Dr. Jacqueline Boles, a Sociology professor. It describes the history and current setting of nude dancing in American society. All in all, this is a well-conceived and executed documentary on an occupation halfway between entertainer and sex worker. It is a great book for anyone who has wondered about the women who dance in these clubs."},{"Title":"Dancing Naked in the Material World","review":"The stories told in this book are somewhat interesting and well written, but they are all basically the same. The book seems to go in no particular direction. It contains interviews with various stripppers, but it leaves alot of questions unanswered."},{"Title":"Dancing Naked in the Material World","review":"...and filled with dreams whose denouncements never quite arrive by closing time.\\" It is an environment where \\"it is sometimes difficult to tell prey from predator.\\" Marilyn Suriani Futterman is a photographer, who decided to become a waitress in one of the strip clubs in Atlanta, in order to befriend and photograph the various strippers who worked in clubs such as the Clermont Lounge, the Tattletale and the Cheetah. Not exactly the high end, as it were, of the entertainment world, or even that particular sub-genre. And she has produced a remarkable book, a wonderful meld of generally empathic photos of the women who take their clothes off for a living, as well as incisive quotes from them on their view of their profession, including the customers.The Clermont Lounge had been there forever (is it still there now?), in the old eponymously named hotel, built in the \`20's or \`30's, on Ponce De Leon Ave. I had driven past it oh so many times, and never ever entered (honest!) as I drove from the \\"North Ave. Trade School\\" (Georgia Tech) to Agnes Scott College, a southern version of one of the \\"Seven Sisters,\\" for the sole purpose of finding a soul mate to discuss 19th Century English literature (OK, not a full and complete disclosure of my intentions). And maybe it was just another version of confusing the predator from the prey. At any rate, somehow it is 1992, Futterman has just published this book, and is holding a signing at the Clermont. It was the perfect excuse to cross one more experience off my list, and many of us, from nearby Inman Park, went, even with spouses. Our local city councilman was there, looking somewhat chagrined, since he appears to have been dragged there by his wife, who was on the Atlanta School Board. Ah, feminist solidarity.Futterman's photos spanned a decade. She seemed to capture the spectrum of women who opted for this livelihood, from the \\"lifers,\\" who hung on for years, and eventually looked, as they say on the farm, \\"rode hard and put up wet.\\" One went on to marry, drive an 18-wheeler, and find Jesus. The lure of good money seems to attract them all, but some were focused, it was a short-term experience to raise tuition money, and they would go on to become hairdressers or nurses. There is a good \\"before and after\\" set of Leslie, first as a stripper in 1984, then as a hairdresser in 1992.There is the mother/daughter combo of \\"GI Jane\\" and Tammy. And there is the incredible sadness in \\"Tracy's\\" eyes. Futterman brings out how it can both be wonderfully ego-fulfilling for the women, being the desire of so many men; but also how the competition with other women can be ego-destroying. Not to mention... the \\"piece of meat\\" degradation.\\"Cheryl\\" projects the most attractive image, both physically, being tall and lean, as well as intellectually. Several of her poems are included. A few excerpts: \\"Well, girls, let me tell you now, There's not a man ever lived worth waiting for, Except perhaps Joseph. And he was cuckolded by God.\\" Or, from her poem, \\"My Sin\\": \\"My sins are aging poorly, Lie an older woman on an urban stoop, Whose dry lips pucker to smoke, Then fall lax to release it...She remembers laughing in a limousine, Full of risk, fleeing dawn, Her men had long legs and wet tongues, And sem*n clean as whiskey...\\"This appears to be the only book that Futterman has ever produced, and that is a shame since she has some very real talent. Our copy is autographed, not only by her, but by a number of the strippers who were there that day. Most telling was the take-off admonition to us from an old country song, by \\"Chelsea's Mom\\": \\"Don't let our daughters grow up to be strippers.\\" 5-stars for the advice, and the book."},{"Title":"Dancing Naked in the Material World","review":"this is an excellent documentary of a variety of strippers spanning a number of years. the pictures are very well done and all of them are evocative. the strippers themselves write commentary about their lives, their work or whatever else pops into their head. it makes for some great and surprising reading. futterman obviously has great empathy for her subjects and this is neccessary in a field where the knee-jerk reaction is limiting stereotypes. i recommend this book as an excellent book for anyone interested in documentaries or strippers."},{"Title":"Dancing Naked in the Material World","review":"I read this book to get an insight on strippers, but I was very disappointed. This books is a photo(black &amp; white) documentary of strippers. It covers interviews about their lives, goals, fears and accomplishments, but it all sounds very repetitive, dry and boring. It seems like most all strippers do it because they have to finance their education, support their children because their spouse left them or they have to support a drug habit.I wish someone would write a book that explains what moral issues(if any) do these women have. How do they justify to their children or loved ones what they do(other than, I was just trying to put food on the table). One of the commandments clearly states that one shall not commit adultry. Promiscuous involvement is covered here. This Commandment definitely says that homosexuality, lesbianism, abortion, pornography, and all promiscuous endeavors of man or woman, have a permissiveness that is against the reason for creating mankind.In the bible, there's a section where God said to Moses, Men and women will have many excuses and will justify their sins against this Commandment. Also, men and women will deliberately attach only specific sins on this Commandment, for shame will make them call this The Hidden Commandment'.I guess that's the biggest question I have, how do these women justify what they do?. I still can't find a book that covers that issue. I have an open mind about pornography and strippers, but I also have many unanswered questions. This book is so much like everything you see in TV documenteries or movies. I found it to bae a waste of time."},{"Title":"Buchanan's Gun","review":"I am a big fan of the Buchanan character of the westerns authored by Jonas Ward, but in this case the complex predicament that Buchanan is placed in is too easy for him to get out of. It begins with a group of cowboys under the command of a crippled rancher named Warrenrode trying to take control of a wagonload of Indian prisoners being transported by a group of the U. S. Cavalry. The cowboys attack the group when the commander refuses to turn their prisoners over to them.One of the prisoners is a chief named Sentos, a man that Buchanan is familiar with. His honor and a few bullets fired his way giving him no choice; Buchanan joins the fight against the ranchers. He is aided by Johnny Reo, a mystery man that adds his gun to the fight against the ranchers, turning the tide against them. During the skirmish, Sentos manages to escape with his only surviving son.Later, Sentos is able to kidnap one of Warrenrode's daughters, so Warrenrode gives Buchanan and Reo an ultimatum. Either agree to rescue his daughter or be killed on the spot. Taking the first option they ride through the desert to where Sentos and a large group of Indians have a permanent base. Significantly outnumbered and outgunned, the action here reminded me of the war television shows where the enemy seems determined to make enough mistakes in order for the \\"good guys\\" to win.Some of the Caucasian characters also challenged for the league lead in dishonorable conduct, willing to do whatever was necessary to gain control of wealth and power. The problem was that they were very ham-handed in their actions and the targets of those actions were a bit too stupid in not seeing what they were up to."},{"Title":"Buchanan's Gun","review":"This western novel in the long running Buchanan series was published in 1968 by Fawcett Publications. The Tom Buchanan books were written by a master of the western pulps and later mass market books, Mr. William R. Cox. As one reviewer noted the \\"novels are noted for their 'pageturner' pace, realistic dialogue, and freqent Colt-and-Winchester gun play.\\"Tom Buchanan's father had been a rancher in West Texas so Tom grew up on a ranch, later becoming the ramrod of a little border ranch. Eventually Tom Buchanan was \\"hiring out his fists and his guns...Thomas MacGrail Buchanan was a long, long way from Alpine, West Texas\\".This book has its setting in the area near Fort Lowell in the heart of Apache country, with the focus of the story on the capture and transport of 4 Apaches to prison. But due to the Warrenrode ranch intervention an army corporal and a couple Apaches are killed, which triggers an eventual reprisal kidnap by the Apaches and deadly chase into the mountains for Tom Buchanan. One of the more interesting features of this story is the time spent within the Apache encampment, at a time of the ceremony of the White Painted Woman or puberty rite for a girl. Tom Buchanan cannot allow this ceremony to go forth to fruition as the girl to be passed through the ceremony is Warrerode's white daughter, Marinda. The Apache chief then plans that Marinda be married to warrior.Though Buchanan and the chief have been friends the village is against Tom, and the chief agrees it would best that he leave. What the chief doesn't realize with Tom's departure, Marinda will go too. And the ensuing chase by angry Apaches over the desert sands back to Warrenrode ranch is something of a shoot out to read. Again, Colt and Winchester westerns by the master western writer, William R. Cox.This well written western reads very well taking the reader back in time to the frontier days of Arizona Territory during the upheaval of the Apache Wars. It is as stated of Mr. Cox's writing: a page turner. And though this reviewer has read many of the Tom Buchanan books this one is right at the top of the list for reader involvement and enjoyment.If you enjoy a good western read or the Tom Buchanan character do not miss this one.Semper Fi."},{"Title":"The Official Parent's Sourcebook on McCune-Albright Syndrome","review":"I am a person with McCune Albright Syndrome (MAS) and I help run a support group of over 700 persons with variations of this disease. I was surprised and pleased to see there was a book on MAS. After reading the \\"Official Parent's Sourcebook on McCune-Albright Syndrome\\" I am somewhat disappointed. The 118 page book has probably less than a dozen pages with any substantive information on MAS. I know of the many questions parents have about MAS because I handle an average of 50 e-mails a week for our support group. This book would answer few of those questions. There is nothing about pain issues which are a major problem for people with MAS, the is no discussion about diagnosis, and there is no information about the special issues realting to MAS and fibrous dysplasia in the skull.On a positive note the Sourcebook does give good information on how to use the internet as a means of searching for information on rare diseases such as MAS. I was glad to see there were references to the MAGIC Foundation and the Paget's Foundation web sites, both excellent sources of information.Searching the internet for \\"fibrous dyspalsia\\" and \\"McCune Albright Syndrome\\" will bring much more substantive information."},{"Title":"The Official Parent's Sourcebook on McCune-Albright Syndrome","review":"My daughter suffers from MAS and I was thrilled to FINALLY find a book that discusses the syndrome.

The essential premise of symbolic interactionism is that all human action is essentially symbolic and that society is to be understood, not as a closed system to be studied in abstraction, but as a network of endless interactions in which human beings symbolically interpret human behavior, speech and thought. Society is the interiorised 'other' or a projected interpretation of societal 'others'. Human self therefore has a free component or I and a bound component or We.This book is an essential reading for whosoever wants to understand sociology and also the departure of Anglo-American sociology from 'society as a system' approaches. And above all it is a timeless classic that you can enjoy reading for the sheer insights it throws into social behavior."},{"Title":"Mind, self, and society from the standpoint of a social behaviorist (His Works)","review":"Until I read Mead's Mind, Self, and Society I couldn't get past mind/body dualism. Great authors rejected it; none, to my limited knowledge, endorsed it. But none were able to convincingly explain it away.Mead, however, though it was not his stated intention, dispels mind/body dualism quite easily. He does so by first giving priority to the organism, something that his contemporary followers, known as symbolic interactionists, seem not to understand.Mead then acknowledges that human beings have a central nervous system possessed of the neurological equipment needed for symbolic functioning, something not shared by other organisms, except in rare instances and in rudimentary form.Beyond that, human beings are actively sensate organisms who participate in social settings where mutually interpretable symbols -- especially in the form of language -- are in routine use. It is in such social settings that we acquire the symbolic wherewithal needed for communication with others and for thinking, an internal conversation that we have with ourselves. It is in such social settings that we acquire an individuated self.When speaking of acquiring language or any other capability, Mead is clearly referring to reorganization of the central nervous system. For Mead, inevitably, that is what learning is, and again we see that he has good reason to give priority to the organism.Mead's take on the concept attitude is especially interesting. He defines an attitude as a repertoire of start-to-finish behaviors which gives value to the environment. A car is a valuable means of transportation if we know how to drive it. Otherwise it's worthless. We need a socially learned repertoire of behaviors to give it value.Mead does not use the term sub-conscious, certainly not in the way that Freud did. Nevertheless, as socially learned behavioral repertoires become automatically responsive to specific stimuli, a richly endowed sub-conscious is created, made manifest through reorganization of the central system. This is the subconscious according to a social behavioristThe first fifty or so pages of Mind, Self, and Society make for difficult reading. After that, however, the material becomes easier, in part because Mead illustrates the same concept again and again in different ways. Each time, it seems, the reader acquires a more subtly nuanced understanding of Mead's ideas.Mead's work is replete with brilliant insights. It deserves reading and re-reading."},{"Title":"Mind, self, and society from the standpoint of a social behaviorist (His Works)","review":"Good compilation of Mead's writings but not for the average reader.

Well now you can find out.The author's highly contrived trip gives him an opportunity to display lots of mildly interesting details garnered during library research into the history of cars in America. Unfortunately, this material competes for space with far too many pages of nostalgic rumination about the author's teenage years, his first marriage, and his current problems with wife number two. He drives across the US obsessing about his middle aged body, drinking too much, eating junk, and reporting with glee anytime a hot babe responds with interest to his &quot;pussy machine&quot; (his words, not mine.)This strikes me as yet another book crafted by an agent and the publisher's marketing department with an eye to TV appearances and tie-ins rather than the serious literary &quot;road story&quot; it purports to be. It's real theme is the whining of priviledged white middle aged men who, though they got a big piece of it, didn't get it all. It bears the same relationship to &quot;On the Road&quot; that a Big Mac does to the meatloaf blue plate special at Stella's Roadside Dinner."},{"Title":"The Distance to the Moon: A Road Trip into the American Dream","review":"I like car books, I like road books. I've read Kerouac, Least Moon, Obert, etc., and I agree that the premise of the book seems interesting. The book just is not. The author is too focused on biographical details and an adolescent self-satisfaction of driving around in a then-fashionable Porsche. I couldn't even finish the book."},{"Title":"The Distance to the Moon: A Road Trip into the American Dream","review":"I receieved this book as a Christmas gift from a fellow Porsche lover and read while I was heading home back home for the holidays. I am in my late 20's, so I have not reached my &quot;mid-life crisis&quot; yet, but I still enjoyed following the tales of Morgan and his thoughts about how the car has influenced our society. I enjoyed his talks while he was in Portland, Oregon. Hearing his own tales on how certain cars throughout his life played a major role in certain cross-roads kept me intrigued. I love Porsches, but I also love the idea of just hitting the road and seeing life outside my little world. As soon as I finished this book, I began &quot;On The Road&quot; by Jack Kerouac. So far, I see some similarites."},{"Title":"The Distance to the Moon: A Road Trip into the American Dream","review":"An excellent read for an American male who grew up on 50's cars. I'm a gen x'er and found it harder to identify, but it still held my interest. He has an enjoyable style that's witty without being pretentious.Morgan takes us through his dream assignment of driving a new Porsche Boxter across the country and through the hard-wired American desire to be seen in a 'cool' car.He describes the very 20th century mode of viewing our personal history through the cars we own. &quot;Back in high school I drove a 73' Mercury Capri and was dating..........&quot; I don't know if this is true for others, but I connect chunks of my life with the car I was driving just as he does. There were the Audi years, and college days driving a Honda, etc.Morgan has a great take on the SUVism that Americans have embraced: &quot;once upon a time the car was going to take us to our cabin in the woods, now it's become the cabin.&quot;It seems we Americans are always seeking a new frontier, and maybe getting in the car and just driving is the modern equivalent of the Lewis and Clark ambition in each of us that he speaks to. Morgan asks where we go when the frontier is closed, as was declared over 100 years ago. He poetically details the rush of the open road, and warns &quot;a lot can go wrong in the distance to the moon.&quot;He covers a lots of geographical ground from coast to coast, and has quick insights here and there. In the end, I felt there was more he could have done with the concept, but still enjoyed the book."},{"Title":"The Distance to the Moon: A Road Trip into the American Dream","review":"Here's the life lesson this book confirmed: if you're going to share a long road trip with a companion and a car, best select both carefully. The Porsche Boxster featured in this book is obviously a primo vehicle for the journey. Alas, James Morgan is not the companion of choice, and this book -- whose premise of a Interstate journey from Miami to Portland atttracted me to it -- lost a star about every fifty pages. Ruminating on whether Americans as a people (and we are basically talking men here -- women exist mostly as ornaments impressed by cars) long most for the open road or the comforts of home, Morgan tells car stories, but not enough of them or particularly interesting ones. He worries about the designs of people he meets along the way and how much he spends on the motels where he stays. Earrings, scruffy beards, long straggly hair on those he meets seem to evoke in him images of horrors about to be inflicted on his person, although these folk invariably offer him kindness both small and large. Frequent flashbacks to his adolescence -- wink, wink -- hint strongly at the seductive qualities of cars he owned in his early driving years. He quarrels with his wife before embarking from Miami and too many pages are spent alluding to this quarrel (details of which are never shared) and the in-trip visit and numerous telephone calls that only seem to exacerbate it. On the evidence of this book, Morgan's trip brought more bother than pleasures or answers, and he writes of it with prose that is neither original or engrossing. My advice: don't subject yourself to his angst. Instead, take a fast car out for an open road run."},{"Title":"The Distance to the Moon: A Road Trip into the American Dream","review":"James Morgan describes driving a Porsche Boxster from Miami to St. Louis to Portland to San Francisco. Morgan seems like the sort of person who experiences life as a series of car stories, and during the journey, he tells his life history with an emphasis on the automotive angle. The pivotal part of his road trip is in Portland, Oregon, which is famous for its anti-car, pro-transit policies that are known as the &quot;new urbanism.&quot; Morgan attacks the new urbanists, and wonders why anyone would choose to stand on a windy rain-drenched street waiting for the bus when they could be driving their own car instead. It's particularly ironic when Portland planning specialists use contorted rationalizations to explain why they drive to work instead of taking the public transit that they're forcing down the throats of their fellow residents.Morgan writes well, if you don't mind the autobiographical element overpowering the travel narrative. However, he's a dyed-in-the-wool car buff writing for other car buffs. Unless you're the sort of person who loves talking about cars, you may have difficulty connecting with this author."},{"Title":"The Distance to the Moon: A Road Trip into the American Dream","review":"I was initially worried that this book would be too much about the car and not enough about the road...or Florida for that matter. It seemed as if the book took FOREVER just to get out of Florida. I was also worried that this book would be too much of a male fantasy. Luckily that part turned out not to be true and made for enjoyable reading.But once the author got into Utah and places north and west of there things picked up. He met interesting people in bar and restaurants, saw a few oddities along the way.The author unwinded as the journey continued. He talked about his previous cars, his previous wife and his previous jobs. Strife between his current wife was obvious from the start and I wonder if this trip was an excuse to mull over the end of his marriage. One never finds out.The trip ended upruptly on the west coast. I thought it was a bit of a letdown; perhaps disillusionment seeped in and the author resided to his fate.

As a Boxter owner, I found myself grinning with joy reading about Mr. Morgan's experiences driving this amazingly fun and evocative car. The Boxter really does elicit great reactions and car stories from total strangers you encounter on the road. The route he chose to drive, especially the Louis and Clark sections of the trip, was perfect. Also the choice of Portland Oregon as a stop was a very thought provoking exercise. I found the running tension throughout the entire trip between Mr. Morgan and his wife (who accompanied him only for the first few days of his odyssey) very disconcerting. In spite of that, if you own a sports car or dream of owning one, this is a must read."},{"Title":"The Distance to the Moon: A Road Trip into the American Dream","review":"We've all seen this guy at a stoplight and cringed.

Williams the last great 400 plus hitter in baseball demonstrates through his schemas the level of acuity needed to become a serious student of this science. He was a true intellectual of the game and has shown the baseball community that thinking not just developing muscles in the game can generate a better hitter. It is an inspiration to young intelligent players who take their game seriously--there should be more of this in all sports."},{"Title":"The science of hitting,","review":"For young and inexperienced players, Ted Williams' name may no longer hold the magic it did when I was growing up and playing baseball. But most of us \\"old-timers\\" will still remember that Williams was the last professional ball player (in the MLB) to hit over .400 for a full season. So when my Little League aged son was struggling a bit at the plate a season ago, I broke out my copy of Williams' The Science of Hitting to look for some kernel of wisdom that would help my son get out of his slump.But, the first line in the book is an admonition that today's best hitters fail more than they succeed \\"...even if you're a .300 hitter...you are going to fail at your job seven out of ten times.\\" This statement is at once encouraging as well as discouraging. That is hitting in a nutshell (triumphant in success yet unbelievably humbling and potentially discouraging in failure) and any good player will need to remember that success as a ball player is measured a bit differently.The admonition out of the way, Williams' book splits the topic of hitting up into two basic parts--first, the physical mechanics involved in hitting; second, the mental duel taking place between the batter and pitcher.Much of what is written in the book is the result of Williams' conversations with great hitters of the past. As a result, much of the advice in the book is shared in the form of readable anecdotes, which make the book easy to read and enjoyable for baseball aficionados as well -- where else are you going to learn about Harry Heillman's philosophy of hitting?One of the primary keys to Teddy Ballgame's success was his swing. The best \\"old-time\\" hitters (and Williams was certainly one of them) had a nearly a flat swing plane, flat wrist-roll and a low, rather than high finish. Most of today's hitters' display an upper cutting arc and high finish to their swings. Yet, in the \\"dead ball\\" the old-timers managed to wrack up nearly as many homeruns but had much higher batting averages and strike-out to hit ratios. This ended up being the clincher for me. I noticed immediately that my son had started trying to uppercut the ball so he could hit more homeruns (after hitting his one in his first at-bat of the season).We started working on having him hit line drives and sure enough he raised his average from .175 to .403 by the end of the season. Then this season he kept the swing we worked on and ended up hitting .390+, but also leading the league in home runs, finishing with 22 (including 6 in the post-season).The other thing that Williams writes (which is often misinterpreted) is that he'd never swing at a pitch he hadn't seen before. Often time people will swear (incorrectly) that Williams never swung at a pitcher's first pitch. Williams was, if nothing else, a student of the game. He intently studied pitchers watching them warm up, watching them from the on-deck circle and mentally replaying previous at-bats in his head. When he stepped into the batters box he had a game plan and he had a good understanding of what a pitcher threw and when. My son used this part of Williams' game as well and it was fun to watch him \\"studying\\" the opposing pitchers.Thank you Ted Williams! My son, whose name is Theodore William by the way, earned the nickname \\"Teddy Ballgame\\" from his coaches and teammates as well.Williams text in The Science of Hitting is accompanied by the wonderful pen and ink illustrations of Robert E. Cupp. These drawings and other explanatory photographs to help illustrate the points Williams is trying to make and really enhance the book.If you are a player, coach or just a parent wanting to help your son or daughter improve their game, this book is a must have!"},{"Title":"The science of hitting,","review":"I WAS FORTUNATE TO HAVE READ THIS WHEN I WAS LOANED A COPY FROM HIGH SCHOOL COACH - UNFORUNATELY I NEVER GAVE IT BACK, UNTIL NOW - BUT I DID SHARE IT WITH MY COUSINS AND THEN SONS AND DAUGHTERS - AND NEPHEWS - ALL TO FANTASTIC RESULTS...THIS IS THE HITTERS GUIDE BY THE GREATEST HITTER OF ALL TIME...THANK YOU TED WILLIAMS - AGAIN AND AGAIN..."},{"Title":"The science of hitting,","review":"Nice read, talks about a ton of ideas for hitting better, have used some of them, and have noticed improved power to the opposite field.Ted Williams was the second best player of all time, anytime he speaks or writes about baseball, it's in your best interest to soak up the info."},{"Title":"The science of hitting,","review":"- I think this should be the first book on hitting any baseball player reads.- Should be \\"The ART of hitting.\\" Very little, if any, science in this book.

Mr. Williams gives some very good information on developing game confidence."},{"Title":"The science of hitting,","review":"This is a book that you can read just to enjoy a bit of baseball history. Or to read deeper into and look into the mind of one baseballs greatest hitters of all time.

A great read."},{"Title":"The science of hitting,","review":"I truly pity the pitchers who had to face this man. Ted Williams went about the craft of hitting a baseball in the same way that artillerymen go about finding a target. This book is a wonderful (and wonderfully readable) synthesis by a man whose considerable mental and physical capabilities were focused utterly on the idea of Getting A Hit. It almost turns hitting a baseball into a philosophical position. One of the premiere &quot;How-to&quot; sports books of all time."},{"Title":"The science of hitting,","review":"Ted Williams does what no other man could or will ever do in the greatest book ever written on hitting. Complex, yet simple, Williams discusses the makeup of a successful hitter not just from a mechanical standpoint, but from a philosophical view also. His &quot;three rules to hit by&quot; should be used by every hitter regardless of skill level. Williams also details the cat and mouse game between hitter and pitcher, discussing how to think along with any pitcher. No other book does what Williams does so beautifully in this book, and that is to break down the most difficult skill in the world of sports so that any non-athlete can gain insight and understanding into the science of hitting."},{"Title":"The science of hitting,","review":"This book, along with \\"The Art of Hitting .300\\" by Charlie Lau, simply belongs on every ballplayer and coaches bookshelve.

Absolutley.However, these two books are the foundation on which all others are built.If you dont own it, buy it!"},{"Title":"The science of hitting,","review":"I read this book more than 20 years ago when I was in my early twenties. It profoundly effected my thinking on the game of baseball. Ted Williams had the best plate approach of any hitter, with the possible exception of Babe Ruth. Bonds used this strategy his entire career, but it only seemed to take full effect post \\"cream and clear\\". This system is simply the best. You can't even argue the point. All the sabrematricians have done the research, and it concurs with Williams. But he said it quite elegantly, I think. I also caught a lucky break when I traveled to Cooperstown, N.Y. to visit the Hall of Fame, and guess what I see on display there? A wall of colored baseballs 7 wide and 11 high. I'll never forget that moment. I couldn't adequately explain that scenario to my wife, but that's another matter. I can still get goosebumps just thinking about it. If you care about what wins baseball games, then there is no substitute for this book. This should be required reading for every fan, broadcaster, player, manager, general manager, owner, and anyone else remotely interested in the game. When I looked at the Amazon page I noticed that out of 42 reviewers, this book had a full 5 star rating. I wonder if anybody gave it less than 5 stars. If they did, well, there are always a few idiots around."},{"Title":"The science of hitting,","review":"I wish i had known about this book when i was in little league. This has helped me tremendously at the age of 22, and i know it can work for someone of any age. The thing i like most about this book is that it allows for hitters to use their own natural swing.

It stresses the importance of knowing the strike zone and the benifits of getting a good pitch to hit.

Ted Williams breaks down the baseball swing in minute detail and explains that the theory of a \\"level swing\\" is not entirely accurate, or necessary to hit a baseball consistently or properly. Williams' greatest contribution to hitters is his insight into the mental side of hitting and in the mental preperation BEFORE you step in the batters box. How to construct a plan of attack and how to have a good at-bat is something young hitters, experienced hitters, and hitters trying to make it to the next level can benefit from as much, or more than how to have a proper swing. Williams breaks down the parts of the swing very well and in good, but not overwhelming detail. His credentials as a hitter are impeccable and is still considered by many to be the greatest hitter of all time. This is a book you can read over and over again and continually pick out nuggets of brilliance that will help you to become a better hitter."},{"Title":"The science of hitting,","review":"This book is forty years old and is still the best hitting book ever.I see high paid college coaches teaching concepts that contradict with this book and it drives me crazy.

The book reads as if it's Ted talking, and it feels as if he and I went on a fishing trip, and he was just talking hitting in between him casting for trout or bass or whatever he likes. The only thing missing is a fire crackling and the smell of grilled fish.There are a few theories that were new to me, such as Ted saying that you should swing \\"up\\" instead of the standard \\"down\\". There is a very nice walk down memorabilia lane at the end of the book with photos and blurbs about all-time great hitters. This is updated, of course, only to about the late 80's, so we're missing Big Mack, Bonds, Sosa, and other recent sluggers, but that's going to happen in any sports book with a certain date on it.If you want help with hitting, I am sure there are more to the point books out there, and they would probably be more worth your money. It will take you a long time to actually weed out the good points that Williams makes (they are hidden in there in between his down-home style of writing). But if you want to chew some tobacco, and sit by the fireside (nevermind the fishing trip) with the last .400 hitter in MajorLeagueBaseball, together with some tips, get the book."},{"Title":"The science of hitting,","review":"Although an outdated work as a guide for becoming a good hitter, it is a book which affords one a historical perspective on hitting. Williams' ideas on pitch sleection still offer a hitter an excellent idea of what pitches a hitter should look to hit in certain situations. Not recommended for any new student or coach trying to learn to hit or coach hitting. This book is a good reference for experienced students of hitting trying to understand the revolution in hitting theories and mechanics."},{"Title":"The science of hitting,","review":"This book really helps.

An absolute must for hitters."},{"Title":"The science of hitting,","review":"I'm an avid baseball fan, baseball player (College) and Little League coach. The greatest hitter of all time does an absolutely fantastic job of breaking down the basics, then expanding on them. It is broken down into all the parts that matter in a swing, including lesser known drills that really open up your eyes to the full body swing. Williams backs up all his information with facts: specific batting percentages and measurements (sweet spots, strike zones, pulling/pushing). Its a fantastic book that you can read cover to cover in an hour, yet take months to fully digest all the information given to you. Not to mention the many quotes and pictures that Williams has in the book diagramming everything he's talking about and teaching you.Hitting a baseball is so incredibly hard, yet Mr. Ted Willimams will make it seem so easy that you'll want to go to the local batting cage and try out all the tips and information he gives you. I recommend this book for anyone who has hit, wants to hit, or wants to teach others how to hit.

Not the head coach, but the one who helps them with their batting and hitting skills.I picked this book up before practice began, and didn't actually read it for a couple weeks... the kids were NOT hitting very well. So, on a Friday night I read the WHOLE book and was AMAZED at the simplicity that Ted laid out the principles of good hitting.The back elbow up, cocking your hips and then swinging a somewhat level swing with a slight upswing to it, made all the sense in the world.We implemented this with the kids, and the next game EVERY kid got a hit... man, it feels good. So, if you are a hitter, or COACH little league... GET THIS BOOK. It will only make each player on your team a better hitter."},{"Title":"The science of hitting,","review":"Ted Williams is probably the best baseball hitter of all time. The Science of Hitting, written by Ted Williams helped me so much on my swing. To pick up the pitcher on the next pitch he is throwing. But its not just having the best swing in the world you have to have good vision and confidence at the plate. So even if the pitcher throws you a change up or a curveball you have to keep your head in, keep your weight back, and wate for the ball then you swing. So always be ready for a pitch like a change up or curveball. As a hitter you whant to be able to put the ball in play where you want to place it.He wrote the book as if he were in a conversation with you.He talks about all of the aspects of hitting. Like:Seeing the ball, hitting mechanics, situational hitting, knowing your pitcher, bat sizes and selection, and hitting from the neck up (being a smart hitter) Say your a lefty and every one does a switch where almost every one would go to right field. You want to put the ball in left field to throw them off. He explains how the game is still like it was when he played, but there are not as many good hitter. Not enough time in batting practice or studying the game. I think this is a great book for anyone who wants to become a better hitter."},{"Title":"The science of hitting,","review":"This book is the timeless classic that was actually the precurser to what is now referred to as rotational hitting. This book should be manditory reading for all coaches and players, especially at the younger ages to get the boys started the right way. There are many well intended coaches who are teaching the wrong stuff who could benefit from this book. The book is from about 1971 when Ted was managing the Texas Rangers, but he talks about what made him the greatest hitter of all time and every bit of the information makes sense.Again, a must read for anyone associated with the game of baseball."},{"Title":"The science of hitting,","review":"This book is perfect for anyone looking to expand their knowledge on how to hit a baseball. Everything from pitch recognition to a smooth swing are discussed and analyzed. Ted Williams also includes some of his stories from when baseball was a lifestyle. This book allows anyone to see the time and hard work that must go into becoming a good hitter. Becoming a good hitter does not mean picking up a bat and taking a few swings. It starts before you ever get to the ballpark. He walks you through ways to pick up pitcher tendencies, and stresses patience at the plate. This book provides helpful diagrams, which show what pitches are good ones to take a swing at. But he doesn't stop there, he goes into great detail about what you should try and do with that pitch that is in the zone. Also included are tips for making your stance comfortable yet effective, grip on the bat, and improving your power for maximum effectiveness in every at bat. Ted Williams also provides insight on knowing the situation, and doing what is best for your team. A must read for players of all skill levels. This book will grow with you as your hitting experiences expand. Ted Williams deserves more stars than I am allowed to give him for this book."},{"Title":"The science of hitting,","review":"This is the greatest book anyone an possibly buy on hitting. It is written by one of the top 3 hitters in baseball history, Ted Williams, and he definitely knows what he's talking about. Take it from me, I know. Im a 15 year old baseball player, whenever I get into a slump I can read this book and it will automatically get me out of it. If you read this at the beggining of a season it's possible your batting average could at least increase by .200, depending on how good you are. He explains the importance of having a good swing, stride, and everything essential to being a good hitter. This is a must have for every little leaguer."},{"Title":"The science of hitting,","review":"This book and Robert Adair's _The_Physics_of_Baseball_ are essential to being the best player, executive, or fan possible. This book is timeless, and focuses on the 'real playing field' of baseball -- the strike zone where the hitter and pitcher battle it out. This book covers technique well, but more importantly, it teaches approach, and the earlier in your life you can learn that, the better you will be.Williams' emphasis on plate discipline and mental approach, combined with his teaching of how to analyze your own swing gives you the basic tools you need to be an excellent offensive player. For pitchers, this book is a must to understand the weapons available to the batter.For fans, this book will help you understand what's important and what's just filler by the broadcast team. If you're under 14 years old, buy this book, or go get from your local library, and study it on a field with a tee and a bag of balls. Then read it every day before you do your hitting reps.This book turns bad hitters fair, and good hitters great. You just need to put in the work."},{"Title":"The science of hitting,","review":"This book is \\"must-have\\" reading for any aspiring slugger or student of the game of baseball. Be aware, however, that the book's value does not lie in the specifics of technical hitting instruction. This is much more hitting \\"theory\\" as relayed by Ted Williams from his years of experience. There is little, if any, practical detailed instruction on developing mechanics for swinging the bat. On one hand, the book is absolute gospel; I don't think anything in it could be seriously disputed, and to do so is to question the genius of a man whom baseball history shows to be one of the greatest hitters (and philosophers of hitting) that has ever lived. On the other hand, for Ted Williams to offer his personal philosophy and methods for hitting is similar to Tiger Woods trying to teach someone how he hits a golf ball. It might be great information for the rare few that can in some way duplicate Ted's or Tiger's physical abilities, but for a vast majority of players (especially very young players) who lack power, 20/10 eyesight, and one-in-a-million type hand/eye coordination, this book will (at best) offer little to improve their performance and (at worst) may actually lead to swing techniques that make the game more difficult.For anyone who has spent any time studying the instruction of mechanics for the baseball swing, you already know that the methods of hitting fall into two primary camps. These methods can be differentiated by their beliefs on what is the \\"proper\\" swing plane (i.e., what path the bat takes in route to intercepting the pitched ball.) One side is often called \\"level swing\\" or \\"linear\\", where the swing is more level to the ground, and the other side (where Williams stands) promotes a swing level to the flight of the pitch (where the pitch is following a downward arc from the pitcher due to gravity and the elevation of the pitcher in relationship to the strike zone.) Therefore, the \\"level\\" swing that Williams promotes is, in practice, what is commonly known as an \\"upper-cut\\" at the ball. This method is commonly adhered to by those who teach \\"rotational\\" hitting (as opposed to \\"linear\\" hitting.)Williams himself states several times throughout this book (although the statements are made in passing, and never really expounded upon) that his method for hitting would NOT be recommended for players that don't have the power to hit the ball out of the ballpark. This is where the problem really begins. How many baseball players aspire to be homerun hitters? ALL OF THEM! How many of them truly can be? Very few. An analyst on ESPN recently made the statement, \\"Just because some guy hits 20 homeruns in a season, people want to label that player a homerun hitter. Not so!\\" It is a very difficult thing (and quite counter-intuitive to an athlete's competitive nature) to identify and yield to the limitations of your athletic ability. However, Branch Rickey, one of the greatest talent evaluators and baseball minds in history, held the firm belief that it is impossible to teach a player to hit with power. You either have the skill from birth, or you don't. Ted Williams had it. Barry Bonds, Albert Pujols, ARod, Chase Utley, Josh Hamilton have it, just to name a few. This isn't just a matter of getting in the weight room and pumping iron. It pertains to the player's natural ability to generate fast, efficient motions of the body that will result in maximum kinetic energy. You are either born knowing how to generate optimal force or you are not. For those that are, then a technique similar to Ted Williams' is probably best for you.Some of the biggest truths in the book are what make the book both universal and, at the same time, less useful for baseball instruction. Williams makes very general statements about proper mechanics, but then says that the 10 greatest hitters have 10 different styles. The times that he does make a concrete argument (like \\"upswing is the only way to go\\") it is placed under the caveat \\"if you have enough power to make it work.\\" Which, as I have said, very few players truly possess.Williams also covers his personal strategies for facing pitchers - how he takes more pitches in early at-bats and uses the data he collects for strategies later in the game (i.e., his third, fourth, and fifth at-bats in the game.) Well, if it's not obvious, this advice is nothing more than a fossil of a bygone era. In the modern age of the relief pitchers and situational substitutions, practicing this type of strategy is almost impossible. A professional hitter will be fortunate to get three at-bats against the same pitcher in one game. Hitters at the lower levels of amateur baseball usually play shorter games, and even if one does face a pitcher multiple times, the performance at that level usually lacks the kind of consistency needed to successfully make any sound assumptions.To summarize this review, I think this book provides an excellent reference point for any student of the game of baseball. Translating the instruction in this book into improved success in the batter's box will require a more thorough understanding of the mechanics of hitting, and a disciplined, discerning athlete to cherry-pick the portions of this book that can actually be applied with his own ability level."},{"Title":"The science of hitting,","review":"In the past 2 years I have read EVERYTHING there is to read on the subject of hitting preperatory to teaching my gifted 8 year old son and while I tell you that in virtually each and every book there exists some gem that you can apply to help increase chances of success THIS BOOK is the definative work on hitting.What amazes me the most is that Williams, only a HS graduate, but yet possessing of an incredibly gifted intellect, as is exhibited by his becoming a fighter pilot etc, taught himself through trial, error and DETAILED analysis what the incredibly complex physics of the swing are. Recently, with the publication of Rob't K Adair's THE PHYSICS OF THE SWING we have the definitive confirmation of what Williams came to understand himself but now from a scientific and scholarly source. Williams doesn't articulate it in his book but he employed a law of physics called The Law of Conservation of Angular Momentum. Simply stated as it applies here it means that when you hold the arms close to the body and start the swing with your hips rather than your arms you will generate greater bat speed. Williams stated this simply in his book when he talks about starting the swing with the hips and holding the hands back as long as you can.... the farther the hands get away from the body the slower the bat speed. It's a law of physics that simply cannot be overcome. The hands, wrists and arms add nothing to the speed of the bat. They are mere conduits through which the power which is generated by the legs and the torso are transferred to the bat. Williams was intelligent enough to figure this one out on his own. Well, as he stated in his book, Rogers Hornsby's immortal words: &quot;great hitters are not born, they are CREATED by study, hard work and fault correction&quot; probably provided him with the spark he needed.He was an amazing man who had problems with his pears when he played as super intelligent people often do. Fortunately now he is getting his just due and respect.Thank you and rest in peace Teddy Ballgame!"},{"Title":"The science of hitting,","review":"Regardless of which hitting philosophy you subscribe to, this book is the best overall technical reference for the mechanics of hitting.

At first reading the Williams' book appears disappointing...too many old-time stories from Ted's days as a ballplayer and coach. Yet like a the game of checkers, the more you analyze (and read) the book, the deeper your understanding of hitting becomes. The most amazing concept is that Mr. Williams &quot;discovered&quot; his hitting mechanics by trial and error...without the use of high speed video, etc. His concepts are rather simple...1) get a good pitch to hit (study the pitchers and their tendencies), 2) use a lighter bat for quickness, 3) hips initiate the swing, 4) swing up (slightly) to increase your chances of hitting the ball &quot;on plane&quot; and 5) practice, practice, practice.My daughters play softball and its mindboggling how poor the hitting instruction is at nearly all levels...including high school. The forward weight shift, &quot;hands thrown to the ball,&quot; and early wrist roll are wonderful ways to hit soft groundballs to second base. (And unless your daughter has amazing speed...mine don't...she'll hit about .180.) Many players and coaches are amazed that my average-sized daughters possess such &quot;power.&quot; I'd love to think it's talent, but alas it's technique...proper hip rotation leading the hands...just as described by Williams, and an upward swing plane.The next time you're at a ballgame, see how many kids are actually swinging &quot;upward&quot;...pick those kids out and you'll immediately know the good hitters that have gotten good instruction.Get the book, study the drawings &amp; photos...it makes so much sense."},{"Title":"The science of hitting,","review":"When your son or daughter asks you how to hit better --- don't just make stuff up as if you really were a good hitter (and you weren't) --- buy this book, instead.

Prot&eacute;g&eacute; is filled with characters common to the murder mystery genre: a serial killer, college coeds, a couple of New York City cops, and a protagonist whose life and mind are a mess.Each of these characters exists to control others. Serial killing is always about control of the victims. Coeds control male students and occasionally their professors using their sexuality. And cops. Well, cops control for a living. The hero of the mystery, a college professor of Criminology with a reputation slightly tarnished for having responded too well to a seductive coed, is trying to retain some control over his life and mind as events spiral, in fact, out of control.At the beginning of chapter two, we are told the essential question of the novel, \`Do we all have the capacity to kill?' The serial killer, who slaughters young women in ritual, sexually deviant ways, certainly believes the answer to that question is \`yes.' He believes there is a killer in each of us. He believes it so thoroughly that he decides to take on a prot&eacute;g&eacute;, someone who will be introduced to his inner killer. The experienced killer will mentor the essentially good, though slightly troubled by his own thoughts, college professor to become a killer. Not a killer in self-defense nor a killer in war, but one who kills for no apparent reason other than taking pleasure in the killing.It is unclear through much of the book why the serial killer has selected this particular professor to be his prot&eacute;g&eacute; in killing. Nevertheless, the killer's selection is a lucky one, for killing is already on the professor's mind. He thinks and lectures about criminals to his students and explores the psychology of killing with them. And he is already worried about himself. At times alone, his examines his own psychology and wonders whether he is already showing some pathology or trait which might make him a killer. The professor is just as vulnerable to the intentions and manipulations of the master killer as are the young women that killer selects for \`training.'The struggle for control between the killer, his prot&eacute;g&eacute;, the cops and the students builds to a strong and surprising resolution. As the plot develops and the bodies fall along the sidewalks of New York, the descriptive passages detailing thoughts and actions by the master killer and the cops are quite good. The spoken dialogue is believable for all the characters.In a unique feature, the author uses italics to tell us what the professor is thinking. Since the professor thinks about himself a lot, the italicized passages are long and sometimes tiring to read. In fact, since the professor analyses himself and his thoughts - over and over again - the first half of the book is about 50% too long The plot drags a bit for just this reason: the professor is obsessed with himself and his psychological self-examination. The second half of the book has a better flow, for there are more action scenes and dialogue than in the early pages. In places throughout the book, the writing is overstuffed with juicy words. Some sentences seem copped directly from daytime soap operas, making certain passages in the book more melodramatic than dramatic.But these are the mistakes of young authors. Almost certainly Scott's second book will be more tightly written. The two characters left standing at the end of Prot&eacute;g&eacute; are interesting enough for Scott to follow them into a sequel. And we hope Christopher Scott forges ahead, for this debut novel Prot&eacute;g&eacute; announces the arrival of another talented writer."},{"Title":"Protg","review":"It's June and schools almost out for summer, a time when some of us have more time to read for pleasure.

An excellent story teller he makes sure u finish the book before u do anything else!"},{"Title":"Inoperative Community (Theory and History of Literature)","review":"Nancy has written on topics as diverse as poetry/aesthetics, history of (the closure) of metaphysics/philosophy, freedom, and what he has called \\"the deconstruction of Christianity,\\" after first writing books on the Jena (romantic) group and one of Jacques Lacan's essays \\"The title of the letter.\\" I see his writing as less labyrinthine than other French thinkers; in this book, perhaps, he helps us understand WHY it is a maze (why reading/thinking has to do with the deferral of meaning, the suspension of ____, rather than with \\"the communication of meaning\\"). The shortest essay in this collection, \\"Literary Communism,\\" is a great example of this and is a great entry way into the rest of the book.Nancy's thinking process approaches the straightforward. His \\"propositions\\" do not ask you to blankly accept them, but rather invite you to think with them, and the prose takes us through his movements. Often, he will turn a phrase in six or seven directions to get the reader focused on different implications, different avenues, to consider meaning alongside with nonmeaning and negation (see page 89 per the phrase: \\"Love is the extreme movement, beyond the self, of a being reaching completion\\"). And yet, Nancy is never for ambiguity and is never without proposition: when we stick with his ideas we see the reason for all these twists and turns. The (\\"argumentative\\") FOCUS of each chapter leads each to the next as much as they stand wholly on their own (though perhaps they cannot 'live' without each other-- Nancy's texts are always retracing themselves).Nancy is reading a HUGE tradition and weaving them together in a way that gives us a window into a way of thinking through this tradition. I would characterize Nancy's whole work as a type of READING: he tries to let thinkers speak where they could not, to say what they were (\\"structurally\\") unable (including himself as time goes on, I think). He seems to let no thinking of the past go away, accepting all of it as there because it is to contribute. Derrida describes him quite adequately (and with all the philosophical implications for the tradition): PUNCTUAL. One gets the feeling that these essays were for the man Jean-Luc quite essential to his being-here with us-- But also that he has written, perhaps more than any other thinker, for US, that the whole past of philosophy (or at least of the more modern French writers) could not do without.He will be the first to tell you in this book that \\"community\\" can only mean the continued articulation of a meaning that is constitutively deferred; again, this emphasizes the space of writing. This means: space for dialog and breathing. Nancy and Blanchot are exemplary as far as constituting this \\"conversation\\" in their texts (as when N writes: \\"Here, I must interrupt myself: it is up to you to allow to be said what no one, no subject, can say, and what exposes us in common.\\")The philosophy presented in this book keys around a focal point in all of Nancy's thinking: that there is no longer a common-being (or communion), and that there is only being-in-common (the inoperative community). This is a discussion that leads him through Bataille's thinking on community, the impossibility of \\"communalism\\" (ch 1), the suspension of the communal myth and its relation to literature, etc (ch 2), and the type of (inoperative writing) community Nancy sees as the space of sharing this being-in-common (this sharing of the impossibility of a common-being, as my-self or as my-group): a \\"literary communism\\" (ch 3).This lays the foundation for his reflection on the relationship between philosophy and love (ch 4) and question of \\"God\\" (ch 5), the two most astounding pieces, both from a philosophical and literary standpoint, I think. Coming long before his deconstruction of Christianity and (perhaps his most astonishing work) CORPUS, these last two especially seem to \\"tremble\\" with the question of love/God (i.e. the possibility, meaning of community-- this is a \\"political\\" philosophy). He has said himself this text is too mystical for his tastes, but that it was suppose to be an experiment in philosophy. Elsewhere he talks about ch 4 as an \\"ancient text\\" of his. I find all these even greater reasons to recommend this early work (along with The Literary Absolute) as a foundation for lots of other thinking, as I can attest it has been for me. Certainly, at least, they contribute immensely to his \\"tone\\"-- also an important concept in Nancy's thinking about the history/voicings of philosophical thinking.I wanted to write this view to respond to the reviewer who said this book was \\"utter non-sense,\\" not to challenge that claim or that experience of theirs, but rather to draw attention to it and emphasize that THAT IS the sense of it: to emphasize along with Nancy that SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED when it comes to signification and sense. (See his \\"The Forgetting of Philosophy\\" for this topic directly). I think his whole work is addressed to this break (I would suggest Holderlin's uniqueness for the modern world when it comes to this break). This is a book that teaches you how to read philosophy and will always help you read it. I am convinced that (following Bataille) Nancy writes for a readership ready to enter greater philosophical texts-- or those who aren't: he writes to be read, to give room for our own speech, and then to be read again.He writes so that we might be exposed there to ourselves-- and there are no rules for how we follow after it. I hope that my terrible summary of the philosophy in \\"The Inoperative Community\\" has only encouraged you to check it out; if it hasn't, please give it a chance and let it speak (GROW) for itself."},{"Title":"Inoperative Community (Theory and History of Literature)","review":"This book has been very influential in France. If you don't take your philophy neat, of if you are new to Nancy's thought, then I recommend starting with Maurice Blanchot's _The Unavowable Community_, which relates Nancy's concept of finitude to the work and life of Georges Bataille. Blanchot shows why, in the face of the various totalitarianisms of the 20th century, we should care about Nancy's work."},{"Title":"Inoperative Community (Theory and History of Literature)","review":"Contrary to the previous reviewer, this collection of essays is well worth reading.

First off, none of the jokes are funny. This might be because it was writtern in the 19th century. The author (Mark Twain) was probably cracking jokes from the time it was written. Some times the jokes dept on repeating themselves. Morgan kept on using slang from the 19th century; of coarse none of the medieval characters were understood him. The book also got really boring, really fast. There was really no action in it. It seemed like the author was trying to make it funny, but couldn't.

I found this book very boring because it didn't have much action to keep my attention. The reason why it was so boring is because the guy just sits around all day feeling proud of his high status. The story also doesn't have many characters, which would have made it more interesting. The book was also hard to understand. Because it was set in the middle ages, the characters used old-fashioned words like &quot;Lo&quot; &quot;thou art&quot; etc. that i could not understand.

For example, he blows up a tower by connecting gun powder to a lightning rod during a storm. Amazing....I think not. I thought this book was boring because there are to many unnecessary details.

The story starts out talking about a young man named Hank Morgan, who was somehow transported back to the 6th century in England. He started out thinking that he arrived in an asylum, where everybody thought they were in the time of King Arthur. He later proved himself that he was in the 6th century by witnessing a total solar eclipse which he knew it was going to occur on the twenty-first of June A.D. 528 at 3 minutes after noon. After that event, he was given place in the government, and continuously used his cleverness and knowledge he learned in the 19th century to improve and prefect the country he was living in, during the 6th century. He used his knowledge in the field of science and performed what the people in the medieval times, called magic; and as time progressed he became the country&iexcl;s most powerful advisor. During this period of time, he kept a journal, which is what most of this book is.Unlike most of the other stories, the plot of this story was consisted of two time periods, the modern 19th century and the medieval 6th century. The main character, Hank Morgan, was mysteriously sent back and became someone like Jesus because he knew what was happening and what is going to happened already in the history lessons when he was still in the 19th century. A literary device Mark Twain used in this book that made this book very amusing was all the satires Hank used to mock the people in King Arthur&iexcl;s court. For example, when a page was introducing himself to Mark, Mark said, &iexcl;Go &iexcl;long, you ain&iexcl;t more than a paragraph.&iexcl;I recommend this book for people who want something light and less serious, because this book will give you a good laugh."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"A Connecticut in King Arthur's Court gives the reader a feel for how someone must adapt to a new surrounding they are put into.

Using modern technology, he becomes more famous than evil Merlin the Magician. Hank, titled the Boss, meets humble friends like Clarence and Sandy who help him get accustomed to the Medieval Period. Hank travels around the English countryside with a down-to-earth man, King Arthur. I liked the story because it was interesting and unique. I found the story to be interesting because the 19th century meets the 6th century. Hank brings electricity, personal hygiene methods, and other modern conveniences with him to the Medieval community. It is interesting how the Middle Ages people get acquainted with these technological advances. The book also gives you insight and a new point-of-view on famous Medieval legends. King Arthur dresses up as a peasant, his sister Morgan Le Fay overturns hanging sentences, and Merlin becomes a deceiving, unfriendly magician, all as a result of Hank's magical powers and his influence on them. There are a few very intense and suspenseful events that make you wonder the fate of Medieval myths. The book has a complicated plot. There can be parts where there is little or no eventful action for a long time. However, when there is an action, it is intense and happens quickly.

I don't agree with those who consider it chaotic, although I do see that some may find it so since Twain attempts so much. He tries to tell an interseting tale, question society and mankind, and be humorous all at once which IS difficult, if not impossible."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"**This review may contain spoilers.\\"Cursory reading of Twain's quasi-satirical \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" suggests that the author was simply interested in lampooning the blue whale-sized targets of Arthurian characters, chivalry, knightly ideals, tyranny, religious hypocrisy, ancestral elitism, and ignorant superstition. The novel does, but I believe Twain's satiric scope was much broader. \\"Connecticut Yankee\\"'s target is humanity and the human condition itself, with Hank Morgan as its ironic prism.Superficial readers of \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" are wont to cheer for the protagonist Hank as a droll, unflappable champion of progressive economic, social, and cultural freedom. On the surface, he is. But Hank is subtly more sinister than that. All his improvements and ameliorative actions throughout the book only seem to benefit the British populace. Instead, everything he does is ultimately self-aggrandizing and self-serving, not to mention manipulative. He constantly and contemptously plays upon the British population's (from serf to King Arthur) fearful ignorance and superstition to achieve his paradoxical goal of conquest. His purported dream of converting Britain into a republic is undercut by his \\"hankering\\" to be its first president. Hank's subtle imperialism shows through the seams. Even Hank's name is ironic. His last name, Morgan, reminds you of King Arthur's malicious sorcerous half-sister Morgan Le Fay, who also had designs on Arthur's kingdom.Hank manages to lay a veneer of 19th century \\"civilization\\" upon 6th century England, but as the Catholic Church's interdict towards the end of the novel proves, that veneer is transient. I believe the prominent theme of \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" is that human betterment must be inherent and developed from within by honest and genuine moral means, not imposed adventitiously from the outside. Furthermore, younger, pliant minds not marinated in superstition are more likely to retain these lessons better than their mentally intransigent elders. That's why the former page Clarence and fifty or so young men remained loyal to Hank even after the rest of Britain plunged back into the Dark Ages after the interdict.However, Hank manipulates even these followers in a desperate attempt to preserve a vestige of his republic. Like a modern fortress, Hank and his followers protect themselves with moats, electric fences, and Gatling guns and exterminate all the opposing English forces. However, it is a Pyrrhic victory because the mound of putrefying knightly corpses threaten to asphyxiate them. Merlin, who is portrayed as a buffoonish charlatan throughout the novel, suddenly displays his true powers and puts Hank in a deep sleep in a cave, to awaken 1300 years later. Hank does wake up, but, perhaps remorseful over his deeds, pines away for the noble, romanticized England he dismissed at the beginning of the novel.Successful satires about the human condition have two primary characteristics: 1) Humans and humanity have many flaws, sins, and vices and 2) Humans and humanity very seldom correct those flaws, sins, and vices. By these standards, \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" is a largely successful satire. Ultimately, there is no one really worthy of admiration, not the conniving Merlin, not the noble but dunderheaded King Arthur, not even young Clarence (though he comes reasonably close), and not the devious Hank. Perhaps \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" was the harbinger of Twain's increasingly dark and cynical attitude towards humanity in general."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"I bought the book for a trip I was taking down the Mississippi River during the summer of 2010.

That said, I was fairly riveted throughout the novel. Hank Morgan's character was amusing, resourceful, and altogether human. After reading so much about the \\"perfection\\" of Arthurian and Round Table society, it's nice to hear about what life would have been like even if King Arthur and his Round Table did exist.

This mental exercise led me to the same conclusion and results as Hank.I perhaps disdain the collusion and alliance of the church and monarchs as much as Twain who is particularly acrimonious of these institutions. I therefore identified with Hank readily and enjoyed reading as he organized and recruited among the populace those who would be most loyal to his cause.

The story begins as a narration through the eyes of Hank Morgan, a 19th century factory manager. The plot starts when Hank is knocked out by an employee and wakes up in the 6th century. After dropping the idea that he is in a dream, he tries to make the best of the situation by improving the lives of the people. Using the knowledge he has of the future and his formal education, he wins the social rank known as &quot;The Boss&quot; and begins to educate a small group of people. His goal is to set up a republic and to destroy the overruling church officials. As time progresses, he sees the life of the people through their position (sees the life of a knight as a knight) and his desire to create an equal, yet effecient civilization increases. He tries to introduce the new ideas of his present time to them and the effect is something to read about. In the end, he learns that trying to change the atitude and customs of a large group of people is not as easy as he at first thought.

The novel is filled with humor and at times takes an optimistic stance on technology and modern age versus middle age, but there're also some touching moments and more than meets the eye at a first stance.When considered at a deeper level, it can lead the reader to think about ancient times and their real connections to our current society. What was Mark Twain's perception of history, and what are the main influences on this perception?Anyway, it's not compulsory to ask such questions, and the novel is enjoyable from a purely &quot;entertainment&quot; perspective. The book is suited both for kids and adults."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"This book was actually required reading for one of my college classes. I really like the parts of the book where Twain talks about the river and becoming a steamboat captain, but I thought the rest of the book sort of dragged - I ended up skimming those parts. Still, though, he does talk about the river for most of the book, and it is a classic, so its worth reading at least once. I reread certain sections now and then myself."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Mark Twain really tears apart the Catholic church and nobility.

We have more and more things to entertain us, yet feel more bored than ever. As I looked over some of the reviews of the classic books including this one, I noticed how often the word boring was used when describing a book. I guess in today's fast paced world if a book doesn't come with large speakers, a big screen and a joy stick it is boring. We aren't sheep, and are entilted to our own opinion, but when I hear the word boring being used to describe anything, it intrigues me and makes me want to see who used it."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"This novel by Mark Twain tells the story of a man who is swept back in time to the Dark Ages, the supposed period that Arthur and his round table existed. The story seems light hearted and fun throughout most of the text, but it was also written to make apparent the problems of medieval socity, specifically the form of government, which was feudalsim. Fuedalism's downfalls are thoroughly ecplored all throughout the novel by hank Morgan, the main character, as he thoughout the land trying to show the people of the time how wrong the way they live is. mark twain's writin style comes through very stronglyin thsi novel. Like many of his other books (Tom Sawyer, Huckleberry Finn) CYKAC at first glance looks and reads like a children's story. but as further reading and closer study show this is not correct. Several times very graphic descriptions of death and fighting are used and many of the issues addressed by Twain take a knowledgeable mind to be comprehended. This style of writing is misleading at times, because of the way the author describes people and things in a light hearted an almost comical manner. He also labels characters throughout the story with odd names and titles. The light-hearted nature soon fades away when the author paints a picture of families being separated by slavery or the injustice of the Church to the people it is supposed to serve. Twain's writing style may be misleading, but it adds flavor and diversity to the text that is hard to find in other novels. The story That Twain writes is really a parody of the Arthurian legends we all know. Twain keeps the same names and positions of the characters, but completely changes their personalities from what we are used to. Many times when a character is into\\\\roduced it is shocking to think of them the way Twain wants us too. But what he really is doing is showing us realistically what King Arthur and his knights would be like if they had existed in medieval times. The author's perception of the characters real, more human selves was believable, but in contrast the exploits of hank Morgan were astronomicaly unbelievable. hank's adventures throughout the kingdom were entertaining, but were bogged down by the issues that the author wanted to bring across to the reader. more comic relief was needed to keep the reader from becoming depressed and to keep the story moving. Over all CYKAC was fun to read and well written, even though it could have done without some of the lectures and soul grabbing that the author throws at you. The ideas taht Hank comes up with are fascinating and totally unbelievalbe, but I still enjoyed them. The change in the characters personalities were a welcome change form the traditional &quot;knights in shining armor&quot; mold used in many other Arthur novels. It gave the story a new boost and helped separate it from the rest of the Arthurian legends. At times it may have been slow, but the freshness and diversity of the book kept me from putting it down, and I think you to will agree with me if you decide to read this novel"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"I haven't read much of Twain's works, but this is undoubtly the best Twain book I have ever read (Huckleberry Finn, Tom Sawyer, jumping frogs...bleurgrht!).

I loved it.&quot;"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"A &quot;modern&quot; (late 1800s) man named Hank Morgan, after getting into a fight with a subordinate at his factory and being knocked on the head, is mysteriously transported back to Britain, 19 Jun 528 AD, the heyday of Camelot, King Arthur and the Knights of the Table Round. The book is presented as a kind of diary of his experiences there.Hank is able to use his modern knowledge to perform feats which awe the locals and their king and is promoted to being the king's right hand man. Hank goes about making various improvements, with an eye toward eventual revolution to free the common people from the oppressive social system. He starts secret &quot;man factories&quot;, recruiting those real men (and women) who seem to have an inkling that they can and should break free of domination and live in freedom and independence.A main thrust of the story is to disabuse the reader of any romantic notions he may be harboring about this era of history. The author clearly portrays the barbarism, filth, injustice, senseless violence, backwardness and brutality of this time and these people, often mocking their ignorance and superstition in the light of our more enlightened ways.A particular gripe is the humble but ignorant reverence of the common folk for King, Church and nobility. He vents that the terrible violence of the French Revolution pales in comparison to the centuries of depredations imposed on the common people who, in his view, were fully justified in that bloodletting. He rails against the Catholic Church of the day as a chief enemy of the freedom of the common people, encouraging them to remain humble toward authority (however unjust) and comtemplate the higher, God-ordained reasons for their sufferings.Among my favorite of the host of bit-part characters to make an appearance in the book is Sir Ossaise of Surluse, &quot;a brave knight and of considerable celebrity&quot; resulting from significant skill in past knightly jousting tournaments. He is one of the many knights that Hank has put to work as traveling salesmen, wearing bulletin-boards front and aft advertising Hank's many innovative products, such as tooth-wash and soap. Hank explains that Sir Ossaise was &quot;of a light and laughing disposition, and to him nothing in this world was serious,\\" which is why he has chosen him to advertise his stove polish (there are no stoves yet). When we meet him, Sir Ossaise has played a trick on another salesman (of toothbrushes) by sending the latter after a group of \\"likely customers.\\" After a long, hard chase, that energetic knight discovers the group consists of five poor souls released the night before from a long dungeon imprisonment, it having been &quot;all of 20 years since any one of them had known what it was to be equipped with any remaining snag or remnant of a tooth.&quot;One touching scene happens when Hank and King Arthur disguise themselves as commoners and travel throughout the kingdom to assess what's really happening there. Along the way, they are captured for the purpose of being sold into slavery (since they cannot prove their status as freemen and the ancient Roman law holds that they are slaves until proven otherwise). Hank is able to play along, knowing he'll eventually work out a way to get free. The king, with his high-born pride, keeps his chin up and maintains an attitude of resistance and defiance, refusing to yield to the abusive slave trader. Hank observes that the king truly knows how to act like the free man he is, regardless of circumstances.While early in the book it seems we are headed in a promising direction toward a happy and virtuous end, Twain later turns the plot in darker directions. Hank stages a &quot;final battle&quot; between the forces of Chivalry (about 30,000 knights) and his own forces of republican progress (himself and 52 boys!). The Battle of the Sand Belt is an outright slaughter of the larger reactionary force. Unfortunately, the evil Merlin has the last laugh and puts Hank into a 13-century sleep, even as his co-conspirators are trapped in their cave fortress and being sickened by the 30,000 decaying corpses of the opposition (so much for a light-hearted and happy ending).In the last scene, Twain has finished reading the manuscript given to him by Hank back in the 19th century. It is toward morning at the lodge where they are both staying and Hank is sleeping fitfully and making noises in the next room. When Twain checks on him, Hank is muttering about his beloved 6th century life (including a wife and child), apparently relieved that his 19th-century experiences were &quot;just a dream.&quot; We, of course, are left assuming that Hank's 6th century experiences were the dream (but of course, there IS that written record ... hmmmm). Before he wakes up, Hank dies in his sleep, so we'll never know for sure.The author clearly holds the misguided assumption that religion is hostile to freedom (see The Theme is Freedom by M. Stanton Evans for a full treatment of this error). He sees morality, human nature and society as being malleable by human reason, rather than as following fixed norms created by God. This way of thinking sees a strong affinity between the (very different) American and French Revolutions and interprets both as a throwing off of the shackles of religion and tradition which are believed to encumber the pure, relativist, rationalist and optimistic vision of liberty. In summary, its a fun story, but suffers from incorrect assumptions about reality."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"The name of the book I am critiquing is A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur&#65533;s Court by Mark Twain tells the story of a Connecticut man who is thrown back in time to the King Arthur time period. He is faced with a lot of these incidents like going to war.It takes place in the nine tenth century in Camelot. I found this book to be a good one because Mark Twain does a great job of putting a picture of what of what the main character is seeing and exepriencing. The details ore so well put that you can almost believe you were their. Also, the way the characters talk and the dialogue is so fitting to the character.Finally, I would recommend this book to teens because a child wouldn&#65533;t get it and I think an adult wouldn&#65533;t be interested. I hope my review has been useful to you."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is an interesting novel written by Mark Twain. This is a fantastic book for the high school level reader, but would be entertaining to adults as well. In this novel the main character, Hank Morgan, is mysteriously transported from the nineteenth century in Connecticut back to the fifth century in England. During his time in medieval Britain, he keeps a journal which is what most of this book is. The preface and afterwards are both the narration of Mark Twain who writes as if he has found Hank's journal, and is merely writing it down in a book. As the journal starts out, Hank is introduced to King Arthur and after narrowly escaping death and becomes the country's most powerful advisor. Hank introduces many modern wonders to this feudal society. He is hailed a magician, being able to perform wonderful &quot;miracles&quot; and &quot;magic&quot;, when it really is only modern science. It is very entertaining to read about how the feeble-minded people of that time react to these feats. In the end, there is a tremendous battle with many exciting episodes leading up to it. If a reader is partial to battle scenes of high caliber, this is a book for him! Of course, Hank has many other battles as well. Once of his biggest enemies is the Church of England. The big question the reader asks themselves during this book is &quot;Will Hank return to his time and if so, how?&quot;. It was exciting for me to ponder this question throughout the novel. During Hank's travels through medieval Britain, he meets many people. The people he meets who think a government ruled by the people in Britain (his ultimate goal) would be a good idea, he sends to Camelot where he has schools set up which teach people about modern governmental ideas. Schools were also set up to teach people how to produce his wonders of modern science. These few enlightened people remain loyal to Hank until the very end. I thought it an entertaining notion that people, who were trained from birth to believe in one thing, could realize its faults and begin to believe another things. I really enjoy this book because it brings a lot about human nature into question. It discusses the vast differences of beliefs, manners, and life styles between one hundred years ago and fourteen hundred years ago. I also thought the differences between classic Arthurian legend and Mark Twain's perspective of the time was very interesting. Hanks training of these idealistic people he runs across plays into the large political aspect of this book. Since Hank's ultimate goal is to transform Britain into a country ruled by the people, he starts factories producing modern goods, which greatly changes the lives of the Britons. I enjoyed the descriptions of the people's reaction to these modern products of science thirteen centuries before they would be invented. Throughout the entire book commentary and philosophizing concerning the comparison of the fifth century feudal system of Britain and the nineteenth century democracy of the U.S. by Hank Morgan is common. This political aspect is typical of Twain's works. It gave me great pleasure to read this aspect of the book and to comprehend it's meaning. Through Hank Morgan, Mark Twain is able to depict vivid images in the readers mind. Whether it is a person, scene, or sensation felt by Hank Twain describes it in a way that puts a solid picture in the imagination of the reader. I have not seen the movie of this novel, but I have heard it isn't very well done and it is nothing compared to the book. I believe this is because Mark Twain paints such a realistic picture in the mind of the reader, it is nothing compared to what some director can film. From Mark Twain's great descriptions and writing style to the unique ideas presented, the novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is a fantastic novel. There are so many aspects of it to enjoy, and it is just an all around entertaining book. I give this book four out of five stars and I recommend it to any one interested in fantasy, especially if they want a different perspective on King Arthur.BY: Christian J. Vazquez"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Mark Twain was one of the United States' greatest writers, but not one of its most brilliant novelists. A case in point is this 1889 novel, \\"A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court.\\"The plot has been redone so many times as to make a synopsis here seem pointless. The title character is a practical-minded factory superintendent from Hartford laid out by a crowbar-wielding worker and transported to the time of King Arthur. After conning the locals by anticipating an eclipse and pretending he has blotted out the sun, the Yankee sets to work reforming Arthur's kingdom in slow degrees, earning the wrath of the wizard Merlin among others.The novel's defenders point out that while written in the guise of a children's novel, \\"A Connecticut Yankee\\" is a cleverly subversive satire that ridicules tradition and progress simultaneously. For seven-eighths of the book, however, it is neither a fair nor a scintillating fight. Our hero, Hank Morgan, is the book's narrator, and perhaps unreliable, but Twain offers no hint of this as Morgan and Twain mock the customs and puncture the myths of this bygone day, informing us whatever existed then couldn't hold a candle to the present day.\\"Somehow, every time the magic of folderol tried conclusions with the magic of science, the magic of folderol got left,\\" Morgan explains.As the book develops, Morgan builds up the society he finds with modern conveyances, including trains, guns, and telephones. At one point in the story, knights ride to battle on bicycles.Anachronism soon devolves as the main source of humor for the book, along with the narrator's off-handed way of telling us about the people he meets, none of whom impress him. One maiden proves such a windy bore it is a surprise to find Morgan later married to her, and quite a fond husband at that. There is one fellow named Clarence who becomes Morgan's chief acolyte, but he only shows up to help Morgan out of the various minor jams that form the narrative thrust of our story.Much of the time, Twain uses Morgan's experience as an excuse to launch into some invective, particularly involving institutions like slavery and the Roman Catholic Church. Critics talk about this as a slam against capitalism, too, but for the most part Twain presents capitalism as a fine and noble thing, ruined only by the blinkered idiocy of Arthur's subjects.Whatever point Twain had in setting this story in Camelot goes by the boards after 50 pages. He references Malory but demonstrates little interest or fondness for the subject. Arthur goes on one meandering journey with Morgan disguised as a serf, Twain borrowing from his own \\"Prince And The Pauper\\", but Arthur otherwise registers little in the story and his court even less. When Arthur's fate is sealed, it occurs off-stage and is presented in the manner of a second-hand report.I got the feeling that Twain had a good idea for a novel but no notion what to do with it. This happens with his novels, like \\"Pudd'nhead Wilson\\" and \\"The Gilded Age.\\" His best-known novel, \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" has a famously disjointed ending, though that wrapper is a regular prize compared to what he does here. It's one of the big \\"huh\\" moments in American literature, exceeded only by those critics who explain why it is so brilliant, because it satirizes the whole message of the rest of the novel or anticipates trench warfare or shows why suits of armor are a bad idea when worn in battle against an electrified fence. To me it's Twain clearly throwing up his arms and leaving his reader in a hole after being dragged around for over 300 pages.Twain knocks off some good one-liners, and does enough with the concept in the beginning that you wish his heart had stayed in the venture. It didn't, but fortunately for his legacy academia has been more than willing to make up for his lack of patience or effort."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"This was one of my favorite books when I was growing up so now that I own a kindle I can reread and enjoy it all over again.

His writing, always funny and warm, tells us first of the history and stories of his beloved river, and then of his experiences learning the steamboat trade. I found his description of being a steamboat student very similar to being a medical student: two-hundred years later and in completely different trades, route memorization and gradual responsibility for people's lives still have much in common. This book made me want to travel the Mississippi, not as it stands today but as it appeared to Twain in his youth. I feel the same way about Gabriel Garcia Marquez and his Magdalena river. I think it is amazing how these inspired authors can make me love a river I have never seen."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Few books exist that speak thru the ages by examining themes and situations that confront people of all time. This is one of those books. Unlike Twain's other classics, the focus of this piece is not America, or topics from American history (i.e. slavery), but more general themes such as industrialization, freedom, religion and religious dogma, government control, the meaning of progress, and individual aspirations versus peer pressure.In short, this book focuses on the adventures of Hank Morgan, a Connecticut Yankee who falls asleep one day, and wakes up in England during the reign of King Arthur. This world of knights, damsels, poor hygiene, and overbearing Christian dogma seems ripe for change for our protaganist. Hank proceeds to introduce \\"progress\\" to this new (old) world in the form of practices, knowledge, and inventions he is familiar with from his time; post Civil War USA. He does this in the name of bettering the lives of those around him, both physically, and emotionally. The result is utter chaos, the destruction of the existing social order, and lessons in colonialism, nation-building, and culture shock that all missionaries, soldiers, politicians and businessmen should heed.Along the way, the book brought both tears and laughter to this reader. One of Twain's strengths is his ability to bring emotion to commonday events by portraying them from various viewpoints. This trait is on display here in its most tragi-comedic form. Overall, a great book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"There is no denying that Mark Twain is one of the best American authors. His wit and caustic style is just one of a kind, and his novels, with the in depth plot and yet witty and sardonic characters and the episodes that are at times comic and serious, is what defines that man and author that you either love or hate. In \\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,\\" it may leave some ambiguous. First of all, the idea is clever: making a man from the 19th century go into another time and era in 6th century Britain so he can critique, satarize, and change the lifestyle of it, therefore creating a \\"frame\\" that helps us to view how synonymous the time era back then somewhat reflects the 19th century. However, the main problem is that it's not consistent. Diving in the first few chapters is just fine, but then the story goes along a bit too slow and becomes too difficult to digest. In other words, it doesn't get to the point, and quite frankly it gets kind of dull. At times i would read one chapter and stop, feeling as if i read over 100 pages in half an hour, exhausted. I can understand why many would enjoy this novel, but it personally didnt do anything for me. If there was more action, movement, and a more firm plot (at times i didn't really understand what stance Mark Twain was trying to make, he seemed to try to make a satire on the society of the 6th century in England but it becomes ambiguous and lost throughout the story), perhaps i would give this book at least 3 stars. Apparently Mark Twain wasn't at his best when he wrote this book. Sure, the wit and humor is still there, but the excitement that drove the reader to keep on reading just isn't there. Not highly recommended, but if you are interested in it, go for it. Regardless, it's still a good story, just didn't work for me."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Mark Twain is indisputably the greatest writer in history, and his wisecracking sense of humor reached its pinnacle in Connecticut Yankee. Far more than a simple time travel book, this book will keep you thinking. One minute the hero is trying to end knighthood once and for all by taping ads to suits of armor and the next minute he is trying to explain supply and demand to an ignorant farmer. The best part of this book is Hank Morgan's journey through the countryside with King Arthur. Though Twain uses his typical sarcastiic tone throughout the novel, it has a very serious, satyrical meaning. I would also like to show that some of us under the age of 18 can still appreciate great literature. Mark Twain was truly a genius, and being a fellow journalist, he is one of my heroes. It is truly a tragedy that other kids cannot recognize the significance of Twain and his works. The only book of his people seem to want to give credit to is Huck Finn because it dealt with racism. Nowadays people think a book can't have a serious meaning unless it involves the persecution of blacks, but Connecticut Yankee is simply a whole lot better than Huck Finn. Every American, every lover of literature should read this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"In Life on the Mississippi the steamboat is depicted as the workhorse of Midwest expansion. Prior to the advent of the railroad efficient inland transportation was confined to waterways and the Mississippi river basin , with \\"about 1,250,000 square miles,\\" was the \\"Body of the Nation.\\" (Twain, preface) Mark Twain fulfills his boyhood dream of becoming a river boat pilot and, returning some twenty-one years later, writes of his youthful experiences and later observationsThe steamboat was a technological phenomena. The vehicle that evolved to meet the unique demands of this particular environment was a special design of river boat. In his own inimical style Mark Twain captures both the excitement of the riverboat's arrival and describes its essential components:\\"She is long and sharp and trim and pretty; she has two tall, fancy-topped chimneys, with a gilded device of some kind swung between them; a fanciful pilothouse, all glass and \\"gingerbread,\\" perched on top of the \\"texas\\" deck behind them; the paddle-boxes are gorgeous with a picture or with gilded rays above the boat's name; the boiler deck; the hurricane deck, and the texas deck are fenced and ornamented with clean white railings; there is a flag gallantly flying from the jack-staff; the furnace doors are open and the fires glaring bravely; the upper decks are black with passengers; the captain stands by the big bell calm, imposing, the envy of all; great volumes of the blackest smoke are rolling and tumbling out of the chimneys...the crew are grouped on the forecastle; the broad stage is run far out over the port bow, and an envied deck hand stands picturesquely on the end of it with a coil of rope in his hand; the pent steam is screaming through the gauge cocks; the captain lifts his hand, a bell rings, the wheels stop; then turn, back, churning the water to foam, and the steamer is at rest.\\" (27)Within a period of ten minutes the boat has been offloaded, loaded and departed. It is an efficiency of system and design ideally suited to its unique purposes, but as the Civil War looms its days are numbered. By then the steamboat had already evolved to it most advanced state and the steam locomotive has become the dominant form of transportationAs a literary piece by a \\"brilliant travel writer and incomparable humorist\\" (Kaplan, in Twain, xvii) Life on the Mississippi earned its accolades, but, as a window into a period of time, one can extract an eyewitnesses truth. In Life on the Mississippi, Mark Twain describes the latter period of the steamboat's heyday dramatically cut short. Wartime technology did not improve the riverboat other than to convert it into an instrument of war. What doomed the steamboat to oblivion was the advent of the steam locomotive and the railroads. The steamboat well served the purposes of river life in its time but was eclipsed by the railroad.That the steamboat was functional is indisputable, but if form determines function, it was a perfect adaptation of a water craft in conformity with purpose and contemporary technology. Combined with light weight and flexible wood construction the steamboat evolved into a shallow draft, wide beamed, low freeboard hull propelled by stern or side paddle wheels. The overall size of a steamboat was a compromise between maneuverability and economy. Power plant, fuel, cargo and passengers were accommodated within a superstructure rising above the hull. Bulk items, machinery, deck hands and low fare passengers were located on the main deck; superior public and private accommodations at higher fares were on the upper decks. Here travelers could enjoy incomparable luxury.High on top of all was the pilothouse. River pilots, by necessity of their position earned through their experience and knowledge of the river, had the best view. By status, they were the pinnacle of river hierarchy. Mark Twain, on his 1882 return to the river, quaintly asks of a fellow passenger he suspects of being a river pilot: \\"Have you ever traveled with a panorama.\\" The passenger responds, \\"I have formerly served in that capacity. [Twain's] suspicion was confirmed.\\" (315) Only higher than the pilothouse were the tall stacks made so for the purpose of disgorging noxious black smoke and dangerous smoldering ash to the wind.All components contributed to functionality, but perhaps the \\"stage\\" or ramp which bridged the gap between the boat and shore, contributed most to its versatility. It enabled the boat to be hailed from landings along the shore without the aid of a dock. As an apprentice, Mark Twain is left alone on the bridge for the first time by his mentor. His initial proud serenity is broken by a sudden awareness that the boat is heading for imminent impact with a \\"bluff reef.\\" His panicked reaction throws the ship into reverse, but he is saved by the return of the pilot who calmly restores order and chastises him. \\"When you have a hail, my boy, you ought to tap the big bell three times before you land, so the engineers can get ready.\\" (53) The \\"bluff reef\\" was actually a wind reef (from the effect of wind on the surface) and they sailed uneventfully through it.The romance of the steamboat era is tarnished by frequent tragedy. Mark Twain loses his brother Henry, a cabin boy on the Pennsylvania, who died when the ship's boilers explode in June 1858. The hazards of operating year round and during night and day, plus the varying river conditions contributed to mistakes of judgment and probably just bad luck too! The pilot may have been king, but he was still human and suffered from the human faults of vain glory, unrealistic confidence, ego, and infallibility.When he returns to the river in 1882 after an absence of twenty-one years, Mark Twain notes the changes that have occurred on the river. There are very few ships left in operation. Passenger travel is limited in frequency and destinations. The romance he once knew is gone, but a new one is beginning, the romance of the rails.Today we know that the railroad too would have its heyday and, in time, its romance would also wane. But has the romance of the steamboat and rail eras disappeared? Today you can take cruises on Mississippi riverboats and luxury train trips across the continent. The difference now is that trips are for novelty and not necessity. The romance only comes from the remembrance of a time past and not the needs of the present."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"I know this book was boring and humorless to a lot of students and I can understand why. Things like the telegraph mean nothing to us now, but in Mark Twain's time it was hot technology like a rocket or the Internet are to us today.Mark Twain was saying, what if we took our modern technology back to a time when people believed in magic and faught with swords and armor. Whoever did this could probably convince these people that the technology was a superior magic and could use this knowledge to dominate them.This is what happens in the story, but only for awhile. Eventually, even the people in King Arthur's court adjust to having the new technology and no longer see it as magic. For example, the people running the telephone exchange don't care about the Connecticut Yankee's &quot;magic&quot; they just want to keep the lines of communication open with Camelot.This kind of story is called &quot;satire&quot;. It is basically a story that teaches us something by making fun of something else. In this story, Mark Twain makes fun of the kind of people who think they can accomplish anything with technology. The Yankee thinks that he can use technology to trick the nights of King Arthur's court and to manipulate them. At first he succeeds, but gradually they become so immersed in the technology that they don't care about magic and legends any more. Once their mental landscape changes, the Yankee has lost the context he needed to control them. The main argument here is that technology does not solve everything, it just produces new problems. And the kind of people who worship technology are bound to fail in one way or another.Hope this helps."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"This is Twaine at his best. The book provokes thought, draws sympathy, and is downright hilarious. It also reads smoothly and at a brisk pace. It's a quick, fun read. I should also emphasize that while this is frequently labelled as children's literature, I find that label to be completely misleading. While it can no doubt be enjoyed by children at their level, there are a number of subtleties, particularly in the humor, that will be beyond the comprehension of most 13 year olds.The most pervasive feature of theme of the book is the ignorance of people in the sixth century. The Yankee is constantly dazzling both king and commoner with all manner of \\"miracles\\" (really just works of engineering or culture that he has as a result of his 19th century education). The people are the most easily duped idiots imaginable, and hold the most base conceptions and prejudices, and have no conception of justice. Twain believes these shortcomings are a product of their environment and education, rather than inherrent deficiencies (\\"training, all is training\\"). He also tackles slavery (an institution out of practice by the time of this book's writing), draws sympathy for slaves, and advocates the equality of all humanity. All pretty simple stuff. At a slightly deeper level, he tackles economic policy, namely protectionism vs. free trade, a debate that raged into his day and even into our own. He ridicules the views of the protectionists and their inability to understand the meaning of real vs. nominal wages, clearly a slap at certain arguments of his own day.Though the social commentary is interesting, if elementary, the satire is by far the best part of this book. Twain takes so many shots at so many targets that it's difficult even for the careful reader to notice them all. By far the funniest character is Alisande, a charicature of Arthurian women, who the yankee pejoritively nicknames \\"Sandy.\\" When she rambles on for hours to no apparent purpose \\"running her mill,\\" by whihc Twain pokes fun both of women in general and of their style of speech in Arthurian literature. A very funny scene is when Sandy relates a story from Thomas Mallory ver batim, with the Yankee constantly interjecting with suggestions to improve Mallory's arid writing style. \\"The Irish guy sounds like all the others, Sandy. You ought to give him a brogue, or at least have him say something like 'be jabbers' so that you'd know it's him speaking,\\" which of course is a suggestion Sandy takes.Another great piece of satire is Twain's commentary on the yankee himself. When he defeats opposing knights, he makes them sell all sorts of trinkets and products, from top hats to soap to stoves, as his way of spreading civilization. Of course these goods don't make a nation civilized, but that the yankee thinks they do is Twain's pejorative commentary as a westerner on eastern materialism. Twain's way of telling it is very funny stuff. There's much more excellent humor that can't be mentioned for the sake of space.The ending is another excellent commentary. The yankee's beautifully crafted civilization crashes down because of the irrascible prejudices of the people, which the church uses to its advantage. Twain's negative view of imperialism is here reflected, in how he depicts the folly of elevating a society by outside influences. A civilization must grow at its own pace, developing its views and values through a long process of trials. Attempts to import institutions from without are bound for failure. Though relevant in Twain's day, this is equally applicable in ours.So, if you want the whole package: a quick, easy read that also provides thought-proviking commentary and great humor, I'd recommend reading this. It would be hard to find a better book that has everything this one does."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Although I usually enjoy Twain's writing style, and his sense of wry humor, there was something about A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court that was less than satisfying.Some of the situations that the protagonist gets himself into are \\"classic\\" Twain. When the narrator is transported back to the time of Camelot, he begins to speculate about rituals, customs and general style of life. There is one part where the townspeople are convinced that he can perform great magical feats (he actually has Merlin as his rival), and when they corner him about performing one, he has to think of a way to please them or face punishment. He realizes that he can remember when an eclipse is going to come, and there is the way out of his situation. There are many adventures, where the narrator becomes critical of their ways, as a time warp will do. He is a fish out of water in many ways in this new world, not understanding, for instance, their need to have extravagant adventures: \\"Hardly a month went by without one of these tramps arriving; and generally loaded with some tale about some princess or other wanting help to get her out of some faraway castle where she was being held in captivity by a lawless scoundrel...\\" Because of his ability to perform great acts, he becomes known as the Boss, and helps to free some poor peasants from terrible punishments.Maybe what made this less of a story was that it became too \\"preachy\\" and filled with social commentary. Although this is what usually makes Twain's novels, here it seemed to detract from the over all story. I was much more interested in hearing about the next adventure, but the narrator continued to rattle on and on about what he felt was wrong with this society. You get the feeling that Twain, not the narrator, is speaking after awhile. In the end, I guess it wasn't really the book I expected it to be. Still, it has its moments, and there are some parts that will have you chuckling to yourself as you read.I consider Twain to be one of my favorite authors, but this is one of his lesser achievements."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"The title also happens to be the plot outline. Elements of the plot have been duplicated in countless books, TV shows and movies. Army of Darkness and MacGyver leap immediately to mind. The book is a fantasy, and if haters can set aside its numerous anachronisms (A man from 1900, for example, would never be able to understand the language of 6th century England), it's quite enjoyable.The novel is considerably more adversarial than one might expect. The main character is uncouth, obnoxious, and a jerk, even more so than is necessary given the immensely frustrating ignorance of the 6th century people. I suspect Twain plugged himself in to the Boss character, and had a good old time writing this one.The main character is out to get the established Church, not in a no-holds-barred, Philip Pullman way, but in a logical way that recognizes the value of faith while tearing down the humanistic and suppressive political and economic machinations of the Church.Twain also takes shots at England through the ages, at its historically oppressive caste system and at the English people's long-running love of hereditary nobility.Commentary on politics and on human nature abound, but A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is still a great adventure story. These two elements step on each other's toes sometimes, but Twain pulls it off.Clunky title. Great book.RECOMMENDED"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"With so many versions of this novel to choose from, it's tough to pick the right one off the shelf.

They were completely under the spell of the Church: 'a united Church means death to human liberty, and paralysis to human thought ... in two or three little centuries it had converted a nation of men to a nation of worms... she invented 'divine right of kings'; she preached (to the commoner) humility, obedience to superiors, the beauty of self-sacrifice, non-resistance under opression and she introduced heritable ranks and aristocracies.'No wonder that the nobility, 'tyrannical, murderous, rapacious and morally rotten as they were, were deeply and enthusiastically religious.'In order to fight against the forces of darkness and to free mankind Hank Morgan creates teacher factories.But he is confronted with the problem of heridity and social conformism: 'There is no such thing as nature; it is merely heredity and training. All that is original in us can be covered up and hidden by the point of a cambric needle, all the rest inherited from a procession of ancestors that stretches back a billion years.'His teacher schools liberate only a few dozens of pupils. With their help, he has to dynamite the whole British aristocracy in order to install his ideal of universal suffrage ('when every man in a State has a vote, brutal laws are impossible').This comical science fiction story is ultimately a very actual political diatribe against exploiting privilege, pure indoctrination and class (in)justice.A must read."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"It is possible to understand what someone is doing, to sympathize with it, and yet not particularly enjoy it. The whole mode of this work, the fantasy, the bringing the Bridgeport foreman Hank Morgan back to medieval England and King Arthur's court as a way of discrediting inherited monarchy, the aristocratic institutions of the past means that the work is on a playing field and in a mode less 'real 'to me than that of 'Huckleberry Finn' 'Tom Sawyer' ' Life on the Mississippi'.Instead of the rich colloquial language of the American worlds Twain grew up in we have here a stilted formal language. True there is something of interest in seeing how the practical, technical, innovative 'modern Yankee' deals with the archaic reality he is presented with.But to my mind the book does not have the real Twain humor, and is more an excursion in 'ideas' than in real three- dimensional characters shaping their lives in the world."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Its theme is the superiority of reason, technology, and intelligence over mysticism, ignorance, and religion. The battle in the closing chapters is spectacular. Gatling guns against a horde."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Who has not wondered what they would do if sent back centuries earlier armed with the knowledge of modern life? Mark Twain is perhaps the first writer (at least the first that I know of) who makes a serious effort (with much comedy thrown in) to consider this question.The main character, Hank Morgan, is mysteriously transported from the then modern age of the late 19th century into the land of Camelot, with King Arthur and his knights. Although the story is well known for the comedic stories within the book, less known is the author's serious statements about human frailties such as prejudice (this book is an outspoken criticism of slavery at a time when the Just Cause myth of the American south was getting its start), superstition, autocracy, blind reliance on tradition, etc. His severity against the Catholic church stings me because that is my faith, but when considering the history of the church and some of the atrocities committed by some church leaders, his denigration is not without some justification.There is much here for philosophical debate. Twain takes an anti-determinist view of what man is capable of accomplishing, but he is fatalistic about the ability of one person to make a lasting change. I think that he missed the point. Hank Morgan failed not so much because of the forces of custom or the clergy, but because he tried force cultural enlightenment. This is like expecting wisdom from ten year olds simply because they have the lessons of their elders available to them. Cultural improvement is a developmental process and comes from self awareness. The character would have also been improved if he had learned more of his own cultural shortcomings from involvement with this different society. Regardless, this is a highly enjoyable book that shows why it, and the author remains of interest over a century later.I disagree with the Editorial Review written by the School Library Journal that this book is recommended for as early as fifth grade. I believe that the subject matter would be better considered and discussed with those in later grades."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court written by Mark Twain is a superb work of literature. This Arthurian novel is different from others because the view point is not from anybody from the round table or that time. The protagonist, Hank Morgan is a blacksmith from 19th century Hartford, Connecticut when he gets hit on the head by a crowbar. Following the incident he is knocked unconscious and transported back in time in a fanciful, diluted dream. There he is taken to Camelot and imprisoned. During his death trial he tricks the court into thinking that he is a magician when he conjures an eclipse. In A Connecticut Yankee Hank rallies against feudalism and idle aristocracy. This novel has become one of my favorites, but I'd only recommend for the 14 or 15+ crowd for Twain's sense of humor and for the confusing Old English."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"\\"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court\\" is one of those rarest literary treasures: a comedy that, for all it's hilarity, actually has both a heart and a brain. Not just a set of cheap laughs, as most comedy of any sort is, Mark Twain's classic novel enlightens as it entertains, throwing an unflinching spotlight on the darker elements of human nature both in the Utopian (to our eyes) Camelot and of modern capitalism and the American Dream.The plot is a familiar one in our age of sci-fi and fantasy, though it was innovative when Twain conceived it: Hank Morgan, an enterprising 19th-century engineer, is knocked unconscious and comes to in King Arthur's fabled Camelot. Bewildered but determined to make the best of the situation, Morgan uses his knowledge of history and mechanical skills to convince everyone he is a super-magician greater than even Merlin. Once ensconced as the King's right-hand man, Morgan sets about reforming the country into a republic, a sort of prototype America. Most of the book follows Morgan through a series of haphazard adventures which Twain uses to illuminate the great but often forgotten evils of the Dark Ages, including the abuses of the Catholic Church, the ignorant and useless ruling body that inevitably arises from a monarchy, and the pitiful working conditions of the medieval peasant or slave.Nor is Twain's critical eye trained only on the far-flung past. Though Morgan is essentially a sympathetic figure, he struggles to find anything the least bit admirable about the knights and nobles he must live with, and considers the chivalric code merely fit for derision. Meanwhile, Morgan's own capitalist code is in full effect, and he takes advantage of every opportunity to cash in his advanced education for the big bucks.Colorful and sublimely written, Twain's time-travel masterpiece is both a magical fantasy and a stinging dystopian satire. Don't be fooled by the several movie versions of this story, some of which are great fun in their own right. Yes, the novel is funny, often riotously so, but the humorous skin hides a deadly earnestness beneath, and the finale is far less optimistic than one who has first seen the film versions will doubtless expect. A deservedly immortal literary gem."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"The book gives a humorous description of what would happen if a modern man was transported to the court of King Arthur.

His years training as a riverboat pilot (when the pilot was in charge, not the captain) and, years later, his visit to the same towns and cities provide a stunning portrait of how the River played a major role in shaping America.

Taking advantage of the superstitiousness of the people, he saves himself from death at the stake by predicting an eclipse. He earns a position secondary to the king and displays nineteenth century technology to the inhabitants. During his stay in Camelot, Hank learns that monarchy, the Established Church, and knight errantry must come to an end.

The journal tells the story of how the man first found himself in King Arthur's time, was taken to prison, and was about to be killed when he remembered that there was to be an eclipse at noon. So, he makes the people believe that he is a great magician and that he made the eclipse happen, so if they don't release him and give him great power, he will never bring the sun back.

The book is about Hank Morgan who is a young man in Connecticut in the 19th century who is sent back to the 13th century. There he barely escapes death, and I mean barely and later serves an important position in King Author's Court. During his time there he introduces 19th Century technology to the people of the land of Camelot, making him an instant hit. Even though he barely escapes death he still makes rude and contreversial coments toward the king. To find out how the book ends you'll just have to read it. This was a really awsome book and I really enjoy it. I would recomend this to anyone who has an imagination and loves to read adventures with humor as well. I really liked this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"This book may seem like a perfectly innocent book that you would want your children to read. Mark Twain's a fabulous American author, right? Well, \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" starts off innocent enough.... Hank Morgan, a factory owner in 19th century Connecticut is hit over the head with a crowbar by a rowdy employee. He is knocked out, and when he awakes he finds himself with Sir. Kay, one of the knights in King Arthur's Court, who brings him back to Camelot to be executed. The beginning of the book shows off Mark Twain's obvious distaste for 6th century society in Britain, but also has a few of its more humorous moments. We learn that the knights of the round table are nothing more than Vulgar Braggarts, we witness the destruction of Merlin (the yankee's enemy)'s tower, the cruelty of Queen Morgan LeFay, and the antics as Hank and Sandy go on a quest to find several captive princesses (who are nothing more than hogs!)Hank impresses everyone by institutionalizing modern conveniences back into that era (trains, telephones, guns, newspapers....) Anyway, the book takes a darker turn when King Arthur and Hank travel incognito as peasants and witness the downtrodden and oppressed peoples. One of the more touching moments of the book is when King Arthur carries a dying girl out of a hut to her mother, risking getting infected with smallpox. It gets even darker when Hank murders 10 knights with a pistol, then later when he and a handful of other men kill off 50,000 knights with high-voltage electric fences, land mines, and trenches with sharp spears sticking out on the bottom, only to almost die from the stench of the dead. This book is better for the mature reader because it deals with many issues of society, such as discrimination between social classes, and not accepting other cultures. I definetly wouldn't reccomend this for: SQUEAMISH PEOPLE, PEOPLE WITH LIMITED READING SKILLS, AND PEOPLE WHO LACK MATURITY. Despite all of the defects of this novel, it sure is a classic!!!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"In this book, It was easy to notice all the small detail such as the accents, rooms of the court's detail and the description of life in Camelot. All those were so detailed it made me think about all the work Mark Twain put into this. This book's detail alone blows any other King Arthur book out of the water. After just reading the first 200 pages, this book has hooked me as its favorite. The beginning was terriffic and will hook you into reading the rest in suspicion about what the Narrator's next adventure will be. The book has taught me (and will teach anyone who reads it) a lot about Camelot and what it would have been like to live there. If you love to read historical fiction books, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Imagine yourself thrown back fourteen hundred years to the kingdom of the legendary Arthur. Add some technical know-how, a touch of arrogance, and a taste for adventure, and you would be Hank Morgan. The successful head superintendent of an arms factory, Morgan is sent back in time by a nasty knock on the head, and finds himself a prisoner at the court of the once and future king. Through an incredible knowledge of astronomy, and mechanics, and his natural intelligence, he finds his way to the top of the Arthurian power structure, and becomes The Boss. Posing as a powerful magician, he impresses the people and the court with magnificent firework displays, stellar predictions, and other \\"tricks\\" that today are taken for granted. As he learns more about the social inequalities in the culture that he has no choice but to live in, he comes to the conclusion that he must free the masses from the oppression of the nobility. Morgan attempts to impose the ideals, governing system, and ways of thinking of the industrialized 19th century onto the primitive 6th century. Secretly, he develops a civilization of his own time inside Arthur's Kingdom, his eventual goal being to destroy every remnant of the old ways, and replace them with the new. Traveling the kingdom, Morgan spreads his influence and his beliefs. He encounters on his adventures both heartbreaking situations of cruelty, and heartwarming scenes of humanity. Throughout the whole kingdom, however, he always sees the need to destroy the feudal system. Twain teaches us something through Morgan's determination, and something else by the calamitous ending of the book. The good: A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur is probably the most accurate of all the king Arthur Legends, as far as describing the daily life, customs, and superstitions of the people of the period. It does not lionize the Knights of the Round Table, but at the same time it does not speak of them as savages, as some accounts do. Similarly, it makes the people out to be decent, simple, and yes, sheep, but not total fools. A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur describes the time impartially, meticulously, and colorfully. There is not the element of glamorization just as there is not the element of degradation. Twain's use of the first-person narration makes the story more realistic; the people who are dying of small pox are horrifyingly well described, and the grandeur with the banners and shining armor at a joust is equally enticing. Most importantly, this book flows well: each event leads to the next, and it all fits together nicely. The twist that Twain puts on the end superbly concludes the story, and it makes you really think. The not-so-good: A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur does move slowly at times. Also, the main character, Hank Morgan, is excessively American. Twain really overuses the baseball metaphors, and Morgan's contempt for all forms of mysticism and non-scientific explanations of things damages the atmosphere of the book. His impatience with the people who do not understand his speech and ideas, and his general attitude of superiority make him slightly less likeable, and more difficult to pay attention to. It is sometimes hard to bear Hank Morgan's thoughtless destruction of 6th century culture, and his obsession with the wonder of technology. The sometimes absurdly long descriptions, vivid pictures of violence, and overall length of this book would make it difficult for people under about twelve or thirteen to enjoy. Mark Twain is sending several messages in writing this book. The first and perhaps most important is that attention should be paid to the way in which a culture develops. Hank ultimately destroys Arthurian England as it was know, because he advances only the parts of the culture that he personally believes to be important. Twain is saying that if we are not involved in our world, everything is out of our control, and we can only hope that the reins fall into the right hands. Morgan's downfall can be attributed to this and to the fact that he disbelieves all other powers besides science, and even more than disbelieves dismisses them. Another main point that this book incorporates is that no one power should be allowed to become too strong. Twain reinforces this point with the examples of the Church and of Hank Morgan. A Yankee at the Court of King Arthur addresses issues that face Mark Twain's time and issues that face ours. It brings many ideas, messages, and themes together into a cohesive body. With Camelot as the backdrop, Morgan's story as the message and Twains engaging style as the messenger, this book is delightful."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"A supervisor (Hank Morgan) in an arms factory in Connecticut is hit along the side of his head with a crowbar and wakes up to discover that he has traveled back in time to England when King Arthur ruled (the year given as 528).

He uses his knowledge of nineteenth-century technology to try and make life better in 6th-century England. But, when he attempts to improve the lot of the peasantry and to end the power of the Knights, he finds himself opposed by the aristocracy, Merlin, and the Church. This is a great satire and illustrates Twain's poor opinions of the aristocracy and of Kings and nobility (&quot;no ability&quot;). Interestingly, it is also the first time-traveling novel in which a character travels to a distant time. (In &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; by Charles Dickens (1843), the main character travels in time is limited to the periods in which he had actually lived.)

But this one is just too much of Mark Twain trying to make nasty remarks in order to be a cynic and too much of pushing American chauvinism, against too little realism to be bearable. Fine, 19th century Americans (and 20th and 21st as well) believe as a religion that their republic was the best invention since sliced bread and every other country in the history of the world was a land of morons. But this story depends on some far-fetched underestimation of human beings (or overestimation of Americans in relation to all others) in combination with sweeping generalizations and a lot of sweeping history under the rug.In short, I didn't like it."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"I was very suprised by the complexity of this book. I had seen the movie with Bing Crosby many years ago and enjoyed it for the light romp that it was. The book delves into the grittier realism that was the 6th century, as well as having lighter moments that showed Mark Twain's relaxed style of story telling."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Mark Twain always good.

A young man tells Morgan is he is in Camelot in the year 528. Not believing the boy, Morgan insists it is the year 1879 in Hartford, Connecticut. Morgan's adventures are written in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, by Mark Twain. Sir Kay throws Morgan in prison after he finds the Yankee and scares him up a tree. Sentenced to death the next day, Morgan performs a \\"miracle\\" before he is hung and King Arthur, believing him to be a wizard, set him free. Slowly, Morgan works his way up to \\"The Boss\\" of King Arthur's court and brings all of his 19th century knowledge to the people of Camelot, such as the telephone and electric lights.Although I would recommend this book to advanced readers, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is over 400 pages and it was difficult for me to get into the story at first. Also, the language was hard to understand. For example, \\"Fair sir, will ye just?\\" and \\"Prithee do not let me.\\" Despite the length and the language, I enjoyed the way Twain used characters and stories from the Arthur legends and formed them into the plot. The book made me think, what would the world be like if some one actually did go back in time?"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Twain brings up a lot of interesting points which, although not new, may seem so because of the manner and voice he uses to bring them up. Some consider this work &quot;chaotic,&quot; but I don't agree. Yes, he does attempt a lot in this work- humor, the relation of an exciting tale, and questioning mankind and society, but the book still has a flow. It contrasts the nineteenth century dependence on technology and efficiency with a pseudo sixth century that uses a caste system and rigidly follows codes of chivalry. The ending was not particularly insightful, as one would expect, but it still satisfied me. The book had me chuckling much of the time- I mean, can you just picture Sir Launcelot with a few hundred knights, in their armor, and riding bicycles?! Or a knight, in the lists at a tournament, being lassoed cowboy style?! It was also interesting to read because it gives you a sense of life in Twain's time, with a few references to the Civil War, or the dispute over currency... And, hey, you've gotta love Hello-Central!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is a comedic novel written by Mark Twain. It is about a 20th century man who goes back in time. The ISBN number is 978-1613823774, and you can purchase it for around ten dollars online.This book is one of Mark Twain's easier reads, and is even an easy read despite being written by Twain. It is also one of the most intriguing books I have ever read.Hilarious does not even begin to describe this book. Mark Twain did an excellent job portraying the life of a Yankee being sent to live in the 12th century. The clothing and culture differences, and the large contrast between his modern innovation knowledge and the medieval world make for great laughs. Throughout the book the Yankee is criticizing the people he meets, while they're doing the same to him. He comments on their clothes, hair, dialect, and even the way the walk.Mark Twain made me think hard in this book with anecdotes and his sarcasm. It all made sense later in the book when he acknowledged and explained what he meant. Most authors would never do that, which makes the book easy to understand.I would recommend this book because it has hard facts, and is brilliantly written with a humorous tone."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Written by Mark Twain long after the age of steamboats, Life on the Mississippi paints a vivid picture of those wild days on the river. Before the channelization projects, before the bank stabilization projects, before channels were marked by buoys or there were radar and sonar to aid pilots on the river, navigating the ever-changing river was truly one of the great feats of the frontier. Twain tells the story first-hand and with his unique combination of wit and descriptive narrative. This is truly an American literary classic and a must-read for anyone interested in 19th century America."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"I remembered reading this a teen and wanted it for my Kindle, especially since it was a freebie.

It has become one of my reference books."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"This is my first exposure to Twain, and I enjoyed it, but it is a bit of an odd book. The first half (or so) is autbiographical--about his learning to be a pilot before the Civil War. The second half is his return to the river in the early 1880s, with many observations about how it and the people who live on it have changed. Throughout, there are engaging anecdotes and stories, many of them mixing humor and horror, and these kept me going through the long stretches about how the river has changed its course through the decades. You can see how Vonnegut and Heller can be seen as Twain's descendents after reading the book--the occassionally morbid, satirical voice that seems to permiate American humor.All in all, a bit of a mixed bag, at least for me. Worth reading, but I wish I had skimmed more passages than I did!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"This book is amusing in some of the same ways that Captain Stormfieldis amusing. A modern man of the time is placed in a different, strange,setting, and gets to make humorous observations about the natives,locals, functionaries and authority figures.Here, the device is time travel, plonking a 19th century American in the middle of a fantasy version of King Arthur's court."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Hank Morgan is a typical Connecticut resident living in the late eighteen-hundreds. He is a clever foreman and loves the technology of his time. One day while at work, Hank is hit with a crowbar and knocked out. When he is finally revived, he finds himself in Camelot in the year 528. Things seem pretty bleak for Hank, who is immediately taken prisoner by a knight and sentenced to die. He uses the knowledge that a solar eclipse is due in order to gain a reputation as a powerful magician, more powerful even than Merlin.Hank quickly adjusts to his position as adviser to King Arthur, and uses his expertise in the areas of science and engineering whenever he sees an opportunity. Soon all of Camelot is connected by telephones and telegraphs, trains are beginning to be built, and knights travel the countryside on bicycles. Hank introduces American systems of money and has plans to turn Camelot into a democracy after Arthur's death.But Hank has enemies, including Merlin and the church. These enemies are powerful and capitalize on the superstitions of the people living in Camelot.This was a very clever book, highlighting some of the weaknesses of a Medieval society, and the things a modern capitalist might do to improve them. Parts of it were slow, but it is a very old book, written in a different style than today's stories, so that is understandable."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"This book--at times disjointed, rambling, self-referential, and irreverent--is decades ahead of its time. It's an interdisciplinarian's dream as Twain takes on economics, geography, politics, ancient and contemporary history, and folklore with equal ease. Mostly though, one appreciates his knack for exaggeration, the tall tale, and the outright lie. It's a triumph of tone, as he lets you in on his wild wit, his keen observation, and his penchant for bending the truth without losing his credibility as a guide.The book's structure is also modern: He recounts his days as a paddlewheel steam boat \\"cub,\\" piloting the hundreds of miles of the Mississippi before the Civil War, then, in Part 2, returns to retrace his paddleboat route. Although a few of his many digressions don't work (they sometimes sound formulaic or too detailed) most of the narrative is extremely entertaining. Twain seems caught between admiration and disdain for the \\"modern\\" age-but he also rejects over-sentimentality over the past. He writes with beauty and cynicism, verve and humor.

Well, now that you've reached adulthood, you should make time to read _Life on the Mississippi_. It's mandatory reading if you live in a state that borders the great river, anywhere from Minnesota down to Louisiana. It's mandatory reading if you have come to that point in life when you can suddenly appreciate American history and post-Civil War stories written by someone who lived through that time.Writing in the first half of the 1870s, Twain retraces the steps of his youth: the watery highway he knew when he trained to be a riverboat pilot nearly 20 years earlier. He speaks of how life _was_ along the river, and what life _became_. It's almost a \\"you can't go home again\\" experience for him, while the reader gets the benefit of discovering both time periods.I have two favorite parts that I share with others. Chapter IX includes a wonderful dissertation about how learning the navigational intricacies of the river caused Twain to lose the ability to see its natural beauty. And Chapter XLV includes an assessment of how the people of the North and the South reacted differently to the war experience. If I were a social studies teacher, I'd use that last passage in a unit on the reconstruction period. So put this title on your vacation reading list, and don't fret: the chapters are short and are many -- 60! -- but you can stop at any time, and the words go by fast. _Life on the Mississippi_ should make you forget all about any Twain trauma and report-writing you may have suffered as a teenager. [This reviewer was an Illinois resident when these comments were written.]"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"This is the book that Mark Twain himself thought to be his greatest. It is basically a memoir in two parts of his life spent on the river with historical sketches, statistics, and other matters thrown in.The first part of the book tells of Twain's early years as a riverboat pilot. He talks about being a cub pilot, about learning about the intricacies of the river and the difficulties of navigating it, and about his mentor Horace Bixby. Twain's love of the river and his pride in \\"mastering\\" it are made obvious in these chapters.The second part recounts Twain's return to the river in 1882, mainly to \\"see it again\\" in preparation of writing this book. Starting in St. Louis, he first goes south through Baton Rouge to New Orleans. He spends a bit of time there and describes life as he sees it in the city (there's a funny chapter regarding the above-ground cemeteries and an argument about cremation). Then he heads north on the steamboat City of Baton Rouge, piloted by his old mentor Horace Bixby. He stops off in Hannibal for three days, just enough time to see how much the town and some old acquaintances have changed, and then continues all the way to St. Paul, Minnesota.Twain's humor, as he recounts conversations with people, sights seen, reminiscences dredged up, and a myriad of other matters that fill the book, is always evident. It's one of the great books on the mighty river, and whether you are a lover of the works of Mark Twain or interested in the Mississippi River during the time period just before and after the Civil War, you will enjoy this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"What a great novel! Twain is wonderfully funny, yet his scathing social commentary concerning his own times are as serious as a heart attack.When a Connecticut Yankee gets sent back in time to King Arthur's Court, he decides his superior knowledge should be used to educate such an \\"ignorant race.\\" Of course, we all know that the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and if I didn't know better, I would say that the person who coined the phrase did so after finishing this novel. The story's main character, Hank Morgan, is a likeable, if not laughable character, yet as most of us already know: absolute power corrupts absolutely. Once technology gets on a roll, the beast of civilization takes off running and Morgan cannot pull in the reigns. Total disaster ensues (incase you had not already guessed).This was a fun read and a look at a problem that is still very much alive today. Too much civilization can be like a disease, especially when those who are working to spread it find that they are doing it for reasons other than altruism.Also, do you remember the scene in \\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\\" when Indiana Jones whips out his gun to shoot the sword-wielding Sultan? That scene was surely lifted from this very book!Trust me, this is a novel for thought, but one that will not bore you. Twain was a master and this is perhaps my favorite of his novels. Very highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"You might wonder what prompted Mark Twain to sidle from \\"straight\\" fiction into the realm of outright fantasy. Twain transports a Connecticut shop foreman twelve centuries into the past [and 5 000 kilometres!] to Camelot and Arthur's court. Initially confused and dismayed, Hank Morgan's Yankee practicality is quickly aroused and he becomes a major figure among the panopolied knights. With the title of The Boss, his rank equals The King or The Pope with its uniqueness. His elevation doesn't distract him from a more profound impulse, however. Hank's Yankee roots and wide experience evoke an ambition - nothing less than revolution. He wants to sweep away the monarchy and aristocracy and establish an American-style republic in Arthurian Britain.Mark Twain's scathing criticism of the sham of hereditary monarchy bolstered by an Established Church makes this among his choicest writings. He resents the condition of a Church which \\"turned a nation of men into a nation of worms.\\" A fervent believer in individual freedom, Twain uses Hank to voice his disdain of Britain's royalty. It's no more than might be expected of a man who boasted of but one ancestor - who sat on the jury that executed Charles I. Hank knows revolutions never succeed when implemented from above. Revolution be achieved only when the individual's attitude changes from meek acceptance toself assertion. Hank's method reaches people through clandestine schools and factories, publication of a newspaper and establishment of a telephone system. These new forms of manufacture and communication become the foundation by which Hank expects to abolish the ancient, mis-named, chivalric tradition. Does he change the course of history?Twain relocates the roots of American democracy from the heart of the frontier yeoman farmer to the brain of the urban industrial worker. Here the man of wide, practical experience shows how to survive compared to those with a formal education. Hank has a simple ambition - establishment of a republic - but utilizes a broad spectrum of ideas to bring it about. He would gladly replace the Established Church of Rome with his own Presbyterian ideals, but is aware that it would be swapping one evil for another. \\"Each man should select his own religion, or make one\\" he contends. Yet, finally, it is this dread force that impairs his desire for change. The final sequence stands as a peer to the biblical Armageddon, Twain wallowing in a frightful bloodletting unseen in any of his other works.Mark Twain contrasts the Reign of Terror of the French Revolution with the centuries of slavery, serfdom, and poverty that killed countless more people than that spasm of excising of aristocracy. What else spurred him to write of human rights with such passion? He had written of slavery before, but this book is especially wrathful in describing the \\"peculiar institution\\" eliminated in his homeland but a generation before. He forces the king to experience the slave's condition, a form of degradation he would have all aristocrats endure. Every feature of the human condition is examined in this timeless treasure. He challenges you to follow his gaze, considering whether today's societies, monarchical or not, will endure the scrutiny."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"As with all of Mark Twain's work this book works on two very different levels. The first of course is a simple adventure story the second is a bitingly satiric work that unmasks many of the hypocracies of \\"conventional wisdom\\".I have to believe that most of his readers of his time (and ours) did not understand his underlying messages regarding society and its institutions. For me, it was hard to miss the way he unmasked the church, the state and society as a whole. I had to laugh out loud at some of the ways he managed to expose the absurdities of government and religion.This book is a quick read and is immensely satisfying if the reader takes the time to follow Twain's logic to its natural conclusions."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"In Life on the Mississippi, Twain recounts his river experiences from boyhood to riverboat captain and beyond. Encompassing the years surrounding the Civil War, this book is an excellent source of 19th-century Americana as well as an anthology of the mighty river itself. Replete with rascally rivermen, riparian hazards, deluge, catastrophe, and charm, Life on the Mississippi is another of Twain's stellar literary achievements.Wit and wisdom are expected from Twain and this book does not disappoint. It is equally valuable for it's period descriptions of the larger river cities (New Orleans, St. Louis, St. Paul), as well as the small town people and places ranging the length of America's imposing central watershed.The advent of railroads signalled the end of the Mississipi's grand age of riverboat traffic, but, never fear, Life on the Mississippi brings it back for the reader as only Samuel Clemens can. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Life on the Mississippi is by far one of the most wonderful books ever written about the post Civil War era in America. Mark Twain takes the reader on a melancholy look at this period of time in history as you journey into the Mississippi of his youth, adulthood, and the people and the communities he knew so well. He conveys a miraculous picture of this lively river giving it the grandeur and prominence it deserves. He defines the river very much like a living organism with a power and personality all its own. As the book unfolds, he begins in his days when he grew up along the river and became a steam boat pilot, ending that career with the advent of the Civil War. Later he returns to the river after some twenty years and takes a journey as a writer from around St. Louis to New Orleans and back up the river into what is present day Minnesota. You learn about the different cultures along the river, its tributaries, as well as the remarkable people who become part of the forgotten history of our nation. Twain's anecdotes are sheer brilliance, and he has an incredible way of choosing just the right story to illustrate a particular point transporting the reader back into time as if it was the present day and you are standing beside Twain observing what he is seeing. His reflections of his times along the river and his descriptions of the people and places make this a true masterpiece of literature and I highly recommend it. I found myself only able to read short portions at a time, as I personally found the sheer beauty of the entire book was a work to be savored and digested rather than rapidly consumed as you would with any other book. As I poured through the book, I felt often as if I was traveling with Mark Twain as a companion along his charming and magnificent journey during a wonderful period of history."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"This is an excellent book. It is by far the best Twain I have read yet, and I give it four stars. In this novel, Mark Twain holds the glory and romance associated with Arthurian Legend up to the standards of 19th century society, and reveals defects in both the romantic ideal of King Arthur and the faith that Twain's generation holds in scientific and social &quot;progress.&quot; Both funny and thought-provoking, this book provides the reader with a new set of eyes with which to view the barbarism and injustice that Arthur and his knights so valiantly fought to preserve. A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is the tale of Hank Morgan, a typical 19th century man who is transported back in time to the days of Merlin, Guinevere, and King Arthur. After becoming aware of his surroundings, and deciding to ignore his uncertainty about whether King Arthur actually existed, this man uses the common knowledge of his time period, his practicality, and some perfectly timed arrogance to acquire a position of great power in this land that he finds repulsive and in need of an enlightened leader. The ensuing story is the tale of what happens when the two utopias collide and this man abuses his power in an attempt to bring the &quot;great and beneficent&quot; miracles of the 19th century to the Age of Chivalry. I would recommend this book to any reader in 8th grade or above, but I would discourage people with passionate faith in the purity and glory of King Arthur from reading this book if they do not want to be forcefully presented with demonstrations of chivalry's inhumanities. A fairly well developed sense of humor will help the reader to enjoy Mark Twain's subtle ironies and satirical situations, and some basic knowledge of science helps in understanding some of the scenes, however this isn't vital to the book. The vocabulary is moderately advanced, the subject matter is somewhat mature at times, and the philosophical reasoning is probably beyond the reach of most Junior High students, yet I would encourage anyone who is interested to give this book a try. This novel is also great for the general public because A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court provides the reader with a main character with whom they may identify. The main character, Hank Morgan is presented with situations in which he must deal with being a stranger in a new atmosphere, being a social outcast due to his uncommon beliefs, he must avoid physical confrontation, and he is forced to use his intellectual abilities rather than brute strength to solve difficult situations. Many readers will have faced similar difficulties in their lives, and this ability to identify with the characters will definitely add to the overall enjoyment of the story. With this piece of work, Mark Twain displays his true talent for excellent writing and story telling. He incorporates enough adventurous and action filled scenarios to make the reader want to continue reading vigorously, yet he also manages to discuss very philosophical and thought-provoking topics during the lulls in the action. This book reads very quickly near the beginning and end. The action tapers off during the middle of the story, but not for long, and once it starts to pick up again, Twain demonstrates his true potential for greatly entertaining writing in the very climactic and cleverly ironic ending that brings this all-around great book to an even better close. This is definitely a book worth reading."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"You probably already know the basic setup: a man from 19th Century Connecticut goes back in time to King Arthur's England. The book is both an adventure story and a social satire. It is in many ways baffling, and is a great attempt but not necessarily a great finished work of literature. The book is confused and ill-organized; attempting to do too many things at the same time. A parody of medieval chivalry and romance, an invective against social inequality and political injustice, an attack on human ignorance and superstition, it is at the same time written as if it were for children. Deadly serious and cynical, the novel is also saturated with lowbrow humor. Despite the disjointed nature of the book, there are many great parts in it, and it is certainly well worth reading."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"I read this recently after having kept a copy around for years; I now wish I had read it years ago. It is witty, observant, and a wonderful slice of American history; thenow-vanished steamboat culture comes alive like nowhereelse. However, the best part is the contrast between the author's confident early youthful years and the much later, postwar years of bittersweet reminiscence and regret for what has passed, never to return. A wonderful book - I simply cannot praise it highly enough."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"If you think Bing Crosby's 1949 movie was anything like Mark Twain's fantasy classic published in 1889...Forget It! Like the precursor novels,'Gulliver's Travels' written in 1726 by Jonathan Swift and 'Alice in Wonderland' written in 1865 by Lewis Carroll were made into movies that are barely representative of the original novels. The film starring Bing Crosby was a musical / comedy only touching on the very basic part of Twain's novel.Mark Twain's view of England's Lifestyle in 528 was very harsh pertaining to church and throne to say the least.On page 246, he says...\\" if one could but force it ( manhood ) out of its timid and suspicious privacy, to overthrow and trample in the mud any throne that ever was set up and any nobility that ever supported it\\". The book has none of the film's niceties, instead it graphically tells of unjust hangings,stake burnings, murder, slavery, and an unfair caste system. This is a brilliant novel written 113 years after the Revolutionary War and 24 years after the Civil War. The contents truly reveal Mark Twain's political and social views, which I think are worthy of the study they have received. For further information on his thoughts see: 'Autobiography of Mark Twain: Volume 1, Reader's Edition (Mark Twain Papers)'.In the year 1879, Hank Morgan ( his name is only mentioned once ), an arms factory foreman, gets into a fight with a man named Hercules ( no, not him ) and wakes up under a tree in King Arthur's Camelot in the year 528! He is captured by the less then adequate knight, Sir Kay. At first Hank thinks he is in an insane asylum, but then as he is brought before The Knights of the Round Table to receive justice, he realizes that he really is in the sixth century. He is stripped naked and sent to the dungeon and sentenced to be burned at the stake the next day. The page, Clarence, visits Hank in the dungeon and is convinced by Hank that Hank's a super magician. Clarence becomes Hank's right hand man. Hank remembers that the next day will have a total eclipse of the sun. He warns King Arthur and Merlin the Magician that he will blot out the sun if they attempt to burn him at the stake. The next day they don't believe him and as they start the fire under Hank, the sun starts to go dark! The King wants Hank to stop it and become the second most powerful man in Camelot. Hank waits for the eclipse to pass and now becomes known as The Boss to the chagrin of Merlin, now a vowed enemy of The Boss.The Boss with the help of Clarence secretly starts many modern businesses, such as; a telephone system, a newspaper business, a railroad, army and naval academies, an arms factory, an electric company and an advertising company with the knights displaying the ads on their armour, just to mention a few of his enterprises. King Arthur requires The Boss to go on a quest with the damsel, Sandy, to save enslaved princesses from three ogres! It turns out to be a pig sty with three farmers. He returns to Camelot a hero with his now beloved Sandy. He then has many adventures in Camelot, such as; jousting tournaments with the knights armed with lances and The Boss with a pistol ( who do you think won? ), the blowing up of Merlin's Tower, the magical repair of the fount at the Valley of Holiness, and many more. At this point The Boss decides to go incognito with King Arthur into the realm of the peasants. They find many injustices and wrongs amongst the people, but before they can return to the castle, they are captured by a earl and sold into slavery. They are accused of murder and sentenced to hang. The Boss escapes and calls Clarence for help. The next day just before they are to be hanged, Lancelot and 500 knights arrive on bicycles to save the day!The ensuing years are good for The Boss, his wife Sandy and their daughter, Hello-Central ( that's right! ). Unbeknownst to The Boss, Merlin has made his family sick, so The Boss takes his family away from England and goes on a long cruise/ vacation to heal. That's when :The expression [the shit hits the fan] is related to, and may well derive from, an old joke. A man in a crowded bar needed to defecate but couldn't find a bathroom, so he went upstairs and used a hole in the floor. Returning, he found everyone had gone except the bartender, who was cowering behind the bar. When the man asked what had happened, the bartender replied, 'Where were you when the shit hit the fan?' [Hugh Rawson, \\"Wicked Words,\\" 1989] This is the best part of the book, the last 100 pages, or so. I never could have predicted the ending. The interesting thing about this book is that Mark Twain is the narrator! The book starts out with Twain on a tour of the Warwick Castle. He is approached by a old man seemingly knowledgeable about the castle and the knights. The old man starts to tell Twain his story from thirteen centuries ago, but grows weary at the Warwick Arms, and before retiring to his room, he hands Twain the manuscript to read. This was a great book and if you only read one classic this year...make it this one!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"In this novel, Twain invented a common fantasy theme: a modern man travels to an ancient era and introduces modern technology and modern political ideas.I found the fantasy part somewhat lurching and disjointed. Major innovations such as the telegraph show up off-stage. Sometimes years pass between chapters with no obvious notice. The ending feels forced, too.The antagonists are a mixed lot. The knights and Merlin are just foils -- always wrong, always stupid. The King is more interesting -- he is invested with personal courage and dignity. Sandy, too, is maddeningly medieval one moment, and a co-conspirator with Boss the next.Mixed in with the scenes about 19th century technology in medieval England, Twain delivers several scenes about medieval justice, nobility, and slavery. He writes fine thunderous fusillades on the side of human dignity and human liberty. These are the best parts of the book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"I really enjoyed this book; it was one of Mark Twain's best, in my opinion. Hank Morgan, a mechanic in a nineteenth century New England factory, is hit on the head during an argument. He wakes to find himself among knights and magicians in King Arthur's court. What follows is a work of satire, in which Twain celebrates ingenuity and democracy over the bumblings of monarchy. But he also asks whether such progress necessarily makes a better society. Gradually as Hank becomes more powerful, he also becomes more ruthless and less able to control events. On top of all that, it was a great story as well. I loved Twain's writing style; it wasn't too overwritten, and I enjoyed the way he alternated from modern style to medieval. Hank's narration is in a more modern style, but the other characters speak with prithees and thous and hasts. Also, the edition I have has wonderful ink illustrations to go with the chapters by Dan Beard. If you've read The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, you'll enjoy this, or even if you haven't, you should try A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.*You can read all of my reviews at my book review [...]*"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"I did not think this was a good book at all. I read this with some friends, and though it made for good discussion, has its funny passages, I think it is a terrible account anything to do with King Arthur and the Holy Grail. Not terrible because it simply makes fun of those things, I could easily digest that, but because it seems to seriously attempt to make the legends seem to be groundless and made up, with none of their hidden meaning and mystery. Besides that, many things in this book are too unrealistic and not well thought out in my opinion."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"My kids love the Arthur and Merlin stories. We have read T. H.

And again. The satire is simply wonderful -- twice as good if you have read Thomas Malory and Chaucer's Canterbury Tales.The section on breaking the enchantment on the well, with the sensational German-sounding incantations, was wonderful. The whole book was entirely enjoyable.Little kids won't get this, unless you are willing to read it all together. Better for big kids.

What an interesting book! I'd never read it before. It's about a guy named Hank Morgan from Connecticut, who gets transported 1300 years back in time to the 590s, and the mythical days of King Arthur. Mr. Morgan is a brilliant, mechanically-inclined, resourceful guy and he goes about trying to civilize the 6th century, by \\"inventing\\" and introducing modern conveniences like the telephone, the steam engine, soap, gun powder, etc. That's fun, of course. I've always enjoyed imagining all the cool stuff I could \\"invent\\" if I was transported back in time. I never realized that someone had written a book about it - let alone Mark Twain! In practice, it would be totally impossible to invent all the stuff that Mr. Morgan invents. Materials just weren't available. But who cares! It's fun to imagine it anyway, and Twain does all kinds of creative stuff with the idea.The book is at turns funny and tragic. The Dark Ages are portrayed as brutal, savage, merciless times...which I'm sure they were. Makes you appreciate living in a modern democracy. Hmmm...what else to say...there's a few weird spots in the book where the story line takes a bit of a sudden jump. One gets the feeling that Twain got fed up with a few bits of it, and just kinda patched it together at those spots. Let's see...what else? The ending is not particularly uplifting, which is too bad...I like my books to end on a happy note. On balance, though, it's pretty good entertainment.'"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Three books in one. 1) Mississippi River history and geography, 2) My life as a riverboater, 3) Return to the steamboats, a miscellany.

Hank Morgan ,the main character, gets cracked on the head with a crowbar while working in his colt-factory in Hartford, Connecticut. He gets put back in time and into King Authors Court were he has to figure out how to get out of being hung by the king for being an outsider.This adventures tale introduces how to never give up and make the best out of a bad situation. Although sounding interesting, parts of the novel are written in old English, therefore recommended from high school up. Personally, the book wasn't the best I had ever read. For a young reader, the book is hard to keep on track when reading the lengthful pages.Sounding interesting, Hank Morgan, the boss, struggles to go through 6th century life. Sounding like you'll get a blast from the past, I myself only give this book two stars. Although many very strong readers may like the novel, many people may get lost in the book by falling asleep on the pages."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"This book A CONNECITICUT YANKEE AT KING ARTHUR'S COURT by Mark Twain is very boaring. It starts out with a fictional character in King Arthur's kingdom. It then creats a labyrinth of problems that the character solves using the technology of his time. It ends triumphantly with Hank (the main character) winning a huge battle for control of England. Although the book had moments where the suspension could be felt by the reader most of the time the descriptions and characters feelings filled the pages with unnecessary narritive. Because of this the racy plot with many intresting characteristics ends up taking a long time and being slowed down by the thoughts of the characters. Although this book is considered a classic its writing could be compared to the writing of Charles Dickens. The plot of the book is well written and thought out but, in an attempt to make the book seem more realistic both authors throw in space-fillers. Also as in GREAT EXPECTATIONS Mark Twain creates a connection between all characters that happens only within a few pages.Because of all the connections in the book the plot can become hard to follow and in order to fully understand the book it is better to glance over what you have just read. The plot at times is to amazing for any reader to believe, the author gives the main character the ability to make all inventions from his time and, at a glance creat new ones. He makes the character follow a heroes journey of sorts, where he must face entire leigons of soliders but wins by flipping a swich or shooting a gun. In a way, however, it is intresting to see how todays knowledge can be used in the past for conquest and for peace. The story the book gives made me think of what would happen if someone actually did go back in time. Because each new chapter in the book introduces a new character or a new problem it makes the reader carefully follow the plot. This creates the need to read every sentence and that is very demanding on the reader.I did not enjoy the book. It was too much to read for such a limited plot and the ideas were repititive. Because of all the different aspects of the book it was barely possible to keep on reading it. Overall I would not reccomend this book as a quick or fun read."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"i have one of the originals of this book and it's so old and crusty and it was so weird and hard to understand with all those big words, and different from the new copies made of it.

He travels back in time to the Middle Ages. He meets new people and pretends he is a magician since he knows so much about the future. He becomes a well known hero throughout the land. The book is pretty much about his successes and adventures as he learns about Medieval times. To me, I thought the book was more on the boring side, but I think someone older might enjoy it more since the book has more complicated events and words. I think it was too long and slow because it would use up pages and pages describing landscapes or how uncomfortable wearing armor is when all I really wanted to do was get to the real point of the story. Also, I don't think the characters were very exciting and interesting because they would never really act like a real person would act during a similar situation. Like how the main character, Hank Morgan, never really wondered how he got to be in the Middle Ages and how he never really missed the 1800's or thought about how he could go back. This all makes up why I don't like this book. So, if you're young and looking for some action or if you're old and looking for some adventure, I would not recommend this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"I have always loved Mark Twain since reading Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer as a kid. At one point I had even memorized \\"The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County\\" as a seventh-grader in Catholic school. Twain has always held a sentimental place close to my heart, so when our book club chose to read and discuss A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, I was all for it.I had heard vaguely of Twain's atheist mindset and his antagonism toward religion in general. But until I read Connecticut Yankee, I had no idea how much irrational and unfounded antipathy Twain had for the Catholic Church in particular. The pervasive theme in Connecticut Yankee is that our modern enlightened world is far superior to that which went before and that the \\"bad old days\\" of slavery and oppression were almost completely the fault of the Catholic Church. This anti-Catholic sentiment can hardly be denied as Twain himself urged reviewers not to mention it when the book first came out. \\"Please don't let on that there are any slurs at the Church,\\" he told a sympathetic reviewer in the Boston Herald. \\"I want to catch the reader unawares, and modify his views if I can.\\"So Twain engaged in what we know today as the \\"last acceptable prejudice.\\" By way of a simple comparison, let us imagine that, instead of Catholics, Twain had chosen Jews, Mormons, or Evangelicals as the villains of Connecticut Yankee. Would it still occupy the exalted position it does as an American classic? Or would it be relegated to those dusty shelves where reside other scurrilous works or racist manifestos to be studied as a historical curiosity of a meaner age?For me, the most annoying aspect of Connecticut Yankee was Twain's almost total ignorance of history--or, perhaps more accurately, his decision to turn history on its head to better fit his polemical aims of blaming all the ills of society on the Catholic Church. This is a classic example of what happens, I suppose, when a journalist with a wide breadth of knowledge but no depth attempts to novelize about a historical subject. To address some of Twain's errors:1.) Slavery in antiquity was in no way the fault of the Church. That pernicious institution long predated Christianity and was endemic to classical pagan societies. Indeed, the Church has a long history of making the lot of slaves more tolerable and being among the premier abolitionist institutions in the world.2.) The idea that the Church suppresses intellectual freedom is a fable made up during the Protestant rebellion, though it is heartily embraced by Twain. Far more erudite scholars than I have examined this fallacy in detail, so rather than address this topic in detail here, I would point the reader to Tom Woods's excellent book,How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization.3.) Twain writes naively of democracy, putting in Hank Morgan's mouth the notion that \\"Where every man in a state has a vote, brutal laws are impossible.\\" One wonders what Twain would have made of our modern America, where not only every man, but every woman has a vote, and yet the ghastly practice of abortion is not only legal, but enshrined as a human right. Democracy of itself does not ensure enlightened government. Without the temper of religion, democracy is as likely to produce brutal and repulsive laws as the worst monarchy. De Tocqueville understood this. It's a wonder that Twain did not.There are many more, but this review is already more prolix that I had intended.As always, Twain's writing sparkles in Connecticut Yankee and his lampooning of the style of Mallory is very funny. His characters, however, viewed 120 years later, are crudely drawn. Hank Morgan is an Alger-esque self-made man whose compendious knowledge of all subjects is just a little too convenient. The legendary Arthurians are all soulless pawns that Twain moves around to further his polemic. No insight is offered into their characters at all. They are all cruel and completely self-serving--as they must be in Twain's mind because they belong to the aristocracy. The story ends on a bizarrely depressing note for a tale that was predominantly a humorous satire for the first seven-eighths of its length.In short, this is not a book I will be reading to my kids as a bedtime story. For me, it is to be considered a shameful period piece, written at a time when it was acceptable and even laudatory to be a Know-Nothing and make up slanders about the Catholic Church. That it is a cleverly-written slander is only another mark against it. Amusing slanders are pleasing to read but have the potential to do real harm both to the target and the reader."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"This was a very entertaining and interesting book. I thought Twain did a great job incorporating the newer (of his time) technologies into the old mid evil times. Not only did I think he did this very well; he had a very interesting take at explaining the great achievements of knights that do not seem to be what we would consider real. Like when knights fought giants and things of that nature, and how magic was explained. I thought it was interesting how he explained that a lot of the knights did not really do a lot of the things that they said, like kill ogres and giants, they only said they did because no one was around, and no one ever questioned the adventures that the knights told of. Another cool thing was how he incorporated newer technologies, like gunpowder, into how he did his \\"magic\\" and made people believe that he was a great sorcerer. This was a very good and interesting book, and I would recommend it to anyone."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"I purchased this edition of Life on the Mississippi because I know that Library of America books are the highest quality and most definitive editions available of the works they publish.This edition includes an introduction written by Jonathan Rabin, a British travel writer and novelist (Passage to Juneau,Bad Land: An American Romance(winner of a National Book Critics Circle Award),Old Glory: A Voyage Down the Mississippi, andSurveillance). It also includes an 8 page chronology of Twain's life, notes on the text used in the book, and footnotes.The book is a paperback but larger format than most - essentially identical in size to the Library of America hardcover editions - and as all other LOA editions it is printed on very high quality paper (acid free).In his introduction, Rabin states that \\"Later in life, Twain would claim Life on the Mississippi as his own favorite among his books\\", and articles originally appearing in the Atlantic Monthly in 1875 served as the starting point.This is nonfiction from Mark Twain, reporting his recollections of experiences he gained beginning in about April, 1857, when he became a cub pilot on the Mississippi, and culminating in May 1861, when he made his last trip on the river as a pilot (at age 25). Being nonfiction it is unlike his novels Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, but it is every bit as enjoyable to read.This Library of America printing is a fine edition to purchase if you want a high quality book for your library, and you care that the text of the book is the most accurate available (see below), and it is very reasonably priced. There are many different and cheaper printings available, but not to these standards. This is the version I will always recommend to anyone wanting to add this to their collection or give to someone as a gift.For those who are interested in the specifics of why this edition is different from ANY other presently available (other than LOA's own hardcover), I offer the following, from the Library of America website (this came from their explanation for the hardcover LOA bookMark Twain : Mississippi Writings : Tom Sawyer, Life on the Mississippi, Huckleberry Finn, Pudd'nhead Wilsonwhich in addition to Life on the Mississippi, includes the three mentioned other novels by Twain. I have edited this to retain only the comments relevant to Life on the Mississippi:---------------\\"The book reprinted in this volume is presented in the best text now available. As early as January, 1866, Clemens had contemplated writing a travel book about the Mississippi River. Five years later, he told his wife that he proposed to spend two months on the river and take notes, but the actual beginning of \\"the Mississippi book\\" did not come until William Dean Howells, editor of the Atlantic Monthly, pressed Clemens for a contribution to follow \\"A True Story\\" (November, 1874). Clemens wrote twice to Howells on October 24, 1874, first to say \\"my head won't 'go,' \\" next to propose a topic. While walking in the woods with his friend and pastor, Joseph Twichell, he explained, he \\"got to telling him about old Mississippi days of steamboating glory & grandeur\\" as he had seen them from the pilot house. Twichell exclaimed, \\"What a virgin subject to hurl into a magazine!\\" The work that resulted went into seven issues of the Atlantic, January through August, 1875, omitting July.The contribution to the Atlantic was not nearly enough to make a subscription book, however, and only after a series of efforts to persuade Howells or some other friend to accompany him on a note-taking visit to the Mississippi did Clemens at last undertake the journey in 1882. By the terms of his contract for the book with James R. Osgood, Clemens became in effect his own publisher, Osgood--who had no experience in the publishing of subscription books--his agent.Clemens redivided chapters, revised chapter titles, added \\"The Record of Some Famous Trips\\" (334-36), made perhaps forty-five other changes, and the Atlantic material became chapters IV through XVII of the book. In composing the additional forty-six chapters--a wearying task--Clemens made voluminous use of his own travel notes and padded the work with previously written but unpublished tales, such as \\"The Professor's Yarn\\" (chapter XXXVI). He also borrowed perhaps 11,000 words from other writers. Most interestingly, he took the \\"raft passage\\" from his manuscript for what later became Adventures of Huckleberry Finn and incorporated it in \\"Frescoes from the Past\\" (chapter III). Indeed, he crowded so many pages into his manuscript that some became superfluous; he was able to omit some 13,000 to 15,000 words and to move other material to appendices.The first American edition (1883) is reprinted here. Ultimately, the methodically prepared text of the future will involve a comparison of the first American edition and the holograph manuscript held since 1909 by the J. Pierpont Morgan Library. The manuscript contains matter not in the book, and the book, matter not in the manuscript. Except for a few pages that Clemens called \\"the eighth batch\\" and--because of the illness of his typist--sent to Osgood in holograph form, the first American edition was set from a typescript made from the Morgan manuscript. Only a few pages of the typescript survive (at the Morgan Library and at the Houghton Library, Harvard). Clemens revised both the typescript and printer's proofs. That collating the manuscript with the first American edition will reveal errors in the book text has been shown by Willis Wager in \\"A Critical Edition of the Morgan Manuscript of Mark Twain's Life on the Mississippi,\\" a dissertation submitted at New York University, Washington Square College, 1942. A few original manuscript readings are given in the notes that follow at 233.3, 380.14, 451.32, and 516.27-28.The standards for American English continue to fluctuate and in some ways were different in earlier periods from what they are now. In nineteenth-century writings, for example, a word might be spelled in more than one way, even in the same work. Commas could be used expressively to suggest the movements of voice, and capitals sometimes gave significances to a word beyond those it might have in its lower-case form. Since modernization would remove these effects, this volume has preserved the spelling, punctuation, capitalization, and wording of the editions reprinted here.The present edition is concerned only with presenting the texts of these editions; it does not attempt to reproduce features of the typographic design--such as the display capitalization of chapter openings. Footnotes within the text are those supplied by Clemens. Open contractions are retained if they appeared in the original edition. Typographical errors in the other editions used here have also been corrected.\\"---------------"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"This item arrived in excellent condition.

The beginning of the book had a very interesting attention grabber. Hank Morgan, the main character, was at the colt factory where he worked when he got into a heated fight with a co-worker, Hercules. Hank then got hit in the head with a crowbar, passed out, and awoke to find himself in 6th century England. This introduction to the book made for a real page turner.I also liked the ways that Hank fooled everyone throughout the story with his \\"magic\\". Everyone thought he was a sourcerer because they thought he made the sky completely black, where as it was really a luner eclipse that he knew was going to happen from being from the future. He also said that he could blow up Merlins Tower by fire sent from the sky, but he really used explosives. He used his knowledge and newer inverntions to his advantage when he went back in time because they were things people from 6th century England never knew about.Mark Twain also used a lot of imagery in this book. I feel that it gave a better understanding of what was going on and it made the book exciting to read.One of the reason I only gave this book four stars is because I didn't like Hank and Merlins relationship. I think they should have gotten along instead of fighting and butting heads throughout the whole story. Mark Twain waited until the end of the story for them to get along whereas if he had done so sooner, the two of them would have gotten more accomplished throughout the story.The other thing i didn't like about the book was Hank and Sandie's kids name, \\"Hello-Central\\". To me there seemed to be an unclear meaning behind the name and i'm really not sure why that name was chosen. I think there could have been a better plot behind it or a better name could have been chosen.All in all, I think this is a wonderful book for anyone with an imagination to read and I would definatly recomend it to people in the future."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"In &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court&quot;, Hank Morgan is transported to the legendary times of King Arthur and Camelot.

There's the maiden, Sandy, who, while accompanying Hank on a quest, drones on and on unstopably about the stupidest things!

Twain's amazing degree of perception of, and attunement with, the essence of Humanity is on ample display in \\"Life on the Mississippi\\" and readers even in this generation nearly 150 year hence will see and feel the almost eerie connection Twain achieved with the eternal Humanity in all of us. Add to that the fact that Twain's \\"Life on the Mississippi\\" is an exquisitely-crafted, often-poignant, oftener humorous panorama of a gorgeous part of our country during a truly wondrous and kaleidoscopic era of our national journey.

There's a scene at the beginning where cub pilot Twain is being quizzed by his mentor on previous sightings on the river. Twain cannot remember a single piece of information. His mentor cusses him and asks why he thinks he was telling him them. Twain replies sheepishly that perhaps he was trying to entertain him.

I think this may have been on purpose, maybe to ingrain (or prop up) the author's desire to juxtapose the two societies, so that the reader can never be too sure that a comment is applicable to then or now. Another thing I disliked was the Boss. He is our main character, and he's supposed to be our link and guide to what is good and lacking between the two societies. Instead he's an unreliable narrator, more guilty of the crimes than the people he attacks.An added point, that I don't think is necessarily inherent in the novel, but one that kept occurring to me as I read, was the question of whether we are actually more intelligent now than in the past. it may seem that we are, because we have the accumulated knowledge of all those that went before us, but are we really smarter? Are we smarter than Twain? King Arthur? Oommgogutuktuk at the discovery of fire? And add to that the particular sharpened stick of hindsight? Would we fare better with our big brains and our racial memories at any time before us?

Just as I have come to expect. Thanks"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"&quot;Life On the Mississippi&quot; is Mark Twain's tribute to the Mississippi River, which surrounded the earlier part of his life. Mark Twain had been in awe of the river for many years; and inspired him to become a river boat pilot - explained in length in this book; much of which is quite humorous, while other parts are heartbreaking, including that of the horrible death of his brother, Henry.One of the main complaints about this book that some people have is that is uses too many facts and figures, which tends to bog the reader down. This is true. Yet, the avid reader, and Mark Twain enthusiast, will not bypass these chapters. We will revel in them, and read them with inspired intent; simply because the Mississippi River has been such an integral part of Mark Twain's life, that the more we get to know about the river, the more we get to know about the real Mark Twain.&quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; is a work of nonfiction; perhaps Twain's truest account of historical fact concerning his life. For those who are just getting interested in knowing about Mark Twain's writings, I would recommend reading &quot;Roughing It&quot;; as it is humurous throughout. &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; would be the second book I would recommend."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"What else can be said about Twain except great story. Imaginative work paralleling medieval England with Industrial America in the lat 19th century. Witty, adventurous and well written. I have yet to read a Twain book I disliked."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is an intriguing novel written by Mark Twain. This is a fantastic book for the high school level reader, but would be entertaining to adults as well. I am a freshman in high school, and I enjoyed many attributes of the plot and writing style. In this novel the main character, Hank Morgan, is mysteriously transported from the nineteenth century in Connecticut back to the fifth century in England. During his time in medieval Britain, he keeps a journal which is what most of this book is. The preface and afterwards are both the narration of Mark Twain who writes as if he has found Hank's journal, and is merely writing it down in a book. As the journal starts out, Hank is introduced to King Arthur and after narrowly escaping death and becomes the country's most powerful advisor. Hank introduces many modern wonders to this feudal society. He is hailed a magician, being able to perform wonderful &quot;miracles&quot; and &quot;magic&quot;, when it really is only modern science. It is very entertaining to read about how the feeble-minded people of that time react to these feats. In the end, there is a tremendous battle with many exciting episodes leading up to it. If a reader is partial to battle scenes of high caliber, this is a book for him! Of course, Hank has many other battles as well. Once of his biggest enemies is the Church of England. The big question the reader asks themselves during this book is &quot;Will Hank return to his time and if so, how?&quot;. It was exciting for me to ponder this question throughout the novel. During Hank's travels through medieval Britain, he meets many people. The people he meets who think a government ruled by the people in Britain (his ultimate goal) would be a good idea, he sends to Camelot where he has schools set up which teach people about modern governmental ideas. Schools were also set up to teach people how to produce his wonders of modern science. These few enlightened people remain loyal to Hank until the very end. I thought it an entertaining notion that people who were trained from birth to believe in one thing, could realize it's faults and begin to believe another things. I really enjoy this book because it brings a lot about human nature into question. It discusses the vast differences of beliefs, manners, and life styles between one hundred years ago and fourteen hundred years ago. I also thought the differences between classic Arthurian legend and Mark Twain's perspective of the time were very interesting. Hanks training of these idealistic people he runs across plays into the large political aspect of this book. Since Hank's ultimate goal is to transform Britain into a country ruled by the people, he starts factories producing modern goods which greatly changes the lives of the Britons. I enjoyed the descriptions of the people's reaction to these modern products of science thirteen centuries before they would be invented. Throughout the entire book commentary and philosophizing concerning the comparison of the fifth century feudal system of Britain and the nineteenth century democracy of the U.S. by Hank Morgan is common. This political aspect is typical of Twain's works. It gave me great pleasure to read this aspect of the book and to comprehend it's meaning. Through Hank Morgan, Mark Twain is able to depict vivid images in the readers mind. Whether it be a person, scene, or sensation felt by Hank Twain describes it in a way which puts a solid picture in the imagination of the reader. I have not seen the movie of this novel, but I have heard it isn't very well done and it is nothing compared to the book. I believe this is because Mark Twain paints such a realistic picture in the mind of the reader, it is nothing compared to what some director can film. From Mark Twain's great descriptions and writing style to the unique ideas presented, the novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is a fantastic novel. There are so many aspects of it to enjoy, and it is just an all around entertaining book. I give this book four out of five stars and I recommend it to any one interested in fantasy, especially if they want a different perspective on King Arthur."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"You think that you would know what to expect from Twain after having read much of his fiction, but that just isn't the case. After having read this book, I am convinced that, had Twain put his mind to it, he could have written about two snails racing and it would have been funny, interesting, and enthralling. I just could not put this book down, as I realized that the only thing better than Mark Twain's fiction is wondering about how real his nonfiction is! Twain's humor never fails him. I have never encountered a book that is so mentally involving, yet so relaxing. I say \\"involving\\" because Twain seems to use just the right words and phrases to stimulate the imagination. My recommendation is to grab yourself a hammock, set it up next to a river or stream, and sip on lemonade while reading and chuckling. This book provided me with a few of my best spent hours on a summer's day that I could imagine. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"To me, this book seemed like several rather disjointed chunks of writing about Twain's Mississippi experience. I don't know what happened. Maybe he compiled all his scraps of material about this period and threw them together, not bothering with transitions or filling in gaps, or smoothing out the narrative flow.In any case, I found the writing delightful and in places laugh-aloud funny. I even typed out several large passages in a letter I was writing to my brother. The letter must have taken me an hour to write but I just had to share those passages with someone. That's how good Twain is. You want to share him with others who enjoy fine writing.I'm not sure I'd go so far as to say this is Twain's finest book. But it is well worth reading and it lays out in detail perhaps the cross section of Twain's life that he enjoyed most."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"My first copy of this absorbing work was a small, compact edition published by the Oxford University Press. I read it by candle-light and found myself borne into another world, transported. In the early chapters, Twain focuses on his introduction to steamboating - he wears his YOUTH on his sleeve, recounting his cub-piloting experiences with the delight of a child. In the latter chapters, set in the post Civil-War era, Twain focuses on his returning impressions - he wears his HEART on his sleeve, remembering the world of his youth, burdened by sweet nostalgia, and a sense of finality and loss. If you have ever been young, you will laugh, and if you have a heart, you will probably shed a tear. No other writer in American literature has so completely combined a genius for wit and humanity. This is one of those rare books that can be read more than once, and enjoyed even more the second time."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"He picks you up off the spot where you are sitting and places you standing on the deck of a Mississippi riverboat in pre-Civil War America. His writing craft is so vivid, detailed, and compelling that you feel as if you yourself have followed each bend and turn, avoided each logjam, and squinted over the bow each starlit night of a journey down the mighty Mississippi River. Additionally, he adds context to the voyage, in the form of digressions about the times, the way peole thought and acted, real items from newspapers of the era, and his own opinions and observations of human nature. It is not a novel. It is non-fiction, but it's writing style makes it as readable as a novel. It was pure pleasure"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Was Twain the greatest writer America ever produced? Certainly no other author has written so many genres so well. Life on the Mississippi is one of my favorites by Twain. What a storyteller! From his own personal experiences to explorers, psychics, the Civil War, slavery, geography, steamboat history etc. Twain gives us a glimpse into himself and his country.Twain is of course humorous in this book, but his lesser known quality--insight--is very keen in this book. Twain's style is at once sophisticated and simple. It is pure mastery.While this may not be up there with some of other Twain's writings, it is certainly worth the time and money. Definitely recommended."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"It was one of Arthur C. Clarke's laws that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Mark Twain predated Clarke by several decades, but he seemed well aware of the idea behind the law, as demonstrated by his novel, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.The title character is Hank Morgan, a late-19th-century New Englander who - by a blow to the head - is transported back to Camelot. This is no mere dream, however; it appears Morgan is actually there. He quickly learns that all is not nearly romantic as the tales of Arthur and chivalry might suggest; instead, this is a land of ignorance, violence and oppression.Morgan's technological and scientific know-how makes him appear to be a great wizard, much more respectable than the flim-flamming Merlin. First by taking advantage of a convenient solar eclipse, Morgan is soon elevated to being Arthur's prime minister, and starts a process of transforming Old England into New England. Paradoxes don't seem much of a concern.This novel - one of the earliest time travel stories - is an often clever satire with many targets, particularly slavery and caste systems, economics, religion (particularly Catholicism) and the idea of chivalry. Only the most basic framework of the Arthurian legends are \\"true\\" in this book. Where the book is a bit weak is when it gets too talky; there are also not many interesting characters outside of Hank himself. Overall, this is a good book, but it is not Twain's best."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"\\"Life on the Mississippi\\" by Mark Twain is no doubt a classic memoir from the Civil War generation. Although Twain was smart enough not to remain with the southern armies for more than a few weeks, his life is still very much part of that era. His most famous book, \\" The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn\\" (which was inspired by the trip along the Mississippi river described in this book), is considered one of the first books which touches upon the racism of the south and its often backward traditions. Twain's work is unique because he is not a northerner like Harriet Beecher Stowe, heralding the inequities of southern life without really living in that region. Twain was from the border state of Missouri.He certainly embodied the divided feelings of his homeland in regards to the times. As witnessed in the book, there is much reverence and nostalgia for the old south along the river that Twain knew so well, but he is able to poke fun at its eccentricities with a wit that perhaps was Twains defining feature as a writer. The sense of personal conflict is a classic point of reference for most writers to the point of sounding clich&eacute;, but Twain's writing is the model from which the clich&eacute;s are derived.The main impetus behind Twain's journey is chronicled in his pages, which is his comparison of life before and after the war. Just as Huckleberry Finn was written twenty years after the war, this book could have only been composed after a considerable interval of time. It is both Twain's memoir of his life as a steamboat pilot and retrospective of the glory days on the river upon returning there in the early 1880's. The steamboat trade is a shadow of its former self as river commerce had been replaced by the railroads. In these shadows Twain writes of all sorts of tales and memories of each part of the river as he travels along it, often concealing his true identity for the sake of getting objective information. The reader can see right away that there is a fondness for tall tales and exaggerations amongst the river folk, as many romanticize the past. Twain's writing seems quite level headed throughout, as he is able to sort through the \\"river lore\\" and relate the important and practical aspects of river travel to the reader (but that is not to say that he is exempt from embellishing to keep the reader on his toes).One aspect of the writing that I thought interesting was Twain's focus upon the practical details of his early days as a steamboat pilot's apprentice. When many think of Mark Twain, romantic notions of travel and freedom are brought to mind, but Twain's first 100 pages is all about the skills of the trade in an ever changing river. The flawless memory needed for the job was quite impressive and no doubt fed his ability to recall his life's work later on. Many forget the man's practicality, which gave him unique insight into the social milieus that he often lampooned or mocked.The mix of personal memoir and river history is done seamlessly, as Twain's early memories are intertwined with certain portions of the river. Just as an aging man looks upon his youth with fondness, Twain recalls the exciting days on the steamboats, evoking a sense of nostalgia for a youth and culture that have passed into history."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"The story of Hank Morgan, the plucky supervisor in a gun factory in the late 1800s, who is knocked out and wakes up under a tree in the times of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. He is promptly captured and condemned to death, but saves his neck through his knowledge of a solar eclipse in the 6th century, which happens to occur the following day. He plays this to his advantage along with his knowledge of 19th century technology and quickly gains a reputation as a magician more powerful than Merlin. He becomes known as \\"The Boss\\" and secures a place in the government of King Arthur and sets about secretly to change the primitive and savage ways of the people, even daring to challenge \\"the Church\\" (the Catholic Church) and trying to institute modern freedoms.The satire is classic Mark Twain, and the situations Hank finds himself in (and his responses to them) are often very humorous. The story, however, was obviously meant as a more serious criticism of the idea of monarchy and especially of the abuses of religion when there is no freedom to choose. While I have no complaint with his logic and reasoning, I found it tiresome to continually read his folksy diatribes on the concepts of noble birth or religion - especially when the same argument popped up so often. What started out as an amusing tale became rather boring when the story stopped for these editorials. In the end, it just wasn't a very endearing story; funny and interesting at times but not enough to warrant a full four stars - call it 3 and a half."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Mark Twain (1835-1910) grew up along the banks of the Mississippi River, and he captures the feel of the mighty river during the steamboat era in this superb narrative and memoir. I particularly liked the earlier chapters, as Twain describes his youthful tutelage as an aspiring steamboat pilot in the years before the Civil War. Readers see what it was like guiding a steamboat over a river full of dangerous snags and sandbars - in clear daylight, through thick fog, and on moonless nights. The author then jumps ahead to his middle age - describing life along the river and in the South after the Civil War, and including politics, epidemics, and the supplanting of steamboats by railroads. The book's second half lacks a bit of the magic found earlier, but remains eminently readable and informative. This is a remarkable narrative by a great writer."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"I read this book when I was young and going through a Mark Twain phase. I enjoyed it. I re-read it when I was in the Peace Corps serving overseas, and I was struck by two things: First, Samuel Clemens understood the world in such an extraordinary way that, at times, he must have felt like a voice in the wilderness (yet, he was willing to share himself with the world). Second, if you are going to go live in someone else's world, you must realize neither you nor those around you will ever be the same...growth, change, challenge can be incredibly beneficial, but you will lose some part of yourself and take something away from others.I'll be reading this again throughout my life. I can only imagine what else I will learn."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"It is not Twain's best book, and certainly not the same as something like Huckleberry Finn, however this is highly recommended reading. The satire is excellent, and although some people who may be a little too serious about Arthurian legends may not appreciate it, I certainly did. Based on this book I would guess that Mark Twain would've been the among the best, and definitely the funniest, science fiction writers of all time if he had decided to follow that path. This book is great for anyone who loves the humor of Mark Twain."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Wow! That is the one word I have for this book, Wow. Twain once again shows that he is utterly and purely a genius in disguise. Our character is carried from the 19th century all the way back to the 6th century by a blow in the head. A man used to telephones, cigars and newspapers he is completely and utterly suprised by the simpleness and ignorance of mankind in the 6th century.After escaping from a fiery death using his knowledge of eclipses, he emerges from King Arthurs castle hailed as the greatest and most powerful magician that ever lived, he sets out to try to \\"modernize\\" Camelot. With the help of Clarence, a trusty righthand man that he met while he was a prisoner he sets up a telephone system, introduces a newspaper, starts a line of advertising, tries to convince the populace to use soap, along with many other things. Our character also takes part in some very distructive things like trying to overthrow the Church and the King, he even thinks of becoming president one day.Not everyone becomes his friend however, there is one guy in particular who is not so keen on the idea of him becoming \\"The Boss\\". His name is Merlin and he used to be a wonderfully respected magician until our character came along. Now everyone has lost interest in him because they have mover on to bigger and better magicians. Merlin shows contemt and disdain several times throughout the book, trying to win back his title. He never suceeds which I found quite humorous.In conclusion I did like this book because it was witty and slightly far-fetched. The idea of a telephone system, a printing press or the King riding a bicycle is simply prepsterous and therefore humorous. To put it simply, I loved this book because I got a kick out of it."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Almost all of the novel features the narration of Hank Morgan, a foreman at a weapons factory in Connecticut who in the year 1879 is hit on the forehead by a crowbar by one of his unruly workers. When Hank wakes up he finds himself in England in the Sixth Century where King Arthur reigns.He is captured by a knight, brought to Arthur's castle and it is determined that he should be executed for he seems to be some strange demon sorcerer, what with his 19th century clothes and speech. But he just happens to be in possesion of the knowledge that on that particular day on which he finds himself in the sixth century, a total eclipse is going to occur. Of course, 6th century England dosen't know anything about eclipses and thinks such natural occurances are the work of various demon sorcerors or signs of god's anger and so on. Hank threatens to use his powers of sorcery to cause the sun to be completely blotted if they go through with his execution. The eclipse occurs and the people in the court are thus flabbergasted. King Arthur makes Hank his Prime Minister and Hank uses his political powers over the next decade or decade and a half to use his elementary knowledge of late 19th century technology and institutions to reform Arthur's kingdom. He introduces telephones, telegraphs, grammar schools, military academies, newspapers. He tries to reduce the barbaric oppression of the serfs and slaves. He tries to introduce enlightenment ideals in the country. He successfully discredits Merlin, the charlatan court magician, in part by pretending to perform miracles, using his knowledge of electricity and construction of munititions. 6th century England, of course is completely ignorant of all these technologies and so takes Hank's use of them as evidence of his extraordinary supernatural powers. He blows up Merlin's castle. At one popular monestary, the monks and nuns are terrified because the water in their very large indoor pool has been reduced by a large amount. They think the reduction has happened because of God's displeasure with them for engaging in the decadent and self-gratifying act of bathing in the pool but Hank discovers that the water is leaking out the bottom of the pool where some bricks have loosened. He constructs a big scene to reveal his miracle, including fireworks which the people have never seen before and the loud sounds and explosive lights he explains are the evil spirit being expunged from the monastery that was allegedly restricting the water level in the lake. This alleged miracle gives Hank the credibility he needs to convince the monks that they could bathe without retribution from God.There is much critique in the narration from Hank on the social, economic and political conditions in Arthur's England. He reports on the conditon of the serfs. What little income such as from the produce that they create on their own plots, is stolen by taxes and as tribute by the nobility and the church. The feudal lords drive their serfs to starvation, disease and death so that they, the lords can live luxurious lives without working themselves. The lords execute or imprison serfs who get too uppity or refuse orders to have their daughters be sexually abused or often times for no reason at all. Hank works to try to release some of the prisoners, whose minds have all been deostroyed by their experience, in the castles of the nobles. The serfs and the slaves, the vast majority of England's population have been trained by centuries of oppression to be mentally docile. They think they deserve to be slaves and think their oppression is the way things should be. Hank notes in relation to this, how the world has traditionally recoiled at the execution of about 10,000 rich people during the French Revolution's \\"Reign of Terror.\\" But there was an incomparably greater terror which affected hundreds of millions of french peasants who suffered a reign of terror lasting many centuries as they were starved and robbed and worked to death by the aristocracy.Hank tries to introduce the elements of the Enlightenment. He tries slowly and subtly to spread the idea that the English nobility has illegitimate power and that the people deserve to control their own destiny. He tries in the same way to inculate a basic spirit of independent thinking, to undermine the spirit of submission to authority. Hank writes that in his opinion true patriotism is quite the opposite of submission to governmental institutions and the laws. Institutions and laws grow outdated, tyranical and ineffective and people who do not voice their opinion about the need to change such things are not true patriots. He succesfully undermines the barbaric and silly custom of knight errantry--he gradually converts the knights into travelling salesman for soap and the other things he is trying to encourage. He fights a bunch of the nights towards the end of the book while wearing gymnastic tights and using a gun and lasso.The end of the story brings a sort of twist and one fully understands the satire as it relates to Hank's vanity and overconfindence in his late 19th century intellect and technological know-how.This a good story, very well written, intelligent, amusing and every so often something comes up in it that makes you laugh out loud.There may be a few minor mechanical problems with the flow of the story, such as one or two actions not being fully accounted for. The last part of the episode where King Arthur and Hank get taken as slaves is kind of rushed through."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"'Connecticut Yankee' is an excellent political satire still relevant to today's world. Everyone's heard of it, and it's been spoofed many times in film. However, few people have read it and they're missing a treat. Mark Twain is one author whose works consistently remain applicable to modern society. 'Yankee' is funny, interesting and highly worth your time."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Summary:Hank Morgan is a fiery shop boss in the Colt Arms Factory in New England during the late 1800s when he is knocke unconscious by another worker who gets the better of him during a fight. When Hank wakes up, he finds himself in Britain during the 7th century C.E. in the time of King Arthur. As it just so happens, before Hank can be burned at the stake for threatening to blot out the sun, the solar eclipse he predicted takes place and everyone in King Arthur's royal court cowers at his command. Hank is given what was formerly Merlin the Magician's position as chief executive and renamed The Boss. The Boss then begins to reform ancient Britain, introducing dynamite, fireworks, bicycles, electricity, telephones, etc.But, as is only becoming of someone of his rank, he must inevitably go on a quest. It just so happens that a damsel in distress, Sandy, has come a-calling and has a mission for a knight. So, Hank embarks on a journey with Sandy and returns victoriously having saved a pen of pigs that used to be a queen and maidens but was mysteriously transformed, though only Sandy knows this.Hank continues with his plans of reforming Britain, but lets slip another plan to the King that he wants to secretly go among the peasants as a commoner himself. The King likes the idea and signs on. They embark on a series of adventures that end with both of them being sold into slavery and very nearly being hung.Due to a misheard comment several years earlier, Hank is forced to battle another knight who was offended by the remark. In an effort to crush the ancient norms of chivalry, Hank not only battles the knight (using a lasso), but challenges all of the knighthood of Britain. His challenge pays off when he pulls out his six-shooters and lays waste to ten of the knights, the rest breaking ranks and running.After this incident, three years of bounty follow during which Hank's reforms become common place - except in the Catholic Church. Ultimately Hank is deceived by the Church, King Arthur is betrayed by his son Mordred and the greatest knight of England, Lancelot, who has been in love with Guinevere for ages. When all of this comes to a head, both Mordred and Arthur are dead and the nation is without leadership except for the Church.Of course Hank can't let this situation stand. Gathering up his very best men, he destroys his wonderful factories and holes up in a cave. The last of the knights, totaling some thirty-thousand, come against him and 53 of his best men (52 and Clarence). Nearly all of the knights are destroyed. But what Hank and Clarence hadn't considered is what the decaying men's bodies would do to them seeing as how they can't leave the cave.In the end, Merlin, the magician that has plagued Hank since his arrival, sneaks into the cave disguised as a woman and casts a spell on Hank, causing him to sleep for 13 centuries or until his own time again. After the spell, Merlin is killed and the story ends.My Comments:There is no doubt in my mind that Samuel Clemens is one of the greatest writers of all time. This book is not only superbly written, but absolutely hilarious and remarkably insightful. Some of Clemens' insights into humanity are astonishing.The story itself is pretty good, though the ending is a little bit well, open. You aren't sure exactly what happened, though you have a pretty good idea. I would love to read something about 'the writing of A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court', it likely draws upon Rip Van Winkle as well as numerous other writers and writings of the day.There is also a lot of commentary about the Catholic Church and its oppressive nature. Whether this is based in early American anti-Catholic sentiment or just plain anti-religious sentiment, I don't know (both are possibilities considering the time period). Perhaps the aforementioned book about this book, when written, will answer that question. I chose to look at it as anti-religious sentiment and thoroughly enjoyed it throughout.Overall, this book is a definite must read for everyone. I recall having read a children's shortened version when I was about ten, but reading in its original form is a treat. Read this book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Although this book's concept is no longer novel - one may now even call it clich&eacute; - its \\"time travel\\" aspect was - at least in the sense that it is used in this novel - a fairly new concept in fiction at the time Twain wrote it. No less a science fiction authority than Robert A. Heinlein even goes so far to say that Twain \\"invented\\" the time travel story. Now, this is certainly stretching the truth a bit, but one can see how Heinlein was heavily influenced by Twain from reading this book. This novel's time travel aspect is not used for science fiction; no, it is a purely satirical vehicle. Twain transplants an \\"aw shucks\\", no nonsense American smack dab in the middle of The Dark Ages. By having his character attempt to transplant American ideas of technology, government, and morals into this staunch, backward (anyway, by our standards) British society, Twain is clearly forging an attack upon monarchy - which he once called \\"surely the grotesquest swindle ever invented by man.\\" That said, we see from the devastating ending (which surely no one who has read this book wasn't surprised by) that the book is as much a satire on American arrogance and idealism as it is on the British. One may not always agree with Twain's politics, but one must at least respect them. He also demonstrates in this book the oft-forgotten truism that one's tribal customs are not the laws of nature - and what business do we have trying to force ours upon anyone else's? A devastating satire all around."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is definately a departure from what one might consider &quot;normal&quot; literature, exploring the possibilities of a regular man going back in time to visit the grand kingdom of Camelot. The story starts with a man telling of a fight in a factory in which he was foreman, and how he was knocked out. Upon waking he was in the land of Camelot, though he didn't realize it. Being put up for burning, he used his knowledge of the past to save his skin, using an eclipse to bestow his &quot;magical powers.&quot;This display was extremely impressive for the people of the day, who that main character described as a childish race, always exaggerating tales for their own glory. After being given all the power in the land, next to the king of course, he set out on a quest to bring the land of camelot into the realm of the modern with such things as the telephone and telegraph, the railroad, and steamboats. All these monumental changes in the world were taking place without the general public's knowledge of it, and was gradually being mixed into the culture, in the main character's goal of removing chivalry from the cultural mix.After performing several &quot;miracles&quot; to his people, and going off on several grand adventures, the main character has the church turn on him, and try to bring the entire populous back to its simpler time, of swords, castles, damsels in distress, and the quest way of life. That is where I leave it up to you to find out the rest of the plot, if you really want to read it.In my overall opinion, the book seems to be rushed by Mark Twain, where he tries to mix his general opinions of humanity, his ideas for its future, and just a fun story line all in one, too quickly. The story unfolds hurridly and seems to lack direction at times, and needs a bit more development. A great read if for enjoyment, but don't use it for your overall future plan for humanity, as it is a bit lacking there.This book will likely appeal to school kids in the middle to high school range, because of its fair amount of depth and hidden meaning, but will also enjoy quite a good story, and a fair bit of insight as to what life was like back in the old days. It seems that Mark Twain had done a fair bit of research as to what life was in the age of Camelot before having gone out to write this book. Almost everybody will enjoy this, even if for no particular academic reason. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Hank Morgan, a Connecticut Yankee, travels back into time wher King Arthur rules. Needless to say, he goes on an excursion with King Arthur experiencing many events along the way. On the journey he learns lessons of how to be noble and be a knight. My opinion of this book is that it lacks something, something that is entertaining. I do not find it interesting or appealing. Mark Twain uses many details like most books he has written. The book went a bit overboard on them. Talking about how it feels to be in armor for a page doesn't entice me. Also Twain goes onto new events too fast by actually lacking in detail. He did not have a smooth entrance to the journey he that the king and him went on. Also, I didn't realize until a chapter or two after Sandy, a damsel going on the journey, was introduced that she was a woman. I thought she was a horse at first. He could have transferred details, meaning using less on particular items and more on entrances. Overall, this book did not appeal to me at all. I usually get involved in books, but for this book I was utterly oblivious."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Hank Morgan is hit in the head with a crowbar in the 19th century and wakes up int he Middle Ages.

Hank also goes on many journeys like when he discovers America, and after he has lived in America with his wife for a while he comes back to the city he lived at before he moved to America to find only a few people. With those people he goes against all of England.I would not recommend this book to anybody because it was boring and there was too much gore and killing. The book is boring because in the middle of the book fo about 50 pages they are riding on horses to get to this place to save some princesses that have been turned into pigs. Also the book goes on and on about boring sujects, and the few interesting subjects are over in a few pages. This book is too gory, and there is too much killing. There are people that go around killing people for no reason at all, and at one point in the book there are 30,000 dead bodies rotting.

I did not like this book at all. It had no description, and I could hardly understand it. It had no description at all. At one point, Hank-the main character-complains that no one ever uses any description. Here is a passage from the book. &quot;Sir Gewaine went a-journeying, and fell upon Sir Kay. He smote Sir Kay down, off his horse. He went farthe and fell upon Sir Galahad. Sir Galahad smote Sir Gewaine with his sword. Then Sir Galahad went further down the road and smote down Sir James.&quot; Everyone in the book talked in either Old English, using words like prithee, thoust, and other confusing words, or they talked in 1800's Yokel Tawk.

He was thought to be a spy and was put in jail, but with the help of a page named Clarence, he convinces everyone that he is a wizard. Throughout the years he invents things we have today, but they didn't have back then. He also educates and helps people of the kingdom and becomes a knight himself. I found the book to be time-consuming and dull because nothing ever eventful happened and the old English they used made it hard to comprehend. They did not have a lot of big events at all. All he did was talk, talk, and talk about what he was going to do. It would have been more stimulating if they described when he was fighting, exploring, or helping others. Another thing that made it boring was that they used old English. It baffled me when they would say &quot;thou are pithy&quot;. You wouldn't know who &quot;thou&quot; was or even what &quot;pithy&quot; meant!

He stereotypes shamelessly throughout this book. And despite the fact that both the narrator and people who read this book seem to assert that this tale is set in the 6th century it absolutely is not. You did not have castles, titled lords and ladies, a powerful Roman Catholic church, and French sounding names in 6th century Britain! Had Mr. Twain been more balanced in his writing and more historically factual I personally would have found this book a great deal more readable. A story about someone in the 19th century transported to a time and place where Britons and Anglo-Saxons were fighting for control of the land would have been even more fascinating. As it stands, anyone looking for a time travel story is going to get little more than a meandering, endless, and plotless leftwing spiel."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"this book sucks no one should ever read i hated it so bad that i want to throw it away never ever read it"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Hi everyone!

I guess in today's fast paced world if a book doesn't come with large speakers, a big screen and a joy stick it is boring.

The novel's immediately obvious flaw (and I assume Mark Twain was aware of it but simply ignored it) is the 19th Century hero's ability to communicate with Britons of the 6th Century. They, of course, would have been speaking an English similar to that in &quot;Beowulf&quot;; the book has them talking like characters in &quot;Hamlet&quot;. The opening chapters are comic in mood, complete with limp jokes. (When one character introduces himself as a page, the Yankee replies: &quot;Go 'long, you ain't more than a paragraph.&quot; Oh, Lord.) However, the story quickly becomes dark and then increasingly darker. The degraded condition of the masses (which the modern hero compares to 18th Century France) culminates in a tour (with King Arthur disguised as a peasant) of a oountryside corrupted by monarchy and the Church, both of which were loathed by Mark Twain. Feminists should be warned that the author's misogyny is given free rein here: all the ladies of the court are thoughtless twits, and Morgan Le Fay is a shrew who habitually and casually kills her servants. The heroine Alisande (who, of course, becomes Sandy) is a tiresome chatterbox, whom the hero abruptly marries as a sort of social condescension. But his attitude towards women is merely a part of his general misanthropy, leading him to write at one point: &quot;Well, there are times when one would like to hang the whole human race and finish the farce.&quot; Once the protagonist has established himself as Arthur's right-hand man (he's called &quot;The Boss&quot;), he exercises his Yankee ingenuity to industrialize the realm. With the genius of Gutenberg, Morse and Bell at his disposal, he sets up a newspaper and introduces the telegraph and the telephone to the Middle Ages. (Just how he devises the technology to accomplish this is not made too clear.) At any rate, The Boss is considered a great wizard, and Merlin (or Brer Merlin, as the Yankee calls him) is treated like a fraudulent fool. Motivating all this is a somewhat smug sense of 19th Century superiority. Actually, the Yankee goes beyond his own century and into the 1900's. When Guenever's treason causes the civil war which divides Britain, The Boss drills a group of cadets (his West Pointers, he calls them) that he leads off to battle against the anti-Arthurian knighthood. The result is a blood bath presciently and repulsively similar to the trench warfare of 1914-1918. (The novel was published in 1889.) If this is meant to be an indication of future efficiency, it's an extremely pessimistic vision. But then, the whole story is Mark Twain's gloomy statement on Mankind's uneasy place in a dysfunctional world, be it the Dark Ages or the somber present."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"From what I've read, The Prince and the Pauper was Twain's first foray into historical fiction. He clearly reused one of the major themes from that book in A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, which was published seven years later - that of a royal who gets a chance to see how the other half lives. In the earlier book, the prince and a young beggar exchange clothes for fun. In this book, it probably isn't realistic to make a full-grown man exchange clothes with another for the fun of it, so Twain gives the somewhat flimsy excuse that the protagonist (who has become the king's right-hand man after traveling back in time) has decided to go see the kingdom in disguise, and the king has decided to go with him. There was almost no more discussion of it than that - I don't think Twain ever mentioned whether the rest of the king's court knew what he was doing. Certainly no search parties are ever sent for him, but it's strange that everyone would let him just go off with basically no protection.In any case, Twain's dislike of sixth-century England is very clear, although, he has ascribed many social behaviors to it that did not actually occur at that time. He even admits to this in a strange preface. At one point, he says, \\"Here I was, a giant among pigmies, a man among children, a master intelligence among intellectual moles: by all rational measurement the one and only actually great man in that whole British world.\\" Now, I understand that the protagonist, being from 19th century England, has thirteen centuries of knowledge more than the \\"children\\" he references, but it's still pretty pompous to claim that much advantage over an entire kingdom.The protagonist finds the king extremely stupid and doesn't miss an opportunity to mention it. The protagonist himself does a number of stupid things, including getting himself and the king sold into slavery, but somehow those are just little mistakes; whereas the king's inability to pretend to be a commoner because he has really never had the opportunity or reason to study one, of course, proves that the king is an idiot. In The Prince and The Pauper, the prince returns to his throne with a greater knowledge of his people and rules that much better for it. In this book, the king returns to his throne and then Twain is a little too busy with creating a way for his protagonist to get back to the nineteenth century to really discuss what happens to the king after his escapades.This was fun to read but personally, I prefer The Prince and the Pauper."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"The book A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court by Mark Twain is told from the view of Hank Morgan, later on known as The Boss. Hank Morgan travels back in time from the 19th century to the 5th century, in King Arthur's Court. Hank learns from a man dress in a knight's armor that it is the 5th century, he doesn't believe that he traveled back in time, he thinks he is in an asylum. Suddenly Hank remembers that the day that he was told also happened to be the same day of the first recorded full Solar Eclipse. Hank finds that he has wandering into a place where they are hanging innocent people. Hank has some fun and tells the people that he will put the world into total darkness very soon, he hopes that if it truly is the 5th century, the people will believe him. Sure enough the eclipse does happen, all the people are in awe. For the rest of the book Hank is then on known as The Boss.Throughout the whole story, Hank gives King Arthur tips about how to be more successful. Hank goes on a venturous journey with King Arthur and he helps the King train Knights and create a large army. Hank gets a seat at the round table even though he is not a knight. Hank uses his knowledge to reinvent things that were a new invention from his time.

Written from his pen at the low point of his career, Mark Twain's Connecticut Yankee was unorganized, and is unable to hold one's attention.After being forcefully struck on the head by a not so gentle tool, Hank Morgan awakes with the realization that he is not in Kansas any more, in fact he is not in Connecticut either. He opens his eyes as a distraught stranger who has collided with a new age of unworldly elements, known as the sixth century. Coming from nineteenth century America, he is only equipped with confusion and bewilderment. Although throughout his existence in his present setting he learns that he possesses the power of knowledge and experience that he has involuntarily drawn from the well of the future. Stealthily using this to his advantage he quickly works his way up Camelot's socioeconomic ladder he then takes a position among the sixth century's finest.Almost immediately after acquiring his coveted political stature Hank is questioned of his worth. He is challenged with a knightly quest. Adventure arouses when he nobily accepts this journey. On the way he partners with a disarranged, yet flamboyant, long-winded maiden who shares Hank's company, while ruining his silence throughout their quarry. All through Hank's entity in the sixth century he indirectly influences the people with his foreign knowledge, all the while going through life altering experiences that will be impressed upon his mind for the rest of his days.It is obviously shown that Mark Twain was in an unhappy stage of his life while composing this peace. Do not be disillusioned by past reputations. The strong and healthy characters, depthful plots, and striking adventure are absent in this book. The story gave a feeling of gloomy misery, and anger. The climax and conclusion were blunt and quite unsatisfying, leaving the reader not only needing more, but wanting a plot as well. Packed with interesting yet depressing insights to mankind, and the actuality of the often glorified Camelot, the story does leave one thinking. Although all the while giving the reader a stale and dismal reaction. Consistently questioning the reader's interest, this book is graced with an unconcluded and depressing response."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Had Twain stopped after the first section, in which he describes riverboat piloting and his exploits therein, I would have come away with a positive impression of the book.

Twain documents his return to the Mississippi with a plethora of miscellaneous descriptions and loosely related anecdotes.

Twain's barbs against religion were witty, but so over-the-top they interfered with the actual story. I kept finding the novel stupid instead of funny, and pointless instead of witty, especially when 'technology/modern civilization' began dominating the court. The use of detail detracted from the story; extremely overwritten. The main character was an 'expert' on everything, and felt more like an author's mouthpiece than a real man, even a caricature of a man. If you aren't amused by old-style religious slanders, expect a plot, and have read modern time travel stories, you'll hate this so-called 'great' novel.Please feel free to discuss in the comments rather than giving me rage-unhelpfuls because you disagree with my opinion.

Great Literature for all ages."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"This is one of the most enjoyable, easiest reads you will ever find, and yet it may also be the most intellectual of all American novels. That Twain has managed such a mix is further proof of his crowning genius.The story revolves around Hank Morgan, a modern American businessman who is transported back in time. He is shocked by the backwardness, ignorance, and poverty of Arthurian England and decides that the people there deserve a \\"new deal.\\" (This novel is where FDR picked up that phrase)The novel is mostly comic, occasionally tragic, and consistently compelling as it follows this quixotic scheme to its ultimate conclusion. The plot reveals Twain's brilliant insights on the nature of freedom; the trade-offs involved with economic development; America's role in world history; the interplay between capitalism, religion, and tradition; and the tragedies of history, without ever tipping his hand as to what Twain himself believes.And, of course, it is hilarious. The Yankee's misery while wearing armor, his bafflement at chivalric customs, and the bizarre contrasts between his modern innovations and the medievel world make for regular laughs. No other author could make his readers think so hard while laughing so hard.Recently, this book has gained an added resonance, as Twain's take on the Americanization of a traditional culture can be easily applied to our current projects in Iraq and Afghanistan. Twain ends his book with a violent insurgency against the Yankee intruder, and horrific bloody tragedy. Hopefully our project will not end in the same way."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"The best work by Twain I've read to date.

Written later in his life, this work is mature in style as well as content in spite of its loose organization and focus. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Twain has a way of taking something that we commonly idealize and shooting holes all through it. Where Letters From Earth took aim at religious belief, this time its Camelot. This is a good satire although not as strong as Letters which is a five star multiple reading kind of book.In Connecicut Yankee, the author runs across Hank Morgan on a tour of Warwick Castle. They \\"fell together as modest people will in the tail of a herd being shown through\\". Morgan, however, has an uncommon familiarity with the objects shown and he eventually ends up relating the story of a Connecticut Yankee to Twain after a few hot Scotch whiskeys.Morgan, it seems, after a crack on the head, found himself transported back to King Arthur's time. After being captured by Sir Kay and being delivered to the Round Table as a trophy, Henry Morgan asserts himself as a master magician over Merlin and sets himself up as \\"The Boss\\". He then begins to secretly initiate improvements and reforms such as setting up a clandestine WestPoint, installing telephone lines, starting manufacturing centers and training journalists - all the while balancing the Church and the traditional castes of the country. A misheard comment lands him scheduled to duel Sir Sagramore but is postponed for Sagramore's crusading stint. In the meantime and in preparation for the undetermined date of the duel, Arthur assigns Morgan to the aid of a young girl who comes to the table claiming that a number of princesses are being held captive by ogres. From there he goes on to \\"magically\\" fix the Holy Fountains, a spring to which people pilgrimage but has stopped flowing and then, with King Arthur in tow, attempts to travel as a commoner and lands in a world of trouble after he and the King are taken as slaves. It is a fun story with a lot of humorous situations. This is why it is recommended to young readers, I suppose.However, Twain's biting sarcasm makes it a good book for adults too. His antecdotes are vehicles for pointing out the absurdity of the concept of nobility, the probability that the belief in ogres and magicians meant that the people of the time were largely ignorant and gullible. And in their ignorance, they are cruel. Time and again we come back to this theme. But, back to the sarcasm. For example, one of his methods of getting rid of knights is by turning them into traveling salespeople of various household sundries!Additional meanings, interpretations, etc. are explored in the afterword and, honestly, unless it had been pointed out I would not have caught it at all. I didn't see this as a treatise on the nature of man although, once explained, I saw that that was there. I enjoyed this simply as a light satirical story."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Mark Twain is synonymous worldwide with the Mississippi River, mainly because of the Tom Sawyer/Huck Finn stories. However, Life on the Mississippi is just as important and, in a testament to Twain's greatness, nearly as readable despite being non-fiction. It details his history with the river and gives an overview of the river itself; this may sound boring, and almost certainly would be with anyone else, but I long ago decided that even Twain's laundry list would be worth reading, and this certainly is. The magic he seemed to bring to everything is in full force; one would be very hard-pressed to find another non-fiction book that is so entertaining, besides Twain's others of course, but it is also awesomely informative. In addition, Life is historically notable as the first book written on a typewriter, not Huck as is commonly thought; however, it made Twain able to finish Huck, which he had struggled with for some years and set aside. Huck fans and scholars will want to read Life for this alone, but it is more than worthy in itself.Twain starts by giving some basic facts and history; this is the least interesting part but only lasts a few pages, and I urge anyone bored by it to continue. Much of the information is of course dated but remains historically valuable as a portrait of the river as it then stood. Far more interesting is Twain's unforgettable rundown of his years as a riverboat pilot - a central life experience that led to much of his writing. We get a fascinating glimpse of this long-vanquished trade, which was all but unthinkable even when Life was published. It is important to recall that Twain was a pilot before such boats had steam or even lights at night. He details piloting's extraordinary difficulties with engrossing detail and typical self-deprecating humor. We learn much along the way about the riverboat lifestyle, the river itself, and riverside towns. Anyone curious about what it was like to live in this era and/or how its inhabitants thought and acted will find a wealth of information; we learn as much here as in any history book, and it is of course infinitely better written. Life covers a crucial American history era and is an important primary source even for those not interested in Twain and certainly essential for anyone who is, as it gives substantial background about a crucial part of his life. The book is indeed in part a bildungsroman; Twain had always loved the river and began pilot training soon after first leaving home. He structures the narrative so that it reads much like a story, and we see him grow from navet&eacute; and ignorance to an admirable experience and wisdom.Twain then details a trip he made on the river many years later, noting what changed and what stayed the same. There is significant autobiographical material here also, but the crux is descriptive. Twain describes the river's whole length and everything having to do with it as he goes, making it all utterly absorbing. As always, there are many eminently readable tangents. Several are autobiographical - reminisces as well as then recent events. Particularly interesting is Twain's profoundly touching visit to his hometown after a long absence. However, a good part of Life has nothing to do with the river directly but is at least as engrossing as what does. Twain's many asides are full of wit and insight; few have ever probed so deeply into life and humanity, and we are lucky to have his wisdom, much of which is hilarious. Especially engaging are observations on North/South differences, notably including the Civil War. Twain's sociopolitical criticism is also as brilliant as ever, taking on everything from architecture to Walter Raleigh to speech. Finally, Life would be valuable even if lacking all this because it passes on an invaluable treasure of American folklore.Life is quite simply required reading for anyone even remotely interested in American literature; it is essential Twain, which makes it simply essential."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"In the novel, A Connecticut in King Arthur's Court, Mark Twain shows the differences between modern society, and sixth century Great Britain. Hank is a self-assured factory worker who knows how to make just about anything. The protagonist, is mysteriously transported back to the sixth century, when struck in the head by a crowbar.He uses his vast knowledge of explosives and metals to quickly become a leader in the monarchy. His democratic thoughts and ideas become his ambition as he strives to make Great Britain a republic. Twain's novel shows how much of a change society has gone through from the sixth century to the time of the writing of the novel. He also show's how little education anyone received in the sixth century, even the members of royalty are not very wise. Hank's mediocre education is far superior to anybody's in the whole monarchy, because of the advances in education to the present.Twain shows that the laws of the sixth century were made for the few against the many. At one point a woman is put to death for stealing just enough food to feed her baby. Hank tries, throughout the book, to get the royalty to realize how unfair their laws are to the common man.This book makes you feel angry at points about the horribleness of the monarchy, yet ashamed because similar acts still go on in the present. An example would be how the rich and privileged still get the best of everything, while the have-nots get the last and worst of everything, both now and then. Twain has a comic sense in the book, and yet he still shows a contrast between the comic and the serious. This book should be a classic for Twain's creative portrayal of the sixth century, yet also because it makes us think about our society today."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Twain's account of his years on the Mississippi is part travel book, part memoir, and part historical work, with a few sketches, stories, and tall tales tossed in for good measure. There is even an outtake from the not-yet-published \\"Huckleberry Finn,\\" along with extensive excerpts from historical and contemporary accounts by other authors. This smorgasbord of material makes for an uneven book, but much of it shows Mark Twain at his humorous and humanistic best.The kernel of the volume (and its best, most cohesive section) is in chapters 4 through 17; this material appeared in the Atlantic magazine in 1875 and recalls his early life as a crew member on steamboats in the early 1850s. His adventures as a young man are fraught with danger, full of comedy, populated by a number of ornery, mischievous, and reckless characters, and occasionally embellished (although Twain is a bit obvious when he's fobbing off a yarn). As Twain later wrote in \\"Puddn'head Wilson, \\"if there was anything better in this world than steamboating, it was the glory to be got by telling about it.\\"After he published the series in the Atlantic, Twain added another 46 chapters; much of it an account of his homecoming (incognito--or so he'd hoped) to the Mississippi River in 1882, when the steamboat had been rendered obsolete by the railroad. Many of these descriptions are unusually (for Twain) melancholy; he remarks upon the relatively emptiness of the river traffic and notes the transformations to the river and its banks that had made steamboat travel safer but less adventurous. His new journey provides opportunities to relate a number of stories--some allegedly told to him on the river and a few unpublished tales that he deemed relevant and worthy of inclusion.The material from other sources, unfortunately, tends to bog things down--and there are about 10,000 words of it commingled in the text and included as appendices. Twain gathered newspaper articles and historical documents; he also included travel writing from earlier visitors, primarily Europeans distracted by how Americans and their homes were horribly uncouth and dirty. (You almost get the feeling that Twain would have smacked \\"the once renowned and vigorously hated\\" Frances Trollope upside the head if he'd had the chance; she provides Twain with the most interesting, if snooty, descriptions of traveling along the Mississippi early in the century.)The material Twain wrote, however, more than compensates for the dryness of the extraneous stuff. As always, he is quotable, witty, amusing, and provocative. In spite of its excesses, nobody has done the Mississippi better."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Who hasn&#65533;t heard of King Arthur and the knights of his Round Table? Along with Robin Hood, the tales of King Arthur are the most exciting tales that British history has produced &#65533; tales of grand chivalry, as gallant knights in shining armour rescue damsels in distress, and fight for courage, truth and justice. But were the knights really so noble and courageous? Through the eyes of a nineteenth century Yankee (Hank Morgan) who goes back in time to King Arthur&#65533;s sixth century court, Mark Twain suggests that the sixth century wasn&#65533;t quite so glamorous. Here&#65533;s a taste of his delightful humour: &#65533;As a general thing &#65533; as far as I could make out &#65533; these murderous adventures were not forays undertaken to avenge injuries, nor to settle old disputes or sudden fallings out; no, as a rule they were simple duels between strangers &#65533; duels between people who had never even been introduced to each other, and between whom existed no cause of offense whatever.&#65533; Twain compares it to boys going at it on the spot: &#65533;I had always imagined until now, that that sort of thing belonged to children only, and was a sign and mark of childhood; but here were these big boobies sticking to it and taking pride in it clear up into full age and beyond. Yet there was something very engaging about these great simple-hearted creatures, something attractive and loveable. There did not seem to be brains enough in the entire nursery, so to speak, to bait a fishhook with; but you didn&#65533;t seem to mind that, after a little, because you soon saw that brains were not needed in a society like that, and, indeed would have marred it, spoiled its symmetry &#65533; perhaps rendered its existence impossible.&#65533; (p16) As for the quest for the Holy Grail? &#65533;The boys all took a flier at the Holy Grail now and then. It was several years&#65533; cruise. They always put in the long absence snooping around, in the most conscientious way, though none of them had any idea where the Holy Grail really was, and I don&#65533;t think any of them actually expected to find it, or would have known what to do with it if he *had* run across it ... Every year expeditions went out holy grailing, and next year relief expeditions went out to hunt for *them*.&#65533; (p54)Sound wickedly funny? Hank Morgan doesn&#65533;t stop there with his nineteenth century heroic arrogance. Using his superior knowledge of solar eclipses, blasting powder, reading and writing, and electronics, he soon becomes The Boss who single-handedly helps sixth century Britain take a short-cut to nineteenth century civilization. Chivalry becomes a thing of the past, and the knights of the Round Table are converted to more worthwhile endeavours as baseball-players and business men &#65533; some commissioned on more nineteenth century style quests as &#65533;missionaries&#65533; to advertise soap and toothbrushes on sandwich boards. It helps, of course, that the magician Merlin is a faker and con-artist, and that hero Hank can do much more impressive &#65533;miracles&#65533;, which are nothing less than elaborate scientific stunts with blasting powder and cement. Camelot soon finds itself with a functioning telephone system and newspaper. All is wonderful, until our hero is commissioned to go on a quest to rescue forty-five princesses locked in a castle by three ogres. He discovers that being a knight isn&#65533;t as glamorous as it&#65533;s made out to be, because you can&#65533;t even use your handkerchief, and you get dust in your nose. Along with the dim-witted King Arthur, Hank&#65533;s plan to walk around in disguise as a peasant backfires when they are nearly executed as rebellious slaves, rescued only when Launcelot and the boys arrive in the nick of time - on brand new bicycles.Twain&#65533;s irreverence in dealing with the beloved Arthurian traditions garnered him a great deal of criticism at the time of publication. Yet as the peels of laughter fade, it becomes clear that Twain is using his humor to make a very serious point. Is he merely critiquing the vices of medieval feudalism and warning against over-sentimentalising the past? If he is critical of King Arthur, surely it is not a criticism directed at the monarchy or the noble virtues that the knights of the Round Table pursued, but rather at the vices of an unbalanced class structure. Or is Twain using a comparison between the sixth and the nineteenth centuries to make an argument for or against the scientific machinist age of the nineteenth century? It is clear that the protagonist &#65533; the first person point of view used by Twain to embrace the reader in sharing his convictions &#65533; embodies one set of ideals and arrogantly looks down on King Arthur who embodies another set of ideals. The sixth century holds fast to the concept of greatness and position being attained by birth, whereas the nineteen century has little reverence for rank and file, replacing it by a respect attained by achievements alone (p46ff). Morgan is sharply critical of injustices created by the medieval class structure, where people are slaves to &#65533;King and Church and noble&#65533; (p74ff), and is especially negative towards orthodox Christianity (specifically the Catholic church), feeling it safer for power not to be concentrated in one single organization (p56,108). He also mocks the simplistic medieval beliefs in the supernatural, and his own scientific &#65533;miracles&#65533; appear to be a reflection of nineteenth century liberalism and atheistic philosophy, where beliefs in supernaturalism were exiled through the advance of scientific naturalism, and where the Christian God was dethroned and replaced by science. The failures of the faker Merlin appear to be symbolic of the failure of medieval supernaturalism, since it is Morgan&#65533;s scientific knowledge that can perform the true miracles. What Twain unconsciously shows is that faith in natural science is just as much a religion as faith in supernaturalism, because the protagonist doesn&#65533;t convert King Arthur&#65533;s court to naturalism. By projecting himself as a supernaturalist, and taking advantage of King Arthur&#65533;s court ignorantly attributing his scientific miracles to the supernatural, Morgan proves to be just as much a political manipulator as Merlin or the established Church.I cannot believe that Morgan is totally a mouth-piece of Twain, or that Twain uses this work to advocate Protestant America over against Britain, since Twain was in fact an opponent of American imperialism. It is true that eventually Morgan proclaims and defends a republic with electric fences, revolvers and dynamite, exterminating the whole chivalry of England and replacing it with American imperialism and technology. But in the end it proves to be a hollow victory, with Morgan on his death-bed having second-thoughts about his technological achievements, and speaking about medieval chivalry with emotional longing and passionate love. The nineteenth century symbols prove to have the same destiny as those of the sixth century &#65533; they are conquered and die. Is Morgan&#65533;s death a symbol of the fate of the Western machine age, and is Twain asserting that nineteenth century American arrogance over earlier civilizations is misplaced, because it will share their destiny? The final cynicism in which the novel ends can not be overlooked, and is a suggestion that society&#65533;s optimism and faith in technology and science are misplaced because these can never improve humanity. Twain&#65533;s disenchantment with technology and progress is a reflection of the failures experienced in his own life: science in the end is not mankind's god or saviourTo get maximum enjoyment and understanding of Twain&#65533;s humour, I highly recommend reading a version of the Arthurian legends before Twain&#65533;s parody. He occasionally quotes Malory&#65533;s fifteenth century classic &#65533;Morte d&#65533;Arthur&#65533; &#65533; deliberately assigning a very different context and meaning to what was originally intended. To appreciate the conventions and ideals he is mocking, a read of Malory is essential, such as the English rendition produced by Sir Frank Knowles.It&#65533;s a brilliant concept, and makes William Goldman&#65533;s farcical and popular &#65533;The Princess Bride&#65533; look like inferior literary fodder for kindergarten kids. Not only is it funny, but there&#65533;s a great deal of depth beneath the surface, which Twain uses to convey a great deal of seriousness. Yet even while critics argue about just what it is that Twain is being serious about, there is no doubt that this is thoroughly enjoyable and humorous work, just as enjoyable today at the end of the twentieth century as when it was written at the end of the nineteenth. It is not so much the dark and serious underlying tone that has made this work a classic but Twain&#65533;s brilliant humour, creativeness, and story-telling."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"The perfect counterpoint to Le Morte d'Arthur. The Arthurian legends are wonderful tales but they are mythic literary productions. Mark Twain gives them a good old-fashioned strapping out behind the outhouse. With the Connecticut Yankee as our guide, we have front row seats on everyday life in Arthurian Britain: White slavery, le droit de seigneur, confiscation of property in event of suicide, nonexistence of impartial justice, the (unintended) degrading influence of Catholicism on the masses, immense ignorance, superstition... And that's just day one. But Mark Twain will never leave you stranded in a dark hell hole. Oh no - brilliance, mirth, and devastating common sense are always surrounding you on any journey with Mark Twain. This book is classic Twain: Funny.A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is chock-full of brilliant Twainisms. My favorite is his observation that a conscience is a very uncomfortable thing to have, and the significant difference between a conscience and an anvil is that, if you had an anvil stuck inside you, it would be a lot less uncomfortable than having a conscience. And Twain clearly concurs with Tom Paine that the English nobility were \\"no-ability\\" - simply the latest in a perennial series of robbers making life miserable for everyone and doing all in their power to hang on to power. A fine modern treatment of this theme is Ken Follett'sThe Pillars of the Earth. Twain also mentions the beautiful mispronunciations of childhood, and how the bereaved parental ear listens in vain for them once the child has grown.You'll never look at castles the same again (and I suspect the Dark Ages will never know what hit them)."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Mark Twain, the most globally recognised of the greatest American writers, comes closest to autobiography in this odd and fascinating book. This is the story of part of his life at least, and lays out much of his unique moral and political philosophy.As a book, Life on the Mississippi lacks a truly coherent story line after the half-way point; it tells the story of Twain's training as a Mississippi steamboat pilot, then, when he returns to the river years later as a successful writer, it drops off into anecdotes as Twain travels down the great river, and can be a deadly bore for some readers.But, oh, what a picture of Twain it draws! There are great tales of characters he meets along the river, told in his inimitably funny style, wonderful bits of his childhood - like the tale of his insomniac guilt and terror when the match he loans a drunk ends up causing the jail to burn down, killing the drunk - and insightful portraits of the towns and villages along the river.This is a characteristically American book, about progress and independence as well as the greatest American river, written by this most characteristically American writer. It is a true classic (a thing Twain despised! He said, &quot;Classics are books that everybody praises, but nobody reads.&quot;), a book that will remain a delight for the foreseeable future."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"&quot;Life On the Mississippi&quot; is Mark Twain's tribute to the Mississippi River, which surrounded the earlier part of his life. Mark Twain had been in awe of the river for many years; and inspired him to become a river boat pilot - explained in length in this book; much of which is quite humorous, while other parts are heartbreaking, including that of the horrible death of his brother, Henry.One of the main complaints about this book that some people have is that is uses too many facts and figures, which tends to bog the reader down. This is true. Yet, the avid reader, and Mark Twain enthusiast, will not bypass these chapters. We will revel in them, and read them with inspired intent; simply because the Mississippi River has been such an integral part of Mark Twain's life, that the more we get to know about the river, the more we get to know about the real Mark Twain.&quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; is a work of nonfiction; perhaps Twain's truest account of historical fact concerning his life. For those who are just getting interested in knowing about Mark Twain's writings, I would recommend reading &quot;Roughing It&quot;; as it is humurous throughout. &quot;Life on the Mississippi&quot; would be the second book I would recommend."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"A fellow from 19th century Hartford, Connecticut finds himself back in early medieval England, specifically in King Arthur's Court.

The book's filled with the humor and wit readers know Twain for.I would argue that A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court is more finely written than The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. It certainly doesn't have any of the silly plot devices of Finn, like reintroducing Tom Sawyer into the final part. And while literature professors talk of how radical Huck Finn was for its condemnation of slavery, I believe A Connecticut Yankee is equally radical for its condemnation of capitalism. They're both fine books, but I found A Connecticut Yankee more entertaining and finely crafted."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"This is a detailed local history of a few years on the Missippi which can help genealogists as well as Riverboat fans and river enthusiasts.

From resecuing damals turned into pig to duels with other knights Hank experiences what chiverally is in its true form. Although I really enjoyed this book and would read it again I do have some critisism on it. There were parts in this book that seemed to drag, There was just some chapters I had a hard time getting through such as the chapter called \\"Sixth-Century Political Economy.\\" In it Hank tries to explain to some peasents about what economy is but they don't get it. While reading his explanation I found that I quickly got bored and tried to hurry through that part. There were a few other chapters like this, but for the most part I thought the story fast paced and quite enjoyable. I would recommend this book to anybody who is a fan of Mark Twain, and who have time on their hands. This is harder reading and the book has 316 pages. This is definantly a classic that people ought to read if they get a chance."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"Mark Twain is synonymous worldwide with the Mississippi River, mainly because of the Tom Sawyer/Huck Finn stories. However, Life on the Mississippi is just as important and, in a testament to Twain's greatness, nearly as readable despite being non-fiction. It details his history with the river and gives an overview of the river itself; this may sound boring, and almost certainly would be with anyone else, but I long ago decided that even Twain's laundry list would be worth reading, and this certainly is. The magic he seemed to bring to everything is in full force; one would be very hard-pressed to find another non-fiction book that is so entertaining, besides Twain's others of course, but it is also awesomely informative. In addition, Life is historically notable as the first book written on a typewriter, not Huck as is commonly thought; however, it made Twain able to finish Huck, which he had struggled with for some years and set aside. Huck fans and scholars will want to read Life for this alone, but it is more than worthy in itself.Twain starts by giving some basic facts and history; this is the least interesting part but only lasts a few pages, and I urge anyone bored by it to continue. Much of the information is of course dated but remains historically valuable as a portrait of the river as it then stood. Far more interesting is Twain's unforgettable rundown of his years as a riverboat pilot - a central life experience that led to much of his writing. We get a fascinating glimpse of this long-vanquished trade, which was all but unthinkable even when Life was published. It is important to recall that Twain was a pilot before such boats had steam or even lights at night. He details piloting's extraordinary difficulties with engrossing detail and typical self-deprecating humor. We learn much along the way about the riverboat lifestyle, the river itself, and riverside towns. Anyone curious about what it was like to live in this era and/or how its inhabitants thought and acted will find a wealth of information; we learn as much here as in any history book, and it is of course infinitely better written. Life covers a crucial American history era and is an important primary source even for those not interested in Twain and certainly essential for anyone who is, as it gives substantial background about a crucial part of his life. The book is indeed in part a bildungsroman; Twain had always loved the river and began pilot training soon after first leaving home. He structures the narrative so that it reads much like a story, and we see him grow from navet&eacute; and ignorance to an admirable experience and wisdom.Twain then details a trip he made on the river many years later, noting what changed and what stayed the same. There is significant autobiographical material here also, but the crux is descriptive. Twain describes the river's whole length and everything having to do with it as he goes, making it all utterly absorbing. As always, there are many eminently readable tangents. Several are autobiographical - reminisces as well as then recent events. Particularly interesting is Twain's profoundly touching visit to his hometown after a long absence. However, a good part of Life has nothing to do with the river directly but is at least as engrossing as what does. Twain's many asides are full of wit and insight; few have ever probed so deeply into life and humanity, and we are lucky to have his wisdom, much of which is hilarious. Especially engaging are observations on North/South differences, notably including the Civil War. Twain's sociopolitical criticism is also as brilliant as ever, taking on everything from architecture to Walter Raleigh to speech. Finally, Life would be valuable even if lacking all this because it passes on an invaluable treasure of American folklore.Life is quite simply required reading for anyone even remotely interested in American literature; it is essential Twain, which makes it simply essential.

Twain wrote such travel literature classics as\\"Innocents Abroad\\", \\"Following the Equator\\", \\"A Tramp Abroad and \\"Life on the Mississipi.\\"Life on the Mississippi was published in 1883 shortly before Twain's greatest novel \\"Huckleberry Finn\\" was unveiled to readers in 1885. In Life on the Mississipi\\" Twain sets out to travel down the long river. Twain (born Samuel L. Clemens) was born near Florida Missouri growing up in nearby Hannibal nestled next to the great river. As a boy he dreamed of becoming a steamboat pilot. As told in the autobiographical chapters of this book he did become one in the years prior to the Civil War. Twain was an apprentice pilot working under the expert tutelage of Horace Bixby. Twain had to learn every inch of the river from St. Louis to New Orleans and back. He left the river to join the Confederate Army. After a few weeks he left the army for the West where he began to write as a newspaper reporter gaining fame for his short humorous sketches.Nevertheless, Twain also wanted to see the river once again. In Life on the Missisippi he sketches the variious towns along the river such as St. Louis, New Orleans, St. Paul, Natchez, Vicksburg and Memphis. He tells tall tales about clever card sharks, grisly murders, Civil War battlesand American Indian legends. His brother was killed in a steamboat explosion and Twain recounts this sad tale. The highlight of the book is his return to Hannibal where he remembers his childhood and what has become of all the children he played with as a boy. There is even an excised chapter from Huckleberry Finn which Twain added to this book.Life on the Mississippi is will live as long as American literature. Mark Twain is the Lincoln of our Literature.

It began quickly and I was easily intrigued by the author's usage of vocabulary and his extraordinary ideas. He began in such a way that one could not put the book down and I found myself staying up late in the night just to finish that one last chapter. Yet, as I continued reading, my mind began to wander from lack of interest. The book became a little redundant and it was hard to concentrate on reading. I fell behind in my reading schedule because I was unable to stay focused on what I considered to be boring text. Luckily, as I kept reading, the plot began to thicken once again. I was again caught up in the story. The last third of the book proved to be an interesting one. I kept reading even when I knew I had to do other things. My mind stayed with the book even when I wasn't reading. I believe that the character development was done extremely well. You get to know the characters and you know how they feel. Even before someone speaks, you know what their reaction to the situation will be. This is a sign of a very well written book. A book where one can feel the characters' feelings is one that is easy to read. Not in the sense that the text is easy, but it is easy to stay interested in the book. It is beautifully written as a whole. Yet, through the middle it becomes more of a technological book. The inventions created are thoroughly explained. I found that thoroughly boring. Although it was interesting to know what was being created, I wasn't interested in a step-by-step process as to how it was being made. I recommend this book to a more mature audience. Not because of any obscene situations, but because I believe it would be too hard to comprehend before the age of twelve at the youngest. Not only would it be hard to comprehend, but it may be quite boring to those under that age. Of course, it depends upon who the person is that is reading the book. Yet, generally I believe it would be most fitted for older teens to adults. Their ability to comprehend and appreciate the writings of Mark Twain would help to make this book an interesting one to read. All and all, I would generously recommend this book. It is a novel that not only interests you, but keeps you thinking as well. The plot, along with the style of writing, is well thought out and keeps you turning the page each time. Although at times it can become a little boring, for the most part one would find this novel enjoyable. One can probably find it at any local bookstore, any library, or even purchase it on the internet. If you are looking for a good book to read, then I would suggest that you pick this one up today."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"While a bit strange, _Yankee_ makes some interesting points about both medival and modern life. Twain makes some interesting commentary on technology, honor, and human nature with characters that cross a millenium."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"I greatly enjoyed reading this book. I laughed outloud frequently as Twain poked fun at 6th century England and in turn, 19th century England. Beneath the thick sarcasm, though, were many profound issues such as freedom of religion vs. an established church, democracy vs. monarchy, and the corruption brought on by absolute power."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"It was an entertaining book, at least in parts, but left me cold compared to some of Twain's other books. One thing that bothered me was that it supposedly takes place in the sixth century, but the characters speak quasi-Elizabethan English; the language spoken then would have been nothing like English. Twain also maligns the Roman Catholic church (it causes the downfall of the nearly 19th-century world the Yankee has built up), but England was only beginning to be converted to Christianity, if that. These may be minor points, but I don't think a satire of England of old has much bearing on modern America. Can one expect the world of 13 centuries ago to be like the world of Twain's day or ours?"},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"While the critique of the weaknesses of Arthurian society are obvious, this is a really remarkable book for its critique of Twain's (and perhaps our) America. The ending can be seen as a prophetic warning of the consequences for war of the adoption of modern technology. Even Twain's accounts of the problem of instantly democratizing a traditional society seem remarkably current to today's efforts to bring our political system to Eastern Europe, etc. This is no teenage science fiction novel, but as usual with Twain, a book with many meanings and insights."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"This book is not a &quot;good&quot; book, in that it fails to achieve its supposed purpose (which is to deprecate chivalric romance). Yet the sheer fascination of this incredibly poigniant failure is enough to keep me returning! It nothing like the &quot;cute&quot; kids versions and movies that it has inspired. Prepare for a vitriolic horror-ride that seems to prove nothing but man's futility--i.e., welcome to Twaine's latter period. Mark Twain's work of psuedo-realistic phantasy is perhaps the most marked and fascinating failure in literature. In the novel Twain sets science and technology against chivalry and romance. Twaine attempts to overthrow a thousand years of fuedal and romantic tradition by means of scientific and economic efficiency. Yet (without revealing too much) in the end the Yankee must praise the romantic hero King Arthur; has used the very superstitions he disdains to dupe the people; come to love an archetype of the simple medieval personality he despises; and, amazingly, has threatened to destroy an entire civilization. In the end the only thing the Yankee proves is that modern man is far too arrogant for his own good, and that it is all too easy to become the villain you hate. So what was Twaine's point? Supposedly to prove the vast superiority of the modern age over the Chivalric Age. But did Twaine actually believe his utterly amazing ending carried out his task? I doubt it; I think the book is a classic example of Twain's disbelief of everything. But the world my never know."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"I was excited to get a copy of A Connecticut Yankee, since I hadn't read it in twenty-five years, but to my dismay, the print is eye-strainingly small. The story is just as classic as always, and to it I give a galaxy of stars. However, to the knuckleheads at Bantam, I have only condemnation. The print is as small as I have ever seen. My thirty-something eyes are still strong, and are aided by glasses, but I find that after a half an hour, I must put the book down. Spend a little more money, and do yourself a favor, and buy a different version of this wonderful book."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"A Connecticut Yankee In King Arthur's Court. What can I say? The title of this review pretty much explains it all. Yet, odds are it could just be me. It is most likely that my complaints are based on opinion, as there is not too much fact within the topic of the quality of literature. The story, which is a clich&eacute;-spawner (more on this later), is about a \\"Connecticut Yankee\\" who is not properly named for most of the plot. In the preface, the Yankee, mostly referred to as \\"The Boss\\", is clonked on the head by a crowbar and miraculously wakes up over one thousand centuries prior. Medieval Times soon turns to be a harsh place for the Yankee, instantly reducing him to the status of a slave. By using his prior knowledge of the date of a solar eclipse, he convinces the higher powers of the land (and everyone else in those times), that he is of magical roots. It is here that we witness one of the biggest thematic sequences of the book. The Yankee is befuddled by the nave nature of the English population, and as an effect, continues to take advantage of this facet of medieval life. The Yankee himself is a very clever character, as we first see with his usage of the solar eclipse, and then again when he \\"MacGyver's\\" together a lightning rod and gunpowder to exterminate Merlin the Wizard's tower. Actions such as this could be easily compared to the antics of Twain's other character, Huckleberry Finn. The Yankee goes through several years with trying to conduct Industrial change years before any such events would have occurred. The push for change continues when The Yankee takes on a quest to help a woman by the name of Alisande, or Sally. On a quest to save a number of maidens, they happen upon two ordinary peasants. Eating breakfast with them, The Yankee questions them about the idea of a more modern democracy, planting the seed for rebellion. The climax of the novel comes when a Tournament with a knight ends with The Yankee displaying his future weaponry in the form of a revolver, in which he uses to shoot his opponent and 9 other knights dead. In turn, he reveals his underground 19th century movement upon the world. In efforts to not give away the ending, I'll stop there. In my opinion, the plot here is one of random events that all concur to the same centralized theme. While this sounds fine in theory, the actual execution of such a technique is hardly appropriate. I found novels such as Huckleberry Finn much more approachable and I was able to enjoy it more, as the plot was much more rich and fun. I would probably recommend this book to someone looking for a satire of history, more than someone looking for a story with a fantastic plot."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"This novel tells the story of Hank Morgan, a 19th century engineer from Hartford, Connecticut who through a strange turn of events finds himself in the 66h century England of King Arthur. He is almost immediately captured by a knight upon his arrival in the 6th century and taken to Camelot where he learns he is to be executed in a couple days time. Using his superior modern wit to escape the situation, hank sets out on a grand process of introducing 19th century technology, know-how, education, and values to Arthur's realm.The novel is filled with many humorous moments as is apt with other fiction from Twain but there is also a distinct dark side to the story that becomes ever more apparent. The impact of the past with the present (at least at the time of writing) results in the dismantling of the romantic view of the past while simultaneously reveals the faults in the belief of scientific and social progress. The England of Arthur is depicted as one where the people, although not generally subjected to the institution of slavery, are for all purposes the equivalent of slaves. The \`freemen' of the day have no rights whatsoever and are subject to the whims of a nobility whose only entitlement to rule is blueness of their blood. The Church is similarly depicted as repressing force against the mass of humanity. The protagonist Hank struggles endlessly to awaken in the people a sense of social justice and outrage at being treated as dirt by their noble lords. He is constantly frustrated in his attempts though and concludes that the level of indoctrination is so deep in the people that only large structural changes and the rise of a new generation will provide the seeds for a revolution to overturn the existing order.Hank Methodically sets out to accomplish just such a revolution by starting clandestine centers of education and industry, all the while keeping an eye on the Church so as not to have his program disrupted. With the introduction of modern technology and education, \`progress' moves along at a steady pace. But with all the advances to society also comes the capacity to disrupt and destroy as much if not more. In seeking to replace the controlling ideology of the Church, Hank inadvertently sets up a rival ideology that demands the complete submission of the people as well.Twain's criticisms of the 19th century become all the more apparent when applied against the backdrop of an age unrecognizable to ours. It is rather amazing that the problems he confronts, free market capitalism, mechanization of war, political ideologies, confidence in a historical progression towards a better society, would all come to the fore in the 20th century as pressing questions confronting a world with the ever growing capacity to destroy itself. The novel stays true to Twain's pessimism concerning his day and the \`damned human race' ends with a truly terrifying scene. All good novels have to concern themselves with themes that go deeper than the mere story that they tell. Twain certainly does not disappoint with this effort."},{"Title":"A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library)","review":"How is it a book written 120 years ago can still be so funny? He's just that good. It's true, some pieces of this are dated and, frankly, the facts regarding populations and cargo tonnage and numbers of schools in various towns is not very interesting, but there is only so much of that to put up with.

This book clearly reflects that from the beginning to the end. Twain is a riverboat captain, and travels up and down on the Mississippi river, seeing cities such as New Orleans, Memphis, and St. Louis. He describes his experiences in very lively fashion to the extent that the reader can very well imagine what river travel was like in Twain's time. It should not be forgotten that river travel at that time was commercial and an essential way of getting back and forth. And Twain makes the reader feel that riverboat travel was lots of fun and very adventurous even at that time. The book is a valuable contribution to history in that Twain accurately describes what has happened and what the events mean for those who live in that time period. Personally, I feel that this is one of the best books I have ever read. Also, the last time I went on a trip aboard the steamer NATCHEZ in New Orleans, I heard the on-board announcer say that if Mark Twain were alive today, the NATCHEZ would be his home.

It rarely has insights, however, except a few &quot;anaylses&quot; of the musicals themselves that often border on the ludicrous (such as how many references to S&amp;M there are in his works). There are misspellings of people's names, wrong dates, and some confused plot descriptions as well. But most of all, she seems too polite and distanced from her subject, offering facts but not insight or exploration. I'm not asking for National Enquirer-style dirt, but there is more on the inner-workings and intrigue of such works as &quot;Merrily&quot; in Craig Zadan's &quot;Sondheim &amp; Company,&quot; which unfortuantely is out of print, I believe. Furthermore, Secrest is often a confusing writer. She switches pronouns without always making it clear who is now doing the talking, or includes an out-of-context quote without explaining its meaning or context. She also repeats herself in several spots, making me think she revised one segment while forgetting what she had written just a page later or earlier. In short, this book needed an editor, as well as a more probing and insightful author. Most biographies suffer from excessive speculation. This one has just the opposite flaw."},{"Title":"Stephen Sondheim: A Life","review":"I bought this book after it had been hyped up in &quot;The Sondheim Review&quot;, a magazine for Sondheim junkies like myself.

There is some musical theater critique, but her lack of knowledge in this area is unbelievable.

It is pedestrian and uninspiring - - surely Mr. Sondheim could have entrusted this work to a writer with more flair, skill and specialist knowledge of the creative and professional worlds he inhabits. The most striking aspect of Ms. Secrest's book, in my view, is the snobbish and insupportable bit of American bashing she indulges in. She introduces the notion that Sondheim has found a more receptive audience for his work in England than he has in the US, and posits that this is attributable to the superior &quot;training&quot; of the English theatre-going public (e.g., rigorously schooled in Shakespeare, a native love of language, etc.). I am an American and an avid theatre-goer who has been resident in London for seven years, and cannot identify any justification for Ms. Secrest's absurd obervations!

Although there are books that are mostly about his work in which you can also find biographical information, this is the first and (thus far) only biography. That's the only reason why I'm giving three stars to this generally shoddy book.What's wrong? First, there is an astounding number of factual errors.In addition to the outright errors, Secrest also makes many misleading, imprecise, or incomplete statements. Loose ends and chronological confusions abound.Some of the people Secrest quotes also make statements that are factually incorrect, and neither she nor her editors (who must take a good share of the blame) caught these mistakes. All of this suggests that she knows little about musical theatre in general or Sondheim's work in particular. She actually gets major plot details of Sondheim's shows wrong. Unbelievable.There are also numerous places where she makes statements that contradict what she writes elsewhere.All these problems seriously call into question how much of the material here that isn't public knowledge can be trusted. You end up wondering how someone who is so clearly unqualified persuaded the people at Knopf to give her this assignment, much less how she got Sondheim to cooperate. She must talk well, but she certainly doesn't write well.Which brings us to the final problem: She isn't a very good writer.Still, if you want a Sondheim bio, this is it. Since Secrest had access to Sondheim and to many of his friends and associates, I'm sure that some of what she writes is accurate. But if you read this, you should just realize that a good deal of what is here is unquestionably wrong."},{"Title":"Stephen Sondheim: A Life","review":"Secrest's bio is still unfortunately indispensible for any student of the man behind the musicals, but its plodding style, many irrelevant asides, and total lack of imagination, wit, or geniune personal insight makes it a difficult read.

Unfortunately, I found an often poorly and pretentiously written book. Some of it is so incoherent that it was hard to believe it had been edited and copy-edited. There were also a number of factual errors in the book, many of them minor, some not so minor, but surprising in a book like this (especially one that Sondheim was apparently allowed to see and comment on before publication).However, what is the Sondheim addict to do? Craig Zadan's &quot;Sondheim and Co.&quot; and Stephen Banfield's &quot;Sondheim's Broadway Musicals&quot; both have much of value (Martin Gottfried's &quot;Sondheim&quot; is awful), even if Banfield's often brilliant and certainly ground-breaking book has a few factual errors of its own. But they are not biographies. If you love Sondheim, this is a book you're going to want to read; there is unquestionably much that is of interest here. Hopefully, no one will read it under the illusion that it is definitive.

Secrest does &quot;get&quot; Sondheim: the man, the composer, the lyricist. She also &quot;gets&quot; his musicals, both as chronicler and as listener. Virtually all Sondheim screenplays, plays, musicals, and individual songs are intelligently discussed. Extensive and intimate interviews with Sondheim provide the basis, but alternative outlooks from his principle collaborators, associates, friends, and enemies also appear. (Insights of his peers are not present since Sondheim has no peers.) The book carries an inside, but not reverent feel. Sondheim's troubled relationship with his mother leading to extensive therapy, his difficulty in coming to grips with his homosexuality, and his periods of self doubt and perceived failure are sensitively covered. Secrest does not hesitate to call attention to perceived shortcomings, but her undisguised love and admiration for her subject continually shine through. The book is geared toward an audience with a serious interest in Broadway musicals with emphasis on beauty and meaning in lyrics. Secrest does footnote her interviews and references meticulously, but I would also have enjoyed a discography and a listing of his songs by musical as elements of an appendix. I especially enjoyed the insight on Leonard Bernstein."},{"Title":"Stephen Sondheim: A Life","review":"A lot of the information is new.

She may quote one person who has a particularly strong viewpoint, but will almost always include a contradictory statement, or one that reinforces it. She writes with wit and with style, using words that are perhaps the best that could be found for the occasion, without making reading too heavy. Even if you were not a musical theater enthusiast, you would still thoroughly enjoy this fascinating book. It describes a man so unique in his lifestyle and his art that he has won himself the highest seat in recent musical theater. He has not always had critical or financial successes, but he (in my mind) has always had artistic ones. Perhaps if would sound like I am writing a review of Stephen Sondheim, but no.

If there is a weakness in the book it tends to be the fact that certain details about a musical are totally deleted. All of the hard work that went into a particular will occasionally be glossed over with a sentence or two. This does not happen often, but it does occur a couple of times. I think Ms. Secrest handled a lot of the material with tact and delicacy. Of course, one of the issues was Sondheim's admission that he is gay. For many years his sex! uality was &quot;known&quot; by everyone who knew him, but it was something that he did not discuss. He discussed with candor his relationships with other men and the emotional roller coaster rid he was on before he came out. I have seen some lukewarm reviews of this book that I did not feel were justified. I found it interesting and a book that held my interest throughout. A definite must for any theatre fan."},{"Title":"Stephen Sondheim: A Life","review":"Perhaps what is most impressive about the Sondheim biography is the detail in which Secrest delves into Sondheim's psychology, especially his relationship with his mother, Janet &quot;Foxy&quot; Sondheim. While most of the history about the development of shows is repetition of what we have already seen in Zadan's &quot;Sondehim and Co.&quot;, and Gordon's &quot;Art Isn't Easy&quot;, the exploration into Sondheim's personal life is delightful, especially since Sondheim has always been a rather private man. His personal relationships are handled with great delicacy and respect, and Secrest makes sure she never judges Sondheim or his behavoir. Being a biography written about a man while still alive, I was afraid the book would take a form similiar to the Issac Goldverg bio of George Gershwin, written in 1931 while Gershwin was still in his prime - it comes across as a biased &quot;Gershwin is God&quot; type book, and it wasn't until Gershwin's death that biographers began looking at his life with objectivity. Luckily, for us, we haven't had to wait for Sondheim's death for an intelligent, thoughtful bio written about the man to surface. If fault must be found with the book, it is that without a solid background in Sondheim lore (ie. having read Zadan and Gordon's book, along with Martin Gottfried's &quot;Sondheim&quot; and Banfield's &quot;Sondheim's Broadway Musicals&quot;), the newcomer may feel a little snubbed at the lack of detail regarding the shows themselves. Even I was a little disappointed at the relatively quick mention of Pacific Overtures and Into the Woods. Other shows, such as Sweeney Todd, received much more mention, and I found myself wishing Secrest had handled each show evenly. Of course I'm aware that Sweeney Todd was one of Sondheim's favorites, a project he initiated himself, and perhaps this explains why there is so much devotion to that specific musical. For any Sondheim fan, the book is a must-have. But even if you loathe Sondheim, &quot;Sondheim: A Life&quot; is also a chronicle of the decline of musical theatre, from the golden age in the 1960's, straight through to the Aluminum Foil Age that has pervaded the last two decades - Almunium Foil, because Broadway has become all glitter, with very little strength behind it. Sondheim, like the song says, has seen good times and bad times, and through them all, is still here. His biography will tell you exactly how he did it, and inspire all of us future-playwrights and theatre-goers to do the same."},{"Title":"Stephen Sondheim: A Life","review":"This is the one Sondheim's fans (and critics, for that matter) have been waiting for -- the first, full-scale, thoroughly researched, smartly written biography of America's premier man of the musical theater. Written with Sondheim's cooperation, this unusually frank account of his early family traumas, personal demons and gay life is balanced by a serious consideration of each of his works (Company, Follies, Sweeney Todd, etc.), how they evolved, their strengths and weaknesses. Sondheim is an elusive character, but this book gives more more of a sense of him as a person than anything I've read before, in years of following his career closely. For theater buffs, a real page-turner."},{"Title":"Stephen Sondheim: A Life","review":"Since 1959 (I was in Lisbon, then, with my actor-playwriter-composer husband - very well known, by now) when I first heard of Stephen Sondheim. it was love at first sound - West Side Story lyrics, for a 22 years actress to be were a dream - and now, 40 years got by and, reading this MARVELLOUS and HONEST book, I KNOW WHY I fell so in love with the man and his work - am finishing the book, and about to recommence it!

It is an accurate portrayal of all of his works and then some. I enjoyed reading the book very much because of my attachment to his musicals."},{"Title":"Stephen Sondheim: A Life","review":"As a Sondheim addict, my hopes for this new biography were high. Unfortunately, they weren't met -- not even close. As has been stated in other reviews, there is little new here, very little insight; Seacrest does talk to a number of interesting people from Sondheim's past, but the passages she chooses to use are ho-hum at best. Perhaps most off-putting is Seacrest's almost unbearably dry writing style. The fact that she could take a subject like Stephen Sondheim and make him boring to read about has to be one of the new wonders of the world."},{"Title":"Stephen Sondheim: A Life","review":"As a true admirer of the work of Stephen Sondheim, I bought this book the day it hit my local bookstore. I was interested in finally reading a complete history (thus far) of the premier composer/lyricist in the American musical theater. What a huge dissapointment this book was. Although this is the first such book to include detailed information about Sondheim's childhood and, on the other end, current personal life, there is a bit too much of it. Secrest digs up no new information of her own, but merely borrows the same quotes we have all read four times before in the other Sondheim books. If you have an interest in this compser, do yourself a favor and read Craig Zadan's &quot;Sondheim &amp; Company&quot;, it is by far the best book on the subject. Secrest also does not quite know what to say about the musical features of his work. If you want a technical approach (albeit an often ridiculous one), read Bandield's &quot;Sondheim's Broadway Musicals&quot;. The only true merit in Secrest's book is in the chapters on the more recent work like Assassins and Passion. She is the first to go into these, as the other books are a bit older. Otherwise, don't buy this book. Everyone should own the Zadan book, and only those with a above-average interest in Sondheim should bother with this mess."},{"Title":"Stephen Sondheim: A Life","review":"The person is at last revealed. I don't understand most of the criticism of the book. If someone wants insights into the process of Sondheim's compositions, read the excellent \\"Everything Was Possible\\" by Ted Chapin. If you want to know about the composer as a person, which very little has been written about, this is the book to read."},{"Title":"Stephen Sondheim: A Life","review":"According to Meryle Secrest, Stephen Sondheim's favorite subject is ambivalence. If Secrest intended to provoke this very reaction in the reader, she has succeeded admirably. Any Sondheim aficionado will be grateful for the first five chapters detailing Sondheim's childhood, school years and early musical compositions. Subsequent chapters primarily contain previously available information about his mature musicals, but only occasionally treat the reader to additional personal details or insights into the character of this most private artist.Unfortunately, the book never offers any original insight into Sondheim's work and fails to communicate any of the visceral excitement his musicals have created on the stage. In fact, the reader begins to doubt that Secrest has ever seen a Broadway or West End production of a Sondheim musical. I vividly remember the original Broadway productions of \\"Company\\" and \\"Follies\\" as two of the most exciting, scintillating and boldly original theatrical productions I have ever seen. One would hardly guess this from Secrest's dry summaries. Her descriptions of these two musicals make them sound as dreary and tedious as Sondheim's harshest critics would have one believe.Overall, the book has a rambling, disjointed quality which proves the New York Times' recent assertion that publishers no longer bother to edit manuscripts in an era when cost cutting and speed reign supreme (apparently even at the venerable house of Knopf). The book ends abruptly, topped off with a dollop of dimestore psychoanalysis.In addition, the book contains numerous factual errors. Secrest states that \\"Company\\" won seven Tony Awards. It actually won six since there has not been a Tony category for \\"Best Producer\\" in at least the last 35 years despite her claims. Secrest later states that \\"A Little Night Music\\" won five Tonys (the correct number) but immediately proceeds to list six individual Tony Awards she claims the musical took home.Some of Ms. Secrest's opinions are just as jarring. She includes \\"Ol' Man River\\" in a list of song titles to purportedly demonstrate that songs in musicals of the 1920's and 1930's had little or nothing to do with the underlying plot. It's hard to imagine a song which is more integrated into a musical than \\"Ol' Man River\\" is in \\"Showboat\\". Not to mention that it was written by Sondheim's mentor, Oscar Hammerstein, who almost singlehandedly created the modern integrated book musical.Although this book is a must for any Sondheim fan given the new information about his personal life, how disappointing that the style and content of this biography do not shine like the brilliantly original, boldly stylized, meticulously detailed and highly polished compositions of the man himself."},{"Title":"Stephen Sondheim: A Life","review":"If you care about Sondheim, there's no way you're going to avoid &quot;Sondheim.&quot; And if you don't much care about the man or his music, you probably wouldn't pay much attention even if the book were on par with Richard Ellmann's biography of Oscar Wilde -- which, I can assure you, it is not. There is certainly a great deal of information in &quot;Sondheim,&quot; and there are moments of insight and even lyricism in Ms. Secrest's presentation. What there isn't, however, is a sustained, properly distanced critical perspective. Often this book seems like the autobiography Sondheim can't bring himself to write. Worse, there are so many bizarre time shifts and narrative fractures as to suggest that the book was not treated to the services of an editor. A sad thing, given the fabled meticulousness of the subject as well as the Knopf imprint.If your shower singing is about the wife whose &quot;sweet imbecilities tumble so lavishly onto her lap,&quot; nothing's going ! ! to stop you from reading this book, in spite of its flaws. But if you have no idea why perpetual anticipation is good for the soul, go listen to Ella sing &quot;I Wish I Were in Love Again&quot; instead. It'll be a lot more edifying about words, music, and life, if not about Sondheim."},{"Title":"Stephen Sondheim: A Life","review":"This new biography of Stephen Sondheim doesn't tell us all that much about the man. I also found the discussion of his work fairly simplistic. The author often relies on other sources and reviews rather than stating her own opinions about Sondheim's compositions. I often got the impression that the writer hadn't even seen his shows on stage. The more interesting parts are about his growing up period and his recent romantic life. Perhaps this will appeal more to those who know nothing of his contributions to the musical theater."},{"Title":"Stephen Sondheim: A Life","review":"One of the best things about Meryl Secrest's biography of Stephen Sondheim is that you finish it with a strong sense of knowing its subject fairly intimately--a tough thing with someone as enigmatic as Stephen Sondheim, who has been famous for his reticence and elusiveness. Having worked with him before for her biography of Leonard Bernstein, however, Secrest lobbied Sondheim hard to be allowed unprecedented access to him so she could write a work about his life, and she succeeded. Although some theater fans have complained that the book isn't juicy enough, it's hard to expect how it could have been more lurid given Sondheim's unstinting cooperation with the author, and he is exceptionally forthcoming about his difficult relations with his mother, his marijuana use, his health problems, his loneliness for much of his life... and most of all about his opinions of his work. Often his own toughest critic, Sondheim is remarkably candid about which of his shows and songs he thinks work well and which don't; I often found myself agreeing with his assessments (and amazed at his humility despite his indisputible brilliance). While it is true Secrest doesn't give as much attention to interpreting his shows or his songs as a more scholarly biographer might have done, you do come out of this book with a strong sense of the arc of Sondheim's life: his simultanoeusly privileged and unhappy upbringing; his early successes as the lyricist for WEST SIDE STORY and GYPSY; his trouble getting more people to take him seriously as a composer as well as a writer in the Sixties; his amazing series of critical (but not popular) triumphs in the Seventies; the dispiriting disaster he encountered with the Broadway production of MERRILY WE ROLL ALONG; and his subsequent comeback as the Grand Old Man of the musical theater. You also get a strong sense of his most important relationships in his life: with his awful mother, his kindly mentor Oscar Hammerstein II, Hal Prince, Arthur Laurents, Lee Remick, James Lapine, Anthony Perkins, and his stunning assortment of leading ladies (from Ethel Merman and Angela Lansbury to Alexis Smith and Donna Murphy). And above all the man himself also emerges from the text: wry, sardonic, sensitive, elusive, and remarkably interested in helping young people interested in theater and music. This is not the last word that will be published on Sondheim's life, but this is undoubtedly the most authoritative and clear-sighted work we will have during his lifetime."},{"Title":"Stephen Sondheim: A Life","review":"I bought this for my boyfriend, a huge Stephen Sondheim fan, who has already read planty about Sondheim's works and life. He could not put this book down. I have not read it myself, but when he can't put a book down, I know I picked out something good!"},{"Title":"Stephen Sondheim: A Life","review":"Secrest is a fine writer, although I think her very straightforward style seems a bit pedestrian in the face of her fascinating subject; much like with her Frank Lloyd Wright biography. I wish she had been more attentive to Sondheim's personal life, since his work has been dealt with better elsewhere, and the book really works best when it looks at the man who shapes the artist. A good job, but not as monumental as we Sondheim freaks wished for and needed."},{"Title":"Stephen Sondheim: A Life","review":"This book is a wealth of information for anyone who loves Sondheim or musical theatre in general. I consider myself a Sonheim fanatic, but I still found information in this book that I had never heard before. To top it off, the book contains anecdotes and black and white photos of other Broadway legends like Harold Prince and Jerome Robbins.The author does stray from the topic at hand from time to time and goes off on some interesting yet irrelevant tangents. Also, in attempting to briefly summarize some of Sondheim's shows, Meryle Secrest is, at times, incorrect about the events or actions in the play.Aside from these minor infringements, which any semi-knowledgeable reader would easily recognize, the book is interesting and compelling. I couldn't put it down."},{"Title":"The Bamboo Blonde","review":"Dorothy Hughes is one of the best authors that is able to perfectly recreate the atmosphere of an era that is long gone.

Then, too, no body bothered with even minimal line editing so the typos and very odd space breaks are off-putting."},{"Title":"The Bamboo Blonde","review":"The story line is weak and rambling; the ending no surprise.

The subject matter itself is very intriguing in that it deals with the plots that Germany was subjected to through its rather tumultuous history. Architecture assumes importance as a manouvreable political tool. The classical buildings standing over time accrue layers of significance as they play host to various disparate and historically significant events of the different political eras of Germany. Also the predicament faced by contemporary Germany in its search for a new identitiy reflects strongly on the indecisive and wavering nature of contemporary planning and development control. All these are brought to light effectively by Michael Wiese, who surprisingly, is not an architectural critic. Aided generously by some good photographs, the narrative is equally exciting when it talks about the history of Hitler's third reich or about the architectural inclinations that marked the attitudes of west and east Germanys before unification. A must read for those interested in German history and politics. Also, anyone interested in the performative and symbolic power of architecture will be delighted by Capital Dilemma."},{"Title":"Labor's stronghold: 120 years of Local 22, United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, in San Francisco, California, 1882-2002","review":"I am using the book for the children to see the novel of the story in their reader.

Highlighting such bright spots as the sucess of detente while at the same time addressing some of the darker aspects of the '80s (e.g. the rise in income inequality, S&amp;L Crisis, the US as a debtor nation) Schaller's book is probably the best starting point in understanding the causes of Reagan's ascension and the consequences of his polices. His obserbvation that the 80's were an era when Americans &quot;suspended disbelief&quot; is well taken. Schaller makes clear that Reagan did have some solid achievements while at the the same time his &quot;Teflon&quot; quality left him unjustifiably untainted by a number of scandals. Reagan emerges &quot;tall in the saddle&quot; as the Cold War nears its end, but not nearly as tall as some Reagan apologists would lead you to believe. The overall picture on of Reagan's foreign policy is favorable. In the area of domestic policy Schaller is much more negative towards Reagan. Not surprsingly, Schaller saves his hatchet work not for his evaluation of Reagan the man, but his evaluation of those who benefited most from the Reagan years: Yuppies, moneylenders, and investment bankers. Reckoning with Reagan is especially effective for those whose formative and/or adolescent years were during Reagan's Presidency. A wonderful detour through the 80's and its President."},{"Title":"Reckoning with Reagan: America and Its President in the 1980s","review":"This book by Michael Schaller is an excellent work taking a look at Reagan the man and Reagan as President. I was assigned this book and used it in a major term paper for one of my classes in college. Schaller's book was instrumental in my paper and helped me argue the fact that Reagan was responsible for ending the Cold War. Aside from my paper, Schaller provides little known facts and an excellent background section on Reagan. Although hampered by the fact that many sources and documents were not public at the time this book was written, Schaller does a fine job looking at the Reagan Presidency. Definitely recommended for anyone researching about Reagan or just wanting to read about him."},{"Title":"Reckoning with Reagan: America and Its President in the 1980s","review":"&quot;Reckoning with Reagan&quot; makes some nice attempts at getting a grip on Reagan's presidency.

The work is footnoted to provide jumping off points for more research.

Since then, my coopy has literally fallen aprt, and I was delighted to see a reprint.The heroine, Marcia, has a good life. Her family wants her to have a different life. How Marcia gets what she alsways dreamed of and makes her family happy is a funny, bitter, and very true story. Anyone who has ever tried to forge a life of their own will see themselves in Marcia.I know this book so well, I sometimes quote parts of it. It has never failed to give me pleasure, and it has the right mix of good writing, good characters and good plot to keep the story moving.Buy it and read it before Labor Day!"},{"Title":"Close Relations","review":"Isaacs follows the great COMPROMISING POSITIONS with another winner that follows similar lines. Only in this case it is not middle-America suburbian married life that is being examined but poor Marcia and her gaggle of well-meaning relatives. She is introduced to loser after loser until there he is one day.The sexual exploits combine with her amateur snooping to create a funny, intriguing book with characters as well-honed as the plot. Isaacs has a way with words and specializes in dialogue of the funny sort. I again laughed out loud over and over and the characters became almost like the people you meet daily. Good fun can be had by all."},{"Title":"Close Relations","review":"As I read Close Relations, I often felt like the weather broadcaster in the movie \\"Groundhog Day.\\" Our heroine, Marcia, is stuck in an impossible relationship with a thinly-drawn co-worker during a political campaign, and their fights and the campaign scenes are endlessly replayed. As every possible political and relationship cliche is played out, we also have to deal with every possible stereotype of oppressive Jewish relatives hungry for their offspring to marry.Marcia is supposed to be a high-powered political operative and in demand for her speech-writing skills, but little evidence of this is shown. Given the mess of her personal life, it's a bit hard to imagine she functions so well professionally.If all of this weren't tedious and insulting enough to the reader, Marcia meets Mr. Right finally and, of course, Mr. Right is not only a perfect conversationalist, a gourmand, good-looking, liberated, and a magnificent lover but also RICH, RICH, RICH! Just like real life.I generally like Susan Isaacs and her wit and good writing tend to keep me in one of her books to the end, despite its quality. Unfortunately, Close Relations is one of her lesser offerings and I grudgingly gave it only three stars."},{"Title":"Close Relations","review":"In New York City, Marcia Green is a successful political speechwriter. However, her family, instead of marveling at her success, loathe her job that her mom and aunt believe interferes with her meeting a nice Jewish dentist to marry and bear grandchildren. Just because she is thirty five, divorced from Barry Plotnick and happy with her work and sex with Jerry Morrisey are irrelevant to her mom and aunt. They cannot understand how Marcia can live with someone whose DNA runs towards boiled potatoes instead of appreciation of the fine art of a knish.However, when Marcia meets her Mr. Perfect, she wants to run away before her family stalk him. David Hoffman is affluent, handsome and intelligent as expected of a Harvard Law School Graduate; but his greatest trait besides not mentioning his alma mater is his fearlessness when he enters the Green family jungle. As he falls in love, she remains in a state of \\"Definitely, Maybe\\" denial.This is an entertaining reprint of a 1980 fine character study although the support cast consisting of her family and co-workers are purposely hyperbole stereotypes. Marcia is marvelous as her professional life is perfect (at least she says so) and her personal life a mess (at lest her mom says so). When David enters her life, he nukes her feelings as she reconsiders what she wants in a man looking back to Forest Hills HS and her crush on Barry for guidance. Fans will enjoy this pre-Twitter era tale with a touch of chick lit before that became fashionable.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Close Relations","review":"Interesting, but ultimately a predictable story.

I could relate to a nice Jewish girl living with someone so far outside the faith and her family's reactions.

Just a tad dated, but doesn't take away from this most pleasurable read."},{"Title":"Close Relations","review":"Oy. I bought this in 1980, read half of it, and threw it across the room, unable to believe that the author of Compromising Positions had written such crude stereotypes about materialistic Jews & alcoholic Irish.

If not, it's a skip."},{"Title":"Close Relations","review":"I enjoyed Close Relations, didn't realize how long ago the book had been written. However, except for technology the book was up to date."},{"Title":"Close Relations","review":"Isaacs follows the great COMPROMISING POSITIONS with another winner that follows similar lines. Only in this case it is not middle-America suburbian married life that is being examined but poor Marcia and her gaggle of well-meaning relatives. She is introduced to loser after loser until there he is one day.The sexual exploits combine with her amateur snooping to create a funny, intriguing book with characters as well-honed as the plot. Isaacs has a way with words and specializes in dialogue of the funny sort. I again laughed out loud over and over and the characters became almost like the people you meet daily. Good fun can be had by all."},{"Title":"hall of famers","review":"I loved this book. It contains great profiles and lots of action photos of all the old greats before 1973.

The photographs are better than other books, simply because they are different and you can't stop looking at them. For anyone who enjoys the Romanovs history, this book is a must. For anyone who enjoys a good history book, this is also a must. This is an excellent book and I recommend it 100 percent."},{"Title":"The Sunset of the Romanov Dynasty","review":"This was one of the first books to be published on the Romanov's in English by the Russians after the fall of communism and it showcases some the rare photos that they had tucked away in their deep archives. Even now you'll find various photos here of the Imperial family from the time of Alexander II onwards that you won't find in any other book on the family. The text is interesting, though I'm not sure it adds much that you won't find in other newer books, but nevertheless I have occasionally seen extensive quotes from this book in other sources.If you are interested in the Romanov family, and particularly the photography of the family then this is a book that should be on your shopping list. It has a nice mix of both formal and informal images and a good overview of the family and in some places does mini-biographies of various individual members and other people associated with their story (eg Count Witte, Rasputin, Anna Vyrubova and Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna, though it does have a few odd missing people like Grand Duchess Marie Pavlovna the elder and her husband Grand Duke Vladimir). This book is highly recommended for those interested in the Romanovs."},{"Title":"The Sunset of the Romanov Dynasty","review":"The Russians eliminated the Romanovs and their dynasty in 1917 and after 75 years and the collapse of the empire that destroyed them Russia published one of the first books on the dynasty. Even mentioning the Romanovs durning Soviet times would lead to trouble thats why the survival of many documents and photos is such a pleasent surprise.The book covers the life of Russia's last Tsar and the political climate of the empire. The book published in 1992 had a wealth of new information and photographs unseen in the many Western publications before. Although the book features mini bios of key players in the dynasty it is a bit uneven. They feature small bios on Grand Duchess Olga and Tsesarevich Alexei but nothing on Tatiana, Maria and Anastasia. There is one on Anna Vybonya yet none on Grand Duke Vladimir or his wife Meichen.I would not catagorize this as a picture book but it does feature many beautiful photos that cover multiple pages. Warning this is not a book that is specific to Nicholas and Alexandra but instead covers a much bigger scope. Overall a fantasic book worth owning for anyone wanting to know about the last Tsar and his empire."},{"Title":"The Sunset of the Romanov Dynasty","review":"Best table book that I have seen on the Romanovs fantastic life style that many felt ruined russia. such a wild and crazy ride"},{"Title":"The Sunset of the Romanov Dynasty","review":"Beautiful book requested as a birthday gift for someone who loves anything about Russia and Russian History.

One fateful afternoon, though, I was bored in class and lo and behold, a casual friend of mine let me read one of his mangas. It happened to be the one I'm reviewing. And the addiction begins. Right after school I rushed and picked up a copy of this.I used to be one of the people who'd kind of look down on manga - the expressions were funny, the dialogue was kind of hokey. My entire perspective of it changed once I started reading \\"Hana Kimi.\\" The plotline is gold - a girl tries to hide her sex while attending an all boys school and swooning over her high jumping hero. The characters are eclectic and their personalities are strong, making you soon love and hate certain characters right at their introduction. The art is brilliant too; in a later volume, Mizuki's expression when she discovers accidently crawling into bed with Sano is CLASSIC.This is a great beginning to a great series. There are currently only 4 volumes out in English, so you can catch up quickly. The plotlines don't weaken, I promise. It only gets better as the story continues!"},{"Title":"Hana-Kimi: For You in Full Blossom, Vol. 1","review":"Hana-Kimi is about a spunky girl named Mizuki Ashiya. An American-Japanese track-and-field star who transfers to a japanese school from the U.S for one reason only... to see her idol, Izumi Sano, jump in the high jump. Sano, during a big tournament, gets tramatized about high jumping because of the pressure. Oh yeah did I mention that Mizuki is pretending to be a boy? She tries to get Sano to go back to high-jumping by encouraging him and, well, bugging him about it. Naturally Sano thinks that Mizuki is really weird because \\"she\\" always follows him around and can't really hide the fact completely that \\"she\\" likes him. This series really hooks you and it has really interesting plots all throughout. There are times when they have a school festival and one of the activities is sort of like a \\"miss japan\\" for the school. The school has all boys, so the boys have to dress like girls and everyone else votes for the prettiest \\"girl\\"! Mizuki is a girl dressed up as a boy dressing up as a girl! The only part is something unexpected happened... *not telling*. Mizuki is always trying to hide the fact that she's a girl, but wouldn't she be surprised if she knew a few people already know her secret, Sano included! One time \\"she\\" went to a beach house to work as a \\"waiter\\" during summer vacation. Imagine her surprise when Sano desides to go as well! One of the other waiters finds out that Mizuki is a girl and tries to get her away from Sano. That ending didn't turn out the way he expected..."},{"Title":"Hana-Kimi: For You in Full Blossom, Vol. 1","review":"I'm just starting out with reading manga, but I can tell I've found a gem in this one (only the 4th manga I'd ever read). After being sort of bored and uninspired with Kare Kano after reading two good drama/action mangas, I wasn't too trusting of the shoujo genre. Then I saw a review for Hana Kimi online. It sounded promising, and lo- Viz was putting out an english version! So, I bought it and started reading. It was very interesting from the first page on, (although Mizuki's brief bout of fangirling was a bit offputting in the first few pages). Then Nakatsu appeared, and I was lost in laughing. The whole manga was just one long string of HILARIOUS occurences. I liked it so much I bought the second volume soon as I could!All the characters are very likeable. My favorite would be Nakatsu cause he's sooo funny and sincere at the same time. Even Sano, for all his annoying angsty behavior, gets a more agreeable personality as the volume goes on. Mizuki is a good character too, and though a bit naive, turns out to be quite strong. And of course, who could forget doctor Umeda? ^_^The one minor beef I have is that the artist, Hisaya Nakajo, tends to draw her characters with very similar faces, so that hair color/clothing is the only way to distinguish some characters. A few times, I wasn't sure if it was Mizuki or Nakatsu I was looking at! But that's a minor thing, and does not detract too much from the story at all.So, if you're looking for instant and constant humor, can take some moderate angst and don't mind occasional references to homosexuality and gender confusion, or just like looking at pretty boys like Sano and Nanba, this manga's for you!"},{"Title":"Hana-Kimi: For You in Full Blossom, Vol. 1","review":"I've picked up Hana-Kimi several times at the local bookstore. I've put it down several times too. I've glanced through it... read the synopsis. It sounded too forced to me. Girl idolizes Japanese athlete, moves to Japan and crossdresses her way through an all boy school, just happens to be his roomie. So I put it back down. While picking up my copy of the latest Hot Gimmick the cashier starts talking to me about manga. I asked her what she would recommend. She mentioned Hana-kimi, Fruits Basket, Gravitation... amoung others. So, I picked up Hana-kimi... AND I AM SO GLAD I DID. The execution of all said awkward elements was great. The story is not bland, contrived, awkward in any way. There is a lot to be excited about. Sano (Japanese athlete idol) is a really awesome character, and so is Nakatsu (peer who is hilariously freaked out when he starts to develope feelings for Mizuki- the supposed guy). It will be interesting... because the love triangle works. I don't know who I want her to end up with, and it's only the first volume!!! It's definetly worth it!"},{"Title":"Hana-Kimi: For You in Full Blossom, Vol. 1","review":"This is a tale of a girl's fantasy to get close to a star athelete named \\"Sano.\\" Sano is a high jumper that has recently retired from jumping and Mizuki is determined to start him up again. Mizuki cuts off all her hair and transfers herself to an all boy's school. To her luck, her roomate just so happens to be Sano! Though it makes it more difficult to keep her disguise, she is easily tempted to put hints onto Sano to go back to jumping. What Mizuki doesn't know is that her secret is out, but Sano goes a long with her little fiasco. Mizuki, already caught as a huge fan, falls in love with Sano but can't say anything about her being a girl. To Sano's suprise, he ends up developing a crush on Mizuki but doesn't want it to look like he has feelings for a guy.This manga is a great series! I've been reading manga for years and would have to give mad props to Hisaya-san for creating such an interesting comedy. This book is great for beginners and regular manga readers. It's a page turner that will definitly catch your attention. Great buy!"},{"Title":"Hana-Kimi: For You in Full Blossom, Vol. 1","review":"Osaka Private High School is an all boys academy, so why exactly does freshman Mizuki Ayahiya want to attend there? First thing, she's a woman, and in America besides (event though she's of Japanese descent). Well, three years ago she saw an athlete on television high jump and happened to fall madly in love with the young man. So, now she has decided to transfer to his school to try to meet him and maybe even see him jump, and she couldn't have better luck. Not only is former youth high jump champion Izumi Sano in her class, but she also ends up sharing a room with him.At first meeting she is overzealous about his accomplishments and giddily asks him to be her friend. He misinterprets this completely, thinking that she is a boy, and one with desires for men. After the initial rejection she attempts again to be his friend, but he reveals that he has quit high jumping and this info nearly crushes her completely.While she is trying to forge a solid relationship with Sano she also meets several of the other young men in the school. Shoichi Nakatsu is the token crybaby with bleached hair who finds he has unnatural affections for Mizuki. Minami Nanba is the dorm R.A., a notorious ladies man who's one of the biggest flirts on campus. His 27 year old uncle, Hokuto Umeda, is the school doctor and proud gay man who becomes the first threat to revealing Mizuki's true identity. And then there is Nakao, the former school idol whom Mizuki replaces as favorite, whom swears revenge on her for usurping him.During all of this Mizuki also realizes that Sano has a close female acquaintance who is encouraging him to jump again, and this news causes great pain within her heart, making her question every reason she had for returning to Japan. When it is revealed that Sano suffered a terrible accident and the emotional damage is too great for him to handle, Mizuki renews her quest to see him jump... but how long will he wait before he reveals to her that he knows that she is not a young man? And will this knowledge jeopardize her position at the school?This shojo manga has such a good start. I must admit, I am hooked now. I think I will be borrowing all of the available volumes from work ASAP just so that I might catch up with all that is going on in this series. Sano is such a great character, and I cannot wait to see how long it will take him to admit that he knows that Mizuki is a woman, along with all of the other folks who are starting to suspect as well that she is more than she seems, not some carefree nancy boy they all take her for. This is definitely a worthwhile read, I cannot wait to read the next volume myself."},{"Title":"Hana-Kimi: For You in Full Blossom, Vol. 1","review":"Hisaya Nakajo has done an absolutely WONDERFUL job with this series! It's hilarious, thoughtful, well written and the characters are completely lovable and relatable. Each character is clearly defined and has their own particular personality. This series reminds me a lot of Fruits Basket (another all time favorite), in that I can read about and \\"roll on the floor\\" laughing at the characters and the way they interact with one another for volumes and volumes and years and years and never get tired! (Plus, there are sooo many bishies... always a plus...)I had to write this review because someone made a comment that Mizuki is intelligent.... Mizuki is a total space cadet! She's impulsive, makes really poor decisions as far as keeping her secret an actual secret and is terribly naive, but you love her just the same. Her heart is definitely in the right place, so it's a joy to read about her and her adventures (or mis-adventures) as she pretends to be a guy at an all boy's school, just to be close to her idol, high-jumper Izumi Sano. And of course, with her pretending to be a boy, you get all that great sexual tension, pint-up romantic frustration and teenage angst that we all love so much. :)This series is a fantastic, grade A find, and you'll love it more and more with the purchase of every volume! Not only is the series itself wonderful, but Hisaya's side bar commentary is always witty and entertaining as she gives her opinion on all things American and Japanese pop culture! (She really seems to like Hyde from L'Arc-en-Ciel ^_^) The quality of the artwork in a manga is also important to me, and this too is grade A quality, (she's no Ai Yazawa, but who is!?)I've definitely added it to my list of all-time favorites! Don't miss out!"},{"Title":"Hana-Kimi: For You in Full Blossom, Vol. 1","review":"This was an impulse buy for me and I really was pleasantly surprised! I have been passing up this series for years...but for whatever reason I decided to pick it up and try volume 1 recently (about 2 weeks ago) I CAN'T GET ENOUGH!! I agree with \\"Sexually ambiguous fun\\" the author has done a great job. It is a funny series with moments of seriousness at just the right time. The story is well written with character that you can identify with and even the ones that seem like they should be hated have a tendency to become likable. Of course it doesn't hurt either that the series is full of bishounen!The story may seem farfetched to some but I can't figure out why...there have been several movies of the same nature (girl/guy dressing as the opposite sex to achieve some goal) I think this manga series is better than any of the movies I've seen.I just started volume 7 and they seem to be quick reads. I just can't put them down because I have to know what Izumi Sano is thinking...when is he going to make that mistake and let the totally clueless Mizuki know he knows her secret.

Over a 176 pages of fun."},{"Title":"Hana-Kimi: For You in Full Blossom, Vol. 1","review":"Eyes wide and glazed-over, brain hermetically sealed against anything remotely resembling a clue, cross-dressing \\"heroine\\" Mizuki barrels her way through the interminable volumes of this series without formulating anything like a thought in her head. This is NOT a sports shojo, as she cares nothing for her sport, only for her good looking fellow track star. You could call it a romance shojo, but she doesn't devote any part of her brain to her relationship with this boy either. It is pure swooning infatuation of the sort that would be ruined by actually getting to know him. So she settles for obsessing over him by day, and then \\"unconsciously\\" falling into bed with him and rubbing her breasts against him by night.Naturally he knows she is a girl. He knows because the first time she showers in their shared bathroom, she leaves the door unlocked AND the shower curtain drawn back. Yet after he walks in on her, he simply pretends he still thinks she is a boy, and she believes his act. Mizuki is that breed of heroine whose cluelessness is supposed to be endearing, but comes across passive aggressive. She never grows or changes or needs to, as her idiocy comes in handy forcing others to run around taking care of her. Her girlfriend shows up for a spot of this thankless job, finds out Izumi has it covered, and then quickly leaves, because real female friends are as taboo here as real conversation with boys. This sort of heroine HAS to be the center of male attention, while avoiding anything like real male friendship and emotional connection. Honestly, I don't see the point.Of course, the mangaka's idea of heterosexual relationships for ordinary girls is pretty horrific. A co-worker suspects our heroine is a girl and tries to rape her. Then he is fired because \\"You can chase the girls as much as you like, but not the boys.\\" Gee, thanks boss! One bonus \\"romance\\" features a hero who blackmails his cousin into submitting to his advances by threatening to seduce her little sisters. Another \\"romance\\" features a boy who seduces a girl to get revenge on her father. A supporting character in HANA KIMI vents his insecurity by hurting his girlfriend during sex. With this view of heterosexual relationships, being a lobotomized cross-dresser does sound like a better alternative. Since most of the story revolves around the tortured passion of two boys for \\"clueless\\" Mizuki, maybe this isn't so much a romance as a passive-aggressive female revenge fantasy.This is a long series - but not because it has a lot of story to get through. Each episode treads water around some pointless time-killer, only to leave everyone back where they started. The only subject presumed to be of interest is Who-Likes-Who, which develops a certain intricacy, but never any heart. Shrimp-like Mizuki is treated as an honorary girl/pet by all the other boys, so she scarcely needs to strain herself attempting masculinity, but instead happily coos over cosmetics in front of Izumi. Since he knows she is a girl, and she is too dumb to properly pretend otherwise, this is scarcely even a gender bender. The art is an endless parade of talking heads and identical school uniforms.The one character with half-a-brain is Umeda, the school doctor. He instantly figures out our heroine's true gender, and throughout the series serves as confidante and voice of \\"wisdom\\" (actually cynicism) to her \\"naivete\\" (actually narcissism). He can usually be found inflicting sarcastic abuse on somebody who deserves it. After Volume 10, I skimmed and read only the Umeda bits. He has a lengthy back-story in the second half of Volume 14.Besides Umeda, I have no idea what anyone sees in this manga. I got this from my library, and suggest you do the same. Sports shojo CRIMSON HERO and girl-stalker comedy-drama SKIP BEAT are infinitely better. If you want something lighthearted, but could do without the misogyny and the brainless heroine, then BEAUTY POP is pretty cool too."},{"Title":"Hana-Kimi: For You in Full Blossom, Vol. 1","review":"this was an awesome manga. true it's 21 volumes or some such amount, but it never gets boring and when it ends you get that bitter sweet feeling where you really want it to continue, but are happy that it ended happily. the relationships were well done, and quite honestly, never in my life have i expected to read, and enjoy, a romance story about long jump... but there it is i guess. for me it's one of those that gets better every time you read it (because yes i've read it more than once). its really sweet, i recommend."},{"Title":"Hana-Kimi: For You in Full Blossom, Vol. 1","review":"I got interested in the manga after I happened on the Taiwanese and Japanese live action dramas based on it. Both TV shows were funny, interesting, completely engrossing, and with melodramatic plots that may border on the ridiculous, but still suck you in completely. But though both shows are fantastic, they're very different in plot and characterization. So I was interested in seeing how the manga stacked up, and whether it was closer to the Taiwanese or Japanese TV plot.Bleh. This volume let me down! I've always been somewhat of a manga purist (\\"the manga is almost always better than the anime/adaptation\\" sort of attitude), so I thought that the manga would be everything that the dramas were, but more so. Maybe it was unrealistic, but I thought the source material for these very enjoyable shows would at least be as funny. It really isn't. There's little to no humor that isn't flat and dull, and the manga has very little of the happiness in it that made the TV dramas so much fun. The shows didn't take themselves seriously at all, which somehow made the melodrama that much more engrossing when all the jokes got dropped and the action picked up. The manga is rigid even during the playful parts of the plot.Granted, I've only read the first volume. The second may be amazing. The whole overarcing plot may be amazing. But I have no interest in persuing it, since I just can't see myself slogging through more lifeless and stale jokes and poorly-executed physical comedy to get to it.Fans of the dramas, stick to the dramas. There's more live, more fun, and more overall to enjoy. Fans of gender-bending stories might try Ouran High School Hosts Club- one of my favorites. Give this one a pass. It's not really worth it."},{"Title":"Hana-Kimi: For You in Full Blossom, Vol. 1","review":"I bought this at Barnes and Noble because I wanted to start a new series, and saw that it was a large series.

She devised a plan to convince her parents to allow her to go to school in Japan. However, she leaves out the part about it being an all boys school. She chops off all of her long hair and pretends to be a boy so that she can get close to Sano. Turns out that they will get even closer than she expected when she finds out that they not only have classes together but they are roommates as well!I thought that this was a very cute manga. There is no crazy bad guys or any plot twists. Just a funny story about a girl pretending to be a guy to get close to her idol. Sano of course finds out that his roommate is a girl but plays along for her sake, pretending that he is clueless. Meanwhile, Mizuki thinks that she has everyone fooled and in some cases she does. There is a boy named Nakatsu in her school who is fighting his attraction to Mizuki and he is freaking out over it. He's not gay and tries to justify some of his actions with Mizuki. Poor guy has no idea that he really isn't gay, Mizuki is actually a girl."},{"Title":"Hana-Kimi: For You in Full Blossom, Vol. 1","review":"I own all 23 volumes of this AMAZING series. It's my absolute favorite of all shojo manga--it's got a touch of something for everyone, male and female alike! There's action, there's romance, there's sports, there's drama, and plenty of gags all along the story line! You'll find yourself loving the main heroine, Mizuki, within the first few books, and as the series progresses, you can do nothing but root for her all along the way!I'd give this series a hundred stars, if I could! Hisaya Nakajo is an amazing writer, and I wish more of her beautiful work would be published in America. This, and her gorgeous art book are some of my favorite products! Love this series! Great for those wanting to get into manga, too. The story is light hearted and wonderfully playful enough to keep even the most unattentive readers interested!"},{"Title":"Hana-Kimi: For You in Full Blossom, Vol. 1","review":"I like it very much, in fact, I find it hilarious! This manga satisfies both genders male and female! It's always a fantasy to imagine what it could be like to live with the opposite sex. Mizuki, does that for us. You must buy it! I tell you I love it!"},{"Title":"Hana-Kimi: For You in Full Blossom, Vol. 1","review":"What is the concept behind Hana-Kimi? Let's see:- Girl sees boy- Girl adores boy- Girl becomes boyAnd for that, the manga becomes a huge success with over 20 volumes and counting.[IMPRESSIONS]Japan has pulled a \\"Yentl\\" in the world of manga, and that \\"Yentl\\" is Hana-Kimi, or Hanazakari no Kimitachi E(as if anyone's gonna remember that whole name, which is good for Viz to shorten it). Shoujo has become more of an acceptable genre for me. I got up with the slice-of-life, character-driven depth that is \\"MARS\\", and now I'm getting' down with this cross-dressing pleasantry. Is the Shoujo genre really that desperate to up the ante from the monotonous boy-meet-girl idea by depending on gender-bending? Well, it worked, or else this manga wouldn't have been a success, now would it?Mizuki Ashiya is a typical American teen girl who travels to Japan as a exchange student for an all-boys school. Why: to get close to her track-and-field idol Izumi Sano she admire since her adolescence. How: by putting on a boy's uniform and pretend to be one. The result: one oxymoron of a biased school year. Fortunately for her, her incognito worked and fooled everyone in this school, almost even a reader like myself. Without much on the T & A, she can downright pull it off for being a man(Eat your heart out, Barbara Streisand). It's too bad that the \\"Yentl\\" thing didn't last for long, as later on in the chapter, a wayward homosexual doctor knew that she was a chick when she was knocked down and was sent to the nurse's office, but he was kind enough to keep this a secret. Sadly, another person knew about her gend-bend disguise, and it was the one she idolize, Izumi, but he didn't tell her about him knowing. Great, he knows about her manly disguise, but she doesn't realize that he knows that, so he knows that she doesn't know that he knows that she's pretending to be a he...where was I? Oh yeah, then there's the bleached haired Shoichi Nakatsu. At first, he was cool with Mizuki, now he's at a \\"gay, not gay\\" situation whenever he feel aroused around Mizuki, and sometimes act goofy, and he doesn't know that guy a she(*sniff**sniff* I SMELL A LOVE TRIANGLE!).The cross-dressing concept may be somewhat of a gimmick, but with this manga, it comes off fresh. The idea mixed well with some above-par standards of a shoujo title: character development, back stories, exposed feelings, and a hint of gags. The story and humor drags down a little, and the characters are too similar by their facial structure, but other than that, the manga is solid and actually fun to read. Hana-Kimi has some nifty extras contained in this graphic novel. First off is the author's earlier work, \\"The Cage of Summer\\", which is about a girl who fell in love with her second cousin who is basically a ladies man, a nicotine addict, and a jerk, but the feelings around him couldn't be avoided. Weird incest material, and \\"MARS\\", it is not, but it's nostalgic at its best. Another extra is \\"The Osaka High School Dorms\\", which shows and informs the different dorms in this manga, plus a drawn blueprint of a room's interior. She may not be an architect, but she's good. There's also a short comic about the author working on a manga from her past, \\"Everyday Life\\", and her short discography.To be frank, I'm quite discomfort about Hana-Kimi. This is the first volume, and already, two people know about the main character's identity. If she was to be exposed in front of the whole crowd within a few volumes, and continues to story from then on, I would eventually see this as another tedious which-boy-gets-the-girl romancer. But I trust Hisaya Nakajo, and if she can continue with the whole gender-bending phase for the rest of this series, I would definitely enjoy reading her upcoming volumes."},{"Title":"Hana-Kimi: For You in Full Blossom, Vol. 1","review":"I loved this manga. Everything about it was very well done. The story line is amazing and makes you long for the next book. I have nothing really to complain about.However, you will not like this series if you mind \\"boy-love\\" as there are some scenes that involve it although not many, cross dressing main characters trying to pretend to be the opposite sex because that's the books basis, or if you are a complete realist who cannot read a book that may not be so realistic in the real world. This manga pushes the envelope and what unfolds is a wonderful romantic comedy that most people would enjoy. However, if you do not like the three things listed you will not like the book. but if you don't mind it is a great read and very well drawn."},{"Title":"Hana-Kimi: For You in Full Blossom, Vol. 1","review":"This is a fun and entertaining series.

Of course, those that are waiting patiently for all 23 volumes to come out.... well, you'll be waiting for awhile.But, don't let that get you down, it's a really cute shoujo story. Though, alot of you will disappointed with the ending, it really is a long run manga, with some aggravating parts. \\"I'm a guy, what are you talking about?!\\" Seriously.. almost 20 volumes of that. >_&lt; It gets really annoying.But, I'd have to say, Shuichi Nakatsu is my favorite character. Through out the most of the volumes, he thinks he's gay for liking Ashiya sometime during the series. It's quite cute and hilarious in his moments.As well as the other characters, though, they can get annoying as of sometimes. And the story pretty much just goes on what happens in school, and outside of it.Another annoying thing would be that 6.. maybe 7 guys seem to fall in love with Ashiya. >_> Thus, tearing up fangirls inside... or not.It's definately a must-read... for those who like shoujo, romance, comedy, and shounen-ai. (though.. not really shounen-ai. just wishful things to some.)5 stars for this volume... 4 for the whole series."},{"Title":"Hana-Kimi: For You in Full Blossom, Vol. 1","review":"I have this volume and it's got enough humor in it that I will continue with this series. My 4 stars apply to Hana-Kimi as a story. But the text of this review is mainly to address the short piece at the end entitled \\"The Cage of Summer.\\"This is a very disturbing short story about a manipulative teenage boy and his older female cousin. She catches him sleazing around at a bar; he is shameless about it, and continues to play a dual role of 'angel boy' when he's with her family and manipulative seducer when they are alone together. As the story progresses he convinces the cousin that he loves her (using various typical lines). Then they sleep together, and when the girl awakens, the boy is gone. Two years pass during which she carries a torch for him, and he eventually swans back into her life and tells her he's been trying to transfer to her high school for 2 years because he loves her. End of story.Well, his lines seemed just that - pickup lines fed to a woman he wanted to seduce. The fact that he disappeared that morning seemed to confirm this - that he had been playing her all along and skipped out to avoid the emotional aftermath. The fact that he doesn't resurface for two years also seemed to confirm this - that he simply didn't care about her once he'd conquered. When he is introduced to her as a transfer student he immediately embraces her and they seem to be in love. But even now, his lines don't ring true. Even on a second/third reading, he still comes across as a weasel.Also, the girl is portrayed as a bit of a sap; throughout the story, as he manipulates her, she is completely trusting and believing of all he says, and she doesn't get angry about his skipping out, or anything. She just meanders on about her life. This is supposed to be a love story but it's more like a creepy exploitation story, and makes you just want to slap some sense into the female character.Some people complain that my reviews are too picky and I read too much into things, but this story jarred me. I also noticed this same theme in the Love Egoist stories at the back of Ouran High School Host Club. The man is manipulative and the girl is a sap. Is this really a theme people like to read about?"},{"Title":"Hana-Kimi: For You in Full Blossom, Vol. 1","review":"I started this book because one of my friends had it. She let me borrow it and volume two. Now I am hooked! Mizuki's cross dressing creates hilarious situations that will entice many types of reader. Once you get the hang of reading it \\"backwards\\", it can bring much hilarity to your evening. The doctor is just great, Sano is awesome(every time he rips down a paper I cheer!), Nanba is wonderful eye-candy, and Nakatsu's mixed emotions make for a wonderful time reading this."},{"Title":"Hana-Kimi: For You in Full Blossom, Vol. 1","review":"I find gender bending humor hilarious, but I was really put off by the review from Publisher's Weekly (for the life or me, I can't figure out what \\"high jumping\\" is supposed to be a euphemism for...). However, after seeing other recommendations and references to Hana-Kimi, and considering I enjoyed the one-shot side story about Kayashima published in Shojo Beat, I decided to give the first volume a try.I was amused, not so much by Mizuki's difficulties as a boy, but by the character of Nakatsu. His over-the-top emotionality and bewilderment over his attraction to Mizuki made it worth my time to read.I only give this 3 stars because I find myself largely indifferent to the character of Sano, and because Mizuki just didn't charm me enough to make me want to buy volume 2 and see what happens next. I can't help pulling for Nakatsu and not Sano to win Mizuki, but I don't think it's likely. I enjoyed volume 1, but I don't think I'll be coming back, so I can't give it more than 3 stars.As for the short story \\"The Cage of Summer,\\" I saw it differently from some other reviewers. I didn't see the cousin so much as a selfish womanizer, but as a miserable, lonely young man trying desperately to fill the emptiness in his life and numb the pain of his family situation. More the bad choices of a person who doesn't care if he's self destructive than the actions of a jerk out to enjoy himself at everyone else's expense. If he wasn't so cute that women came to him easily, he'd have turned to something like alcohol - anything to make him forget how unhappy he was.Perhaps I'm being overly generous, but... Rather than being idealistic and stupid, I thought that Toko saw past her cousin's behavior to the hurting person underneath, and that's how she came to fall in love with him. While I don't see why he felt he needed to stay silent for two years, I thought he left because he felt compelled to straighten up and get his act together - as well as persuade his father to allow him to be geographically close - before he would be fit to be Toko's boyfriend, because he really did love her."},{"Title":"Hana-Kimi: For You in Full Blossom, Vol. 1","review":"Hana Kimi is a truly entertaining manga. The powerful characterization carries the plotline along smoothly. Mizuki is a strong female lead; Dr. Umeda is perhaps the funniest adult mentor I've ever encountered in a manga; and Izumi Sano is the epitome of attractive male leads. Many of the other characters provide extra comedic relief.If you enjoy a good laugh and plenty of gender and sexuality confusion in a straight love story, Hana Kimi will certainly make your day."},{"Title":"Hana-Kimi: For You in Full Blossom, Vol. 1","review":"This book is terrible! I borrowed it from my friend (she not having the chance yet to read it) and expected a funny, well thought out book, much like Ouran Host Club, instead I got a fiasco of a manga. After the first few chapters of non-laughing and hating the characters I started to get doubts. This book was terrible, the characters were bland and boring, the main girl was a psycho,her only motive for going to the school was her so deemed 'love' for her crush, a guy who didn't even know her. And was just a sports guy she admired from T.V. The guy himself was a bland mix of other and better manga characters from other manga. The other characters are lost in the haze of stupid jokes and are forgettable. So, if you are thinking of reading this book, having read all the good reviews from others saying this was the best manga in the world. DON'T. I'm warning you for your own good. If you are looking for a well written book with a theme like this book and enjoyable laugh out loud characters please, please, PLEASE, read Ouran High School Host Club by Bisco Hatori."},{"Title":"Hana-Kimi: For You in Full Blossom, Vol. 1","review":"I love this Manga!

You can see Ramona at Univision, which is channel 23 at 4:00pm.The actress is named Kate del Castillo, and it has been a hit in Mexico and the US.I am watching the novel and I can truly say that is as excellent as the book. This book has everything, it has sadness,glorious moments and mostly the discrimination between Mexicans,Yahi Indians and Americans, if you want to read a story that will keep you glued to the book for the whole day, buy Ramona.

I only got into Helen and her work myself because of my interest in Emily and her world. \\"Ramona,\\" though wonderfully well-written and still readable, even historically important, is a 19th century romance, and therefore not \\"literature,\\" properly speaking, nor likely to turn up as required reading in any academic curriculum anytime soon. It's not easy for us today to imagine that age, back when the much more famous Emily Dickinson was still completely unknown, in which the too young death of Helen Hunt Jackson inspired a national day of mourning.Much of the historical interest of \\"Ramona\\" swirls around one of America's forgotten wars, much like Korea, in this case the Mexican War. To this day, Mexico still resents the loss of about half of itself to the burgeoning US, ceded to us by a corrupt pusillanimous Mexican government as essentially spoils of war, with matters considerably complicated by the discovery of gold in a huge chunk of it, California, a couple of years later. The issue in \\"Ramona,\\" however, has principally to do with the fates of the population of the vast new territory at the time, namely its Mexicans and Indians. The tragic destruction of their wealth, ancient land titles and treaties, communities, culture and even people at the hands of the inrushing American population, all under the diffident benign neglect of Washington government, barely stopped short of softcore genocide. Jackson, already a famous writer, as a young New England widow, relocated to the West for health reasons and subsequently remarried, was one of those American thinkers of the day who discovered and got interested in the plight of this displaced, distressed population as a social issue.Jackson wrote a detailed survey of the crisis, with which she bombarded congress, only to get no palpable reaction. Accordingly, she decided that what was really needed was some sort of public outcry, inspired by some sort of popular literature, after the model of her friend and fellow New Englander Harriet Beecher Stowe's \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\\" which had so inflamed the nation as to inspire the Abolitionist movement. The resulting opus was \\"Ramona,\\" the story of the doomed romance of a half breed Mexican rancher's daughter and a young Indian brave, their affairs caught up in the tidal wave of US immigration into their ancestral lands, and it's a dandy. No chick-lit here; it's a much different wild West as seen through the eyes of someone who actually lived there, written by a gal with a real gift for descriptive prose, eye for local color, and a keen insight into the inner motivations of her characters.In one sense, the book was a success; it was a huge best seller, and Emily Dickinson wasn't the only reader, by far, who adored it. In another sense, it failed, perhaps by being too good... certainly a far superior book to \\"Uncle Tom's Cabin.\\" The same general public who were enthralled by its vividness somehow never internalized its story as depicting a real national crisis about which someone ought to do something. In defense of Washington, it must be said that the tiny government of the day, what with Indian wars, Reconstruction and such, already had enough on its plate to tremendously complicate things politically for them, even without such a vexed issue as this one. However that may be, Jackson was not about to give up, continuing to tour and write about the Southwest despite her mounting health problems, which, unfortunately, killed her a couple of years later, with her dreams of social justice still unrealized. The legacy: a ripping good story that lived on for a long time after its author. Not to mention an ongoing sociopolitical crisis with which anybody who knows the Southwest at all is only too familiar."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I AM 79 YEARS OLD AND 'RAMONA' IS THE FIRST REAL BOOK I EVER READ (UNLESS YOU COUNT DICK AND JANE).

The author, herself an activist, tells the story of the injustices that were done to the Spaniards, Mexicans and Indians by the early American explorers who came to California. Ramona, who is part-Indian. becomes the heroine in a tale of love and hate. The book is one of the most famous stories ever written about early California, and there have been annual Ramona-festivals in many towns over the years. There is also a town named Ramona in southern California. Most of the characters are very well drawn, but the main character of Ramona is lacking. This does not spoil the impact of the book. As a lover of early western history in America, this book is the best I have ever read about the transition of the old world into the new. Reading it for the second time, I have enjoyed it even more."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I actually read a 1908 edition of this book but this was as close as I could find. I found Ramona to be a pretty good story but had trouble understanding why it was said to have been monumental in bringing changes to the government's treatments of Native Americans or why it apparently received such myth like status in certain parts of Southern California. I was raised in or had family in nearly all of the territory mentioned in Ramona (which ranges from San Fransisco all the way down to Mexico). I had never heard mention of the story until a local book dealer here in NC offered me a copy of it. It was only recently that I got around to reading it and I did like how well the book describes all the mountainous terrain I grew up in and miss so much, particularly the mention of manzanita trees which are so beautiful but are only indigenous to that area. Also the mention of all the missions, particularly the one in San Diego I visited so often was a nice mental vacation back home.Outside of the background, I was excited to read this book that was suppose to have been so life changing for the Native American people, as half my family falls in that category. Unfortunately, I was not struck by anything earth shattering. Jackson does talk about the government's early allowances of whites basically claiming public domain over the natives' homes and lands, which was definitely tragic but the true horror of what really happened at that time never really reaches the level it needs to to be moving. You would gain more from reading pure historical accounts or textbooks or visiting native area museums near the reservations. I found Ramona to be more of a love story than anything and even the love story was sweet but again, just short of really moving. Ramona herself goes through mental and physical maturity and it was nice to see her grow with each experience throughout the story but her love Alessandro struck me as mostly annoying to be honest. It seemed he spent all of his time in constant outrage, whining, paranoia, melodramatic smoochy love talk with Ramona, or just bat crazy. Granted his people had been through some hell, but even when things were good for him, Alessandro just never struck me as a real man secure in himself and I wondered what Ramona was fawning all over. Even Ramona at one point makes a comment that she jumped to hear Alessandro laugh because it was so rare.I saw one reviewer on another of edition of this book mention that it seemed that Jackson was trying to write how she assumed the Native Americans spoke and acted. That is definitely the impression I got too. Particularly with Alessandro but with many of the Native characters, they would either sound White-influenced or Mexican-influenced in their speech and behavior but never really Native American to me. Jackson's \\"Indian\\" dialog reminded me of the way they would make Tonto speak in the old Lone Ranger movies. Not to mention that Natives (at least the men lol) are not so open with their emotions and feelings, even with wives. There is a guardedness and stoicism that just wasn't well portrayed here.Like I said, Ramona is pretty good to get an idea of the Southern California landscape, and there are some great interesting characters - Ramona herself and especially the sassy Aunt Ri (though her deep Appalachian dialect makes for tough reading-at certain parts it goes on for pages!). The love story between Alessandro and Ramona is cute and bittersweet and you do feel for them through their joys and tribulations, but overall it just wasn't QUITE as moving as I was hoping for."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"As a playwright, I haven't been inspired to adapt a novel until I read Ramona. What works for me? The melodrama is, after all, average, and the love story...a little predictable. But there's something audacious about author Helen Hunt Jackson and her bold \\"Mother Jones\\" muckraking persona that constantly reminds you throughout the pages about the injustices committed against Native Americans. Yet, in spite of this heavy message, there's something utterly fascinating about its main characters--the beautiful Ramona, the daring Alessandro, the unforgiving Senora, even the wimpy Felipe. They create a powerful scenario worthy of intelligent, passionate drama. I, in turn, wrote the play which has been produced at PlayWright's Theater in Phoenix and at Arizona State University in Tempe. I've adapted the story, done my own interpretation of it, but the essence has remained the same."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I had found a a very old handwritten letter written in 1904 by my Great Great Aunt, telling about her trip from Ohio to California.

It is a great read, my Great Great Aunt was correct!!!"},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"Several years ago, I read an article in the San Francisco Chronicle about this book. I was surprised, because I didn't even know that a book was written about how the indigenous peoples of California felt about the change from being governed by Mexico to being ruled by the United State of America. It was heartbreaking to read, but it's a must-read for everybody who lives in this country. May we never forget, so that it won't happen again."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I loved Ramona. It was the most beautiful story I have ever read. A wonderful look at California right after it came under the control of Americans. A story that has history, romance, prejudice, love, loss, and everything in between . Please read this book. I only regret that I never read it until I was in my thirties. This is Helen Hunt Jacksons masterpiece and the attention that it gave to the treatment of Indians is remarkable."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"There is no doubt that Helen Hunt Jackson's novel Ramona is a classic -- the fact that it is still in print more than 125 years after it was first published is testament to that. The novel is primarily a love story set in Old California at a time when three cultures -- Mexican, Anglo and Indian -- were colliding. Jackson's intent was to create a story (and much of the events in the book were real-life events that she wove into her tale) that would bring the plight of the Indians to the attention of the white American population. And in that she had a fair degree of success, as her book was popular and there did seem to be some shift in sentiment towards Native Americans in the wake of its publication.All that being said, Jackson's writing is undeniably weak. Although she was a successful and popular writer in her day, to the modern reader her style is overly melodramatic. All of her characters are one-sided and under-developed. Aunt Ri, who is one of the more interesting ones, unfortunately speaks in a dialogue that is practically indecipherable. Near the end of the book, when some of her speeches go on unbroken for a page or more, I had to skip them entirely because it just took more mental effort to make sense of them than I was able to muster.Ramona, the main character around whom the entire story revolves, is just the sort of heroine that Walt Disney would begin to crank out, starting with Snow White in the 1930s. Abandoned as a child, raised in a loveless home by a foster mother who bordered on cruelty and neglect, Ramona is nevertheless sweet and good and perfect in every way. Oh, and captivatingly beautiful, also (natch). She starts out perfect on page 1 and remains so all the way to the end, and inspires near-reverence in everyone who encounters her. She is a total bore.This isn't a terrible book -- as a picture of the long-lost culture of Old California it is both effective and unique (I know of no other novels set in this time period that are so well-known as Ramona). But it is definitely not all that engaging, as evidenced by how long it took me to read it. I should have easily finished the book in two or three days but it took me more than twice that long, because I just wasn't compelled to pick up the book and read it.For those who are particularly interested and intrigued in the setting of Old California at the end of the Mexican era and the dawn of the American one, I could recommend this. Just don't expect it to rock your world, and you shouldn't be too disappointed."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"This book is an excellent story.

After the 1834 Secularization of the 21 missions in the chain founded by Father Serra, the California of the grandees slowly, inevitably began to fade into historical memory. Three groups were drastically affected by the disintegration of this social system--admittedly not free of innate injustice. Ruin fell upon the devout Franciscan fathers, the Hispanic hidalgos who had received vast estates from the King, and the Native Americans who first respected the land--ever at the bottom of the social chain.Depicted as the underlying moral evil of all three groups are theYankees--Americans in general, whose greed and violence destroyed innocent lives, trampled decades of royal justice and raped the landscape of Alta California with wanton violence and callous indifference. Dispersed among these recriminations and regrets the author weaves a grimly fascinating tapestry of love, psychological brutality, outraged or warped honor and overbearing pride.Senora Moreno rules her household with an iron fist and a cold heart, except where it concerns her only, somewhat nave son, Felipe, 20. A master at manipulation this dowager wields absolute power to her vast household and retainers but also behind the scenes, deferring only to aged Father Salvierderra, for whom she has had a chapel built.Keeping selfish secrets about her dead sister's half-breed daughter (who considers a marriage between a white man and an squaw valid?), she hoards both the jewels and the love int ended for the girl. Obeying only the letter of her promise to her sister, she never intended to honor the spirit of motherhood, thus condemning Ramona to be raised without affection.At 19 Ramona is lovely, sweet, gentle and genteel (thanks to her convent training) but sheltered in a simple country lifestyle, where she is kept in ignorance of the reality of the present world and her own, mysterious past. This tenuous status quo changes when the annual sheep shearing occurs, the year that 21-year-old Alessandro, the educated son of a chief, leads his band of Indians to the hacienda. Their hidden love smolders until it erupts in a passionate embrace, which is unfortunately witnessed and misinterpreted by the shocked Senora.Her outraged reaction and fierce determination to punish theculprits sets in motion a chain of events which result in both the loversfleeing the rancho. There follow years of persecution of this doomed pair, as they seek to live peacefully--in harmony with nature and man. Jackson includes heavy themes in this story: racial prejudice, the power of Catholicism, the tension between mother and son, and the regenerating force of love. Partly a novel of social protest, RAMONA--despite its semi-tragic denouement, remains a classic tale of old California, whose pathos and passion reach out to modern readers."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"This book might be the only romance novel that I've read in my life, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. It painted a detailed portrait/landscape of what California was like in the late 1800's."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"It was a book that kept you reading and reading. Book was in goodshape and packaging was good. Received the book in good time."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I had never heard of this classic 19th century read but I am glad I got to read it. While definitely written in a style and ethos we would consider old fashioned, this book is the Uncle Tom's Cabin of Native American relations and a valuable read. Plus the plot has a satisfying finish."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"This book rivals any of the greats. Sometimes slow reading but for the most part a &#34;can't put it down&#34;."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"Although this is entirely a work of fiction, the author, Helen Hunt Jackson, spent a significant amount of time with the indigenous population of California and asked them extensively about how they felt about their land changing hands from the government of Mexico to that of the United States of America. This is a must-read for everyone who lives and have lived in California, so they can gain a much clearer perspective of what it means to be a Californian. As painful as it is to read about Ramona's life experiences, it is humbling to know what she went through. It leaves the reader wanting to know what happens next."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"The book arrived promptly from the vendor; in excellent condition. Have read it and loaned it to a friend; we both enjoyed the story and the history of early settlement of California particularly."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"This book is so much easier to read due to the large print. I purchased it for my 95 year-old mother and she expressed her joy at being able to read the print without getting headaches."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"The propaganda classic of 1884. Jackson intended to stir American sympathies for the plight of Native Americans, which probably explains the flat perfection of her Indian protagonists, Ramona and her lover/husband Alessandro. The two are hounded pillar to post by greedy American settlers, with no recourse to law and no protection from church or state.I'd give the first half of the book five stars and the second half three. What gives it five stars? (1) The setting: Old California, just after the territory has changed hands from Mexico to the U.S. Both the Moreno ranch and the Indian villages and ruined missions were fresh and alive.(2) Senora Moreno. The wily, domineering matriarch steals every scene from her pushover son Felipe and blandly-angelic foster daughter Ramona. She's complex, and Jackson does a great job getting inside her motivations.And the three-star second-half? Well, when the book has to depend on Ramona and Alessandro for interest, it gets a little dull. The good-hearted Tennessee poor-white family that shows up livens things up somewhat, if only because the reader must expend great effort to translate Auntie Ri's orthographical-nightmare dialect."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"Just when I had begun to despair that I might never truly fall in love with a book again, along came Ramona. From the first page, I was captured by the poetic nature of the writing. Some books can be read quickly, not so Ramona. Every sentence is crafted so carefully, every description so complete, some passages must be read over and over again just for the sheer pleasure of the prose. The plot combination of social justice and romance makes the book amazingly contemporary. The racism of this book is directed toward the Native American population and their story is a heart wrenching one indeed. The description of the startling beauty of the landscape and the lives of the characters stands in stark contrast to the breathtaking cruelty with which this nation took land from its native population. Ramona thrilled me and broke my heart. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I have Heard Ramona by Helen Hunt Jackson described as a &quot;propaganda novel.&quot; That it well may have been in its day. But &quot;Ramona&quot; has not endured all these years because of a propaganda message. This novel has endured because of the trueness of the characters--The noble Alessandro, the patient, tender Ramona, the faithful Felipe, the just, stern, sad Senora Moreno.Even the minor characters are true to form especially the jealous, vindictive Margarita, the loyal Marta, and the strutting but endearing Juan Can.I rediscovered this book in a dusty corner of our public library and devoured in in two days.A book becomes a classic when it becomes part of your soul. The love story of Ramona and Alessandro has burned itself into my heart where it will remain forever."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I just recently heard of this book, although it was a bestseller around the turn of the century, and was popular through the 20's. Modern readers may find the language and parts of the plot melodramatic and overly sentimental, but the characters are strong and memorable, the story is full of exciting incident, and the portrayal of the United States government still shocks. I grew up in California, but I had never really seen how \\"white Americans\\" appeared to the Native Americans and Mexicans who first lived here. \\"Ramona\\" gives the earlier settlers a voice. Erica Baumeister's review, quoted on the Amazon page for this book, states that \\"the book has the flaws of being created by an author who, although deeply engaged and sympathetic, had not experienced the life she was describing.\\" I don't agree--perhaps if I had grown up as an \\"Indian\\" or Mexican in those times I wouldn't find the book convincing, but as it is, it worked for me. The main characters, Ramona and Alessandro, are \\"fairy-tale-ized\\", but their story still touches, and the book still has power. Helen Hunt Jackson purposely wrote \\"Ramona\\" to call attention to the U.S.'s unfair treatment of Native Americans, but the two essays included in the Signet edition claim that, for all the popularity of the novel, it didn't bring results. For that, we have only our own injustice to blame, because this poetic messenger did her best to right some wrongs."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I thought this was one of the best books I have ever read. You will fall in love with Ramona (Majella) and Alessandro.If you are like me your heart will break, then it will heal slowly, but maybe not all the way. While reading this book you may learn some things you did not know before. If you have some spare time, read this book. But don't race through it, there is meaning in every line. I recomend this book mostly to girls. It can be read from teens up. You do not have to be fans of history to love this book."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I must admit I read this novel only to get the background on my girlfriend Majel's name. I initially held no respect for its &quot;Great American Love Story&quot; subtitle, but this book really hit me right in the chest. I liked that I was able to extract the characters' personalities from their words and tones rather than from paragraphs of third-person description. I liked that it piqued my interest in nineteenth century Californian history, especially the upsetting struggle of the Mexicans and Native Americans living there. And lastly, I liked experiencing the boundless love that flowed from the simple, strong and beautiful Ramona. A quick, colorful, emotionally satisfying novel."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"Ramona, set in early Spanish/Mexican California, weaves the tale of love between the Indian Allessandro and the Mexican-Indian girl Ramona. Rich, deep characters and vivid description of the landscapes makes this novel a great piece of California historical fiction. Through Jackson's powerful illustrations, the racism Mexicans and Indians both endured at the hands of White and Mexican settlers is experienced by the reader. Yet the love story is what makes this book and Jackson's romanticism of the landscape and the main charcaters only enhances Californians' fascination with Mission Revival."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"It has been a long time since I first read this book, but the subject matter will be around for a long time to come. Bewitching love story for which at least one beautiful song has been written, \\"Ramona\\" and possibly \\"Vaya Con Dios\\". It is a love story, one whose emotion most of us will recognize; another time, another place, from our own Spring Time; woven skillfully into cultural differences, that somehow begets bigotry, born of all the little differences that make each of us unique, but also make us strange and unacceptable to others who cannot accept differences from what they have always known.The descriptions of that far removed landscape and time are marvelous. The Old early Missions, the sheep, the priests who visit the valley in the traditional way on foot, traveling on ancient footpaths to bring religion to the people (and keep them religious), all are magical in their simplicity as the author brings forth their tale. She is also one of the first to dare write of things unsavory to the average conscience. She took conditions \\"as they were\\" and exposed them \\"for what they were\\" in the treatment of people displaced.It's a setting deep within the Old Spanish Mission Country of Southern California, among the sheep ranches, and steeped in Spanish Culture, strict traditions, and unforgiving religion. Times were hard, values were strict and anyone not fitting snugly into a pre-conceived notion of a pre-conceived group was hard-pressed to find a life to live in peace anywhere. It is in this life where Ramona grows up, a child of a misalliance between the former lover of the Senora Moreno's own sister and an Indian woman - that's a twist in the story to be discovered while reading it. The Senora, for a variety of reasons you will understand as you read, agrees to take the child Ramona in to raise, although she never accepts her, because she is not blood family. The description of Ramona is captivating, long black hair of the Indian girl, dark blue eyes of the Scottish father - truly she is beautiful, but it is also apparent that her beauty goes deeper than the skin; she is beautiful of spirit as well as of the flesh.Alessandro, an Indian lad, comes to work on the ranch early in the spring to help with the annual sheep shearing. Ramona quickly sees in him something she has never seen before - someone who will accept her for whom she is, without reservation, coupled with a gentle mind and character much like her own. She falls in love with him, adding another layer of \\"difference\\" to her half-breed status.Felipe, the beloved son of the venerable, strong and proud Matriarch, Senora Moreno, who rules not only the ranch but her son with an iron hand, falls in love with Ramona himself but knows he can never take her for his own, for many reasons. Those \\"reasons\\" finally dissolve during the tragic ending of the story and what remains of the life of Ramona blends again into the home she left as a young woman - as she tried to make a new life with a stranger she has loved deeply. As she is delivered back to a life of security, she is strangely serene - but never again will she feel wild, young excitement once experienced with Allesandro, the Indian. I offer one of the last lines of the epilogue - as she finally stands \\"quietly in Filepe's arms\\":\\"...how unlike was she to that Ramona who flung herself on Alessandro's breast, crying 'take me with you! I would rather die than have you leave me!'.....\\"Ramona is well deserving of it's place in Classic Literature - a love and strife story extraordinaire."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I heard about the book while hiking at Seven Falls near Colorado Springs. HHJ was suppose to have gone to the overlook there to write, including parts of Ramona. This intrigued me and so I checked it out. I don't read much non-fiction, so I enjoyed the idea of a history based novel. It was enough of a love story for me to earn points with female friends, but enough of an adventure to keep me interested. One part of the book that I found distracting was the attempt at phonetic spelling of the Tennessee drawl of a few characters. I had the hardest time reading that, which perhaps is an excellent way of HHJ to capture the difficulty of listening to it."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"Readers can follow the narrative style of &quot;Ramona&quot; with ease. It does not take a long time to finish reading this book.I like the author's use of a love story, albeit sad and doomed, to shed light on the treatment of Native Indians in American history. You also learn a little about the life of the Mexicans and American settlers in California.&quot;Ramona&quot; can still serve as a reminder of today's social injustices and the role we play in it.Fafa Demasio"},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I admit it...I never in a million years would have read Ramona, if not forced to do so by my history professor for a class in race &amp; ethnicity in American History. However, having said that, I found the book a thoroughly enjoyable read...overdramaticized, yes, but we can forgive it when we consider the original date of publication. However, it is the story behind the story that is most interesting. What Ramona truly is....a middle class white woman's perception of what it might be like to be an Indian. Jackson was an abolitionist turned author in the 1830's. This is her most recognized and extensive work. So the next time you read it, if you read between the lines, you will see HER innate prejudices and assumptions. But,like I said, I enjoyed it immensely and reccomend it as a fun read...but don't take it too literally...it is after all, fiction"},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"Sometimes I wonder if there's a point to reviewing older novels. I mean - there's obviously a point to reading them, and Ramona presents a good case for that. But after reading a book like this it's hard to imagine that others haven't read it, or something like it... until I remember that until this past semester, I'd never even heard of Ramona.For those of you who, like me, had never thought to pick this book up let me just say that it will frustrate, awe, and inspire you. The story is one that speaks of epic, sweeping love and loss, but it's buried in pages upon pages of description which, back in the day before the internet, television, and radio, would have passed for entertainment but today just feels as if it's one more thing to push through in order to get to the meat of the story.Thankfully, I read this book for a classroom setting - so three days were set aside for us to get to the meat and actually talk about the themes and ideas in Ramona.Here's what I came away from this talks with:Even in a story, such as Ramona, when the author is seeking to shed light on the issues of the time (specifically the tensions between whites, Mexicans, and Native Americans), in order for Ramona to be related to she is given \\"white\\" characteristics - i.e. blue eyes from her Scottish Father.Sweeping stereotypes are made not only about the whites (and honestly, as far as stereotypes go, they were pretty harsh but necessary ones) but also about Mexicans. Even the Native Americans in this book did not escape judgement from Helen Hunt Jackson.Jackson has no problem spending 70 pages talking about the little things - making a bed on a porch, tension-filled relationship between Ramona and her adoptive family, and so on.. but she spends less than a paragraph on a vital turning part of the story. In fact, the action and result of this turning part happened so quickly I thought I'd imagined it happening and had to go back to re-read it.I understand from our discussions the importance of a book like Ramona and I believe that it's important that it continues to be read and talked about - but more than anything, I wonder how that will be possible with the changing of our culture. We talk in 140 character tweets - so how can we expect young adults today to be patient enough to read pages upon pages of description? It saddens me to think that this story is one of many that will end up lost as a result - so if you decide to read just one \\"classic\\" American story this year, think about choosing this one."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I got the book exactly came how the seller said it was. It was fast shipping and in great condition. Thank you so much."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"Helen Hunt Jackson's two major books, CENTURY OF DISHONOR and RAMONA were on a reading list of mine when I was a graduate student back in the Upper Paleolith. I didn't like either book, but am forced to concede their value.RAMONA reminded me of trying to eat ten gallons of ice cream. It was too sweet, too melodramatic and I was lucky to avoid death by cloying suffocation from reading it.It is, however, a great example of late 19th century romance. People didn't have e-mail, text messaging, computers, TV or radio. Instead, they read! A lot of them read RAMONA and apparently enjoyed it a lot more than many of today's readers.It is dated, but that is its true value, in my opinion. Jackson doesn't step out of her skin, or her age, when she writes. Some of the dated, annoying stereotypes which roll off her pen illustrate the perceptions of the age in which she lived. For better or worse, that's their value.If you're interested in American Literature, Intellectual History, or regional literature related to California, RAMONA may be of interest to you. I have a copy and enjoy it in small doses as befits an aging Philistine."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"I truly enjoyed this wonderfully written work by Helen Hunt Jackson. It is definitely her best!

The Mexican TV has taken the book to the TV screen. Currently, the production is being presented in a local Hispanic TV channel."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"While appreciating what Helen Hunt Jackson was trying to do with Ramona, there are some aspects of the book which truly bother me. One can't help but wonder at her glossed over, hisoricaly nostaligic view of the mission system in California. The Native Americans who were in this system were kept in virtual bondage and horribly abused, both physicaly and sexualy and were forced to give up the lifestyles that they had known. I think Ramona has good intention, but like Uncle Tom's Cabin, the book it was modeled after, suffers from a severe case of historical nostalgia. It is, however, interesting to read the book from a modern perspective in the sense that reform literature has certanly changeg over the years! A good read, just beware of the hisorical inacuracies."},{"Title":"Ramona","review":"If anyone is actually looking for a true tale of the plight of California Indians, don't bother to look at Jackson's novel.It is inherently racist, written by a woman who doesn't deserve to be mentioned in the same likes as Upton Sinclair or Harriet Beecher Stowe.On one of her visits to California, Jackson called the Native Americans she saw \\"loathsome, abject and hideous.\\" In her novel, she doesn't stray far from this inherent indignation of another race. In fact, she most likely had no idea she was being racist, another reason entirely why this book should be burned. ALternately thorughout the book, Jackson refers to the indians Ramona and ALlesandro encounter as \\"patient creatures\\" (16), \\"poor creatures\\" (20), \\"wild creatures\\" (47), \\"faithful creatures\\" (353), \\"miserable creatures\\" (324), \\"vagabond bands\\" (286) \\"like beasts\\" without the Christianizing presence of the Missions (231). are they human? possibly. are they equal to the pastoral spanish who enslaved them that Jackson venerates so much? most definitely not.Secondly, ALlesandro could be the most anglicized Indian ever. He is most assurredly an abberation, physically looked like a mexican, was the most devout catholic, lives in a house that is like any mexican villa. INdeed, Jackson remarks that \\"There were not many such Indians as Allesandro and his Father. If there had been, it would have been better for their people,\\" (327) and that he \\"almost makes one forget he is an Indian.\\" (101).also, she refuses to create an interracial love story. the whole crappy book is predicated on the fact that Ramona is half indian. only when she is indian can she fulfill Jackson's debased notion of racial determinism.Besides the myriad moral reasons why this book is so terrible, it could be the most groandiose, verbose, and pooorly written romance book EVER. the characters lack any moral ambiguity which would make for interesting characterization and are constantly marked by sweeping romantic gestures that could better be classified as trash fiction than a literary classic.You'd find more entertainment from reading the yellow pages than wasting your time. The world would be a better place if the trees from which the paper for this book came from were still planted."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"Somewhere I read that Cather will eventually top Hemingway as America's finest and most esteemed writer. This book floated Cather above Hemingway in my estimation and this was only the fourth book of hers that I have read. A wonderful, timeless story set in the early twenties (could very well be today!). A remarkable tale of how the appearance of a young man in the lives of one family can have such impact. Cather develops each character around their reaction to the man, Outland. Outland, a perfect name for a character that sweeps in, lives intensely, whose intellectual capabilities create wonder and who gives it all away.The main character, the Professor, begins by tutoring Outland, even as Outland tutors the Professor's own daughters. Outland betrothes the eldest who benefits from Outland's creations with enormous riches. The youngest daughter languishes in the shadow of her older daughter's consumerism, which the mother encourages, much to the disinterest and dissatisfaction of the Professor.The middle and last sections of this three-part book are wondrous and provide the ultimate redemption and &quot;tutoring&quot; for the Professor who is &quot;saved&quot; by the life which Outland has lived.The setting for this book moves from the attic-office of the Professor in a small college town set on Lake Michigan to the mesas of the southwest. Each setting is beautifully described, in economical and lovely language.This novel is a wonder! Perfect, and the best that I have read in a very, very long time."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"This Cather novel can best be compared to a small symphony in a minor key. It is a gentle, bittersweet portrait of a successful scholar who finds himself emotionally isolated from his family in a transitional time in the family's development. A move from their familiar, too-small home to a newer, larger home highlights tensions and jealousies between his newly married daughters and the distance between himself and his wife. The first portion of the novel focuses on the professor's disappointing relationships with his family and colleagues, relationships he observes with poignancy and sadness. A smaller but equally important portion of the novel tells the story of Tom Outland, a young man whose life and death provide a backdrop for the professor's story. Cather's prose is lean and unadorned, giving every word meaning. This lends itself particularly well to her treatment of the southwest. Her portrait of the professor as ineffectual and alienated is consistent with Cather's general treatment of males and reflects her distrust of marriage. It is nevertheless a poignant and realistic portrayal of a man confronting the disappointments of an otherwise successful life. It is a must read."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"As much as I loved reading this novel, I can't stand this edition. The publisher seems to have written the text in about three minutes flat: \\"your\\" becomes \\"you\\", \\"my\\" becomes \\"me\\" (except during Henry's dialogue - then it's supposed to happen). There are also a large amount of accented letters ( like \\"&eacute;\\") that ended up being something like \\"\\" which makes reading words as simple as \\"Op&eacute;ra\\" very difficult as it now reads \\"Opra\\". The publisher didn't even bother to put in the standard chapters that other editions have, which leaves you reading approximately 89 pages without any place to rest the eyes. PLEASE get yourself a different edition: one preferably not from this publisher. A simple publisher's mistake should not detract from such a marvelous text."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"Willa Cather's early novels of life on the American prairie, such as \\"My Antonia\\" and \\"O Pioneers\\" are well known. Her novel \\"The Professor's House\\" is much less familiar, but it is Cather at her best.The book tells the story of Professor Godfrey St. Peter. When we meet St. Peter, he is a respected academic and scholar, age 52, who has written an eight volume history called \\"Spanish Explorers\\" dealing with the Spanish in Mexico and the American Southwest. He has persevered in his writing and received awards. As a result, St. Peter and his family are able to build a new house and move away from the ramshakle rented quarters in which the Professor and his wife have lived and raised their family.The family consists of two daughters who, when we meet them, have married and gone their own ways. The younger daughter is married to a struggling news reporter who has impressed his bosses by his ability to turn out hack prose-poems for the paper on a daily basis.The older daughter was at one time engaged to a man named Tom Outland who is, perhaps the real hero of the book. Outland invented an important scientific device and willed it to her upon his death in WW I. She then marries an engineer and entrepreneur who develops and markets Outland's invention. The couple build a large home and name in \\"Outland\\".The book tells a story of change, frustration and acceptance. The Professor is unhappy with the new home and refuses to leave his old study. His relationship with his wife and daughters has cooled. He is unhappy with the modernization of the university and of academic learning with its emphasis on technology and business rather than study and reflection. Most importantly, he is dissatisfied with his honors, his leisure, and his comforts. He thinks of his youth of promise and study, of his life of solitude, and yearns for adventure and meaning.The first part of the book tells the story of the Professor and his family. The second, shorter, part is a flash-back and tells the story of Tom Outland who Professor St. Peter befriended many years before and who grew up in mysterious circumstances in New Mexico. We learn in the second part of the book of Outland's life on the railroad and on the range. We see his somewhat ambiguous friendship with an older man and their discovery of an ancient Indian village on the mesas. There is a wonderfully drawn picture of Washington D.C. as Tom tries, without success, to interest officials in his discovery.In the third part of the book, the Professor reflects on Tom and on his own life. It seems to me that Tom's life mirrors the theme of the Professor's lenghty studies in \\"Spanish Explorers\\" It is the kind of life in its rawness, closeness to nature, and independence that the Professor thinks he would have liked to lead rather than settling for a middle-class life of conformity, comfort, and boredom. We see how the Professor tries to struggle on.There is a frustration built into life when we learn we are not the persons we dreamed of becoming. This is a poignant, beautifully-written story of American life and of how and why people fall short of themselves.Robin Friedman"},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"Objectively speaking, this book as a whole is perhaps not quite as excellent as some of her other books like DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP, but this nonetheless is one of my three favorites of her novels. The book consists of three parts, not all of them of equal strength (the only real criticism of the book in the end is that the sections are not sufficiently integrated with one another and that they do not quite balance one another), but a couple of them containing some of her most powerful writing. A very, very good book. Anyone who enjoyed DEATH COMES FOR THE ARCHBISHOP would in particular like it."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"The Professor's House is a novel that I read and re-read, in the same way that one turns again and again to a good friend, for solace. Middle age is a time of change and this novel's main character is going through the Change of Life (as surely as if he were a woman...)After reading this novel about 4 years ago, I went on to devour almost every other published work by this author. If you are Canadian, like me, I urge you to read Shadows on the Rock. This is a Cather novel set in 18th century Quebec City. A real gem.But back to The Professor's House: Cather draws us in with the singularity of her main character. The professor is set apart from his wife and one of his daughters, disconnected from them by a lifetime of having to listen to and observe their pettiness. Connected to Tom Outland and to his youngest daughter, the professor flourishes. Aren't we all like this? There are kindred spirits and there are those who are not kindred spirits.Because I love the landscape of New Mexico, I was thrilled with the descriptions of the ruins. Cather's love of this part of the world is reflected in much of her work. She is able to capture the emptiness and beauty of this stark landscape in her writing.I have found some of Cather's work to be a bit ponderous. The Professor's House is one of her best novels. It has stood the test of time, which is what makes it literature. I'm also thrilled that a woman writer can be so successful at creating male characters. This is an art that many writers do not have."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"Lately, I've turned away from fiction, because I haven't been able to find works that keep me turning those pages. When I stumbled across The Professor's House, I was delighted to find myself swept away and completely absorbed by Willa Cather's tender and disturbing tale of an ordinary man's confrontation with his feelings about place, family, and ageing. The professor's realization that he might have to forfeit the passion and vivacity he experienced in his youth and compromise with a &quot;life without joy&quot; was very poignant and provoking. Cather's prose is intelligent, but fluid and concise. I think it will go on my list of a dozen or more most memorable novels."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"This review is about the edition, not the book.I made the mistake of ordering this edition for my class, thinking to save them money. Now I have no idea how I'm going to keep them on the same page (and I mean that quite literally). The Wilder edition is full of misprints and errors. An entire chapter is repeated twice! The editing is so incompetent that it makes the book painful to read.The novel itself is wonderful, but please give your money to a more responsible publisher."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"When I was younger I thought \\"My Antonia\\" was Cather's best novel. But the editions you find in bookstores now have gone back to the original, more bloated, and definitely inferior introduction to that book--Cather, had she been alive, would never have stood for it--and, maybe more importantly, I've gotten older. Older, I say, but by no means old, maybe just old enough that, like the professor of Cather's novel, I spend more time looking back--at nothing, to be sure, nothing--than I do looking ahead. Maybe that's why I now think \\"The Professor's House\\" is Cather at her finest.And since nobody else seems to have done so, I'd just like to mention that \\"The Professor's House\\" is also very witty, at times downright comic."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"I read this book in four or so hours straight.

She's really romantic but manages to completely avert any cheesey-ness. I remember looking up after reading the last page of the novel; I felt totally displaced from my life. For that moment I was still utterly invested in the life of the family in _The Professor's House_. Read this one if you love Willa Cather, or if you've never read her before."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"I am an undying Willa Cather fan. Her collection of stories was the first e-book that I bought on my Kindle (at least this electronic version will not lose it's cover or binding like my other Cather books that I may have loved a bit too hard). Of course, every writer has their slips and that's what I think The Professor's House is. Even though it is listed in the 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die, I don't think it even holds a candle to O! Pioneers or My Antonia. Still, it has some redeeming qualities that a Cather enthusiast will surely enjoy.The short novel is divided into three sections the first of which focuses on the professor's family. It is clear that the professor feels at odds with most of his family for while he values education and knowledge, his wife and one of his daughters are materialistic. When they plan to move into a newly built house, the family does not understand the professor's reluctance to leave their old house behind. The second section focuses on the professor's former student, Tom Outland. In fact, the whole section is written by Outland and describes his life and connection to the ancient civilizations in America's southwest. The final section gives greater insight into the professor and his admiration for his late student, Outland.As one can see, this novel is character driven as opposed to plot driven. However, the characters are not that interesting and seem a bit convoluted. Therefore, the story becomes bogged down. Cather clearly wants to send a message about the dangers of materialism. However, these characters do not seem to be the best vehicle for this message. Additionally, the fragmented storyline is a bit confusing which distracts from Cather's theme.Overall, this is not one of Cather's finest but Cather fans will certain see its redeeming qualities and perhaps a different side of Cather herself."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"I've read a number of Willa Cather's books, but this novel had escaped me until now. Particularly for being one of her earliest works, written when she was quite young, the novel shows a mastery of the craft and an unusual maturity.Cather starts out slowly, building scene and character, with her signature sparse and interesting descriptions and phrases--always thought-provoking. The Professor is a particularly sympathetic character, wise and kindly. But the end of the book puts this work into a special category. The writing transforms, mirroring the transformation which occurs within the Professor at that point in his life. He rereads the diary of Tom Outland, an exceptional former student and colleague (the choice of name had to be deliberate.) In Outland's diary of his days in the Southwest, the book attains truly poetic prose and is very moving. This is followed by a remarkably deep understanding on the part of Cather of a usually later-life (if attained at all) state which the Professor undergoes. I've reread this last section several times.Needless to say, I highly recommend this book. As to this edition, there are a few typos. Those shouldn't be too distracting, at the price."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"This is a great book with lots of hidden meaning. I am sure I didn't get them all, may read again."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"This was a textbook for a college class. It came quickly and in good shape"},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"I've been reading some of the Cather books and have enjoyed all of them. The best part of this book is her story within a story technique. Her descriptions of the American southwest are outstanding. This book held my attention, especially as it progressed. It is not as good as \\"My Antonia\\", which to me is her all time best, but it is an excellent reading experience."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"I have to admit that when I was assigned this book for an Amer. Lit. class I was anything but excited at the prospect. A further contribution to my misguided dread was born from the rather poor synopsis of the book on the back cover which fails miserably in &quot;selling&quot; the great story hidden within its pages. Yet another example of why one shouldn't judge a book by its cover. It is far more than just another story of inward rebellion and emotional &quot;renewal&quot;; it is instead, a story about the American dream, the family, higher education, friendship, nature, and the elusiveness of American history. The way that Cather blends this varied subject matter is a testament to her great talent as a writer, but more impressively, this book bears witness to her keen insight into the deepest recesses of the American psyche. The story centers around an aging professor(St. Peter) , and his close and yet mysterious friend Tom Outland. Complicating this is the professor's strained relationship with his own family,(his two daughter's and their husbands and his wife). Cather's nonlinear narrative of their interactions and the various relationships that result works to pull the reader ever deeper into a work that soon spirals out of the professor's small study into a world of arid mesas, mysterious strangers, ancient skeletons and forgotten yesterdays. In the end, this story could be seen as an exposition on the American dream, one that probes deep below the surfaces of what that dream entails, and what is lost to acheive it."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"If you are interested in Willa Cather read &quot;My Antonia&quot; first and then read everything else, including &quot;The Professor's House&quot;. Cather is one of the best writers of the century and don't skip over her, just start somewhere besides this book."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"This is the first book by Cather that I have read and I'm glad that I did. It is so beautifully written that one could feel as though they have been gently placed within the walls of the professor's house. Cather included so many characters, at times it was hard to keep up with the names and personalities. However, to take away any one of the characters would have taken away from this great read."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"Professor Godfrey St. Peter is a success in his academic field and doesn't want to move out of the house he lives in to a bigger, more upscale one his wife wants to live in. Eventually, she moves, he stays put. He is a very depressed man, partly because of the untimely death of Tom Overland, his favorite student. He even contemplates suicide, but is saved by his daughter. This is a sad, pessimistic book, but compelling and very well written--one of Cather's best."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"Cather writes another insightful and incisive piece of literature with this book. She focuses on several themes in the book quite specifically, and with good effect.The prevailing themes are the basic anti-semetism of the time (copyright 1925, which Cather finds inappropriate; the manner in which people \\"Masquerade\\" as something that is very different from who they are; the meaning of human life; and why that meaning is so elusive.With the unavoidable use of the name GODfrey St. Peter as her protaganist, the relationship to spiritual and heavenly things is immediately illustrated. Many of her sentences therefore start as such; \\"St. Peter thought ...\\" This device allows her to immediately integrate religious consideration at any point within the narrative.While some of the descriptive information is a bit long winded, it also must be taken into consideraton that this was 1925, and most people had never seen the types of things she is describing in her book, from a geographic and geological perspective.The story is recommended for all people who like tales of the plains and the West. In addition, it is recommended for all readers who wish to see how an author can create the thoughts and use them effectively of her characters in her story."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"I had a hard time deciding how to review The Professor's House. The plot itself is very straightforward and easy to describe. The characters are vivid and well-defined which adds to the realism of the novel. But it seems to me that the meat of this novel is in the themes and nuances.I have read some of Cather's short stories many years ago and only have vague memories of them other than a memory that she had exquisite attention to detail. As I read this book I found that memory to be true. The writing vibrantly presents minute details to the reader...from the shape and texture of a hand to the nature of a dress or necklace to the depiction of setting both in and out of doors.Her characters are likewise detailed. We are held at a close third person so we don't actually get into the characters' heads, but the detailed account of appearance and action allows the reader to feel very intimate with the characters.The layout of the book is interesting in that it consists of three \\"books.\\" The first book is entitled \\"The Family\\" and follows the Professor as he works to finish his own writing while teaching and balancing the various dramas unfolding in his life and the lives of his family members. The second book is \\"Tom Outland's Story\\" and is the first person narrative of Tom, an old student of the Professor and friend of the family who is now dead (from WWI) but left behind an invention and legacy that resulted in great wealth for one of the Professor's daughters. The final book is entitled \\"The Professor\\" and is a very short wrap up of the novel which focusses on thoughts, emotions and actions of the professor after he reads and ponders Outland's story.The overarching plot of the book is interesting if not terribly engaging. There were moments of drama and emotion that drew me in, but there were other segments that were almost boring with the mundane interactions.As I mentioned initially, the meat of the novel though isn't the plot itself, but the themes and emotions it instills.Looking to these themes, part of this book seems to be an exploration of emotional displacement and emotional paralysis or release. The Professor is very attached to his old house and his work and doesn't want to move into the new house with his family. Outland is almost a portrayal of a return to the past for the professor and in the end, Outland's story provides an almost existential release to the professor. The claustrophobia of the old house and the room in which the professor works serve as a metaphorical trap that is holding the professor hostage in his current/past life/behavior and causing emotional turmoil and angst from which he can't see a clear escape.At a higher, more sociological level, the novel portrays some interesting counterpoints on society. The Professor is doing well enough off teaching at the university and does even better once he receives an award for his writing. His two daughters are well enough off as well though one is moving into the \\"upper class\\" while the other is sitting fairly \\"middle.\\" The family interactions and conversations give interesting insight into the class reactions of the era and some of the internal and external results of class mobility. As the professor's daughter and son-in-law gain their wealth and rise to a higher social status, there are jealousies and even some resentment and anger both within and outside of the family.Looking at the writing, it is clear that there are MANY levels at work in this novel. Cather's frequent use of color helps categorize different themes or values. Her descriptions of the houses, rooms and other settings set the balance between the different classes or social situations. To further illustrate that NOTHING appears to be arbitrary in this book, it was pointed out to me that there is particular significance in the name of the ship that Outland takes to the war, the name of the ship that the Professor's family returns home on, and even the book that Outland uses to study latin.So, even though the book's plot isn't terribly engaging, I can see this work as having a lot of valuable insight into the social and mental ideas of the 1920s, many of which have relevance today especially given the almost parallel economic situation around us.While it's not likely something I'd read over and over, it is something I can recommend to those interested in human behavior, the 1920s, or life in general. Cather paints a vivid and beautiful picture of a family...not a perfectly adjusted and blissfully happy family, but a realistic, flawed and interesting family."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"I came to the works of Willa Cather by way of my father, who was a deep admirer of her books, especially after he read The Song of the Lark. I knew that Cather wrote about the immigrant experience, but after having finished The Professor's House, I realized that her talent in capturing the nuances of the human experience was not solely limited to the immigrant life. It was just one slice of the pie that she happened to address. There is so much more to her books than I had judged, and admittedly, The Professor's House set me straight.In life there are pitch-perfect moments, and when they arise, they are sometimes just so good you don't ever want to let them go. They are that euphoric bubble of bliss where everything is just right, not blemished nor off kilter. And those moments are few and far between. Yet, when they happen, we thirst for them. However, what happens when that bubble bursts? For many, the typical pattern is to become isolated and cope the best way possible. We try to accept and conform to what has been dealt even though we may not like it. Others flat-out rebel until their heads are through the wall, unyielding and defiant to the bitter end.Now meet Godfrey St. Peter, husband, father, academic and writer; for the most part, he is an affable and compromising fellow. But in some regards he is not. He has his loyalty to his old study, what for him is his security blanket. It represents his life and how he came to be who he was. His study is simple and not overly adorned, but the things in there represent the tangible moments of his life and successes. And that is a comforting sense of fulfillment that he has rightfully earned. As the novel progresses, Professor St. Peter is forced to face an unpleasant onslaught of challenges in which he is looped into. His way of life is gradually being yanked away from him by the enemies of materialism, loneliness, new vs. old generation values, to simply being an old man. What is particularly moving is that all these battles are coming from within the family context. They are moving forward, but in so doing, they are leaving the past absolutely behind, not giving it an iota of concern or appreciation. When collected, it is all so dense and overwhelming St. Peter just wants an out, even if it goes contradictory to what his name represents: \\"Rock\\". He's tired of reflecting upon his family woes, the memory of Tom Outland (who gets the story off the ground), of missed opportunities... They all pile atop each other and thus causes St. Peter to be apathetic towards his own life: \\"When St. Peter at last awoke, the room was pitch-black and full of gas. He was cold and numb, felt sick and rather dazed. The long anticipated coincidence had happened, he realized. The storm had blown the stove out and the window shut. The thing to do was to get up and open the window. But suppose he did not get up--? How far was a man required to exert himself against accident? How would such a case be decided under English law? He hadn't lifted his hand against himself--was he required to lift it for himself?\\" Pages 251-252.Ultimately, perseverance does prevail, but there is a lot of residual that needs to be sorted out. Whether young or old, all people have conflicts that bombard and oppress them. Professor Godfrey St. Peter is a survivor. Even though (to me) he is a very heroic figure, I personally don't think he wants to be one. But he copes: \\"...he could face with fortitudd...the future.\\" Page 258. Overall, The Professor's House was a great read with many worthwhile lessons to be gleaned."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"This is one of the most extraordinary novels I have ever read.

The story line is excellant..completely different from Willa Cather's other works. An excellant book."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"I am a huge Willa Cather fan and have been reading her novels in the order she wrote them. I started \\"The Professor's House\\" in eager anticipation, because I just LOVED \\"A Lost Lady,\\" the book that preceded it.\\"The Professor's House\\" has many, many good elements, but ultimately I was disappointed. The last part of the book was unworthy of what had gone before. In the end, I felt as though I'd invested a lot in the Professor and that that investment had not paid off. I'm glad I read it, but think it's nowhere close to one of Cather's best.I thought the first two section of the book were excellent. I believed almost everything about the Professor's life and his relationships. My only criticism of the beginning portion of the novel was Cather's superficial and, yes, bigoted attitude toward the Jewish son-in-law, Louie Marsellus. I didn't have a problem accepting Louie as a real person. But Cather could only see him and comment on him as \\"the other.\\" One of Cather's great strengths is her understanding of how the world looks to the different characters in her novels. She may not agree with who they are and how they act, but she is usually deeply empathetic. Not so with Louie. The fact that he is a Jew is somehow taken as an explanation for everything. Even in 1925, I expect better of a writer of Cather's insight and talent. Interestingly, Louie is ultimately one of the most sympathetic and generous characters in the novel. But Cather writes as though she'd never had a close Jewish friend, or never applied her prodigious imagination to contemplate Louie's psychology and point of view.Still, even with the problem with Louie, I thought the first book was very good. It was filled with the wonderful writing and the psychological, sociological and philosophical depth that I so admire in Cather.I also enjoyed the second book, Tom Outland's story. I agree with an earlier reviewer that the section set in Washington, D.C. was particularly good. I was raised in Washington, and my mother's family has lived there since the 1840's. Cather just NAILED the town.But it all came to a crashing halt in the final section, when we return to the Professor's story. Did Cather lose interest? Did she not know where to go with the Professor? This section was too short and undeveloped. The first two parts of the book deserved a more thorough and satisfying conclusion. I particularly objected to the section about how the Professor had gotten back in touch with the unthinking boy he'd been back in Kansas. Hogwash. Not credible. This guy's an intellectual. He might come to see the limits of what many academics pretentiously call \\"the life of the mind.\\" But jettison it entirely for some romantic, unreal Tom Sawyer fantasy? I don't think so.My advice: do read \\"The Professor's House,\\" but don't make it your first Cather book."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"This was the first Willa Cather book I've read, and only because I got it at a yard sale for 50 cents. She has written it with an economy of words, but no less vivid than more grandious writers. The imagery of the main setting (near Chicago) is bleak, and offset wonderfully by the tales by Outland of the desert southwest. His world is like sunshine on the soul.The key to the entire book is Outland, the professor's favorite student. From first hearing of him, the reader wants to know more. Which I'm sure was the intended effect Cather had in mind. He is described perfectly - mysterious yet incredibly open and sincere. Its very clever, because people in this life who touch you deeply are like him. The main character, the professor, and the elusive Outland, plus the addition of the wife, housekeeper/seamstress and two daughters are all wonderful.

I regret getting this edition."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"The Professor's House is a very good novel but not one of the five novels by Cather that I would rate 5 stars. The novel is a critical look at higher education in one way. The college in America was once a fountain of basic knowledge in the humanities arts and basic sciences. The college education at the undergraduate level was not about job training but developing intellect. The liberal arts and basic sciences were at the center of a college or university.Cather critiques the change into a job training center and the change in attitude from being motivated by a search for knowledge to being motivated by money. Even the professors are affected and it shows most clearly when the title character talks to a close faculty friend whose anger at ebeing denied money from a discovery of one of his students stuns the professor becausehe thought his friend was a physicist to learn the secrets of the universe not make money fro mpractical applications of discoveries.The whole novel is a critique of the American emphasis on money and possessions. The professor rejects his nicer and brand new house because it has no soul .The main reason he consented to buy it was his wifes desire to be upscale and the financial success of his books enable that but the professor didd research out of love of knowledge which is why he so loved and admired the other main character Tom Outland who after he dies has his research as a student turned into something practical and wealth creating by oo professors son in law or one of them . He and his wife represent greed while the other daughter and son inlaw represent osmething more noble but they too are affected by a love of money they just dont have much. Only Outland the Professor ST.Peter put love of knowledge for money. The book is quite good but the middle section on Tom Outland in New Mexico so I RATE IT 4 STARS"},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"Cather's A PROFESSOR'S HOUSE is very different from the spirit-of-the-prairie book she's often so immediately associated with. Like O PIONEERS! and MY ANTONIA, however, this novel exhibits cather's great fascination with the American landscape, and with he posiibility of dreams left both fulfilled and unfulfilled. The experiences of Tom Outland in the Cliff City have made this book a recent favorite with Americanist scholars, but no less compelling is her portrait of a suddenly wealthy Midwestern academic family in the Twenties whose recent good fortune has begun to tear them apart despite their general good will and kind tempers."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"I needed this for a class and thought I'd save myself a few bucks by getting this edition; I was pleasantly surprised by how cheap it was, but you get what you pay for.

This leads me to fear that some parts may have actually been left out! Not sure what the deal is, or why this is so carelessly printed. I imagine that the copyright expired and the publishers payed some undergraduate to transcribe an older version into a Microsoft Word document which they printed in cheap paperback without going over it beforehand.

Caveat emptor!"},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"I wanted to read something I hadn't read before and didn't already know as a fan of Willa Cather's writing. Call it the intellectual stretch. The Professor's House (1925) is a short book with only three chapters. Now that I read the book I recognize it as three pieces written separate and apart from one another.The second chapter, \\"Tom Outland's Story,\\" stood alone for many years as an unfinished work. Today it would stand alone as a captivating short story about the Southwest during the frontier days. Thirty six pages long, this voice is Willa Cather at her storytelling best. It's the story of two young men and their archeological discovery on a mesa. A man's story: friendship, adventure, betrayal and loss. It's a masterpiece of description for a time and a place; the reader is dropped into the middle of the frontier prairie landscape and its human scenery.The first and third chapters are wraparounds. Seventy pages of narration about the professor and his family and circumstances related to Tom Outland's premature death build up to the revelation in Chapter Two. The third chapter is only thirteen pages long and yet it's where all the plot lines pull together.The narrative premise pulling these three pieces, written at different times, is that a professor doesn't like the direction his life has taken. Due to circumstances, Professor Godfrey St. Peter has come into more comfortable circumstances as a result of his daughter's inheritance from Tom Outland, her fianc&eacute;e, and his own writing and publishing success as a scholar. His wife, Lillian, also receives a small inheritance check every month from her family and has sustained all appearances of class for his insignificant income as a college professor.The professor and his wife Lillian have two daughters; and now two son-in-laws. His own position with regards to his own family as he faces his 50s is at stake. His wife moves into their new house, but he decides to keep his old study in the rackety-trap attic in the old house. He's stuck. He's stuck because of what transpired with Tom Outland. There is mention of a patent and his invention as a student there in the college; the professor and his family had taken Tom in as an unschooled youth and he proved a scientific genius. The exact financials are kept rather discretely; implications are that it makes the professor quite uncomfortable.The professor won't accompany his family on their trip to Europe for the summer. He spends it in the old house in his study doing as he pleases for the first time since his youth. Seeing Lillian fall in fondness with their sons-in-law, he recognizes he has long ago fallen out of love with his wife.He finds in the seamstress a confidante over all the years they shared the attic for their \\"work.\\" She is never sexualized, but throughout the first and third chapters she is the female heroine to the professor. Augusta is St. Peter's rock.In the third and final chapter, the Professor finally falls prey to the dangers of his woodstove and the weather in his attic. He collapsed into a sleeping stupor in the midst of a rain storm after spending the afternoon and evening contemplating the meaningless of his family relations and career; carbon monoxide filled the room. He welcomed the easy escape, before Augusta rescues him just in time for his family to arrive home from Europe.Perhaps this felt like a cob job because I bought a crappy paperback edition. The corrupted fonts resulted in a variety of typos and pages 68-72 were duplicated passages. Something tipped me off that the narrative flow was more than a little contrived. It isn't Cather's best novel. Novella is even a stretch. Triptych maybe.I take some solace in seeing one of my heroines trying to make a living wage from her work. Like many writers, pieces and fragments of our best work lie outside that which is easily marketable. This shows she tried to take one of her gems and work it into a fine piece of jewelry; didn't quite work, but the gem is apart from its setting. And you see how the stone is distinct from the steel. As a reader and a writer I liked looking at more of her writing and career as I see how hard it remains to make a living at this craft of writing."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"While Cather's novel does live up to the reviews posted here, I must complain about this edition. Not only are there frequent OCR problems--Santa F', for example, instead of Santa F&eacute;--but there's one six page section which is simply printed twice. I hope that it's just my copy that's bad, as Cather is an important enough author that her work deserves to be printed in good editions!"},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"Those expecting something as vivid and moving as \\"My Antonia\\" will be sorely disappointed by this book. Ms. Cather was at her worst when she wrote in imitation of earlier lady novelists such as Edith Wharton or Henry James, and the entire first half of this novel concerns the intrigues of a Midwest Brahmin family. During this part there is absolutely no plot, just tedious description and some of the most stilted dialogue ever written. The cardboard characters include the good-natured protagonist, Professor St. James, and his two daughters, one sweet (Cordelia?) and one rapacious (Goneril?). The bad daughter is lolling in luxury due to the avaricious machinations of her husband, who, naturally, is a Jew - a stereotypical Jew, the worst kind.If that weren't bad enough, when a plot is finally introduced it concerns a preposterous device (or substance) called \\"the Outland vacuum\\" which is said to concern bulkheads and be a boon to aviation. It seems as though the novel will now hinge on the moral issue of who is entitled to the rewards for this great discovery (the Outland vacuum may also be a gas), but I suspect that at this point Ms. Cather realized that she had gone in over her head, and the novel comes to a sudden halt. The next page begins a second novel, about as bad as the first but which takes place among cowboys out West who discover a lost Indian city.Alas, this likewise amounts to little, and we eventually return to the warmhearted professor who comes to the good-ol' American conclusion that being rich and famous is not all it's cracked up to be, and real happiness is found among the plain folk.Y'know, people, just because something is old and ostensibly literature doesn't mean it's really great. My only worry is that schoolkids will be forced to read this - under the theory that classic fiction is \\"good\\" for them - and they will thus be alienated from reading books because they're so dull."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"I read My Antonia and loved it so much that I consider it one of my favorite books. And, that's why I really really really wanted to like this book.

The problem is that the Tom Outland character does not get you there and most of the text of the book is on this character.2) Which brings me to my biggest gripe about this book, and Cather in particular. Cather cannot, to save her life, write a believable male character. Tom Outland is supposed to be an orphaned boy turned cowboy around the turn of the century, but Cather managed to make him out to be so unbelievably feminine that I found myself in wonder at how little she knows about men. She holds Outland out to be the hero of the story, the inspiration behind the Professor's motivation. That's fine, but if I'm supposed to conclude the Professor part of the story, then I have to buy Outland's character and it's just not possible. Here are some examples of Cather not being believable:a) When she describes Tom Outland's hands through the professor's eyes, she describes them as beautiful and delicate. Worse still, she bothers to describe them in detail. Men don't do that.b) Around page 218 when she begins Outland's tirade against Blake she makes Outland sound off like a nagging wife about how Blake shouldn't have sold the pottery etc. Men don't argue this way with friends; they don't have hissy fits - they stay quiet!c) After the argument in (b) above, as Blake leaves the scene, she describes Outland wishing to run after him and hold him in his arms. Men just don't think like that.d) When Outland is in Washington D.C. trying to get people to take interest in the pottery he discovered, he lets himself get ignored, disrespected, and he waits by tolerantly while being stepped on by people in positions of power. That's not a description of a turn of the century orphaned cowboy; that's a description of a turn of the century well-to-do woman of society - the only world Cather appears to know.e) Whenever Tom Outland meets other men in his life as a cowboy, they are always really \\"nice and pleasant\\". Indeed they are overly accommodating. Huh? I could see cowboys being really respectful and accommodating to a beautiful woman of society (like Cather) but an orphaned cowboy? She just puts too much of herself in this character. I couldn't buy it.3) Now before reviewers think my gripes are based on some sort of homophobia, let me just say that if it had been a story about men in love with each other, I would have accepted that as at least being believable. But that's not Cather's intention. Outland ends up marrying the professor's daughter. Is Cather trying to send out a bisexual message of some kind? Was the professor gay? The text just does not support any kind of homosexual message either explicitly or implicitly.4) Cather plays out Outland to be this super human being. Indeed he is the inspiration to the Professor and all the other characters in the book. But if that's the case, why is he on the wrong side of the moral debate on the Dreyfus affair? Cather wrote this book in 1925; twenty five years after all the facts had already come out on that case and yet Cather has Outland take the side of bigots?5) In Outland's tirade against Blake, Outland chews him out for selling ancient pottery belonging to native Indian tribes. Earlier in the book it's concluded that the tribe was decimated by outsiders. In chastising Blake, Outland declares that Blake was wrong to sell the pottery because it was not his. He says that the pottery belongs to his country, to the State etc. That's the best our hero can do? Wouldn't the right thing to do be to leave the ruins to themselves and not dig up the belongings of the decimated people - i.e. let them rest in peace?Anyway, I was sorely disappointed. I gave The Professor's House one star more than it deserves only because My Antonia deserves six."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"Cather can be difficult: read slowly and savor! You won't be disappointed."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"Willa Cather is one of the top five American writers. She gets little notice, it seems, today. I find that very strange, given the feminist movement in America. I've read three of her other books and this is the oddest, and most wonderful, or perhaps I forget how O Pioneers, Death Comes for the Archbishop and My Antonia affected me so greatly.Nothing seems to happens in her books and yet they blow me away and I remember them always. I do not exaggerate that they haunt me. I know that sounds dramatic, but that is what a good book does.I struggled with this book. I'd read twenty pages, put it down for weeks, come back and read twenty more pages and then, finally I said I was going to finish it. As I was starting to read the last sixty pages -- it is a short book -- I was thinking to myself: 'I'm sorry I ever started to read this.' I was merely finishing it as a sense of duty. But then, the last thirty-five pages had me by my heart and it 'explained' all that I had plodded through previously.I don't know if I can recommend this book. I'd fear that it would bore to tears any friend who would read it. But for me, it's effect is monumental --- and it has been a while that I can say that about most books I've read. I suspect that this book does not move younger readers as it does older readers, as it is a summing up of a man's life and how he has lived it. I'm not sure that a person who has not put many years into living would understand Miss Cather's brilliance in how she does this through --ironically--a quite ordinary professor's life."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"Our book group, consisting of women in their 30s and 40s, enjoyed getting reacquainted with Cather through this evocative novel.

First of all I never was aware that Rosamunds husband was a jew, I thought he was french. I thought he was most generous, but not the least upset by using the money earned by his wifes ex fiancee. I did not see a stress on money, more of a class distinction created by the professors wife, and the elder daughter, who was also not upset about spending her former fiancees money.The professor became quite introspective once his family left him alone, which is what he wanted in the first place. He seemed to have felt deeply about Tom Outland, and enjoyed his company and his intellect. There could have been more stress on the fact that Tom was sorry about the way he treated Roddy, and I wished he could have found the well intentioned man and apologized to him and used the money toward his education. The professor did not seem to have a strong influence on his wife and daughter, and they were equally disinterested in him and his private thoughts. He did feel lucky he had married as well as he had, and didn't really feel life had disapointed him, although I think if he had given his life a little more thought, he would have ended up in a different place. descriptions were good. I liked My Antonia better."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"Willa Cather is a fine author. This edition is not. Duplicated pages, symbols and signs for letters make for clunky reading. I would recommend the story but get a different edition for smoother reading."},{"Title":"The Professor's House","review":"Willa Cather (1873-1947) has been familiar to me my entire adult life as a very good American author, but I never read any of her works until now. I think that one of the English classes in my high school was reading \\"My Antonia,\\" while my class was being introduced to \\"Tale of Two Cities.\\" So, reading her novel \\"The Professor's House\\" was a new experience for me, and I'm sorry it took me so many years before I discovered this truly wonderful writer.Cather writes about the America she knows, the Midwest. The protagonist in \\"The Professor's House,\\" which is set in 1920 in the Midwest, is a totally admirable American who is a model of virtue and traditional American values. But, as he reaches age 52, he experiences a very modern mid-life crisis and questions the value of his life, finding a lack of meaning in what he has become. In modern psycho-babble, we would say he's depressed. Although the plot has several interesting subplots, how the professor resolves his existential angst is the central theme of the book. Cather's prose is straight forward and, in its simplicity, elegant. The middle third of the book involves the exploration and exploitation of Indian ruins in New Mexico, and it describes areas with which I'm familiar and love. This aspect of the book was a very pleasant surprise.\\"The Professor's House\\" is an easy book to read, is very enjoyable and meaningful, and demonstrates that good literature can illuminate and explain life. It is a rare combination of being a good story, and, providing the reader with a lot to ponder, if the reader chooses to go down that path with Willa Cather as the guide.

There is a progressive development of thought through the dozen lectures comprising this book, as they all aim at expressing the same fundamental idea: although the laws of the universe can never be broken, they can be made to work under special conditions which will produce results that could not be produced under the conditions spontaneously provided by nature. This is a simple scientific principle and it shows us the place which is occupied by the personal factor - that of an intelligence which sees beyond the present limited manifestation of the Law into its real essence and which therefore constitutes the means by which the infinite possibilities of the Law can be evoked into forms of power, usefulness and beauty. Thomas Troward had a special gift for explaining the way things are and how they can be - he writes with clarity and great insight and leaves the reader wiser and considerably more positive and joyous about life. Chapters are: Entering Into The Spirit Of It, Individuality, The New Thought and the New Order, The Life of the Spirit, Alpha and Omega, The Creative Power Of Thought, The Great Affirmative, Christ The Fulfilling of the Law, The Story of Eden, The Worship of Isi, The Shepherd and the Stone, Salvation is of The Jews.

Murphy is in my opinion primarily concerned with the practical aspects of New Thought while Troward deals with the philosophical foundation. The working of Positive Thinking or New Thougth can rationally be understood if the underlying principles are recognized. Troward explains in his books these spiritual laws und develops his thinking logically.His considerations are often highly abstract, but always easily to comprehend.I read also &quot;The Edinburgh Lectures&quot;, &quot;The Creative Process&quot; and &quot;Bible Mystery and Bible Meaning&quot;.

What a concept! This book reminds me of a church 2000 years ago that operated without walls. This is not to imply that a church should not own or rent a building (there are other books that do say this), but that church ministry must not take place ONLY within the walls of your facilities. In this awesome story about Randy White, he shares his victories (awesome!) and his failures. He even candidly discusses his marriage failure, in which he never passes the blame on anyone else exept himself. (That greatly impressed me.) I have given this book to several of our key leaders in our church and every one of them has been greatly impacted. The challenge has been accepted...the challenge to step outside our 4 walls and enter into the world...the world of hurting people...and touch their lives. We touch them in practical ways. We touch them in relevant ways. We touch them in spiritual ways. Being a church without walls is a messy mission. It's not neat and tidy like we'd all like. We must count the cost.

As they begin to do some investigating, they realize that this case is going to be a lot tougher then they thought--and that this is definitely going to be the most dangerous adventure of their lives.TERROR IN OAK GROVE HIGH is one of the least thrilling thrillers I have ever read. The novel is made out to seem like it's actually interesting. But the beginning, middle, and end are completely disappointing. First of all, the characters are very uninteresting and unrealistic. It seems like Samantha is a perfect girl with a perfect family. The only problem they've ever encountered is a missing principal. Yuck.Second of all, Samantha and Taylor act nothing like normal teenagers. It seems like they have nothing better to do than go around investigating. Don't they have homework they need to finish? Third, this whole book seems to be way too old-fashioned. It seems like they've never heard of computers. I know it was made in 1991, but computers were out then. And lastly, the ending is way too predictable. It didn't even seem like it was supposed to be a surprise. Please don't waste your time with this novel.

Brook has keen insights into human nature and motivation, with zesty comments about ego, hierarchies, awareness of one's surroundings, and focusing on the material at hand. I profited from his comments about working with what is available, in terms of budget, personnel, setting, and so on. Anyone who needs to work with a team with limited resources, whether in business, academia, government, or even the church, will find here a comrade and a masterful intellect. Brook was clearly &quot;present&quot; to his audience during these conversations. One can understand that the same presence is the key to his remarkable accomplishments in directing."},{"Title":"Between Two Silences: Talking with Peter Brook","review":"Dale Moffitt has brilliantly interlaced his own annecdotes and charm to this fine portrait of the legendary theatre director, Peter Brook.There are no empty spaces in THIS book!

Rarely has this gifted giant of the theatre been revealed so succinctly as in this book. Edited from hours of master classes with students and teachers during a week in residency at SMU's Meadows School of the Arts, Moffitt's legendary ability as a theatre professor allows him to take Brook's ruminations and compose a compelling conversation that extends far beyond the stage."},{"Title":"Between Two Silences: Talking with Peter Brook","review":"Dale Moffitt breathes clarity into Brook's words and often circular ideas that may have been missed otherwise. As a member of the theatre community, I feel blessed that someone was able to illustrate Mr. Brook's forum to the Dallas area. We are lucky to have such a thoughtful insight into the week-long visit of Brook's."},{"Title":"Between Two Silences: Talking with Peter Brook","review":"I am a great admirer of Dale Moffitt's devotion to the art of acting. He has constructed a book that is an imperative read for those interested in the craft of acting.

There were too many inconceivable coincidences. And how long does it take for 2 people to realize they love each other! Surely their actions could speak louder than words even if they couldn't say them. I mean my gosh how many times did they have to save each other.

It's not the type of book I would read over and over again though."},{"Title":"Discourse (Language Teaching: A Scheme for Teacher Education)","review":"Guy Cook's \\"Discourse\\" is a very practical book that not only deals with discourse theory, but also applies some of it to the classroom with some activities that teachers can use in very practical ways.The book is divided into three broad sections. Section one deals with discourse in a very \\"bottom-up\\" way, working with structural elements such as cohesion, principles in conversation analysis, (including the Co-operative and Politeness principles), schemata, information structures and much more.The second section deals with discourse from the other direction: \\"top-down\\". It is here that you start getting into the information we bring to discourse from our own knowledge of the world, such as what we know about the sender and receiver, discourse types and parts, and more. It is in this section that the activities start to come with suggestions on how to promote student awareness of different aspects of discourse. Of course, Cook emphasises the \\"top-down\\" aspect of it in this section.The third section explores discourse in the classroom, which is almost entirely activities that can be done in class. They are fairly interesting and add an extra element to a neglected aspect or two in English teaching.This is book that is more practical than theoretical, and provides an excellent insight into discourse and how that impacts on students who are learning English. It is a great introduction to the complexities that students of language have to deal with, and what we can do to alleviate the difficulty and promote deeper skills.I really found this book interesting and inspiring for my own development, and recommend it for others in the field. A great book that keeps it relatively simple, and keeps it relevant. In that, it definitely follows the Co-operative Principle: keep it relevant and keep it brief. Though, it is not too brief.Simply put: a great book all round."},{"Title":"Bristle Face","review":"I am 50 years old, I read BRISTLE FACE when I was in Jr. High at age 12 or 13 ..

No this isn't Ripley's Believe it or Not, just an ordinary dog in an ordinary place.A boy who has lost both of his parents runs away after his uncle, who he's forced to live with, gets drunk and beats him. After he escapes questions run through his mind, \\"Where will I go? What will I eat?\\" But after finding a bit of company on the lonely dirt road, he gets attached to the ugly hound, and his life begins to change.I love this book because the vivid description paints a picture in your mind. For example, after the panther fight, the author states, \\"I looked him over and found he was ripped bad down both sides and one ear was chewed almost clear off.\\" Doesn't that make you think of a dying dog lying helpless on the ground (I know that isn't the best mental picture but it helps you plunge your self into the scene!)?I also love the deep southern accent used through words such as, \`ain't', and \`electioneerin.' The author, Zachary Ball, tells the story from the boy's viewpoint rather than a bystander's, which gives the book an amazing twist.I recommend this book for grades six and up because of vivid description however both adults and teenagers may find this book intriguing."},{"Title":"Bristle Face","review":"Judging from the reviews, it looks like I wasn't the only one who was affected by this book...I was 12-13 yrs old when I read this book.

Just as \\"Where The Red Fern Grows\\" is a wonderful story of a boy and his dogs with a tear-jerker ending, so is Bristle Face.

The enduring romance of the eastern Madeline Hammond and her cowboy, Gene Stewart, There's a lot of fun (the golf episode is a favorite of mine) along with action and drama. I first read this nearly 50 years ago and still re-read it. Also look for the sequal - Majesty's Rancho."},{"Title":"The light of western stars: A romance","review":"The Light of Western Stars is one of my favorite Zane Grey romances. And when easterner Madeline Hammond gets off the train near midnight and things begin to happen right away, you know that this is going to be a good one. Gene Stewart, the other half of the romance is a man's man with the traditional western values but who has at first kind of lost his way because of drinking too much. But that gets straightened out through the love of a woman. The cast of characters includes some cowboys, old time cowboys, you will never forget. There's an animal, a magnificent horse, in the story; an automobile, driven by a cowboy who loves to go fast and scare his passengers, and this plays a vital role in the climax of the story as only ZG can describe and tell it. This is another of his books which take place in contemporary times, written when these events were playing themselves out along the US-Mexico border. This is another of his books which is told primarily from the woman's perspective and would indeed appeal to the female reader; it's NOT a bang, bang shoot'em up with street duels and impossible violence, but realistic characters and events. It's a great book for anyone to enjoy, a historical romance set in the West; not a \\"western\\".

At one book fair to which he took the class, he found this book for me. It has nothing to do with monsters, but rather is a collection of short stories, moral essays really, about a legendary 17th-18th century Japanese judge, Ooka Tadasuke a.k.a. the Wise. I liked it so much, I went to the law textbook section of the 18th St. Barnes & Noble in Manhattan and to find more books on law. Being 10 years old, I chose a small paperback -- West Nutshell Contracts. This, as any lawyer can tell you, is not a book for children, but rather it is the premier study guide for law students, a condensation of all U.S. law on contracts. That was the beginning with my lifetime love affair with law. Now, I am happy to be a lawyer in NYC. My appreciation for justice in the law, as I believe it should be, comes in large part from having read this book, The Case of the Marble Monster and Other Stories by I.G. Edmonds. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The case of the marble monster and other stories","review":"Ooka the Judge was a real judge who tried cases with fairness and justice long ago in Japan.

Armed with passable Polish and the outlines of the history of Poland, he travels to that country in 1995 and tracks down the vestiges of an older Jewish community and the emergence of a newer one. Among his subjects we find less anger or self-pity than a gritty determination to defy the odds and hold onto tradition, even though that tradition must be reinvented and redefined.I recommend this book without qualification. Mayer may not be a novelist, but his characters draw you in and leave you with the same kind of inchoate satisfaction and understanding that Jumpa Lahiri was able to achieve in exploring her Indian background in The Namesake."},{"Title":"Who Will Say Kaddish?: A Search for Jewish Identity in Contemporary Poland (Religion, Theology, and the Holocaust)","review":"A breathtaking and poignant look at identity--from the pespective of a new and important vantage point: the 2nd generation Jew who must accept the past and forge a future. Larry Mayer's text unflinchingly takes on all the hard questions and Gary Gelb's photo's bring the reader the means of seeing for oneself."},{"Title":"Who Will Say Kaddish?: A Search for Jewish Identity in Contemporary Poland (Religion, Theology, and the Holocaust)","review":"This is an amazing book that integrates photos and text very successfully. This is not just a photo book, nor just a wonderful story about the miraculous revival of the Jewish community in Poland. The author's personal journey, as the son of two Polish-Jewish Holocaust survivors is just as intriguing and extremely well-written. I appreciate his open-minded approach and ironic self doubt. I was especially moved by the chapters about the old Jewish man living near Tarnow, and the 'Jewish' priest in Lublin. The sections where the author takes us back to his American childhood were also especially charming and enlightening. The black and white photographs are well-placed throughout and add an extra level of understanding to this contemporary narrative. A must for all those interested in Judaism, the Holocaust, and what it means to create an identity in the wake of tragedy.Also recommended: Helen Epstein--'Where She Came From' Thane Rosenbaum--'Second Hand Smoke' Nathan Englander--'For the Relief of Unbearable Urges'"},{"Title":"Who Will Say Kaddish?: A Search for Jewish Identity in Contemporary Poland (Religion, Theology, and the Holocaust)","review":"Larry N. Mayer's portrayal of modern day Jews negotiating the complexities of their history in Poland interweaves his personal quest for understanding the meaning of \\"Jewishness\\" in this late age, and yet resists that victim/victor dichotomy that so often accompanies the the sanctified tale of Jewishness in the 20th century. Mayer, the child of two Holocaust survivors, initially sets about his work to tell their tale, to speak the silence, the \\"absent-presence\\" of the Holocaust. And yet, throughout his journeys among the Jews in Poland, his text begins to tell a new tale altogether. Indeed, this is a text about individuals; those who are possessed by \\"a feeling,\\" be that religious, cultural, familial, or otherwise, that living their Jewishness is a life affirming activity. While this \\"feeling\\" takes many forms, Mayer's work is not intended to resolve the inconsistencies between them. Rather, this is a book that ultimately celebrates the diversity of Jewishness in the present, and unhinges stereotypical (and even archetypal) representations of what \\"Jew\\" means. Among the incredible individual portrayals included in the book are those who continue to testify, in their own ways, to both the Nazi horror, but also to the horrors of living under the Communist regime in Poland. Shmuel Roth, the \\"last observant Jew east of Krakow\\" is called \\"a living relic,\\" by the text, and after the purging of the Jews in 1968 he was one of the few who remained. While the synagogue is closed down, Shmuel Roth set up a synagogue in his small apartment. In one of the most moving affirmations of the book, Roth speaks about how he must stay alive because if he dies, \\"what will be left?\\" Mayer and the photographer of the text, Gary Gelb, whose moving photos bring the text to life, meet with Roth just in time, and thankfully so. Roth, like so many of the generation who survived the Holocaust, has since died; his post-Holocaust life what Who Will Say Kaddish so urgently conveys. Another of the \\"old generation,\\" Moses Szapiro, has an equally incredible story. Szapiro, the \\"last Jew of Warsaw\\" assists in the first bar mitzvah performed in the Warsaw synagogue in at least 17 years, since the Jews were forced underground by Communist oppression.) While the text does want to make sense of the horrors of the past, and the shadows of the past are everywhere, the work itself, and its readers, slowly come to understand that the Jewish existence in Poland never went away. It is this fact that Mayer wants to bring to his readers. The continuity he seeks is the continuity of life in a land that was termed \\"Juden-free\\" by the Nazis and has had similar terms revived since then. Indeed, Mayer's work operates as a bridge between this old Jewishness and the new Jewishness that is developing in places like Warsaw and Krakow. Despite the fact that anti-Semitism can be witnessed in the day to day realities of their lives in Poland, the development/renewal of \\"the feeling\\" Mayer portrays is being produced by a new generation; in journals, schools and in a philosophy so eloquently expressed by living a Jewish life in the present by Bogna Pawlisz. Mayer's own story comes to fruition in this new space that is the space of continuity, rather that the space of an \\"absent-presence,\\" or the destroyed past. Indeed, the work's title question, \\"who will say Kaddish?\\" speaks to both the old generation and the new, and rather than holding each of them in separate contexts, Mayer's work comes to understand that they are each parts of a larger cycle of Jewish life, both in Poland, and in the world. Mayer's version of \\"bearing witness\\" is thus the testimony of the now, a life affirming work that refuses to sentimentalize the past or to condescendingly valorize a survivor's mentality; as such, is an empowered and empowering stance for writer, photographer and their readers. In his father's words, \\"What's the big deal?\\"Reviewed by the Infinite Conversation"},{"Title":"Intelligence Test Desk Reference (ITDR): The Gf-Gc Cross-Battery Assessment","review":"Kevin S. McGrew and Dawn P. Flanagan propose that current intelligence testing practices are based in outdated models of cognitive abilities. As a result, test results interpretation is often ambiguous, incomplete, impossible or useless. As an alternative, the authors present an integrated Cattell-Horn-Carroll model of intelligence. This is really the most comprehensive and empirically supported psychometric theory of intelligence currently available and the theory around which intelligence tests should be interpreted. You will know, for example, what Wechsler verbal and performance IQ really measure or how global IQ scores obtained from different batteries actually arise from combining different abilities and are thus hardly comparable. The presentation is exceptionally clear and gives all the information necessary to correctly understand the applications that follow.First, the CHC model is used to analyze the major individually administered intelligence batteries. This is the Desk-Reference part of the book and shows the psychometric characteristics of all subtests in the batteries in a particularly clear and visual way. If only for this part, the book must be on the desk of all psychologists who wish to make sense of the intelligence tests they apply.Second a cross-battery approach to intellectual assessment and interpretation is defined and operationalized. This is sure to become a major landmark in intelligence testing. From now on, psychologists, educators and other mental health professionals have a set of practical guidelines for conducting actual assessments based on the CHC model and interpreting results in a meaningful and potentially more useful way. It must be emphasized that the guidelines describe a really feasible, perhaps even an easy, procedure.To most of us frustrated by the continued absence of sound theory based tests and uncomfortable with having to invent interpretations which we know are of no utility, this book could hardly be more welcome. It is thus only fortunate that it has been followed by another one specifically focused on the Wechsler scales (The Wechsler intelligence scales and Gf-Gc theory, by Dawn P Flanagan, Kevin S. McGrew and Samuel O. Ortiz). Also, the book connects with a previous and important one (Contemporary intellectual assessment, edited by Dawn P. Flanagan, Judy L. Genshaft and Patti L. Harrison). The reader might consider having, reading and using the set of three as a trilogy which updates current intelligence theory and practice and sets the stage for the immediate future.I strongly recommend that the interested reader uses Amazon's personal notification service so as not to miss any new book by these authors. We are witnessing the birth of a new era in intelligence theory and testing."},{"Title":"The Aleph and Other Stories (Penguin Classics)","review":"I was surprised to find when I picked up this book that it is not the same selection of stories as the earlier published THE ALEPH AND OTHER STORIES 1933-1969, translated by Norman Thomas di Giovanni in collaboration with Borges himself. Instead, it is a translation of two volumes published by Borges in Argentina, THE ALEPH and THE MAKER (EL HACEDOR), translated by Andrew Hurley.As for the stories themselves, I can say only that they are some of the most magical tales written in the last hundred years, perhaps even ever. Stories like \\"The Immortal,\\" \\"Story of the Warrior and the Captive Maiden,\\" \\"The Zahir,\\" and \\"The Aleph\\" are worthy of being read over and over again.Since I already have these stories in other form by other translators, I wanted to determine how good Hurley's translation is. To that end, I'll compare some of my favorite passages. Let's start with the title story in the Hurley translation:\\"Under the step, toward the right, I saw a small iridescent sphere of almost unbelievable brightness. At first I thought it was spinning; then I realized that the movement was an illusion produced by the dizzying spectacles inside it. The Aleph was probably two or three centimeters in diameter, but universal space was contained inside it, with no diminution in size. Each thing (the glass surface of a mirror, let us say) was inifinite things, because I could clearly see it from every point in the cosmos.\\"Here di Giovanni with the same paragraph:\\"On the back part of the step, toward the right, I saw a small iridescent sphere of almost unbelievable brilliance. At first I thought it was revolving; then I realized that this movement was an illusion created by the dizzying world it bounded. The Aleph's diameter was probably little more than an inch, but all space was there, actual and undiminished. Each thing (a mirror's face, let us say) was infinite things, since I saw it distinctly from every angle of the universe.\\"I'd say that Hurley did a workmanlike job, but I like di Giovanni, especially with \\"the dizzying world it bounded,\\" much more idiomatic than \\"the dizzying spectacles inside it.\\" Now here's Hurley with \\"A Biography of Tadeo Isidoro Cruz\\":\\"As Cruz was fighting in the darkness (as his body was fighting in the darkness), he began to understand. He realized that one destiny is no better than the next and that every man must accept the destiny he bears inside himself.\\"From di Giovanni's \\"The Life of Tadeo Isidoro Cruz\\":\\"Cruz, while he fought in the dark (while his body fought in the dark), began to understand. He understood that one destiny is no better than another, but that every man must obey what is within him.\\"Again, I accept the Hurley, but prefer di Giovanni.\\"Every man must obey\\" is simpler, more idiomatic than \\"every man must accept the destiny.\\"One complaint I have against both translations is that neither bothers to provide translations of quotations from the Latin. This is particularly disturbing in the case of \\"Story of the Warrior and the Captive Maiden,\\" in which two four-line excerpts are taken from a Latin tomb of a Lombard warrior that turn out to be quite interesting. I finally had to turn to Thomas Hodgkin's THE BARBARIAN INVASIONS OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE to find the whole epitaph Englished.In summary, it is better to read Hurley than not to read Borges at all; but, given the chance, I would prefer di Giovanni by a slight margin."},{"Title":"The Aleph and Other Stories (Penguin Classics)","review":"Trying to full describe the writings of Jorge Luis Borges is like trying to explain exactly why Leonardo da Vinci's art still captivates. The man wrote works of art.\\"The Aleph and Other Stories\\" includes two different books of Borges', very different in their styles -- one is rich and epic, while the other is sort of short and quirky. But this collection is a shining example of why people enjoy Borges -- magical, rich in language, and lets us glimpse the minds of anything and anyone he can conjure up.The title story involves a sort of fictional version of Borges, who makes regular pilgrimages to the house of a woman he loved, and encounters her slightly nuts first cousin Daneri, who is composing a horrible epic poem describing the whole world. When Daneri's house is threatened, he reveals how he's composed the poem -- the Aleph, which he discovered as a child, and he allows Borges to catch a glimpse of... everything.The other stories have tales of heretics and holy men, of a man's last days awaiting an assassin's bullet, of a girl who coldly seeks revenge for her father, and the Zahir (the opposite of the Aleph), which can cause an all-encompassing obsession in the one who sees it, until they shut out reality.And in the second book, he spins up a long string of very, VERY short stories (some only a paragraph). Some are musings on his toes, and nothing much more. But there are also brief stories of startling depth, such as God speaking to Dante and the \\"Divine Comedy's\\" leopard, and assuring them of their literary immortality.The main flaw with this collection is that it's basically split into two very dissimilar styles -- some of them are short and relatively plain, while the others are dense pockets of philosophy. In fact, all the stories in the first portion of the book are based on the idea of shared experiences and infinite time, where there are no \\"new\\" experiences but only repetition.And Borges wraps these stories in lush, digified prose that takes a little while to wade through, but the richness of the words he uses is worth it (\\"every generation of mankind includes four honest men who secretly hold up the universe and justify it\\"). And his writing takes on many different people's selves -- he even makes readers squirm by taking us into the mind of a loyal Nazi.It's almost like another world, Borgeworld, which is almost like ours, but where magical items are hidden in the cellars, soldiers are forgotten, the Minotaur plays in his maze, and God dreams of mortal lives. The most entrancing foray into Borgeworld is \\"The Immortal,\\" about a Roman soldier who goes searching for a city of immortals, and finds an ancient poet who seems very familiar.\\"The Aleph and Other Stories\\" is a brilliant collection of Borges' exquisite stories. Magical and gritty, beautiful and haunting -- this collection should be cherished."},{"Title":"The Aleph and Other Stories (Penguin Classics)","review":"In these tales , Borges retakes his favorite themes and according to his acustomed inventive modality , gives them a unexpected and shinning threatment. He risks in every page a new imagination of the fantastic universe that he - as anyone else - knew how create among us . It is well reknown his capacity to build estethical metaphors of philosophic trascendence . The fair endings , mathematics never lose its characteristic sensibility . That is why you can state that these tales conform its geometric miracle .To those who seek the brilliant Borges of the unfinnished mental games , you must name The Zahir , The two kings , The teologhists .And even if you prefer the walking Buenos Aires Borges of this stage that always is giving background and national perspective to his work you will find friendly pages in The dead man , The wait and Emma Zunz .Please, make yourself a favour and get into the enigmatic universe , the asimetrical axis , the elusive encounters , the sinister otherness and eliptic dreams of that outstanding writer who was Jorge Luis Borges ."},{"Title":"The Aleph and Other Stories (Penguin Classics)","review":"Many people bewail that Borges was not awarded the Noble Prize for Literature because of political reasons. The prize was given to Gabriel Marques, a superb writer, but Borges is better. Borges stories are a delight to read and they have mystical messages. Both Borges and Marques write in the tradition of Spanish magical writers. It is like reading how a person is walking across a bridge and continues by floating across in the air.This volume has twenty of Borges' short stories, including the title tale The Aleph. The letter aleph is the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet. Its form is very similar to the English letter X. Both can be seen by the mystically-minded as a man pointing simultaneously to the heaven and the earth. But the aleph is the first, the primal letter, and could and did invoke in many ancient minds the idea that all of creation, past, present, and future, can be contained in the small space of this letter, far less than an inch in height and breadth.Borges story captures this ancient notion. A man enters a house and descends down a cellar and discovers the aleph there. Readers of the tale will ask themselves many questions, such as: What is the significance of descending to gain the knowledge? Isn't knowledge attained by ascending? What is this knowledge? Is it possible that all knowledge can be capsulated into a single small idea? Is all of nature really one, as God is one? Once the man knew what the aleph contained, could he remember it? When we get insights, can we remember them?"},{"Title":"The Aleph and Other Stories (Penguin Classics)","review":"To read Jorge Luis Borges --the Argentinian sage-- is more than a challenge, it is a losing battle with literary reality because Borges erased the borders between the quotidian, the dream, magic realism, hallucination, and eternity.One can just picture Borges (the man) going to his grave with an impish smile on his lips, thrilled with the knowledge that many of us would endlessly continue to puzzle out his contrived stories.For example, search as hard as we might, we will never find the 602nd night of the Thousand and One Nights; the night when Scheherazade tells a story about herself telling a story in which she also tells a story about--and so on in an infinite regress.Forever we will also attempt to decipher the magic of \\"The Aleph,\\" the point of all points in which we can see all of creation in an instant; much as God did on the seventh day. In the short story--the Aleph--Borges cites similar ideas about creation, such as the Shield of Achilles in which the entire cosmos is depicted.Closer to our times, contemporary writer Marciano Guerrero situates the Aleph in New York City! In a culminating scene of his novel the Poison Pill, the protagonist Ivon Bates, sees and hears all the languages of the world and their convergence into the Adamic language and God's totality.Time, Borges thought, is an illusion; a daring hypothesis with an obvious proof: The Borges (not the man but the character) of \\"Borges and I,\\" will live forever.The writing techniques I employ in this article are all explained in Mary Duffy's writing manual:[...]"},{"Title":"The Aleph and Other Stories (Penguin Classics)","review":"This collection of short stories covers a huge array of concepts and ideas, ranging from history and religion, through philosophy to science. One recurring theme involves taking a well known story or idea and looking at it from a different angle or viewpoint.The translation is well handled and the translator's notes are designed to give a background to place names or people that a non Argentinean would not necessarily know without getting in the way of the text.This is the first of JLB's books that I have read; I will certainly look out more."},{"Title":"The Aleph and Other Stories (Penguin Classics)","review":"Length:: 0:32 Mins"},{"Title":"The Aleph and Other Stories (Penguin Classics)","review":"This new Penguin edition of \\"The Aleph and Other Stories\\" was my first voyage to the land of labyrinths and puzzles that Borges is so noted for. I can certainly say now that the trip was more than worth it, and I hope to make many more \\"le voyage &agrave; l'espagnol!\\""},{"Title":"The Aleph and Other Stories (Penguin Classics)","review":"When I read the work of Jorge Luis Borges I feel like my universe is expanding a thousand fold. And for good reason - my universe is, in fact, expanding a thousand fold! This is especially true as I read The Aleph and Other Stories. Never before have I encountered a collection with such sheer imaginative power. Fantastic! There are nearly fifty stories and brief tales collected here from three Borges books: The Aleph, the Maker and Museum -- and every one worth re-reading multiple times.Since this collection already has 11 reviews and mine will be number 12 - ah, all the magical and archetypical associations Borges could make with this most perfect of numbers - I will focus on 4 stories, the first 3 being no longer than 2 pages. (4,3,2 . . . moving down to the infinity of the Borges 0, which, so happens, to be the shape of the Aleph). Sorry, I am getting too carried away.The Two Kings and the Two LabyrinthsThe king of Babylonia builds a labyrinth \\". . . so confused and so subtle that the most prudent men would not venture to enter it, and those who did would lose their way.\\" Although the king of Babylonia tricked the king of the Arabs into entering his diabolical labyrinth, the king, with the help of God, manages to find the secret exit. After claiming victory in a bloody war, the king of the Arabs leads the king of Babylonia, in turn, into a different kind of labyrinth, and says, \\" . . . the Powerful One has seen fit to allow me to show thee mine, which has no stairways to climb, nor doors to force, not wearying galleries to wander through, nor walls to impede thy passage.\\" Then, the king of the Arabs abandoned the king of Babylonia in the middle of the desert. These two images of a labyrinth, one intricate, convoluted, infinitely confusing and the other an endless desert, have remained with me since I first read this tale some thirty years ago and will remain with me as long as there is a \`me' with a memory.The CaptiveA tale of identity where a young boy with sky-blue eyes is kidnapped in an Indian raid. The parents recover their son who is now a man and bring him back to their home. The man remembers exactly where he hid a knife. Not long thereafter, the man, now an Indian in spirit, returns to the wilderness. The story ends with a question, \\"I would like to know what he felt in that moment of vertigo when past and present intermingled; I would like to know whether the lost son was reborn and died in that ecstatic moment, and he ever managed to recognize, even as a baby or a dog might, his parents and the house.\\" For Borges, memory and identity are ongoing themes. After reading Borges, I can assure you, memory and identity have become ongoing themes for me also.The PlotHow many volumes have been written pondering and philosophizing over fate and free will? In two short paragraphs Borges gives us a tale where we are told, \\"Fate is partial to repetitions, variations, symmetries.\\" How exactly? Let's just say life is always bigger than man-made notions of life.The AlephAround the universe in fifteen pages. There is a little something here for anybody who cherishes literature - a dearly departed lover named Beatriz, a madman and poet named Carlos Argentino Daneri, who tells the first person narrator, a man by the name of Borges, about seeing the Aleph, and, of course, the Aleph. What will this Borges undergo to see the Aleph himself? We read, \\"I followed his ridiculous instructions; he finally left. He carefully let down the trap door; in spite of a chink of light that I began to make out later, the darkness seemed total. Suddenly I realized the danger I was in; I had allowed myself to be locked underground by a madman, after first drinking down a snifter of poison.\\" Rather than saying anything further about the Aleph, let me simply note that through the magic of literature we as readers are also given a chance to see what Borges sees. I dare anybody who has an aesthetic bone in their body to read this story and not make the Aleph a permanent part of their imagination.Go ahead. Take the risk. Be fascinated and enlarged. Have the universe and all its details spinning in your head. Read this book."},{"Title":"The Aleph and Other Stories (Penguin Classics)","review":"A lot of these are also in Labyrinth's, but it was a pleasure to go through them again and to be reminded of the wonderful way that Borges makes these succinct little ruminations about time, memory, and of course, books. The stories in this collection are also much more specifically about Argentina and Argentine history, which Borges comes at from a very empathic, if also sardonic angle. Even the little, half page sketches I found myself re-reading several times, mystified and enchanted by what someone can do with a single paragraph"},{"Title":"The Aleph and Other Stories (Penguin Classics)","review":"It was as if in the writing of many stories he was seeking to conceal the fact that he had only one story to write. And in that one story was contained the essence of all stories, so that to read it and understand it was to become the story itself.So too with the Aleph the single letter in which the whole of the Universe is contained. Once one finds it and reads it and loses oneself in it one has read all stories and need not read any other again.Yet when the other stories come, and they do come, and they have letters and shapes 'The Aleph' itself does not know,they remind us that basically the 'Aleph ' is at best a metaphor, and in its heart of hearts ,unreal.All of us today are readers of Borges. And as such we are contained in the Aleph of his work.But he is far away and above us all.For he is the great literary genius whose works will be read and reread.And it is fair to say that the letter 'Aleph' alone is not enough to contain him."},{"Title":"Elegant Glassware of the Depression Era: Identification and Value Guide (Elegant Glassware of the Depression Era, 9th ed)","review":"The shipment arrived very very fast, the book stinks but that is not the shippers problem."},{"Title":"Elegant Glassware of the Depression Era: Identification and Value Guide (Elegant Glassware of the Depression Era, 9th ed)","review":"I have collected alot of glass over the years and never cared to know what they were.

Decent as in if you use it youll bet the boss, most of the time.The book tells you what items there are to find in a section, but its incomplete and wrong. Most of the time there are at least 2 items i found that werent on the list, and at least 1 item on the list that wasnt in the game in that area.The walk through is good if all you want to do is go directly to the boss, but it doesnt take you to the weapon/armor upgrades neccesary to defeat the boss.The game is great, this book is pathetic."},{"Title":"The Legend of Dragoon: Prima's Official Strategy Guide","review":"The reason why people buy official strategy guides in the first place is because they need in depth helps.This guide book is really brief hardly telling you where key items are and how to defeat bosses and the right team combinations and skills to use.Legend of Dragoon is a complicated game and the guide book does not help by briefly describing on the dragoon power, how to boost it up .......It could have been better"},{"Title":"The Legend of Dragoon: Prima's Official Strategy Guide","review":"like the others said, if you are looking for something to tell you where to go next it is good, but for one it does not tell you where all the items are and hardly anything about the sub quest. overall it is a very rushed and poorly put together strategy guide."},{"Title":"The Legend of Dragoon: Prima's Official Strategy Guide","review":"If you're looking for a strategy guide to Legend of Dragoon, look elsewhere.
