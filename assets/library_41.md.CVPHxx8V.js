I can't believe I haven't changed my mind about that. It is stunning in that it has so many words I had to look up. Such a shame that novelists today are discouraged to use such language. It is easy enough to read and I would imagine it would be a great one to read to young girls piecemeal on holidays.

They are poor and their father is at war,and they have all sorts of, um, not really adventures, but you get the point. Well, it tells about their daily lives- not that interesting. Alcott devotes whole chapters to something as trivial as making dinner- and doesn't make it even that interesting. In the end, they are all happy and married with kids, thus giving the message to reach true happiness the ultimate goal must be marriage- not.I can't believe Alcott managed to write 647 pages of this- it was so dang boring! Of course, it had its interesting moments, but for the most part, I can't believe I'm alive, writing this review. Overall, this book hasn't affected me much- just another book.Plot- boringEnding- pretty satisfying, especially because it's the endingFlow- I still don't know which character is which, and the book went from, say, a tea party, to a dinner, and back to the tea party; confusing!Would I buy this book- I already did, but it was free (meh heh heh)Would I reread this book- NO!Bottom line: Must I say it again?

It's wonderfully done; extremely descriptive. It is realistic, with ups and downs. Each character has its own personality; nothing has ever been like it before, in all my almost 13 years. It really takes you back in time, as if you are really there. My favorite character was Beth; I cried really hard when she died!! Jo was creative; Beth was a darling; Amy was prissy; Meg was vain. I liked how Beth was close to her cats, and I also liked how she \\"took in\\" rejected dolls. I also loved the fact that Jo was a writer, because that's what I am; I just LOVE to write stories, especially about horses. I recomend this book to any old fashioned girl like me."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Have you ever thought about what it would be like to live during the Cicil War? Little women, by Louisa May Alcott is a sterling example of this. In Little Women, there's a family of seven. Marmee(the mom);Meg, Joe, Beth, and Amy(sisters), a maid, and the father who is a chaplain in the Civil War. The sisters are good friends until their handsome neighbor Teddy moves in with his grandfather. Then they start vying each other for his attention. Through all this, there are fires, dances, family problems, etc. Towards the end one of the sisters dies from scarlet fever.Little Women is a book written for middle to high scholl students. The language it is written in, and some of the things that happen would confuse elementary. It;s a very good book for sisters, friends, etc because it teaches you not to become jealous.Little Women can be both sad and humorous at times. Throughout the story the dialouge switches back in forth. For example, when Amy was talking to Joe she said \\"You like Teddy, You like Teddy\\". Then in the same paragraph it talks about there father. At sometimes the girls are happy with each other, while sometimes they are angry. For a chapter at the end it's very sad when one of the sisters dies.The content of the book is very good. It goes back and forth from fictional stories from the civil war to non-fictional stories. A lot of the places in the book are real to. For examole, Virginia. The book teaches a very good moral. Not just for sisters but for anybody. It teaches you not to get jealous, and yearn for things others have or want.If you want to read a fictional story about sisters set in the Civil War, then this book is for you!!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I just finished reading Louisa May Alcott's Little Women and I thought it was okay. Some of the problems that she wrote about I would not have to worry about today. One problem that I wouldn't have to worry about would be having a good dress to wear to a party,like Jo had to. Not many girls wear a lot of dresses to parties. Some parts of the book were better than others,like when all the girls pitched in money to buy a present for their Mom instead of themselves. Louisa May Alcott also wrote the book kind of like a sequal to Little Women called Little Men,if you would like to know what happens with Jo."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"The story of these four girls and their experiences growing up is one that all readers can relate to.

Some times I wish I was in that sort of family were every one is close to each other and theres lots of people to love. I only have one sister and two dogs but i hardly ever see them thats why i would like a family like that. My faviorite part of the book which i could never do, is when Joe cuts her hair and sells it for money. I love my hair so mutch so I dont think that I could ever do that mutch of a brave thing for my family. I thought it was really sad when beth died I have never had anybody in my family die so I dont know how that would feel. I't was really suprising to me how thet got over it so fast. Well I guess they had each other to love and take the pain away. Well I guess I dont have to mutch to say other than this is a really good book.I sugest you read this book if you havnt.

Lots of lessons are learned by all four of the sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. who all have very different characters. Much laughter, fun and sad times too, the mother is portrayed as a loving, nurturing parent who directs her children through trial, tribulations and turbulent times.

I love the Jo character and really identify with her. I think it's interesting that even though it was set in the past, the concerns of the girls are very similar to those of people today. While each person wanted something different in life, they were all things I could identify with. It may be a classic, but the writing is still easy to read in current times.

Heartwarming=)"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"The novel, Little Women, By Louisa May Alcott is what people would consider to be a classic real life novel. It tells about the lives of young people and all the events they must go through. The girls in this novel have to go through a death of a sister, a person that they all love more than life itself, the girls must grow up with their father in the war, forcing them to try and earn money for their family, and there is many other problems these girls must face. Even with all the troubles they had, they never let it get to them because they still tried hard in whatever they came across and respected and loved one another until the end. This book inspires readers because of the commitment of one of the sisters, Jo, and how she never stopped believing in her dream to be a writer, and how she felt committed to the family more than anyone else why her father was away. This book teaches young and even older girls how to live their lives. The girls in this novel learn everything from their mother and she is confident in all of them. This story shows the true meaning of love between a family."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"The heartwarming book, Little Women, has won its readers love and support. The generalized assessment shows fondness to the realistic viewpoint of the lives of Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy and descriptive details that transport the reader into the beloved fairy tale. The plot of the story centers upon the girls' lives as they grow up during the Civil War. Each of the girls is extremely distinct in their character, taste, and dreams for their future. The positive role model and personal advisor to all of the girls is Mrs. March. I feel that she advised all of her daughter in making good decisions, except for when she agreed with Jo that Laurie was not a suitable match. The change the girls undergo as they get older is completely intriguing as each has special qualities and drawbacks to their character. The realistic aspects of the tale is one of my favorite characteristics of Louisa May Alcott's writing style. The detailed descriptions sent picturesque scenes through my mind. The variety of emotions throughout the duration of the book takes the reader on an emotional roller coaster ride."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This timeless classic still makes me cry, still makes me laugh and still seems fresh, every single time I reread it! My mum read it as did her mum probably, I've read it over and over and now my two teenagers are reading it. I used to recite my own version of this wonderful story when my children were young girls. They loved it! Of course, they weren't quite old enough back then to fully understand or appreciate Louisa May Alcott's version so I'd improvise for them. They would hear about all the fun times the sisters had during the Civil War era. The games they played, how Amy (May) used to draw on her bedroom walls. You see, the wonderful thing about living in this suburb of Boston is the fact that I can drive 15 miles into Concord. Of course, as soon as my girls were old enough, off we went, to the Alcott house where we visited this big rambling house which they'd heard me talk about and by now, had seen in the movies. They SAW Amy's bedroom drawings all over her bedroom wall and her dresses laid out on her bed. They saw everything first hand which was a real treat for them. They didn't seem to enjoy the trip up to the old cemetery where Louise and her 'real life' sisters lay. Not quite as entertaining to youngsters...ha ha. I seem to have told you about the thrill of being able to actually visit the real Alcott surroundings, which seem to be stuck in a time warp with all the original old furnishings inside. So, back to the book. Need I even say it! I'm sure everyone who visits this site has read this wonderful book about a New England family growing up and their many adventures. Sure, we all know Louisa changed the names of her sisters then wrote a book around their lives. You can read this book a million times and never tire of it so imagine how I felt, looking at the actual sites and just imagining in my mind! I saw my girls eyes open wide in wonder! No, not everyone can come to Concord to see the Alcott house but you can pick up this book for your teenagers or just read it again yourself! In case you didn't guess, I LOVE this book. Please read it! As my daughters are right now...and so on...and so on...and so on...."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"The four March girls (Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy) come of age in Civil War America in this classic from Louisa May Alcott.This is a morality tale in which the girls experience separation from a parent (Dad is off to fight for the Union), caring for each other and their mother, travel, loss and death, love, marriage and most of the life experiences one might expect a young woman to encounter.My abridged edition proved to be a good reader... The story held her interest and the experiences of the sisters almost always led to good discussions about dating, loss, marriage, caring and the other topics Ms. Alcott does a good job of rostering up a chapter at a time.A good book for the elementary school set."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Little women is a very heartwarming book it is about four sisters and their family, and what they go through. I think that what makes this book so heartwarming is, because of the fact that they deal with normal everyday problems. With most books they don't have too much reality involved, but Little Women does. The Marches family is a really close family who sticks together through everything that happens to them. None of the sisters are alike they all have different personalities, which is probably another reason why I like this book. Meg is the mature one, she is also very pretty. She is sixteen years old. Jo is the adventurous one; she wants to be a write. Beth is the very fragile one, and Amy is the one who is pampered. She puts everyone before herself. Marmee, the mother is all alone taking care of her children, because the father had to go fight for the north. The mother takes care of the children very well. She gives them lots of love and tender loving care. To me the mother seems like a second mother to me, because she seemed so real. I'm sure anyone who has read this book, and who doesn't have a mother thiks of Mrs. Marches as a mother to them. To me I think the funniest part was when the one sister cuts off the other sisters hair. The saddest part was when one of the sisters die. Yes, I did shed a tear when Laurie who is the Marches' neighbor proposed to Jo, and yet Jo turned his offer down. So, basically I would say that this book is somewhat humurous at points and somewhat sad at points. I'm not a book reader, actually I hate reading, but this book was a definite page-turner. I liked this book very much; I couldn't put it down. It took me about five days to read it, which is how good it was. Between a scale from one to ten, I would definitely give it a ten. Thsi book I would say is about four hundred and fifty pages. I wouldn't reccomend this book for anyone under the age of eleven."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This is how my life used to be: I get home from school, wander around in the pantry for awhile wondering what to eat, snatch a bag of chips, grab the comics, sit down and read the &quot;Marvin&quot; and &quot;Pickles&quot; comic strips.

When I started to read Little Women, things dramatically changed. It was good-bye to Marvin, Earl and Opal and hello to Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. It was Little Women before food. It was Little Women first. Because of poverty, the characters stumble over many rocks on the road of their lives. Once in a while, they find a golden nugget lying in their path. In Little Women, author Louisa May Allcott shows the life of four sisters. Meg is a quiet proper young lady, who in spite of here desire of wealth, falls in love with her neighbor's poor tutor. Jo is the wild one with the lowest amount of properness and the highest amount of dreams. She is a young and talented writer and finds a deep friendship with the neighbor boy, Laurie, because of their great similarities. Amy is the artist. Her wish is to be popular at school. She is proper and receives great credit for it. As for Beth, she has nothing to look forward to. This frail young girl knows her future and has no wish other then love and happiness. Now I leave you, my friend, to find the future of these women by picking up the book and entering their lives."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Little Women is the best book I have ever read. The heartwarming story of the four sisters Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy is a classic everyone should grow to read and love. The story depicts one family's hope and strength to overcome one struggle after another. This story is wonderful for both children and adults, and it really shows how close families can be and how their love can affect one another. I think that anyone in need in a good book to read whenever should pick up Little Women by Louisa May Alcott. The sequels Little Men and Jo's Boys also give readers the stories of the March family after Little Women ends. Five stars for sure!!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"When I first read &quot;Little Women&quot; I was twelve years old and now, several years later, it is still my favorite book. One of the reasons for that is that the book is effidently written with much love and feeling, which is quite understandable, knowing that it is based on Louisa Alcott's own life. It is really tragic when one finds out what Louisa's real life was like and the way she describes it in &quot;Little Women&quot;. It is as if she were decribing the life she wished for, while she tries at the same time to depict the truth. The way she describes the family life is heartwarming and I always hope that my children will love me as much as the March girls love their mother. The book is a picture of love, confidence and goodness. Some people may say it is too soft and moralistic, but I think that it can't do any harm to think about that once in a while. I mean, what is wrong with being good? The March girls are not saints, not even Beth, but they try to be as good as possible and many people should try that too. This book is most surely the loveliest story I have ever read and probably the best I'll ever read. And I don't think I am alone in that, otherwise it wouldn't be so popular today, over a hundred years after its first publication."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This was a well written book by Alcott.

It tells the story of a family living in poverty, but are much richer in love than any family I know of. There are four sisters who love each other very much, but are often quarreling as sisters do. I have read and reread this story about 25 times and every time I find it as delightful as before and I am always finding new parts that I either missed or forgotten before. I recommend this book to everyone who likes classics. Also all women who have sisters will really appreciate the trials that these four have."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Louisa May Alcott's 'Little Women' is one of the most captivating and heartfelt stories I have ever read. This is the story of four sisters, living at an unstable time in American history, who learn to overcome poverty and selfish wants to become mature and accomplished women. Their triumphs will bring a smile to your face, while their trials will bring you tears. The March sisters will win their way into your mind and heart, and their story is one you will not soon forget."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I read Little Women by:Louisa May Alcott.This book is an amazing book. It does not necessarily teach you lessons on how to live, but from reading the book you learn alot. I enjoyed this book so much. It taught me about family, love, sacrifices, hardships, and alot more.When Beth goes and visits the Hummel family and gets Scarlett Fever from the baby, you sense alot of feelings from everyone. That was a very intense part for me. Also when the Dad gets sick, and the Mom leaves that is another intense part. Alot of things happen that make you feel like you do not know what is going to happen.Then the sister's start to grow up and fall in love. You get to know them so much throughout this book. When they feel something like when Jo thinks Beth loves Laurie, the guy Jo met and become friends with, and then goes away and lets Beth have him. That hurts to know how she is feeling. But when Jo meets Professor Bhaer and starts to fall in love with him you get very excited.I was did not specifically like how the book ended becuase I wanted something else to happen that did not. But I still think this was a great book and I reccomend it to anyone searching for a book that you can not help but care about the characters."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"When i was nine years old i read little Women. Though it is long I read it pretty quickly and enjoyed it immensely. After reading this wonderful book I became inpired to finish the trilogy about Jo and her family/life, and to read more of Alcott's work. right now I am reading An Old-Fashioned Girl which I am enjoying, but isn;t as good as Little Women, Alcott's masterpiece. this book is perfectly balanced because there are joyous moments, though sad things occur. This fictionalized story about Louisa may Alcott as a teenager is written well. I would reccomend it to any girl between the ages of 9 and 12! I will defenitely read this book again, to rediscover the timeless tale of four wonderful sisters.-S.L.B."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I think Little Women is a wonderful book. It is about four sisters who live with their mother, \\"Marmee\\". Their father is working in the Civil War. I think it was very interesting because Miss Alcott makes it full of surprises. Even when sometimes the surprises seem out of place, everything comes out perfect.Anyway, it has a very nice ending, and I loved reading it even though it was very long."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I thought the book was rather good. It was kind of easy to read and easy to follow. I also liked it because it was about four sisters. I think books with sisters it in are good for children to read so they no what other ppl think its like to have sisters. Then ending was really cute too."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I actually liked the book Little Women. I am not huge fan of reading, but for some reason i really liked this book. It was sort of boring at parts, but other time you couldn't put it down. There was also very upsetting parts and even happy parts which made u keep reading and keep wondering. An ex. of sadness was when Beth passed away. It was shocking when Laurie asked Jo to marry him and she said no, and then he asked Amy to marry him and she said yes! A point of happiness was when Meg delivered her babies! I would recommend this book o others, but prefeberly women because guys will not enyjoy it or get enought out of it!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I can't imagine someone disliking this novel. That is impossible. This book has things for all tastes: romance, friendship, betrayal etc. I have read this book 3 or 4 times and everytime I can find something different, or, even, be surprised. I think it is a wonderful thing how long Louisa May Alcott's masterpiece has been delighing readers everywhere.As everyone knows this is the story of four sisters and their love for each other , but above all, for life. Jo is the most impetuous and she wants to be a writer; Meg wants to get married and be a housewife; Beth, the most sweet, loves helping people; and, Amy wants to be an important person somehow. Through many years of their lives we learn how they succed --or fail-- in their ambition.Alcott's novel became a paradigma of the condition of American Women during the civil war. Each girl can be seen as a possibility of what women had for their future by that time. Maybe this is why this novel is so timeless. The writer didn't want to make a sociological analysis of that period, but her work is very helpful, once it is quite reliable as a portrait of that society.This novel deserves to be read over and over again, and not only by little women."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Little Women is a story of four sisters with thier own point of views. This book has a very strong romantic field, but yet it has all of our child hood fantacies. The story is about four remarkable young girls, and as the pages turn they all grow up. Each one finds thier own love but desperate times happen more often. I love this book and, I think that this is a remarkable story of four sisters growing up together. As you read this book you may feel sad but everyone faces tough times. So read this book, It truly is worth reading."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Little Women is a charming book for all ages old and young. It has been cherished in our libraries for so many years and it never gets old. The story is one of four sisters battling not only with perosnal issues but family issues. The March family is not exaclty wealthy and they must find their money is places they wish not to. But despite their financial issues the sisters make believe they live in other places, putting on theatricals, plays, making up clubs and tellong their most apauling secrets. With their father in the Civil War and their mother having the reputation of helping a young black girl, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy must search for ways to fit in. The book tells their story from when they are young girls in the Pickwick Portfoliio, to young women getting married and having a family of their own.I can relate to this book a lot because having sisters of my own I went and still go through a lot of the same things. When my sisters and I were little girls we played with eachother and made up games together much like the March sisters. And as we a growing older we find that life is not always as simple as when we were kids, like Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy all find out together. The book captures the essence and wonderful things to come when you have a sister that you love and care for and can tell all your secrets to. When you doubt yourself your sister will back you up and love you no matter what. There is nothing like a sister and to quote the book, \\" a sister's bond is one which that is stronger than marriage\\"."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This is a one beautiful book to read ,the beauty of the book is that it has so many central charecters and each one holds his and her grounds completely.Amy is a wonderful girl ,who keeps the string of happiness in the family,but its the Mrs. march who is the driving force in the book."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Alcott's novel recounting the lives of the March family is aremarkable book reflective of her own unusual upbringing (the Marchesare all modeled after her real-life family, from her artistic sister May to her scholarly father). The story is written episodically, making for ideal bedtime reading, and is filled with lessons of early feminism, transcendtal theories, and the advanced ideas of the Civil War era that Alcott absorbed from her father.I've read this book for a decade, and only recently made a trip to the Alcott house in Boston. What a wonderful way to come back to a book that shaped my life and ideas of independence."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"OK, so after the 17 hundredth time (yes, I'm exaggerating), I have finally finished Little Women, and I'm so glad that I did! It's so totally excellent, and each chapter has a moral. Like, not to be vain or to not waste time or to not put much stock in riches, for money never was the equivalent to true love and happiness. I cried &amp; sobbed, and laughed and just generally thought &quot;I wish I were as contented as Beth, or as clever as Jo, beautiful as Amy &amp; charismatic as Meg.&quot; You fall in love with each of these girls, and Miss Alcott gave such a perfect description. I LOVE this book! Read it, and you'll never regret it. Pefection, pure and simple.

Families really can be that happy. I would highly reccomend this book and any of Louisa May Alcott's books"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"The book was rich in a kind of sensitive way. It was writenfrom the eyes of Jo, the tom boy. There are 4 sisters. Jo and Amy havea temper tantrum. Mr. March is away working.

Some times I wish I was in that sort of family were every one is close to each other and theres lots of people to love. I only have one sister and two dogs but i hardly ever see them thats why i would like a family like that. My faviorite part of the book which i could never do, is when Joe cuts her hair and sells it for money. I love my hair so mutch so I dont think that I could ever do that mutch of a brave thing for my family. I thought it was really sad when beth died I have never had anybody in my family die so I dont know how that would feel. I't was really suprising to me how thet got over it so fast. Well I guess they had each other to love and take the pain away. Well I guess I dont have to mutch to say other than this is a really good book.I sugest you read this book if you havnt.

In the case of Little Woman, there are pictures of fashion, carriages, sample segments of newspaper, information on Pilgrim's Progress (a play put on by the girls), etc. Sometimes it made a section of the text more clear; other times it just added color to the story. A very worthy choice for your library."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This is not an exciting book. But it gives a lot of insight about life, such as a positive attitude, selflessness, kindness and honor. It's got a lot of values and morals.

I usually finish novels in 2 or 3 days, but this took me about 2 weeks to finish, seeing as it's not that exciting.

I find myself relating to Jo, then to Beth, then to Meg, and rarely, to Amy. I understand these girls and feel as if they are my sisters. Marmee is my second mother. Professor Bhaer is my hot older intelligent German professor. Laurie is my tag along buddy. This story speaks to me. I'm so in love with it that words will not do them justice. This novel produces feelings so strong and sure. I bought this edition at BN for the full retail price. It's a beautiful linen cover and, unfortunately, I GOT A LITTLE NAIL POLISH ON ONE OF THE PAGES! Sorry, I had to vent. Anyway, I'm not sure why some people rate this as one star. This is certainly not an abridged version, there are no pictures, and it's definitely not written for children.

Lousia May used her childhood stories wrote this book. In the book there was Meg who was a really lady like Louisa's older sister Anna, there is Beth, who is my favarite, she may be sick, but she is a very nice girl; there was a Amy who love to paint, and of course there is the tomboy Jo, who may be a girl but a tomboy in her heart. This book tell the stories that the four March sister have while their father are away. They have some awasome advangers.

However, like many books I wish to read, I never got around to it until recently when I was required to read it for an adolescent literature class.LITTLE WOMEN was the book that brought Louisa May Alcott fame, fortune, and freedom. It has become an American literary classic and is probably more popular today than when it was first published. The story explores the lives of the four March sisters and the trials and tribulations they go through while growing up during the mid 1800's in the New England. The book is somewhat long, but easy to read. It contains many ethical and moral lessons. The book primary appeals to girls and women, but men can enjoy and learn from the book, too. The Penquin Classic edition of the text includes a rather dry introduction by Elaine Showalter.I thoroughly enjoyed reading LITTLE WOMEN. It has all sorts of great messages about faith, love, and life. It's a great book and I now know why it is Albert Peterson's favorite novel."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

Then there's the little women: sixteen-year-old Meg, who is pretty and mature; free-spirited, fiery Jo, who is determined to become a famous writer; timid Beth, who always puts others before herself; and young Amy with her artistic tastes and airs. There's also the March's lonely neighbor, Theodre Laurence (Laurie), who befriends the girls and supplements their experiences and family.MY REVIEW: This heartwarming story about four sisters growing up during the Civil War visits upon themes of family, transcendence, sincerity, and duty. In a novel based upon her own family and experiences, Louisa May Alcott chronicles the first of three books about the March family, which is the universal story of the family unit and the self in the face of the world: how each lives and how happiness prevails in morality and truth.Alcott's novel caters to all audiences, regardless of age and gender. As a children's book, as it is often placed, Little Women serves as a record of the coming-of-age of four girls as: Amy bears injustice at school, Jo struggles with personal, literary, and romantic issues, Meg faces society and Vanity Fair, and as life threats Beth's solitude. As a piece of classic literature, Little Women serves testimony to the emerging conscious and individual. It's impossible to resist the gentle lessons and the charming, dimensional characters that stimulate the reader to the same awakening and discovery of value."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This book is fantastic. I first read it in fifth grade and it still brings tears to my eyes and a smile to my face every time I read it. It stars the March sisters; Jo a tom boy writer who scribbles away and is a strong willed free spirit, while Beth is a sweet girl who never says a mean word to anyone, Meg is the motherly oldest and Amy is the childish youngest who must be surrounded by pretty things. It is a very touching story where four young girls become young ladies and their interactions with eachother and society. It is an utterly splendid story :)"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This is now my favorite book! The struggles that the whole family goes through touches me. It reveals how sorrowful and joyous a person can be in a matter of time. Happiness doesn't come with your wealth or belongings, but with your family and friends. I can relate to the girls in the different situations. The story made me laugh and made me cry! I would say it is by far better than the movies. The use of detail and description is beautifully done. I like how the language and story are so old fashioned and find myself using such dialect after reading it!

I can understand the many accolades the book has gotten from various writers (the afterward of the one I was reading, for example, was penned by Susan Straight) about the depiction of women, especially young women, as groundbreaking for its time. All well and good, but I couldn't get past the aggressive bucolic nature of the thing, which makes the Beany Malone novels seem as if they were written by Huysmans or Lautreamont (or Sartre or any other nihilist/existentialist you'd care to name). I have often wondered if there were a particular novel Melville were parodying in the hilarious opening pages of Pierre; it is obviously not Little Women, published some twenty-eight years after Pierre, but I can see where Melville was coming from anyway. (This was actually an accepted literary style of the time? How depressing.)You may ask what in the world I'm going on about (though I assume if you're a fan of the book you have an idea of what the word \\"bucolic\\" means without me having to explain it to you). It's this--no one in this book ever thinks a truly bad thought. No one could ever even consider doing a bad deed. These characters are squeaky clean. Have you ever, in your entire life, encountered a household with four female children (especially four female children being raised by two females, since dad's off to war) where there was no bickering? Ever? Where every small, unintentional slight was worked out by calm, rational debate? No. Of course not. Why? Because that household does not exist. It did not exist in 1880, and it does not exist in 2009. There are obviously those who can relegate that to the backs of their minds; I found it impossible. Thus, one more book fed to the dustbunnies in 2009. (zero)"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I haven't read this book &amp; probably should.

I was very skeptical going into it believing that this was more a book for little women than for big men. I have to admit that it was difficult for me. Their wasn't so much an enticing storyline, but rather a drawn out description and character development of the March sisters and their \\"march\\" into adulthood during the 19th century circa Civil War era. Little is really mentioned about the Civil War except noted that Mr. March served as a chaplain in it. What I did enjoy was the manner of which the March sister's exemplified an era where women prided themselves on fine etiquette, moral behavior, respect of family, the development of culture, and the role of keeper's of the home and hearth. The sister's were quite saintly, but not in a prudish way, but rather in an innocent and genuine way that is often lost in today's culture. I think that most young women today would find this book laborious, but I think it carries lessons that would be valuable to them. By the end of the book I was quite enamoured by the characters and longed for the past where character, poise, grace, and charm were sought after by young women, and young men."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Don't get me wrong.

My own copy, much loved and well thumbed, has been with me since I was a ten year old. I bought the Kindle version just to have it in my portable library, since I thought I knew it almost by heart. To my surprise, when I started looking it over, I found that the book was not the same at all. My original copy must have been &#34;modernized&#34; at some point. All of the familiar passages were there, but there was a great deal that I didn't remember reading before. Some of that was a specifically Victorian kind of moralizing, but there was also some expansion of the story.. I'm not sure that I would have appreciated it all when I was younger, but I found it a delight to read now, as an example of a book of its times. Now I'm going to download the rest of the Alcott catalogue and see how it compares to the books I thought were the originals when I read them many years ago. This was still an exemplary book. It will always be one of the classics."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I am a 14-year-old girl and just got around to reading Little Women about a year ago. It is a great American classic written by Louisa May Alcott. It is about the four March sisters: Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. They live in New England during the Civil War. They are poor, but they try to make the best of it as they grow and learn. We follow them through good times and bad as they, with help from Marmee and Laurie (their next-door neighbor), bear their own unique burdens. Meg's is poverty, Jo's is her temper, Beth's burden is not being able to play on a piano, and Amy's is her unaristocratic nose. (as funny as that sounds) You'll fall in love with Jo's oddities just as much as with Beth's gentil manners. It is a great book that everyone should read!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I was so, so looking forward to reading \\"Little Women\\" to my daughter, so she could be caught up in it as I was at an early age. I particularly chose the \\"Whole Story\\" edition because of its broad margins, easy-to-scan pages, and charming illustrations and margin notes that add historical texture to the story.Imagine my shock to discover that at the end of THIS edition, Jo has not written a book, Amy has not gone off to Europe, Professor Baer has not made an appearance of any kind and....you'll never believe this....Beth is still carrying on a conversation (I'm trying not to spoil the plot of the real thing here).That's because, apparently, \\"Little Women\\" was initially published in two parts (\\"Little Women\\" and \\"Good Wives\\"), which are generally published as the same book. Whole Story has chosen to stop at the half-way point, so much of the story you remember, loved, cried, and laughed over is just not here.Imagine getting only the first half of Tom Sawyer...leave him stranded on the island forever!I feel completely conned. It's a five-star story - make that maybe even a seven-star story - but it's a one-star edition."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I bought this perennial favorite to add to my barely-started collection of these tiny Collector's Library books (sadly, B&N; discontinued publication of these). I love that it's small and hardcover- perfect for traveling- especially for long hours on the plane or whatnot.I was a bit disappointed to find that this book contains only part I of Little Women, ending with Chapter 23 (\\"Aunt March Settles the Question\\"). It does not have Good Wives (aka part 2 of Little Women). Luckily, I have what I call my \\"home copy\\" of the book which has both parts...so I don't feel like I've made a mistake in purchasing this one. But I thought I'd let you know this book only features part I so that you know what to expect!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Please don't misunderstand me...I am NOT disparaging the original story of Little Women. The one star rating is for this particular edition of the book. I have loved this book all my life and having worn out my childhood copy, was hoping to get a new one. An UNABRIDGED copy!! This is not the original...words and whole phrases have been changed and added to this copy! If you, like I was, are looking for an original, untouched, UNABRIDGED copy of Little Women then bypass this edition!! I cannot even begin to tell you how disappointed I was!! I will be returning this copy and continue my search for a REAL copy of Little Women that hasn't had words changed, modernized, or \\"dumbed down\\"!!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Sure the story is great (as it would be with any version) and this version does have the nice print and book mark, however, the advertising suggested to me, at least, that there would be several illustrations. There were none except silly chests with each little woman's name engraved on them at the start of each chapter.Do not select this book if you are looking for an *illustrated* version. The Illustrated Junior Library version is well illustrated and at least as high quality a printing.By the way, read the sales copy above to see how misleading it is. Just for that reason, consumers should eschew this version, and Amazon should have them change it."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"As an unabridged edition, all of Alcott's words are there. The narrator, Sandra Burr, takes us through the classic work in a style that takes the listener inside the story. Voices for the different characters are all created, but never in a melodramatic fashion. Listening to the story is like watching a fine and faithful production"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"When people ask me how I became such an avid reader, my answer is because I read Little Women in High School. This timeless classic of four sister growing up during the Civil War is my all time favorite book and I do not even know how many times I have read it. I treasure my copy of this book and it is one I could never part with.Little Women is a coming of age story about four sisters Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy, and it always amazed me how Marmee would sit back and let them learn life's lessons and always find the right words to say to each of them afterward. Family values and morals as well are hard lessons to teach but through love and understanding they all learn.Jo is my favorite character, she is so vibrant and full of life and the character based on Louisa May Alcott herself. My favorite movie version of this movie is the 1933 version with Katherine Hepburn as Jo, she truly captured Jo's spirit.This story has been read by many generations and I'm sure that there will be many more generations enjoying the story of Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy for many many years to come."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Having not read Little Women in many decades, I was drawn back to the book by my love of visiting the Alcott family home, Orchard House, in Concord, Massachusetts. I plan to re-visit that wonderful home and want to refresh my recollections of Little Women before doing so. By the way, if you have a chance to visit Orchard House, I strongly recommend that you do. Your sense of Little Women will expand.As I re-read these delightful pages, I found myself comparing Little Women to Pride and Prejudice, that outstanding work that captures human psychology so well. The comparison made me see new depths in Little Women that convince me that Little Women is by far the stronger work.But my biggest reaction was how modern the views in the book are. Women should have education, access to opportunities to develop their interests and marriage to men who will complement them. People should be concerned about each other and help one another, lest any person's life be harmed or feelings hurt in the process.I also noticed how complete a community of loving women can be within the same family.The writing style is beautifully spare. The key point of a chapter may turn on two or three words. And then, everything changes in the twinkling of an eye.Being a long book, Ms. Alcott has plenty of chances to develop her characters and she does so beautifully . . . allowing Meg, Jo, Beth, Amy and Laurie to grow and change as they age.I also came to appreciate more the scope of the book, taking the young women from teenage years through the first few years of marriage. It's a time period that few books consider. Usually, it's all over when the marriage happens. I like this approach better.Should you read Little Women? Does the sun rise in the East?If you haven't read Little Women, you've missed great role models for how to be a parent, spouse and child.Here's the story in a nutshell: During the Civil War, Mr. March is away serving as a chaplain in the Union army. Mrs. March (Marmee) and her four daughters are at home in the cold north making do on small income with the help of one servant, Hannah. As the story opens, the March family is facing a frugal Christmas. But events soon take an unexpected turn and their hearts are filled with gladness. Jo makes an unexpected and most humorous acquaintance of the Laurence boy (Theodore, known as Laurie) who lives next door with old Mr. Laurance, his grandfather. The two families draw upon one another for strength and friendships grow. Illness intercedes making the two families even more dependent on one another. One by one, the children move into adulthood, deal with their romantic feelings and form their alliances.The characters of each child are quite different, allowing Ms. Alcott to explore the contrasts by putting them together in various private and social occasions. Meg is beautiful and much admired. She should attract many suitors. Jo is energetic, self-absorbed and talented in writing (the character closest to Ms. Alcott herself). Beth is very kind and yet fragile. Amy is the social climber in the family . . . and the pet. Laurie has an artistic temperament, but finds himself expected to play an heir's role.You'll long remember with delight the stories of their thespian performances, games, dances and social visits. Although the book makes up a wonderfully detailed novel, the chapters are written almost as stand-alone short stories that pack a powerful punch in their modeling of good behavior.What a joy!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"One of the novels that I have read this summer was \\" LITTLE WOMEN\\" by Louisa May Alcott. The characters in this book are Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. These girls and their mother are poor. Their father is also in the navy so he can't come home to see his family. I really liked this book because it shows that kids should be more greatful to their parents an d that you can never get everything that you want if your parnets don't have the money. One thing that I about the book was how the author declared that those girls' father was in the navy. I liked that she wrote that because it matches up to the fact that their family is poor.If i had to tell the author what to improve about the book is that she should maybe give more information ab out the mother and the housekeeper that lives with them. I would recommend this book to all the people that I know because it shows that people should be greatful about what they have and that they should respect the people that take care of them. I really enjoyed reading this book."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This timeless children's classic is read and enjoyed by many adults as well as children. Unlike most classics considered children's works today, Little Women was intended for an audience of children. It takes place during the Civil War and the years following, and narrates the story of 4 girls as they grow up, including their friends and their family. Louisa May Alcott based this work in large part on her family, although many of the events are born totally of her imagination. Jo is based on Louisa May; Meg is based on her older sister Anna; Beth is based on her younger sister Elizabeth, or Lizzie; and Amy is based on her youngest sister May. Because the character Jo is based on the author herself, she is the most well defined character in the book and the one most children identify with. A tomboy, a writer, and quite determined, Jo is the central figure in the book and most events center around her growing up, but all of the other girls get special attention in stories particularly about them from time to time.There is a great sense of morality in the work, but it is never treated in a 'preachy' manner. Values and morals are taught and absorbed by the reader as the girls learn them through various trials, some funny, some sorrowful, some frustrating. There is likewise a very strong emphasis on God. Much of the first half of the book centers around concepts found in the Puritan work, Pilgrim's Progress, by John Bunyan. The girls are often pointed by their mother toward God and placing their trust in Him and seeking His aid in various situations. Louisa May Alcott was also a transcendentalist and her family was close friends with Emerson, Thoreau, and Hawthorne. Because of this, there is a sense of joy found in nature as well as respect. In addition, Louisa May was an avid feminist in her day, although not in the sense of feminist that many think of today. She believed that women should not be barred from admission in the workforce, or limited to work as seamstresses or governesses, nor should marriage be their only avenue of insuring a stable and secure future. She did not get married, but did raise her sister May's daughter after May died. Little Women is definitely not anti-marriage, but some of the characters dream of becoming well-known in their favorite fields; also, some of the characters speak about how the only way they can insure a positive, pleasant future is by marrying well, which is later rejected in a way that asserts that women should be able to choose marriage freely for love, not for position or money and likewise free to choose not to marry.This book is well loved by so many. It spurs many children on to become strong readers for life and the childhood copy of Little Women will become worn from much loved reading. This book will be loved by most girls, but boys will enjoy it as well. Jo's tomboyish behavior and the neighbor boy, Laurie's presence will attract the attention of boys. It makes a great choice for bedtime reading with chapters of perfect length to read one per night and short enough that if begged by the kids, you can read two. In addition to Little Women, it would also be beneficial to read a biography of Louisa May Alcott.I strongly recommend an unabridged version. Don't miss out on the well-known sequels Little Men and Jo's Boys."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Rosemary R.ISBN:1-4027-1236-7I would recommend this book to anyone because of it's amazing qualities and meanings. The characters just all around have great qualities and are so loveable. It's a nice life story to read about. The genre is like a biography but not quite. It's a great old fashion book to read and shows the true meaning of family. It's a sure attention grabber! The Little Women have gone along way in their lives and will continue to live their lives to the fullest ability no matter if riches come or do not come their way."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This is a book that once you read it you will never forget it.

When I was in junior high, my mom and grandmother recommended I read it, but it sounded so dorky and old fashioned that I never gave it a try. Even my best friend whom I considered \\"cool\\" told me how great it was, but I didn't believe her. I saw the 1998 movie when I was about 22 and that led me to finally read the book.

It started off kind of \\"goody-goody\\" sounding and written for young adults. But I gave it a chance, and it paid off. As I got further into the book, I was hooked. I fell in love with the characters and kept turning the page to see what would happen next. It's a classic story for every woman. I enjoyed it so much I bought it for my 8-year-old cousin.The story is essentially about 4 sisters as they grow up.

It follows the trials and triumps of the close-knit family living in the Civil War era. The four March sisters manage, although fequently challenged, to remain close throughout time. From the very first chapter the unique character traits arise pretty, proper, and mature Meg, tomboy Jo who loves to read and write, shy and caring Beth who loves music and animals, and vain Amy with an artistic talent. They are as different as sisters can be, but their strong personalities bring them closer together. The family is held together by the loving parents who are devoted and fair. The parents work to mold their daughters into responsible young women by teaching them morality and love. It is very much a coming of age story, each girl striving to become a good woman, and tying to let go of their past. Even though it was written over a hundred years ago, modern readers can still relate to the story. The girls still fight, they serch for love, they deal with loss, they struugle with poverty and fitting in. The story teaches great morals that are as important now as they were when the book was written. The book teaches the value of family, the importance of self-improvement, and the truth that love can withstand all. It is a plot that will involve the reader, a book that you will not be able to put down. By the end of the novel you will feel like you know the Marchs personally and will want to read it all over again. This story has passed the test of time and is a beloved peice of literature that brings people together. It is a tale that has touched countless generations, and will continue to do so for many more."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Some books transcend the time in which they were written, because the truths they contain are simply timeless. Such is \\"Little Women,\\" a simple tale of four sisters in rural New England during the time of the Civil War.Yes, they wear long skirts, and yes, one is NOT seen at a ball without white gloves, and yes, there are horse-drawn carriages. But Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March are as modern in their simple desire to be themselves as any teen living in today's techno world. The hurdles the girls face seem tougher than the hurdles of today, but are they really? Meg, the oldest, is not the saint she appears. She secretly misses the money her family once had, and desperately wants to \\"fit in\\" with the in-crowd, in this case, the high-society milieu that has rejected the Marches because they are poor. She also wants to find a nice man and get married. Not so very different...Jo (Louisa May Alcott's fictional persona)constantly flies in the face of convention, finding the restrictions of being a woman in her time almost unbearable. A feminist long before there was a hint of such a thing, Jo wants to dress like a boy, have the freedom that men do, and think for herself. She largely succeeds.Amy is the 19th-century version of \\"Girls Just Wanna Have Fun.\\" She wears a clothespin on her nose each night so it will \\"turn up\\" and look pretty. She hoards her small pittance of an allowance so she can buy herself small trinkets. She is beautiful, selfish, but lovable deep inside.Beth, modeled after Alcott's real-life sister, truly IS a saint--and is martyred for it, having caught scarlet fever from a destitute family whose baby she tried to nurse back to health.All four girls struggle to live their lives while their father, a chaplain, is away at the War, and their mother is forced to do menial work to keep everybody fed. Family values are preached and preached again, but Alcott's \\"marmee,\\" the mother, is too human to be obnoxious. And the lessons of helping one another, living a good life, and making appropriate choices are not lost on the girls--or the reader.This is the perfect tale to read to your daughter, and I recommend the book before any movies (there are several wonderful film versions; my favorite remains the one that stars Katharine Hepburn as a simply fabulous Jo). To my way of thinking, \\"Little Women\\" is part of growing up. And deservedly so."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This is a great classic.

When I received my new Kindle Fire a few weeks ago, I downloaded some free books to test it out and among them was Little Women. I enjoyed the eloquent language and writing used. I had heard about this book many times over the years as a must-read chick-lit, but had never taken the time to do it. I even remember them talking about this book on an episode of Friends. Now I'm really glad that I've read it.The four Little Women are sisters in the March family, who has gone from fortune to working-class when their father became a preacher and went off to the War. At first, they regret losing their wonderful rich things and beautiful clothing, but through time and with their mother's coaching, they learn that money isn't as important as helping others and loving others.There are wonderful parts of the story that highlight each daughter's quest for marriage and grows into her own.

I set it down then, never realizing it would take this long to get back to it. Little Women is the story of four girls and their mom and dad during the Civil War. Their dad has gone off to minister to soldiers in the war and the girls and their mom are quite poor. Optimism is a key concept among the Marches, however, so you do not hear bellyaching or whining in this household. The girls find ways to entertain themselves with nary a Nintendo or tv. They continually renew their vow to keep a happy face and try harder to be good.

Even though the time period is way back when, it kept me interested."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This was one of my favorite books when I was little. I read it multiple times, and even held my own version of their Pilgrim's Progress roleplay. I hadn't read it for years, but when I got my Kindle for Christmas and saw this free version, I had to download it. The book is still as wonderful as I remembered (and some part of me still pulls for Jo and Laurie to get together, though I love Professor Bhaer, too). It's a gentle, quiet book filled with profound wisdom and loving relationships between family members. The path of growing up is never easy, but this book shows how for many, faith and family can be the underpinnings for a bright future."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"\\"Little Women\\" is so well written and accessible. I had only seen the movie before reading the book, and as with most all stories, the book is by far better. I felt as if I were a silent member of the March family. I laughed at Jo's antics, and cried at Beth's departure. I really think this book has encouraged me to be a genuinely better person. I feel challenged to hold my tongue and have patience and to show kindness. This is definitely a must read for everyone!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I love this book and the charming characters in it. The book is about girls growing up to be Little Women, and there journeys and lessons on the way. It's a great book but in a little to much detail for my opinion, but it was an old book and still is."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This book touched my heart.

A vivid book, edited competently."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I regret having put off this book as long as I did, but I must say that I did not like it as much as I thought I would. I guess I was thinking too often the movie I so loved (the 1994 version) since there was so much that had not been in the movie, making it more drawn out and boring at times. However I still loved the characters and the tale. I was not as awed by the ending either, since it seemed more drawn out than in the movie. Though this is not my favorite classic I find it a very important one, and will surely read it again in the future."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I loved this book when I first read it as a girl and I loved it even more the second time when I read it as an adult.

Especially when I don't want to pop for a kindle, just the iPhone app."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I must have read this book a dozen times before I graduated from junior high, but it is still a favorite of mine. Even after first reading it 15 years or re-reading it, I still cry when Beth dies, laugh when the sisters write and star in their own plays and pull for Jo as she makes a way for herself in a man's world. If you are looking for a perfect gift for a daughter or sister this rich story of the relationships between these young women is without a doubt a solid choice. It's also a winner if you are just looking for a great story to fall in love with and enjoy for years to come, this is a rare gem that will be more than worth the price. I can't recommend this book strongly enough. In fact I am beginning to read it again even now!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"My Mama used to read to us all the time, and this was and is still onbe of her favs."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"When my book club selected this book, I didn't want to spend alot of money on another copy since I had already read and thrown out 2 others.

The opportunity to play Aunt March in a local theatrical production spurred me to read the book again. And I'm so glad. First of all, I realized I had never read the complete story. I'm sure I read the illustrated abridged version that is usually read by young children (and the edition I just bought my 9-year-old granddaughter). The 500+ pages would have seemed a bit overwhelming when I was reading it the first time. I also realized that even though it is recommended for children ages 9-12, I would never buy this unabridged version for a child in that age group.That being said, I would have to say that this book is absolutely delightful. I loved the story 60 years ago, and love it even more now. At times I'm reading with a big smile on my face. Other times the tears are running down my cheeks (when Mr. Laurence gave Beth the piano and Meg's wedding as an example). I cherish every word. Miss Alcott gave each of the girls very individual and endearing personalities. Visions of them run through my head as I read. They are filled with such joy but at the same time experience more than their share of sadness and hardship.

The story, which I have read many times, is sweet and sentimental. I last read \\"Little Women \\" as a teenager, and now that I am a 40-something year-old mother and wife myself, I am frankly shocked by how touched I was by the effect that re-reading it had on me. The little words of guidance, maternal advice, and quiet examples of virtue and self-sacrifice take on new meaning and seem to reflect even more timeless wisdom now that I have some years of life experience myself. I believe stories such as this are exactly what is needed to help guide a new generation of girls toward a happier and more peaceful adulthood."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This is one of my favorite stories, it's very honest and kind, loving and hopeful.

I typically stick with murder/mystery books, but since this was a classic and was free, I decided to give it a try. I love it! The way Ms. Alcott developed these characters made me fall in love with them and think about them even when I wasn't actively reading the book.

It chronicles their life from puberty to adulthood and is a warmhearted tale about love and loss. I found it funny, the customs of courtship especially and laughed out loud often.The story is driven by a very lively dialogue, making it a quick read. The Characters are well developed, but as a history buff, I missed the events of the outside world, war, prejudice, politics... Though it does tell of the morals, customs, and decorum of the times in detail.A great book for girls and women. It illustrates how much the roles of women have changed. Written by Alcott in the time in which she lived, and I believe that her Character Jo may have been modeled on her own experience as a woman and a author."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I love it so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so much so that you have to get it."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This book went straight to my heart and I will never forget these life long lessons from these little women."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I like this book alot.

I may read it again!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This review refers specifically to the Penguin Classics edition of LittleWomen, as pictured, with the introduction by Elaine Showalter. If you area fan of this piece, or would like to read it for the first time, I wouldhighly reccommend this edition. I would not, however, read theintroduction until after the text itself has been read, since, as a rule,intorductions usually give something away (often times even quoting fromthe book itself) &amp; this one is no exception. However, this edition offersa marvelous set of endnotes which help the reader to better understandsome unfamiliar terms.Most importantly, however, is the fact that Showalter has chosen topresent Alcott's novel, IN ITS ORIGINAL FORM. The chapters have beenrenumbered to maintain coherence, however, every word is true to theoriginal. It may not be known (as I did not know myself until I happenedupon this edition purely by accident) that there are two editions ofLittle Women currently in print. The second being altered slightly, asper a publisher's request (to remove certain slang and change somelanguage to what was considered more proper). This edition contains theORIGINAL text, as Alcott intended it, &amp; the majority of versions I haveseen contain the altered version, making the original wording very hardto find, indeed.I would definitely reccommend that anyone interested in this bookpurchase this edition, you won't be disappointed!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"My mom bought me the book, Little Women, quite a few years ago. I'm a book worm and proud to admit it, but I didn't get around to reading this classic novel until a few weeks ago. I'm not sure why I put it off for so long, but I'm glad I didn't wait any longer. This a beautiful and rich tale that takes us to the past, where a whole different world awaits to be explored. Little Women is a must read!Little Women is the perfect story for the truly romantic person. Not just romance in the sense of love, but in the classical sense. Something being historical, timely, and good hearted. Little Women is full of the virtue and lessons that we try to find in our daily life. At the end, the reader is engulfed in happiness and satisfaction. Though not a deep, philosophical work, it provides its own morals, brought out in a way that can be enjoyed from generation to generation.The story centers around the lives of the 4 March sisters: Jo (Josephine), Meg (Margaret), Beth (Elizabeth), and Amy. Each sister possesses a unique personality with their mother as their link and loving companion. In the early part of this Louisa May Alcott novel, Mr. March is away at war and his daughters show concern for his welfare. It is said that Alcott didn't know what to do with the father's character so she wrote him as being gone to war. A genius solution to a literary block! Anyway, the story centers around the trials and tribulations of each girl and the family, as a whole. The family is poor, but still live to do good...or try to be good at least. Though it seems unrealistic that the family should be in bliss even in poverty, Alcott brings the fantasy level to ground level by portraying the girls as being a little selfish. With all the beautiful clothes and delicate manners, who could blame them for getting carried away with vanity. However, we also experience what lessons the girls have learned and appreciate their honesty. The family is not always going through pleasant situations, but take a share in heartache and loss, as every family does.In a time when modesty is not exactly a trend, Little Women sets a bar all on its own. It will warm your heart, even if you've already read the novel four hundred times. So, take some time out of your day to read the exhilarating trials of the \\"Little Women\\"."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I did not think that I would enjoy this book. After years of avoiding this paragon of femenine literature, I finally gave in and read it, and I'm glad that I did. This book is great. The author's use of language, the way that she writes is a pure pleasure to read. She also has her finger on the pulse of human character; I'm sure that is one reason this book is regarded as a classic. The characters experiences seem genuine and are truly touching. But for one glaring miss on the emotions of one character, I think the book is flawless and stands as a wonderful exposition on character and human relationships. I rate the book 4 and 1/2 stars, and would wholeheartedly recommend it to all the men out there that shy away from &quot;women's literature.&quot;"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Because of the reviews, I almost didn't read this book because I thought it must really be best suited for young teens. I'm so glad I bought it anyway. I found the characters so endearing and the story so full of emotion that this became one of my favorite books.

Then my mom told me I should read this book because I was going to love it. And she was totally right. The good thing about this book is that it is real. I have to admit it: I fell in love with the real characters. This book shows that life can be great with love. Louisa transmits feelings, and reading this book you feel happiness, sadness, and lots of stuff. My mom told me that she even cried when she read the book. The characters will become your imaginary friends and I'm sure that, after reading this book, you will see life in another way. In a few words: I love this book and I'm sure you will love it too."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"\\"Little Women\\" is like the best vanilla ice cream-simple, sweet, pure, and something that always seems good, no matter what else you read (or eat!). As most of you know, \\"Little Women\\" is the chronicle of the four March sisters (Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy) and their family, as they grow up in 1860's New England. Part autobiography, it is easy to see why it has become the classic it is.Sure, the \\"slang\\" is noticeably dated, the writing style is definitely \\"1800's\\", but the characters are what really makes this book great. Louisa May Alcott's chatty, graceful writing style is the epitome of warmth, and it definitely helps the characters to \\"come-alive.\\" Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy themselves are portrayed honestly, and the reader feels just like they are having a visit with the March as they read about Jo's highstrung good nature, Amy's hilarious \\"airs\\" and worries about her \\"un-Grecian\\" nose, Beth's good-as-gold sweetness, and Meg's gentle womanliness. The girls' struggles with poverty are gradually overcome throughout the book, and Marmee (as the girls call their mother) is a timeless beacon of love and lessons for the girls to take refuge in.\\"Little Women\\" is divided into two parts-I find the first to be (generally) slightly more well-written, and the second sometimes to be a little too long-winded and descriptive (the extensive descriptions and place names that chronicle Amy's European adventure are sometimes meaningless and boring to the reader). However, it is worth \\"plowing through\\" some less-than-choice chapters, for the end is pure gold, and the conclusion shows all of the sisters happy with their lives and reinforces the loving bonds of the March family.\\"Little Women\\" is truly a book that will make you laugh and cry. I would suggest that you be at least 12 before you read this alone (I usually don't give age ranges for books, but slight wordiness and some very involved passages are reason for it this time). Still, when confronted with the sheer warmth, honesty, and human emotion that come from the pages of \\"Little Women\\", it is easy to forgive some small faults."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I saw the movie first, but then I couldn't understand English(accent) as I do now.

You cry when their marmee have to go to their daddy, &amp; especially when Beth dies. You get angry when Amy burns Jo's precious dairy. And you will feel bad when Jo refuses Laurie and wish she hadnt done that. I still now wish Jo married Teddy. Meg is happy with John and I'm happy for her, also for Amy.

Their hardships,sorrows, and happy times is what this book is all about. Desciption is really good in Little Women. When the girls' father goes to war, the girls and their mother wait for a lette, that would never come. Overall, 3 stars is all this book gets, nothing more nothing less.

I purchased this for my spouse as a gift and she adores it."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Louisa May Alcott's LITTLE WOMEN is a classic novel about the four March daughters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, who live in New England at the time of the American Civil War. The book was originally published in two parts in 1868 and 1869; the first part concerns the girls while their father is away serving as a Union chaplain and the family is suffering financial hardship; the second half follows the girls as they marry, encounter tragedy and celebrate love. I recently read LITTLE WOMEN in the Sterling edition to my ten-year old daughter.The story holds up quite well 150 years after first publication. The first half is more accessible to pre-teen children. It isn't quite as reflective as the second half, which ponders more the trials of life. Understandably, the challenges of courtship and of married life aren't perhaps so compelling a topic for the pre-teen set. Moreover, the second part gravitates towards the melodramatic; it doesn't always ring true. The first half, on the other hand, engages the reader by deftly defining the attributes of each of the sisters: Meg, the responsible one; Beth, the sensitive one; Jo, the tom-boyish writer; and Amy, the girly-girl artist. The strong bonds between the girls are developed in the first half, and more just seems to happen, especially since their wealthy next-door neighbor Laurie, a friendly boy who is equal parts good hearted and playful, is an object of endless fascination to them. It's not surprising that children's adaptations focus more on the first half of the book.As one might expect, the novel does engage in moralizing. Each one of the children has to overcome defects in her character; Jo, for instance, is hot tempered. The lessons are just obvious enough to young readers, though they might be a little hackneyed for the modern adult reader. However that may be, one can be assured that the book promotes traditional family values. It is also refreshingly progressive--for a nineteenth-century novel--on the role of women in society; the daughters are not expected to set aside their personal goals for their husbands.

Amy, the youngest and fiercest, would marry for wealth. Jo, fits in her own category. These historical \\"little women\\" are an inspiration.In my eyes the girls should be read by all. The second I began reading this miraculous piece of work my fingers began to cramp for they were turning the pages of my book much quicker than I had predicted. The friendships and relationships this book has to offer are so much fun to read about, especially anybody who has been a 12 year old girl.Louisa May Alcott uses a wonderful narrative voice to tell the story. She also has very good character development in the beginning she shows you Meg, Amy, Beth, and Jo; you can practically feel the wind rushing through your hair as you gallantly stride in and out of the pages.The work of this incredible author, Louisa May Alcott, is truly inspiring, those of you who want to read a flawless book sprint to your local library or bookstore and pick up a copy of Little Women."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, from her \\"blood and thunder\\" tales to heartwarming novels about teens growing up.But there's something special about \\"Little Women,\\" a fictionalized account of her own family's growing pins.

Together they have many good and bad experiences, but all of them they will never forget. It is perfect for young adults, especially &quot;Little Women&quot; who are growing up, because of the experiences it deals with. With every turn of the page, there is a new adventure to be found. The book is so brilliantly put together that you won't even want to put it down. There are new situations and lessons to be learned after each chapter. The story relates it's situations to some that actually happen in everyday life. For example, the way Amy wants to look perfect all the time, and the way Jo acts like a tomboy. Through all the obstacles in the girls' lives, they always stick together working everything out, and never giving up.

Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

I am such a man. A few months ago I read Pride and Prejudice, although to be fully honest, the reason I read it was so that I'd appreciate Pride & Prejudice and Zombies more. There are certain books that I feel should be read by everyone. This is one of them. It's classic literature and has stood the test of time.That being said, I can't say that I particularly enjoyed reading it. Was I on the edge of my seat wondering if Meg would learn how to make fresh jam or not to spend her husband's earnings on frivolous things? No. Did I cry when Beth was on death's doorstep with Scarlet Fever? Not quite. Was my heart warmed when Jo sold her hair to help with the family's finances while their dad was away at war? Please. Nevertheless, it's an excellently written book. I can see why it's considered a classic. But before I'd be able to read another book like this, say Jane Eyre or something, I'd need to read 25 or so books for pleasure."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"The book starts out with four teenagers, tells the story of them growing, until the four girls become little women. The four girls have very different personalities. While they are growing, many things happen to them. Here are four explanations of the four little women:The oldest and probally the most important to talk about is Meg. She loves to play with her sisters and to take care of them. She gets married (first) to Mr. Brooke the tudor.The second oldest is one year younger than Meg, named Josephine. She is a tomboy whom is a very great author. She is feircly independant, and likes people to call her 'Jo'.The second youngest is Beth. She is a little girl with a very shy personality, and loves music. (By the way, I was suprised of the fate to one of the girls...)The most young of the children is Amy. She is a very selfish, prissy, bossy, and artistic.

Any young woman with the slightest interest in reading would certainly be able to identify with at least one of the four unique sisters, and as I child I was fascinated by the predicaments and adventures of their lives- and convinced that I was in love with Laurie, their charming yet complex \\"boy next door.\\" This story has not lost its charm because of its powerful illustration of female (obviously, sisterly in particular) relationships, as Alcott emphasizes their commitment to each other even as they grow in separate directions and face adversity. There's a reason why it became a classic...don't pass it up."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"If recommending a classic novel to someone who wants to read examples of good writing, no recommendation would be complete without the addition of Little Women, and the four March sisters; Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. It is a story about the devotion of these four young sisters to each other, to their family, and to their friends. No matter what the age, all of us must learn to endure the obstacles that life will throw us. So it is in this story. Although originally written in 1898, this novel transcends time. Alcott weaves the story of these sisters as they search for love, security, peace, and happiness. \\"Christmas won't be Christmas without any presents,\\" grumbled Jo, lying on the rug. So begins this richly written story. Even if you have seen the movie, do try reading this beautiful classic. Perhaps we can learn a thing or two from a classic writer.It transcends all time. It doesn't matter if the time frame is the late 1800's; good writing is good writing, which should lead to good reading. Louisa May Alcott was so ahead of her time in writing about spirited, independent women in a time when it was not fashionable to be so. If you liked this book, you may want to refer to other books by Alcott, but I still believe this is by far her best."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Little women is a book for all ages.

The way the sisters lives turned out was way different than they thought but they still lives happily."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"A very early reader, I received a copy of \\"Little Women\\" at age 7. From the very first time I read this lovely book, I fancied myself as Jo, and so thoroughly identified with her that even through all the succeeding decades and thousands of other books read, this book will remain one of my top five favourite books because of her. I read and reread this book sitting in a big apple tree in my parent's back yard, laying on the grass on a summer's day, and under the sheets with a flashlight I now suspect my parents knew I had stashed under my bed.In an age of easily digested and mass-produced books with weak characters and plot, \\"Little Women\\" is a stand-out that resists the passage of time for its exemplary characters, theme of family unity, and love on so many different levels (friendship, familial, true love, and romantic love).Readers today might find the writing and occasional chirpiness of the March sisters when faced with their poverty a bit difficult to relate to, but knowing stories of how my own mother and sisters faced the Depression and then WWII in the UK made me realise from an early age that trying to find things to rejoice in is essential to surviving tragedy and loss on a personal level.The March sisters encapsulate female society in most countries even now, and are well-written individual characters, each with a different goal they wish to fulfil in life. The girls do not become career women, and their parents do preach the importance of family life and sacrifice, however, each one does what was expected of young girls at that time. Jo's daring in writing a sensationalist \\"man's\\" story and insisting on payment commensurate with a man was unheard of in those days and when one considers that women are still underpaid, it makes Jo's triumph still relative today. Amy's goal of being comfortably well-off is eventually tempered by her own personal sorrow at the poor health of her own little Beth, Meg wants to be a mother and wife, and she learns not to overachieve, and Beth who overcomes pathological shyness through her altruism and empathy for others and which leads to her death is still inspirational today.My suggestion is that if you have a daughter, sister, granddaughter or friend, take turns reading it. It will improve your vocabulary, make you smile, and dear Beth's stoicism will bring a tear to your eye."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Little Women was one of my favorite books as a young adult.

I enjoyed how the author managed to make the book readable to people of all ages even though it was about children. Also, I approved of the theme-- the satisfaction that simple virtues can bring, even if you must sacrifice greater ambition to acheive it. At least, that is the message I took from this book. Additionally, Beth's character and death were beautifully and compellingly written. The one problem I had with the book was the style of narration; it was written in first person with the author referring to herself. This made it hard for me to lose myself in the story, as I kept getting dragged back to reality by the author herself mentioning how the story was a story. This was annoying, to say the least. All in all, I recommend this book, as it becomes even more relevent in today's pleasure-loving mindset, as the characters do their duties wholeheartedly. A good, homelike, virtuous book."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Great classic read.

There were some formatting issues, such as many paragraphs being completely indented, but that's formatting, not content."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Little Women is the first novel by Louisa May Alcott, written in 1868, and the first of the Little Women series. The story involves the four March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy, their mother, Marmee, their neighbour, Laurie and his tutor, Mr Brooke, and is set at the time of the Civil War. Their father, Mr March, is away ministering at the war and his absence looms large for the family, whose circumstances are much reduced due to an unwise investment some years ago. Mrs March works dispensing charity to the poor and those affected by the war and does her best to hold together her family; sixteen-year-old Meg, who remembers how is was when they were better off and loves fine things, works as a governess, teaching the King girls; fifteen-year-old Jo, a budding writer, is employed as a companion for the formidable Aunt March; shy, thirteen-year-old Beth, the musical sister, helps at home while eleven-year-old wilful Amy, whose vocation is art, attends school. While the first chapter introduces a family that seem sickeningly good, each character soon enough becomes human, flawed and likeable for their individual faults and charms. As the war, penury and scarlet fever impact on their lives, each of the March girls has her own trials, faces challenges, learns lessons about vanity, selfishness, anger, change and love from the events of life and matures during the course of the twelve months over which the novel is set. The lessons may seem simplistic, but perhaps these were simpler times. After some time ago reading March, the excellent novel by Geraldine Brooks about the absent March father, I resolved to reread this novel. With only the vaguest of memories of the last reading, the plot and characters seemed relatively fresh. This very enjoyable and thought-provoking read now spurs me on to read Good Wives, and back to reread March."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I was skeptical about reading such a feminine book but after a few chapters I was hooked. The characters have such depth and they bare all their trouble with a kind of strength that you'd never expect from young women. All the girls are tremendously well developed, and the story touches on nearly every vice and nearly ever virtue.It's a tremendous story of love and growth that I would recommend to any one. The relationships between characters are complicated and multifaceted: making the girls seem so real you'd expect to meet them on the street."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This was one of my favorite novels as a child.

I read this book as a school assignment, and had to read it in one week. I'm eleven, so it wasn't too hard to finish it before the due date ,but it was really good, and some of the parts in the book made it worth it. I liked Jo the best because she was really tomboyish, which was nice and different from all the other characters. For all of the people who read Little Women I recommend reading The Diary of Anne Frank, because it.... well, actually it doesn't really have to do with Little Women at all. I guess it's just a really good book. The part I liked most in Little Women was when, at the end, everyone got married and was happy! Well, almost everyone. Beth didn't."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I read Little Women as a girl and loved it so I was excited to have the opportunity to review an audio production of the book. However, I was quite surprised when the audio book abruptly ended in the middle of the story. I discovered that Little Women was originally two volumes: Little Women and Good Wives. They were first published together as one book titled Little Women in 1880. Most versions of Little Women published today are both volumes together in one book. This audio recording is just the first volume. Because what most people read as Little Women is actually both volumes, I feel like there should have been some indication on the box somewhere that this audio book does not include the second volume.(I don't want to spoil it for anyone who may not have read it yet so I'll say this - remember the Friends episode when Rachel convinces Joey to read Little Women? And he has to put the book in the freezer because of one particularly sad part? This audiobook ends before that sad part happens.)Even though this book was written more than one-hundred years ago, it still has relevance today. I think that the four March girls and Marmee have some good lessons to teach young girls that are timeless. Reading it now as a mother myself, I marveled at Marmee's patience and wisdom. I could learn a lot from her! I was very impressed at how independent and free-thinking the girls and their mother were given the time period the book was written in and took place. (Of course, Louisa May Alcott was a Unitarian so I shouldn't have been surprised at that.)Lorelei King narrated this audio book. I thought she did a great job for the most part. The two voices I didn't like were Beth and Amy's. I thought Beth's was too breathy and Amy's was too babyish - they didn't sound realistic to me. Overall, I enjoyed this audio production. My biggest complaint is that it left unexpectedly hanging at the end."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I enjoyed it a lot. All of my sisters had read it but me and I wanted a little fun reading it was great funny, sad, and a great ending"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"First, this is not a review of any abridged version of the book. That book is garbage, and you should not buy it, regardless of the illustrations.Second, why is this book good? It's not particularly well written, for example. And there aren't a lot of deeper layers. Yet somehow it is good; but not just good. It's great. One of the great early American novels. So I guess it is the story itself, that of the timeless March sisters. Applicable to every family, every girl, and maybe every childhood. First fantasies, first loves, and first disappointments.One of the things I like most about this book is the unpleasant turns it takes regardless of the reader's wishes -- thus reflecting life itself. We want Beth to recover, but she does not. We want Jo and Laurie to marry, but that doesn't happen. Or at least for neither to be complete without the other. But again, no. Life does not cohere like that, and neither does this story. The dead remain stark dead and the \\"true loves\\" find other loves that they ultimately find truer. And that is striking; very realistic, very wonderful. Also probably why this story works better than Little Men, which was not based as much on reality.Some postscript notes: the earlier parts of the book are best, before we become depressed by the dual disappointments. It peaks when it tells about Beth's final days, that poor, gentle soul. I'm pretty hardened, but that got to even me -- well, a little, anyway."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I got this for free for reading on my Kindle and I just LOVE being able to read it whenever the mood strikes, wherever I may be.

Each character is unique and special and believable.Each entertwined story is as interesting as the next, you truly don't wish the story to end.Again, if you've never read a 19th century classic before, Little Women will grab and hold you throughout the entire book.L.W. is appropriate for all ages and especially &#34;tweens&#34; may receive a positive lesson in ambitions and decorum by enjkoying the way life was for their ancestors 150 years ago.This is an all-aroud 5-Star book any age girl won't want to put down.."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I loved that each of these characters had faults, recognized them and worked through the entire novel to grow and essentially conquer those faults.

Really lovely!!!!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This is a heartwarming tale of four sisters growing up in their mother's house in (I believe) New England. We follow the girls through their teens and into marriage and (in some cases) motherhood. Obviously intended mainly for young women, this is not a book to buy for your brother or boyfriend. It is, however, a fascinating look at life in another era, before everything got complicated. I was just as devastated as any of the characters were when tragedy struck. This novel is followed by Little Men, in which Jo and her new husband open a home for runaway boys, and Good Wives, in which the sisters are all grown up and married. You won't regret taking a trip back in time and watching the girls fall in love, lean on each other and learn what life is about"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"It was such a pleasure to meet the sisters as they were created by the aurthor. At first you feel like it was written to teach young girls their morals, but it is so much more. Ms Alcott's reflections on relationships still hold true today. For a period book, the writing is very smooth and clear enough for our generation to understand. In fact, it actually helps you to get closer to the era."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I read this book when I was a little girl and I love it as much now as I did then.

This is a definite must read!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"A timeless tale that has a special place in all of our hearts, Little Women. The magical story of four girls having adventures while they lay in wait for their father to come home from the Civil War. In this tale, Meg, the eldest, marries Mr. John Brooke, Teddy's tutor, and has the life she always wanted, like her mother. Meg moved down he road from her family, and had twins, Demijohn and Daisy, becoming the model mother she always wanted to be. After Jo had \\"scorned\\" Teddy's love for her, Teddy went off to Europe to sulk. Around that time, Beth was getting weaker. With all this stress, Jo went away to New York. There, she met Professor Bhaer. She fell in love with him as he helped her to cultivate her writings, helping her to write a book based on her childhood. He promised her that he would help her get it published. Beth was getting sicker and sicker, so Jo went home to help Beth. Beth died in Jo's arms. Professor Bhaer came to the March's doorstep to give Jo her published book. He asked Jo to marry him, she said yes. When Aunt March died, Jo inherited her plantation. She realized, I love boys, why not fill this house with boys that she would grow to love. So the plantation became \\"Jo's School for boys.\\" The rooms were filled with the boys that she loved very much. Amy went abroad with Aunt March to help cultivate her art. There she met the crabby, snobbish, horrid side of Teddy that had come out because of Jo's answer. The more time they spent together in Europe, the more time they got to grow to love each other. They were married in Europe and Amy got the wealth and prominence she longed for as a child. This book is a wonderful tale for all. We all should read this book in our life. It belongs in our lives.This book had very detailed characters. Teddy is so detailed in the book, and you can actually hear them talking and his point of view on things. When Teddy got in a fight with Mr. Laurence, his grandfather, about going to college, he was so mad that when Jo meekly knocked on his door, he fired a mean insult and threatened to hurt his grandfather if he knocked one more time. Amy, at times, can be very nice in the story, but other times she was lying to make herself seem bigger than she was, and would even the score pretty well. When Jo, Teddy, Meg, and John Brooke went to the theater, Amy begged and pleaded to go, but Jo was firm, when she said no, she meant no. As they were leaving, Amy yelled at the top of her lungs to Jo, and said, I will get you back! (Not the exact words) When they came back from the theater, Jo wanted to write, but she could not find her book. She asked around, and then saw Amy watching the fire burn her book! Jo started yelling that she hated her and never wanted to talk to Amy ever again. Amy never even said she was sorry. Jo gets very fired up when something bad happens to one of her friends or family. When Amy was in school, she got in trouble, and the teacher struck her hand, and she had to stand up in front of the whole class, humiliated. When Jo heard about this, she was yelling, writing nasty letters, and was thinking about go down there and giving that teacher a piece of his mind.This story was very realistic. When Meg received John Brooke's invitation to wed, she refuses. Again and again, John asks, but she still says no. Rich, snobby Aunt March \\"overhears\\" and commends Meg for making such a decision, because John is dirt poor and money is one of the things that makes marriage run smoothly. Meg is appalled that Aunt March would say that. Aunt March also said that if she didn't marry in wealth, she would be cut out of her will. Meg tells Aunt March off, and tells her that John is a kind; caring, man and He would love her whether she was dirt poor or a princess. Then she realizes that she does love John, and she accepts the invitation to wed. Jo was asked to wed by Teddy, but she said no. The reason she said no was because they would always fight, like they did, with both of their tempers, they would never have a calm, cool, and collected argument, and they would never be really happy. Of course, Teddy did not understand at the time, but what Jo was trying to say was that she didn't want to be trapped in an unhappy marriage. Lastly, when Professor Bhaer proposed to Jo, He told her that his hands were empty. That meant that he would not have any money and could never buy the things that she would like. She replied, that his hands weren't empty anymore, and then she put her hands in his. This meant that she didn't care whether he had money or not, as long as he loved her, for she never cared about money, social status, or new clothes. She just loved Professor Bhaer.This book was very long. I loved this book, but she kept explaining every single little detail. When Beth died, she didn't just die, she died with an expression on her face. An expression that showed that she was content and ready to die, because she knew that there was nothing that the doctor could do. An expression that sent Jo into crying uncontrollably when Jo died. An expression to make Hannah, the Marches \\"live in cook\\", into sobbing while she was cooking, and saying \\"Too young, she was too young. She had so much strength left. See what I mean? When Amy burned Jo's book she was writing, Jo kept thinking about it, which made her even madder. When Jo and Teddy went ice staking on the pond, Amy came, but Jo and Teddy ignored her. Then, Amy fell under the ice. After that, Jo beat herself up over being mean to Amy, she even thought about either running away, or being Amy's eternal servant. When Jo was apologizing to Amy, tears were flowing and flowing down her face, and, one half of the chapter was about Jo regretting ever being mad at her. During the book, Demi, Meg's son, would get out of the bed during the night to be with his mother. John would not allow this, so every time he got up, John would take him back to his room, talk to him about why he should not get up and pop his bottom. This would go on for pages and pages without any progress. Finally, he stopped.This book is for everybody. I suggest for those to have the patience to read a book this long, I quite enjoyed it for it was a challenge; to read it and meditate on the lessons it shows usB. Rimando"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I have a very special place in my heart for this book, & not only because I really learned to LOVE reading as I enjoyed this book for the first time, but also because of its characters & heart-warming story. It truly is a coming of age tale of the March sisters & their unbreakable bond through all of the tough times that life places before us.In my opinion, this book was very relateable with situations that many of us as readers have encountered. For me, it was very nice to see such a close-knit family who loves each other so much, as opposed to the broken family homes turning up in novels so often today. (And don't get me wrong, I know how important it is to portray the 'broken' homes too-I come from one myself.)Another reason why I loved this book was because of the warm & endearing bond that the March sisters shared. I never had a sister & having the chance to peek into such a relationship between these sisters was very much so enjoyable for me.This novel is well-written & has obviously withstood the test of time for it is just as well-loved now as it was five, ten, or twenty years ago!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"When i was sixteen, my favorite book in the world was little women. i identified very much with jo march, a tomboyish girl who loves to read, go for \\"larks\\" with her best friend (the neighbor, a boy named laurie), has a short temper and dreams of one day becoming a published author.i longed for the companionship jo had with her three sisters, the short \\"romance\\" and the longterm firendship she had with laurie, her sucess as a writer, and finally, her romance with the german, Professor Bhear.this book is comical, witty, and has a wonder and warm sense of family life for those of us who hunger and thirst for love and belonging."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This book is a classic favorite, especially for girls from the age of about 11-14 (depending of the reading level of the girl). Its made all the better for this age set because there are sequels- \\"Little Men\\" and \\"Jo's Boys\\" which continue the saga of the March sisters. The lives of these girls is related in an exciting way- sometimes gently moralizing (19th century middle class Protestant Christian values), sometimes sad, sometimes innocently romantic. The book is a good gift for any young girl who likes historical fiction, and has always been a treasured hand-me down in our family."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I have read Little Women nearly annually since I was 8 years old. The story never ceases to amaze me. As a youngster, I related to the tomboy Jo. As a new wife, I laughed out loud at Meg's attempts to make jam. Although I know it is going to happen, I never fail to cry when Beth's &quot;tide goes out easily&quot;. Now that loss has touched my life as an adult, the story becomes even more poignant. I gave this book as a gift to my oldest &quot;little woman&quot; in the hopes she loves this book as much as me."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I read Little Women many times as a pre-teen. I would re-read and cry over the passage where Laurie comes home married to Amy. Now, 25 years later, I recently decided to read it again. It is even better now, reading it with an adult's perspective. The characters are so deeply developed, their Christian faith plays a big role in their lives, the wives they become.....it is even better than I remembered and I'm not even sure why it is considered children's literature. Good for all ages!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"The first part of &quot;Little Women&quot; is an innocent portrait of girlhood (at a time when 16-year-olds, could still be girls without any hurry to grow up). Each March girl has her own burden to carry, trial to overcome, and castle in the air to wish and work for. Meg has to keep her head from being turned by rich friends who dress her up in their finery at their &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; and make her feel ashamed for coming from a poor family. Beth has to overcome her fear of crotchety Mr. Laurence so that she may enter the &quot;Palace Beautiful.&quot; Amy has to pass through the &quot;Valley of Humiliation,&quot; and learn to humbly admit her wrong. Jo has to subdue &quot;Apollyon&quot; (the &quot;Dark Angel&quot; in abridged versions), swallow her pride and learn to forgive and forget the destruction of her most prized possession.Of course, every step of the way, Marmee gives counsel, comfort and encouragement; and their neighbor Laurie adds fun and mischief like only a boy--and an honorary brother--can.Louisa May Alcott constantly alludes to &quot;The Pilgrim's Progress&quot; by John Bunyan. She also has an entire chapter that sees the March girls impersonate characters in a Charles Dickens novel. Yet none of this is above the heads of young readers, who can take each episode in the March girls' play in stride. Children's fun is universally understood.I am never tired of rereading this part.The second half of the novel (which is actually &quot;Good Wives&quot;, the sequel of the original &quot;Little Women&quot;) is very different. More serious, it shows the girls growing up and getting married--or passing on to another world. If Book 1 told stories of the golden morning and afternoon of childhood, Book 2 has stories of the dark night of maturity. Despite its funny and light-hearted parts, the bittersweet thought that childhood is now far away lingers in the air. (After Book 2, &quot;Little Men&quot; was a relief--proof that the sun always rises on the next generation of children.)There are few classics I consider as timeless as Louisa May Alcott's novels about the March family."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Hi I;m Amanda.

Little Women is based on Alcott's life at home with her sisters, mother and father, but is in no way a biography. She transforms personal disappointment and loss into a story of close family love, personal growth, moral duty and fulfillment.The writing is humorous, sentimental, a bit moralistic (which was the style at the time--the height of the religious revival in America.) The characters are true--because they were taken from Louisa's own sisters and parents. \\"Laurie\\" may be David Thoreau, a neighbor for whom Alcott may have had an unrequited love.This is one of my favorite novels. I loved it as a child and I love it still."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This is my favorites. This book is about four sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy.

It's a great book that reads all too quickly. It's very strongly emotioned,so just about the only people I wouldn't recommend it to are people who are ashamed to cry! Other than that,I think it's the perfect book for anyone above the fourth grade level!!! It's got all the ups and downs of a great roller coaster;except sometimes the cars collide on this roller coaster, and you don't know whether to laugh hysterically, or to ball your eyes out! Among other things, I loved the characters! They were very well written and easy to relate to. The best thing about this book (to me, anyway)is that it's about life. It's about how it feels to grow up, to be a woman, and to deal with more hardships than I can count! It's better than any soap opera or movie, so what are you doing just sitting there on your computer?!? Log off, shut down and read!!!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"MAY17,2001YES, I HAVE READ lITTLE WOMEN. I ENJOYED THE BOOK BECAUSE FOR ONE IT WAS DURING THE TIME OF THE CIVL WAR TIMES,AND BECAUSE IT WAS ALMOST LIKE READING ABOUT MY SISTERS."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"From the very first time I read Little Women (at about age 9) it immediately and firmly established itself as one of my ultimate-favorite-forever books. As a young girl I took immediately to Jo, and from that moment on wanted to become a writer. I remember even attempting to write a story about girls using the same formal, slightly-affected-19th century style as Alcott (blushing). I soon outgrew that, but the desire to be a writer never left and even still hasn't quite died in me, although life has gotten in the way and I doubt that I will ever write a book.Yes, Little Women is old-fashioned, sometimes affected and often moralistic -- particularly in the first half -- with a strong emphasis throughout on \\"being good\\" and Marmee turning practically every event in their lives into a teachable (lecturing) moment for her daughters. And yet, for all that it remains firmly ensconed as not just one of my favorites, but as my ultimate comfort read. There is just something so warm and soothing about this sweet, sentimental and often funny story of a close-knit family in simpler times and its gentle but insightful look at many aspects of human nature.And now thanks to this wonderful audio version (which I have listened to twice already -- I can't even count the number of times I've read a printed version) I have a new way to enjoy this much-loved classic. Recorded Books always uses excellent narrators, and Barbara Caruso is no exception.Now if I could only get my hands on audio versions of Little Men and Jo's Boys, so I could once again enjoy those favorites, also...."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I read this book when I was very young and I was surprised to find it held up as well for me as it did when I reread it.

As a nearly 50-year-old woman, I thought I would find it childish and boring, but instead I was in turns fascinated, intrigued and charmed. Accounts of everyday life as lived in the time of the Civil War in Concord, Massachusetts were every bit as fascinating as Pride and Prejudice. In particular, it was intriguing to hear how women spent their time forever mending clothes, cooking and cleaning. The explanations of how young women were expected to act toward the opposite sex were interesting, too. I also caught glimpses of myself, very young, reading the book for the first time. There were actually passages that I distinctly remember reading, for instance, I know I identified completely with Jo, who preferred to spend her time reading and writing, didn't want to cut her hair, and who wanted to simply be \\"one of the boys.\\" This is one novel I will be passing along to my two young nieces, as a piece of Americana that will never go out of style."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I bought this book for my girls and we all love it!!Hours of good reading.

You will be caught in the relatinship between Jo and Laurie."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Little Women is a wonderful classic, worthy of a space on anyone's bookshelf - especially with this version's beautiful binding."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"very timely delivery. got for granddaughter and know she will love it. every young girl should read this book."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"My first actual introduction to Little Women came from watching the Winona Ryder version of the film on a snowy, beautiful day in New England during my sophmore year of high school. I immediately fell in love with the movie and tracked down the book in my library. I read a few pages of it, couldn't get into it, and brought it back to school unread. And that was that (sadly this happened with a few classics that weren't required of me). I ultimately decided that I should give Little Women another shot due to my love of the film. I'm so glad I did.Okay, sure some of the views in this book (one being that a woman's worth was determined on how well she kept house) did prick my feminist nerves a little bit, but I did keep in mind that this was a wildly different time than the one I live in now. The book was a bit on the preachy side, but Little Women had such a humble and homey feel to it that I really didn't mind being preached at most of the time.Now, on to The Little Women...I was endeared by all of the characters in this book (Marmee, Hannah, etc.), but of course I was mostly endeared by the little women (and Laurie). I just loved Meg, Beth, Jo, and Amy (to some extent, at least). My favorite was definitely Jo. She was just so strong, independent, and marched to the beat of her own drum. And I adored her relationship with Laurie. When I finished the film, I remember thinking (HUGE SPOILER FOR THE END HERE) \\"Laurie ends up with Amy?!??!? What a rip-off!\\" Even while reading the book, I kept hoping that I would turn the page and Jo would end up with Laurie.On the one hand, I thought that Jo and Laurie were perfect for each other, but on the other hand, I loved that they had such a strong friendship that not even unrequited love could ruin it. However, I still don't like that Laurie ended up with Amy. Out of all the sisters, she was the one I was least endeared by. I would've loved nothing more than to drop her down a peg or two (or six). However, nothing can be done about it at this point. The fact that I'm so into whom should end up with whom just shows how attached I am to Little Women. (END OF SPOILER)So, I absolutely loved and adored Little Women. I found it to be one of those classics that's just incredibly easy to read that even those whom don't have much experience in reading classics (like me) can understand the language without much difficulty. Little Women was just an adorable and sweet book that I know I'm going to re-read this book for years to come."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I really liked this book sooo much! Sometimes the way the language was back then, i had a little bit of a hard time understanding it, but all in all what a wonderful story, and i fell in love with all the sisters in the novel! Great read!!!!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"\\"Little Women\\" by Louisa May Alcott has been undervalued for most of its history. This book is a true American Classic. Published originally in October of 1868, it is a story set during the Civil War, but Alcott does not deal with the specifics of the war. Instead, it serves as the pretext for the absence of Robin March, the father of the four \\"Little Women\\", for a large portion of the first book. The novel today actually consists of two books, the original \\"Little Women\\" from 1868, and the sequel \\"Good Wives\\" which was published the following year in April of 1869. The two volumes started being treated as one in 1880.The first book deals with the growing maturity of the four sisters, and in particularly of Jo and Meg as they have to learn to help their mother out more and do with less during the war, and while their father is away. Meg is the eldest at 16 when the story begins, and Jo (who clearly represents the author) is 15. There is then a gap of a couple years with Beth being just 13 and Amy 12. Their lives transition from that of young girls to young women, and each sister has her own unique traits. Margaret \\"Meg\\" with her beauty is following the traditional path in entering society and heading towards marriage. Josephine \\"Jo\\" is attracted by intellectual pursuits, in particular reading and writing. Elizabeth \\"Beth\\" is very shy and demure. She is also a peacemaker between the sisters, and enjoys helping others. Sadly, she also falls sick and never fully recovers from scarlet fever. Amy is the baby, and likes to tag along with others. She is also used to getting her own way.The first book is masterful in its simplicity. The story feels real, undoubtedly largely due to the author drawing on her own experiences, but Alcott also cleverly avoids adding too much into it and thereby making it unrealistic. She chooses a good steady pace, and the characters are well defined and consistently portrayed. Her dialogue is not perfect, but that adds to the overall realism of the telling of the story. It is a wonderful story for young women to read, and is also very readable for older readers.The second book is fairly good too, though it fails to be as believable as the first book as Alcott allowed herself to be convinced to have Jo marry. Alcott never married, and the union she chooses for Jo is a bit unusual and thus it doesn't feel right. Outside of that, though, the second book is a worthy successor to the first. Meg's choice of husband fits perfectly with the character and ideals that she develops in the first book. Most of Jo's actions in the second book also fit well with her character up, including her avoiding marriage with Laurie, her friend and neighbor who plays an important role throughout both books. Only at the point where Jo marries does it not fit. The tragedy of Meg's passing is beautifully described, and the reader is touched by the goodness of her character. Lastly, the full development of Amy fits well, including her choice of spouse.The Penguin Classics edition of \\"Little Women\\" includes a very informative introduction by Elaine Showalter and extensive notes by Siobhan Kilfeather and Vinca Showalter. One of the important notes is that this edition is based on the original publications, and not those which were amended by Alcott for later editions, though obvious printer errors were corrected. There is discussion of some of the changes which Alcott made in the notes to the text. This is a wonderful book, but I will take part of a star away and round down for Jo's forced marriage."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I like this book because of Jo March. And I never cry when Beth dies, because she annoys me."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I was thrilled to find Little Woman for free on Kindle. I remember reading this book over and over again when I was a child. I believe the version I read back then (many years ago) was slightly different from this one. There are scenes in the Kindle version I don't remember from my childhood. Of course, it could just be a faulty memory on my part. Either way, this is a wonderful book for both children and adults."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"You can never go wrong with the classics. My daughter (11) loved this book adn so did I when I was a girl"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"this is my favorite book of all time, one I re-read every year around Christmas time - nothing will ever be able to compare, even Pride and Prejudice (which is also one of my favorites).Little Women was originally written in two volumes: Little Women and then Good Wives; today these two books are combined, so will be my review... ((this may be a bit long of a review so bare with me - there is just soo much to cover in this book))Loosely based off of her own life, Alcott presents a story about four women who grow both individually and together as a family during times of trouble, turbulence, and peace. Each sister has their own hopes and dreams, and each sister finds their place in the world only after discovering heartache, pain, love, and loss. Jo, who is loud, rambunctious, hard headed and impatient, finds solace through her writing. She struggles greatly to find peace within her self and accept herself as she is. Meg, the oldest remembers a time when the March family was revered and was not in financial hardships, making it hard for her to accept life as is, all the while being kind and understanding to her young sisters. Beth, the quite and timid sister, who is always kind and sees the good in everyone and everything, desires nothing more than to remain at home with her family and dolls. Amy, the youngest of the sisters, is constantly concerned with how prime and proper she should look, act, and speak, but remains true to her character.Laurie, the boy next door, finds himself a home he never expected in the March household as he finds it hard to live up to his grandfather's expectations of him. He is seen as an older brother to all the sisters, never faulting in his devotion to them, that is until his feelings for Jo grow into something more. However, Jo is unable to see Laurie and he wishes and her desire to find her place in the world is never greater.You really see the divide between childhood and adulthood when each of the sisters go their own way: Meg gets married, Beth remains at home, Amy travels abroad to Europe, and Jo goes to New York (Laurie is also left to his own devices, first going off to college and then working for his grandfather in Europe). It is only when tragedy hits the sisters, are they all able to come back together, as new adult women.While this novel is filled with girls knitting, needlepoint, and darning (which were expected of women of the time), it goes much deeper than that. Alcott presents the constant struggle that many women had, and even many women of today, between their loyalties to their family as well as to theirselves, and trying to find a balance between the two. This is a wonderful novel that can teach anyone many different lessons about life and love and family."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"it is a really nice novel. it is so good that i wish i could read it more. it was like i was witnessing the whole story myself . it was a really nice experiance. we can learn so much from it."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Definitely a classic that I think should be required reading. There are some parts that are a bit drawn out, but overall I find it an excellent book."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Little Women is about 4 sisters the oldest Meg, the tomboyish Jo,sweet Beth and little Amy. Through many things the girls never forget what is important, their family. The book progresses as the girls grow older and it is a great novel. My friends know I'm a fast reader but they took one look at it and told me that it looked so boring that they bet me it would take me weeks to finish. Boy were they surprized when I was on the first page a week later, they said &quot;told yah so&quot; and I said that they were wrong and I was rereading it! I became so ingrossed in it that they accutually let me tell them what it was about and they hate reading.

I am 12 years old and really love to read. I have to say that this book was very challenging, with a lot of new words, but it was worth the extra time and effort.Right from the start you see the four main characters, who are sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy along with Mrs. March (Marmee) working together to get through the hardship of being without their father, Mr. March, who is off to war. The way the family cares about each other and people who are even less fortunate than they are is really a great lesson. There are funny parts, sad parts and really unexpected turns to this story.I really enjoyed getting know all the characters and REALLY loved Jo! Everyone who has read this book says that I'm a lot like her. I think anyone who reads this book will have fun seeing which girl they most are like. I thought all of them had really great personalities, most of the time...just like me.I really enjoyed the book more than the movie (the Katherine Hepburn one) because the book is loaded with details and I was able to picture the people and the scenes in my mind better (in my opinion) than the movie did. So DON'T skip the book and just watch the movie!!This book is really long, so make sure you're up for the challenge. But if you want a way to pass a rainy day (or even a snowy one), this is one of the greatest books to curl up with."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I've only read it fifty or more times. At one time in my life I read it through and started right over again at the end. I could recite large portions of it, as well as the table of contents.I first read this when I was about eight. I didn't understand it at all. Re-read it when I was a few years older and couldn't live without it. My grandma sent me a copy which I later replaced with a better one (the old version of the Children's Classics series) and I passed my first copy on to another LW admirer.I've always enjoyed this book. I remember being thrilled when I was fifteen like Jo is at the beginning of the book. I always liked Jo best... because I felt I was very like her. I've always liked to write. But then the artist in Amy appealed to me as well. I always loved Beth also and her dolls and cats. Meg was the only one I never felt I could relate to... later on though I re-read the book after a long absence from it and Meg's character seemed much more interesting. There's a charming supporting cast in these pages too... Laurie, John, and the Bhaer... Hannah... Aunt March...I like the Pilgrim's Progress theme of the first half of the book. I think it's so nice that these were four girls who really wanted to do right... and went to the right place for help - the little Books Mother gave them under their pillows... There is humour and sadness here, much reality, and plenty of charm. I always appreciated the simple but profound style of Louisa May Alcott - it bears up under so many readings very well. It's been about a year since I last read it... I think it's time to pull it off the shelf again.I get a strange feeling that this review is a bit scattered. But if you've gotten the idea that I love and recommend this book, it serves its purpose."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"If you've never read this book, you simply have to! Women of all ages can and will relate to the follies of the little women. From burnt hair to boy troubles to feeling stupid and made into a fool, we've all been there and experienced it in some form or another. My favorite chapter is actually the first one (Though I can recite any passage from any chapter of the book word for word.) A Merry Christmas introduces us to the characters and show the unity and support in American families during the Civil War. Dark Days has you feeling the worst is around the corner, but then some sun peeks through the ice encrusted tree limbs. And though The Valley of Shadow brings about darker days yet, good things come of them, and in the end, life is beautiful! It doesn't matter what your usual style of reading material is, this is by far the greatest work ever published. I have this particular copy and there are about four or five exquisite full color drawings inside and some truly magnificent sketches, aslo. Don't even consider waiting one more second to pick this one up, whether you're a long time fan who's been looking for the perfect copy or a new reader, trust me when I say you will want this one longer than any library in the country will allow it out.

I'm referring to the Grosset & Dunlap Illustrated Junior Library edition. I found this at a local Borders and was immediately attracted to the cover illustration. This is a beautiful book. There are many illustrations throughout the book, both in color and in back and white (the majority are in black and white).When I looked it up on Amazon, I was a little hesitant about buying this book because I had read reviews stating that it only contained the first half of the story (288 pages). The book I bought (at Borders) contains the entire story (643 pages). So, if you like the appearance of this particular edition, but are put off by the lack of the second half, it is available with the complete story. Just be careful when making your selection."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This was one of my favorite books as a child -- and even now, the chapter \\"Dark Days\\" (and other parts, too!) make me cry. I NOW find the character of the mother (\\"Marmee\\") and her constant moralizing annoying; but it's still a great book. And little girls still read it and weep over it (I volunteer in schools and meet a lot of kids).I think this is because the characters of the girls and Laurie are so real and the book has so much more heart than many things published now; but who knows? At different times in my life, I've liked each of the sisters (except Meg) the best and think this is quite common though most of us first like Jo. At any rate, I believe in the characters and find the book touching...even when I'm annoyed by Marmee! I just ignore her moralizing as I probably would have tried to do in real life if she had been my mother.Two facts: If you visit Boston, you can go to Concord and see one of the houses where Louisa May Alcott lived -- it's now a museum and furnished as it would have been in her day. And the conversation in my novel BLOW OUT THE MOON about Litle Women, Jo, and Amy is one of the things that happened in real life just as it does in the book."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"The first time I read Louisa May Alcott's Little Women, I fell in love with the story. Little Women is the story of four girls that were coming of age during the civil war. Each of the girls, all sisters, has different personality traits and characteristics that are developed throughout the book. Meg, the oldest, is the sensible sister, while Jo is hot-headed and independent. Beth is musical and Amy, the youngest, is the more material of the four. The girls grew up in a very close family and strived to support each other in their dreams. But Jo, the second-born, has a difficult time seeing all of them growing up and leaving home. She wants things to remain the same, always. Change is inevitable, however, and throughout the book, the girls' love for each other is strong, as they face different challenges and joys of growing up. They keep their strong sense of family... I thoroughly enjoyed reading Little Women. It has been awhile since I was able to sit down and read a book I so love. Louisa May Alcott's character, Meg, did not hold much interest for me... Amy, the baby of the family, was too materialistic for my taste. The character I related to the most was Jo. I do not know if it is because I am like her, or if it was her spunk that I really liked. I loved to see the blossoming love Laurie had for Jo... I think that Louisa May Alcott did a wonderful job in writing Little Women. I could relate to the book and with how the four sisters were at home with their mother and their father was off doing military things. I grew up with a father in the Navy and he was gone a lot. My mom, brother and I had to take care of things while he was gone. Life goes on even if the whole family is not together.I fell in love with the Little Women at a young age and I hope to read this book to my children as they get older...

I have read this book more times than I can count, and I still love it. Once I pick it up I can't put it down, lost in this seemingly fantasy world, which was actually quite true more than 100 years ago.My favorite thing about Little Women has to be the characters. Jo, the day-dreaming tomboy, Meg, pretty and proper, Beth, the quiet sweetheart, and little Amy, our artist, who always tried to grow up too fast. Then of course there's Laurie, the tall fun-loving boy-next-door, and so many other fabulous personalities (Aunt March, Fredrick Bauer, Hannah, Marmie, etc.) that I couldn't possibly name them all.This book is one that I think everyone absolutely MUST read some time in their life, for it teaches moral values that should be used by people of all ages.

Although the story is very sentimental and it has many morals, it is an extraordinary portrait of life in Northeast US during and after the Civil War. It was still very much a protestant, puritanical society, starting to modernize but still very provincial. The characters are well-rounded, alive and real, and the stories are amusing. It has no specific plot. It is the story of the March family, and it starts when the father is away, fighting on the North's side.

It shows us their trials in life and leaves us with a sense of belonging to their world.I think that this book is more important now than ever, because of the strong feminist attitude expressed by the family as a whole.

The sisters include the beautiful and very womanly Meg; strong and sensitive tomboy Jo; innocent, kind, and quiet Beth; and free minded, sometimes selfish, but attractive girl Amy. These four girls&iexcl; weaving story touches my heart deeply. Laurie, a charming young man, has an unusually sincere love for Jo, yet marries her sister Amy in the end.

This book would be classified as a young adult.Little Women is the strory of three sisters. It shows the trials a girl can face as she grows up into a women. The book is filled with romance, trouble, revenge and many other domestic problems.I have read many books that are similar to Little Women. The Old-fashioned Girl, is another delightful story with a similar genre. It is also by Louisa May Alcott.I really enjoyed the book. I love Alcott's style of writng. You are really able to connect with each of the charcters. I found the strongest connection between Jo and myself. She is an independent women. She and likes to be philosophical. We are very much alike in these ways. &quot; Jo is our Literary fellow.&quot; This was said about Jo form her sister Meg. The whole March family thought Jo was the greatest authoress that ever did live. I to would love to get such praise for my writings.However good this book may be it does have its drawbacks. I feel there could have been several things omitted. I would recommend this book for those who enjoy stories about women who in their own little ways try to make their world better."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I am absolutely torn as to how to rate this book.On one part, I feel awful about giving it a BAD rating, because it is a classic novel with an impeccably clean story.On the other hand, I can't bring myself to give it a GOOD rating, because the whole thing read like a Puritanical rant.Therefore, I think I will go with a 2.5 out of 5 star rating.I feel that Ms. Alcott said it best in the following quote: \\"'You said, mother, that criticism would help me; but how can it, when it's so contradictory that I don't know whether I've written a promising book or broken all the Ten Commandments?...This man says, \\"An exquisite book, full of truth, beauty, and earnestness; all is sweet, pure, and healthy\\"...The next, \\"The theory of the book is bad, full of morbid fantasies, spiritualistic ideas, and unnatural characters.\\"'\\"As this quote was found in Part 2 of the book, which was written some years after Part 1 was published, I can only assume that the quote itself reflects real criticism that Ms. Alcott received for Part 1 of Little Women and reiterate that \\"I couldn't have said it better myself.\\"Of course, all of this is coming from one who is long past childhood and young adulthood and therefore somewhat jaded in both spiritual and relationship matters, and as this book is basically the epitome of happy endings and moral tirades, I just could not bring myself to enjoy it as much as I may have 10-15 years ago."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This is a GREAT book! I was thrilled to find it at my library, because everyone told me that I should read it. This unique story shows how the March sisters deal with problems together. (I have two sisters, so I can relate to that). The four girls, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, form a tight bond as they deal with frienships, money, marriages, and much more, during the civil war, when their father is away. When their mother, &quot;Marmee&quot; goes to help their sick father, they struggle to find any help for Amy, who is dreadfully ill with the scarlet fever. This, and many more problems fill their lives, and they learn to live a better life as they mature and grow strong within each other. This is a wonderful classic, and I encourage you to read the book,watch the movie, or listen to the cassete (of which I have done all three!)."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I read this book a long time ago and absolutely hated it. Then someone recommended Louisa May Alcott to me so I gave it another shot, but by the end I was truly wondering why Little Women had become such a classic. I found that the first half was lacking in plot - when I looked back on it I realized that I had spent at least a couple hours reading about a ball, a sickness, and a bad dinner - and that the second half had far too much plot. The first part was very hung up on morality and sometimes felt too pious, although Marmee was a remarkably enlightened woman. The characters, especially Meg, didn't feel distinct and realistic throughout the second half; I felt like the three years that had passed distanced me from the characters. Attempting to jam three romances, a death, and a storyline involving Jo's writing into the second part only made things feel more detached. As for the aforesaid romances, I tried desperately to find the emotional reasoning behind Jo's choice and came up empty handed. The one thing that saved this book was the simple language and writing; I found it easy to read.In short, I'm sure that this book appeals to some, but I didn't like at 7 and I don't like it now. I definitely agree with the people that recommended Anne of Green Gables instead - it and its sequels are great books."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I never read the book in this form, but did read it many years ago. I gave it three stars based on what is think of it, which is four or five stars, and the fact that my grand-daughter was bored, which deserves maybe two stars. I think before you buy books, you should try to know the book and the child fairly well beforehand, in terms of what you think they would like. I know that many kids will dislike a book which many others like (like you today, perhaps). Considering the caveat I said, I'd consider buying it."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Little Women is very like The Brady Bunch. In its time, everybody knew it was sugary-sweet and unrealistic. (Including, and especially, Alcott.) It still dared to tackle subjects previously taboo. (For Little Women, it was daring to show girls with personalities, for Brady Bunch, it was new to show blended families.)The world was never like this--even Alcott's own life was not. She idealized a miserable childhood into something that would sell: a noble, genteel poverty that conveniently appeals to today's nostalgiacs. If you enjoy that, great. Just keep some perspective.Belongs in classes studying how literature has changed."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"My mother, an avid reader, always introduced books to me and &quot;Little Women&quot; is one of them. But I eventually rejected it after looking through it. It simply isn't my cup of tea because I don't really related to four proper ladies during the 1800s who all eventually got married off and produced offspring, including Jo, who was supposed to be &quot;tomboyish&quot; and independent-minded. Additionally, it may be a little too cloyingly sentimental for me to stomach. But however, if it is a good, well-written book with inspiring characters, especially women living in the 19th century, then I guess I'd recommand it to anyone who would like it nevertheless."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Little women are the perfect compliment to little men. Large men can like them too, however, if they are careful."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Little Women's Dreaming GlassesI have always had extremely vivid dreams. While asleep, I have been known to shout out loud to people in my life who are hard-of-hearing; speak French; throw punches; laugh; and carry on lengthy one-sided conversations. Throughout these dramas, I am treated to Technicolor images playing on the back of my eyelids.At one point in my life, a friend suggested I talk with a psychologist who was well-known for her expertise in deciphering dreams. To be honest, I was pretty skeptical. It sounded like either fortune-telling, or a waste of my time, or perhaps both. Talking with this woman, however, turned out to be incredibly helpful. She did not tell me about myself, my life, or my dreams: instead, as the best guides do, she gave me the tools to find my own insights.Surely, this is what our best writers and most influential teachers have done for us, as well. When people write a good story, or help us to interpret those stories, they are offering us a new set of glasses to try on - a set of glasses through which we may catch a different way of looking at ourselves and our world. These glasses, whether they are labeled \\"Marxist\\", \\"Christian\\", \\"Feminist\\", \\"Jungian\\", or what-have-you, may give us deeper insight into parts of our own personality, or they may give us a view of a part of the world we've never even considered.In the case of the above-mentioned psychologist, she suggested I look at each object or person in my dream and see it as a representation of ...ME. So, the ugly couch is me; the thunderstorm in the background is me; the broken teapot is me, as is the table it is sitting on .... This may not help me understand every aspect of my dreams, nor every dream I have, but it is a great starting point. I have also found this to be true in my personal reading. Even if the purpose of reading a certain book is to learn about something completely foreign to you, it helps to get a foothold by finding a familiar aspect, something to which you can relate.Recently, I started reading Louisa May Alcott's \\"Little Women\\". This lovely little book is, unfortunately, one of many of the \\"classics\\" that I have never read. Despite the fact that I love to read, I do find \\"The Canon\\" (capitals completely intentional) rather daunting. I was surprised, then, to find myself wholly sucked in to what could be criticized as a overly simple, moralizing story, written too long ago to be relevant, in words which may now seem stilted. What could Jo, Amy, Beth, and Meg have to say to a modern woman, more than 130 years later? Why, as I devour the pages of their story, do I feel such love and sympathy for them?And then, I realize, in the clarity of thought that often comes as I put down a book for the night and just before sleep takes me, that these characters are ... ME. Scholars and historians who have studied the life and writings of Louisa May Alcott attest to the autobiographical aspects of \\"Little Women\\", and how Louisa created the character of \\"Jo\\" to represent herself. As I am reading, I sympathize with Jo - her stubbornness, her tomboyish ways, her fierce loyalty to her sisters and her family, her writing, her bossiness. So, at first, I say, \\"I am Jo.\\" But then I realize I relate to Beth, too, especially as members of her family protect her, with her perhaps overly sensitive heart, and her health problems. And - admit it, ladies, even the toughest among us - who doesn't want, in some corner of her soul, to be \\"petted\\" and admired at times, like the little princess Amy wants to be; or to be the nurturer, older sister, eventual wife and mother, Meg. And, hey, guys, who knew that \\"Little Women\\" might be a better guide to understanding the females in your life than anything contemporary pop psychologists are writing?And so, with the help of this classic, I have touched base with parts of myself I haven't acknowledged in a while. The way symbols and themes and people may show up in your dreams, though you haven't consciously thought of them for a long time. This is why the great stories truly last.Author of \\"Hobo Finds A Home\\" editor \\"Of A Predatory Heart\\""},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I have just re-read \\"Little Women\\" and found it even more intriguing then the first time I read it as a preteen.

I finally did one day when I saw it on my friend's bookshelf and asked to borrow it (to which, of course, she agreed; we exchange books as often as we exchange words). I read it in a week and when I finished it I thought, I should have read this years ago!! I went to the library the same day I found out there were sequels. Perhaps the conversations are a little too long; and some of the old mannerisms hard to understand, but stick it out for the whole thing and you won't be sorry! And one more thing -- read it even if you're an adult or a boy. It isn't just for twelve-year-old girls (excuse the fact that this was written by one); and it isn't about sisters making calls and gossiping.

However, many reviews already comment on the story, and I only wish to comment on a particular edition, particularly the Penguin classics one. Not only does it have a beautiful cover illustration of the four sisters, it has plenty of end notes printed in the back for a better understanding of the text. Although Alcott's language is not convoluted in any way, the culture the four sisters lived in is very different from ours, and thus there are some idioms or expressions that are now archaic. The notes help explain such terms very well. There was some confusion about one of the editions not having both parts, but rest assured, Penguins includes both parts of the story. Furthermore, the introduction states that this particular edition contains no altercations or editing that some later texts contain, and is presented as Alcott originally intended. Sadly, this edition has no illustrations besides the one on the front cover, and thus may not be the most ideal edition for children. However, Penguins is the perfect edition for those seeking a lovely copy and a fantastic read. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"In Little Women, you will meet the March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth & Amy who live with their mother, Marmee, and their maid Hannah, during the Civil War. The first half of the novel takes place while their father is away, serving in the war. Each sister has a distinct personality, a reader, an artist, a musician, the quiet one. You will get to know this family in touching little stories of their daily life. Each chapter seems to set up a moral lesson for the reader to learn. We also meet a wonderful set of neighbors, Mr. Laurence and his nephew \\"Laurie\\" who quickly find a place as part of the March family.The second half of the novel, focuses on the girls as they leave their childhood and begin their journey into adult life. Lessons of friendship, family, and love are covered as we join the characters through the ups and downs of life, good times and bad. It seems that Louisa May Alcott used her own family as the basis for the stories in Little Women, basing the character Jo on herself. It is amazing how though the book was written in the late 1800's, so many things about humans remain the same. The foundations of life that are important in friendships, family & love don't change through time, as Alcott has shared with us. This is a book that young and old can read and appreciate."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"The book is a classic and the price was unbeatable.

The descriptions of the girls and their friends are missing, as are descriptions of their clothes, home, etc. Alcott herself wrote (ch. 1), \\"...young readers like to know 'how people look.'\\" I question the decision to leave out the descriptive passages as they are some of the most interesting writing, especially to younger readers."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I read this book when I was 12 years old.

But it changed my life. I model myself after Marmee, the loving and kind mother. This book taught me to have self respect and hold myself with dignity. I taught me to be polite and respectable. Throughout the turmoil of adolescene, with kids growing up to model pop culture icons and growing up too fast, with sex and drugs littering the road to adulthood, I held myself like a lady. Thank you, library, for having little selection. This book changed my life. Everyone has to read it. After that book, I read more classics, and let me tell you they are lovely.

It's a role model - an encourager. To the person who said that the Marches were the &quot;perfect&quot; family - I dearly hope to have a family as good as they when I grow up.

Precisely why I decided to pick it up again at age 24 is unknown to me, but the reread was well worth it.Alcott tells the story of the four March sisters--Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy--as they grow into young women. Each girl has her faults, and they struggle to overcome them. They also must face the consequences of the family's poverty as well as separation from their father, who is serving with the Union Army during the Civil War. The book is told in episodic fashion, with many chapters acting almost as short stories complete with crisis and resolution. The sisters act appropriately for their time as well as display the sibling rivalries and affection present in most families.Reading Little Women as an adult, I realized just how moralizing it is. The March girls learn important lessons from nearly every event in the book. Beth is elevated to near-sainthood even before she becomes ill. But, other than the preaching, I found Little Women to be a thoroughly enjoyable read. I might just pick up Little Men again one of these days."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This book is a wonderful book that tells the story of 4 girls who are living during the Civil war and trying to cope with their father away at war and their mother who is busy trying to make ends meet until their father returns. This book is great and touching. You see how unselfish these girls are and how they will do anything to help their mother. But this book also shows conflicts that arise between sisters. I recommend mothers and daughters and sisters to all read this book.

I am an avid reader, and there are some books which I have read more than once, but when I think about them years - or even months - later, I cannot for the life of me remember some of the main charactors' names.

Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"One of the best books I've ever read. It started out that I just wanted to get more AR points than this other girl in my class who had been unable to finish the book because she had thought it was so boring. I was anticipating the worse, but I began to read it and I just fell in love with the dear little book. It was just so great! My favorite character by far was Jo. After I read it more people in my class became curious and four other people in the class read it including the first girl who gave up on it.

I strongly recamend this addion for its beautiful illustrations that complament the classic story, you will treasure"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Little Women is a 500+ page book. Although long, it is a wonderful book that I will eventually read again. Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy are four teenage sisters. Throughout the book we see their lives. The father is fighting in the civil war. They are a poor family. But even so they find a way to make the best of life. Meg is proper and ladylike. She simply loves silk dresses. Jo is a tomboy with a temper. She loves to write and although she wants independance and freedom, she also wants to do something for the world and craves respect and honesty. I am most like Jo. I love to write and even though I am not a tomboy I feel that I most identify with her. Beth is a sweet pianist who is a little angel. She is timid and feels that she does not do enough with her life as she mostly stays home with their maid Hannah. When she is on her deathbed she reads a poem by Jo about her and realizes that she made a difference in her older sister's life. THat makes her feel better. Amy is a bit of a snob. She is a talented artist who hates her nose. She says she will marry for money. Laurie is the next door neighbor. He and Jo become best friends. When he asks Jo to marry him she refuses because they are both so independant that it would ruin their relationship as just friends. It breaks his heart. He later marries Amy, who although Laurie does have a lot of money, she also loves him. Marmee is a mix of all four of her daughters. I highly recommend this book. Don't put it down because it is too long. The second half of the book is better. I admit, I felt like punching it when I was at the last 25 pages. Suffer through 562 pages and not regret it because of the ending, trust me you will love this book! Go Little Women!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Little Women was a fantastic book. It's a story about the life of the four March sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. The girls and their mother are very close. Mr. March is away in the Civil War. The book tells of the adventures of the girls as they grow up. It tells of their poverty and how they shouldn't take anything for granted. It shares stories of bad moments in their lives. A teacher hit Amy as a punishment therefore causing and uprising. The girls mother then pulls them out of school. It tells of their love lives and the conflicts between Laurie and the sisters. They also try to find a happy medium of good and bad. They want to be bad and do mischivous things, but need to be the proper ladies that they are expected to be. They spend their lives trying to balance the two ideas. They try to learn the difference between dreams and reality. They dream of a life of riches, where they get everything they want. But in reality, they are not even close. They try, throughout the whole story, to be good sisters to one another. They also try to be good to their mother, since she is struggling while her husband is away. At Christmas, the girls planned on buying eachother and themselves gifts. Later, that changed to buying presents for their mother to show her how much they appreciate her hard work and love. The author, Alcott, portrays they life and society during the civil war superbly. This book is good for boys and girls of all ages because everyone can learn something from it, wether its about love, lust, money, pride, education, or anything else. This book shows us the reality of life. It deserves all five stars, if not more."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"How can you not love this tale of 4 sisters struggling to have a normal life despite a father away fighting in the Civil War and diminished means because of his absence? Jo is a feminist of whom Susan B. Anthony would be proud. Poor Beth is so good and easy to love that her illness is heart-breaking. Meg is strong and practical. And Amy, well, you have to love her despite her vanity and selfishness. Of course, Marmee is the tie that binds this family together. So many wonderful movie adaptations of this beloved novel have been produced, including the very faithful one starring Winona Ryder, but, really, one should read this novel to totally immerse themselves in the lives of the March girls. If you love the movie, do yourself the favor of reading this book. Read it to your young daughter, or buy your 4th, 5th, or 6th grader her very own copy to treasure."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Little Women is a classic story written by Louisa May Alcott. This is a marvelous story. It concentrates on these four little women with their dad off fighting in the war and the March family going poor. Alcott incorporates the feelings of each of the little women as the story progresses. She wrote a great story with such great detail with each of the women. During the coarse of the story, Alcott uses many literary devices in her writing, but there are a few that are more immanent to the reader.Louisa Alcott uses a combination of two literary terms, an understatement and figure of speech. Josephine March constantly uses the phrase, \\"Christopher Columbus\\" during the coarse of the story. She usually uses this phrase when something marvelous or great happens. In the story, Jo is invited to visit the ill Mr. Laurie. When he shows her the house and invites her for tea, Jo uses \\"Christopher Columbus\\" when she sees the great and luxurious music room. She really means how marvelous and great the room was. People around her may not know what she is talking about, but Jo surely does.Louisa Alcott also uses the literary device, foreshadowing. She does this when Jo comes home from town one day with Laurie. Jo comes running up to her house and there was Meg talking with John. Jo gets jealous and mad because she doesn't want Meg to fall in love with him and marry him. Then that means she will have to move out and the four little March sisters will down to three and Jo does not want that. So as Jo, Meg, John, and Laurie are talking, Beth comes home from town. All of a sudden, Jo grabs Beth and gives Beth a hug and says, \\"Beth you are never going to leave. You are going to be the one to keep the family together.\\" With Jo saying that, it foreshadows that something bad is going to happen to Beth and surely something does. Beth dies from Scarlet fever that she got from the baby she was taking care of. Jo was of course devastated with the death and lost of poor Beth. Before Beth dies, she confronts Jo in the attic to talk her. They talk about her (Beth) dieing and leaving Jo. As Jo is crying, Beth starts doing a soliloquy in which she makes a long speech with Jo about dieing. She talks about how she will always be with her and how much Jo means to her. She also says how she is not scared and how what is happening is what is the right thing. With her relationship with Beth, Jo is later inspired to write a novel to be published about her Beth.Finally, Alcott uses all of the characteristics in a character. For instance, Jo is a great example of a static character; she never changes through out the coarse of the story. At the beginning, Jo loves to write and wants one of her stories published. At the end, she still loves writing, but at the end, her story My Beth is published. Laurie is a good example of a dynamic character. At the beginning, he falls in love with Jo, but as he confesses his love to her and her hand in marriage, she turns him down. Then as he is visiting Europe, he meets up with Amy and things just click and he starts having feelings for Amy. Later they get married, but Jo and Laurie still stay the best of friends just as they were before. Examples of flat characters are Demi and Daisy because they are only described as the twins of Meg and John. Beth is an example of a round character because she is a very quiet but very virtuous. She does nothing but try to please others. She adores music and plays the piano very well. She seems like a real person that some one would know from school. These are just a few examples, but there are many other characters that fit the description of each of these.Little Women by Louisa May Alcott is a great book. No matter how old or young a reader they maybe, they would enjoy it. It is a book for all ages. Alcott words the novel as though it is a true story happening to real people. Readers can relate to the events in the story and can relate to the feelings of the characters. This book may be a classic, but it is still enjoyed by many. Little Women is a novel that will never fade away and will continue to be read by others for as long as time can tell. Now that is fantastic novel."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"The main reason I loved Little Women is that it displayed so many different personalities within one family. Meg, being the oldest, was more refined and mature than her sisters. She always felt as if she had to set a good example for the younger siblings. Jo was the daydreamer and had strong ambitions to become a writer. Jo, according to the story, is the one who wrote this book. She was the tomboy who always wanted to have fun. Beth was the quiet sister. She was always listening to the other girl's problems and giving advice. Amy was the youngest sister, and to be quite frank, was just plain spoiled! She always got what she wanted and in the process took many things that could easily hurt Jo. Going to Europe was one of Jo's dreams. Whe Jo finally thought she was going to get to go, her aunt asked Amy. Instead of refusing to go and offering her spot to Jo, Amy accepted her aunt's offer immediately. The book Little Women is not just a story about four different girls growing into women; it is a tale of friendship, family, and belonging. It shows how four ppeople can have a huge impact on each other's lives and on the lives of many others."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature.

And in the end, the book is ultimately a coming of age story that would be better suited for someone much younger than myself.Reading the book as an adult, I found it hard to get into. It went from slow and meandering in the beginning to an almost break-neck pace towards the end. It was heavy on description and the characters weren't all that deep. I know it's a classic and people love these girls, but they seemed very two dimensional to me. Each had her very own set of traits and none seemed to share a trait with another as sisters would. While that could allow for each character to be her own person and made it easy to distinguish one from the next, it didn't seem real.A wonderful book for children, but the experience doesn't justify a reading as an adult.

The early stages are sugary sweet and there is quite a bit of preaching on religion and morals throughout that might make the younger ones roll their eyes a bit.

The beautiful New England scenery, the excellent background music which somehow conveys the Civil War period, the fine acting - all make this a very enjoyable rendition.I somewhat reluctantly have withheld the 5th star - possibly unfairly so. I re-read Louisa May Alcott's book just recently. My conclusion was that because the book provides a much more comprehensive development of the lives of the four March daughters, no movie, within its modern time limitations, can really do justice to Alcott's plot. While I liked the portrayal of Professor Bhaer very much in this latest version, I think the movie adaptation made him much more &#34;modern&#34; than the book would allow - more youthful in appearance, more advanced views of culture, a manufactured love scene, etc.But all in all - highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"5 stars!!!!

I finished reading it a few weeks ago and already feel the urge to read it again. Alcott's novel presents subtle yet astute viewpoints regarding the tension between the traditional domestic roles of females and the push for women's rights which was beginning in the mid-1800s. Pay close atttention to the character of Beth to see Alcott's view on how overly-domestic women fair in the modern/changing world. I will say, though, that the ending seemed very forced, almost contrived.Also, Amazon suggests that 9-12 is a good age to read this book...maybe that was true 50 years ago, when society read more and was more literate in general, but for today, I would personally suggest 12-14 as the perfect age to read this book (for average readers)."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I'd read this book 60 years ago and had forgotten how beautifully it was written.

This is one of those books I could see myself reading again."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"The Whole Story edition of Little Women is Louisa May Alcott's unrevised, original publication from 1968. She later revised some of Jo's colorful language and use of slang as well as altered the appearance of Laurie and Marmie in order to appease the disgruntled \\"contemporary\\" public (who apparently didn't approve of foreign-looking men or stout women). In 1880, she published an edited version along with the Part 2 (Little Wives) that is included in most modern Little Women books. So, actually, The Whole Story uses the absolute original story. It has wonderful information on the era sprinkled throughout and a plethora of photographs and illustrations which is the hallmark of the Whole Story unabridged editions of classics. While I do wish The Whole Story series would release Little Wives (separately)...this version is definitely worth buying in conjunction with an ordinary unabridged book that includes the Part 2. That's what I did. I treasure all of the Whole Story series books...they're absolutely phenomenal -- if you're lucky enough to find them.I do think that Amazon should reorganize their lumping together of reviews for classics spanning various editions. It looks like they're trying, but it is still somewhat confusing. The way it's advertised, they claim to have The Whole Story Little Women on Kindle...which is not true."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Nice kindle edition of both Little Women and its sequel Good Wives.Both are beautiful stories and here they are complete and unabridged, asthey should be.This edition would benefit from a little more formatting but on the whole it is very good, especially with both books for free.Wonderful to have these in my e-library to read again, and share with my daughter."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This book took me awhile to read and some parts I didnt quite understand.

I recieved mine new from a seller."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, but \\"Little Women\\" retains a special place in the heart of American literature. Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"THis book was delivered in the condition promised (Brand new and shrink-wrapped). Great price too!Thanks."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"After reading some of the 1 star reviews on this book, I know that some people might not like it because of how nice and perfect and possibly unrealistic the family is. While I have no problem with this viewpoint, I think otherwise. When I read this book, it's sort of like taking a break from the awful lives people live in this time period. It feels nice to just sit back and relax and imagine how nice life would be if, even though there may be arguements, they are small and unimportant compared to the hapiness that you can share with people. Yeah, that might have sounded pretty cheezy, but it's still nice to read some books like that."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"i read books called little women in my school library and i thought the were sieres so there must be a lot of different versions i cant wait to read this even though im only 11 i heared great things about this book and i loved the ones i read in the library i just love to read and i love old books i think its cool to learn that really thats acatally how people lived then and then there were these lucky ones it toght mehow unfair life was and sometimes still is"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I inherited my mother's copy of \\"Little Women\\" when I was young, but always had a bit of trouble reading it. It wasn't until many years later that I noticed the words: \\"modern abridged edition\\" on the cover, and realized on comparison with the full text that my version had been all but chopped to pieces. No wonder I didn't understand anything!So it was a little odd settling down with the proper version of Lousia May Alcott's most famous book, knowing the basic structure of the story, but now having the chance to read it in its entirety. Ironically, Alcott wrote \\"Little Women\\" solely at her publisher's request for \\"a book for girls\\", with Alcott herself writing for purely monetary reasons and with no expectations whatsoever at to how popular it would become. Basing the March family on the Alcotts and her own experiences, Alcott's novel sold two thousand copies (the entire print run) in just one month. Requests for a sequel were inevitable, and so \\"Good Wives\\" was written, a story that is usually combined with \\"Little Women\\" in most copies available today.Quite episodic in nature, the story itself is rather straightforward, concerning four sisters dealing with the family's poverty and their own adolescence whilst their father is fighting in the Civil War. Ultimately the story, not counting the two later sequelsLittle MenandJo's Boys, covers a twenty year span, as Jo (the unofficial protagonist) grows from a fifteen year old to a thirty-five year old. The four girls are more or less counterparts of Alcott and her own sisters, and the author presents four distinct personalities to the reader: Meg, the motherly eldest, who struggles the most with poverty; Jo the tomboyish book-lover (an almost autobiographical portrayal of Alcott herself) who harbors ambitions of becoming a writer; Beth, the angelic and shy homebody; and Amy, the youngest: spoilt, pretty, and artistic.Alongside the girls are a range of supporting characters, including their mother (called \\"Marmee\\" by the girls; a name that is often pronounced phonetically, though in keeping with the New England accents of the time, it would have been pronounced \\"Mommy\\"), the housekeeper Hannah, sharp-tongued Aunt March, and a range of possible suitors for the girls, including their next door neighbor, the mischievous Laurie.It is the relationship between the sisters as well as their bonds with parents, friends and lovers that is the true heart of the book, and it is Alcott's ability to write with realism, wit, and understanding that made \\"Little Women\\" so distinctive, particularly for its time. That Jo was not an idealized heroine, but quite literally the girl next door; and that the girls did not deal with melodramatic adventures, but rather the day-to-day trials of ordinary life, was quite an innovation in the mid 19th century. When the story opens just before Christmas, each of the girls receives a present of John Bunyan'sPilgrim's Progress, a story that is often alluded as the girls learn to master themselves through facing the various obstacles in life.Each girl has their flaws as well as their virtues, and each struggle with their foibles as they grow: Jo's literary ambition, Meg's experiences with the ups and downs of marriage and motherhood, Beth's struggle with her failing health, and Amy's growing maturity and attempts to overcome her desire for marry for money. Though in many ways Amy is the only one who doesn't seem to grow as much as the other girls; that is we are *told* of a change, but do not *see* it in a particularly vivid way. By the end of the story, she seems a little too perfect, and the fact that she ends up marrying a very wealthy man doesn't do much for the \\"marry for love, not money\\" tract.On the one hand, it is rewarding to see the girls overcome their faults and become wiser, more contented young women, yet at the same time, it is their flaws that make them such loveable characters in the first place. At the end of part one, in which Mr March looks at Jo and says: \\"I see a young lady who pins her collar straight, laces her boots neatly, and neither whistles, talks slang, nor lies on the rug as she used to do,\\" one can't help but be slightly disappointed at the change.Another bad side-effect is the fact that Alcott can often slip into sentimentality and moralizing (something she apologizes for a couple of times in the text itself: \\"I dare say my reader has fallen asleep during this little homily\\"). Being written as a \\"girl's book\\", which were naturally meant to extol womanly virtues, it's only expected that some sermonizing would be present. But often they're completely unnecessary, particularly in the earliest chapters in which the girls learn a valuable lesson, only for Marmee to reiterate what's obviously just been learnt. Though the sincerity of the girls is inspirational, the preaching gets on one's nerves.As strange as it may seem by today's standards, \\"Little Women\\" was considered a revolutionary novel in regards to the feminist movement of the age. In a time when women were still expected to be subservient and obedient, Alcott created female characters that were not wilting flowers nor passive damsels in distress, but realistic women who were each deeply flawed in their own way, with their own dreams, goals and ambitions. Likewise, although the girls eventually marry, Alcott is careful to give them husbands that are complimentary to their natures, and with whom the girls often have disagreements with (some of the best and funniest chapters involve the tiffs between Meg and her husband John). In this case, marriage does not come at the end of the story, but the middle, and there is no such thing as a \\"perfect happy ending\\" - only life in all its joys and disappointments.Of course, despite all this, there may still be some dissonance between the book's values and a contemporary audience. Meg is ultimately expected to be a good little housekeeper, and any discord in the household is naturally placed on her shoulders. Despite her ambition to become a writer (and the hope that she'll one day write a famous novel, which she eventually does in \\"Jo's Boys\\"), Jo ends this particular tale as the mistress of a boy's school, married to a much older man. Amy goes to Europe with the desire to become a famous artist, but on being confronted with the splendors of Rome, realizes that she's aiming too high and instead choosing to focus on helping other people realize their goals (though to be fair, Laurie comes to the same conclusion in regards to his music). In all cases, romantic love trumps ambition, and though there's certainly nothing wrong or invaluable about being a loving wife and mother, they are deemed incompatible with having a career; something that may not sit well with today's \\"have it all\\" readers.There are certainly some mixed messages at work in the book, perhaps born out of Alcott's own uncertainty over the issue. A feminist herself, Alcott remained a self-described \\"literary spinster\\" throughout her life, but although she tells us that for Jo: \\"To be independent, and earn the praise of those she loved, were the dearest wishes of her heart,\\" she also has Marmee, that font of wisdom, tell us that: \\"To be loved and chosen by a good man is the best and sweetest thing which can happen to a woman.\\" Yet it is in these seeming contradictions between the freedom of a career and the warmth of a family, (as well as the rewards to be found in both of them) that the interest in \\"Little Women\\" lies.But possibly the one aspect of the book that sparks the most debate is the relationship between Laurie and Jo. Throughout the course of \\"Little Women\\" the two best friends seem destined for one another, sharing the same interests and fun-loving spirits...but as it turned out, Alcott had other plans for them. After the immense popularity of \\"Little Women\\" Alcott was inundated with letters from young readers who requested a sequel, simply because they wanted to see Jo and Laurie get married. Alcott was disappointed with what we call \\"shipping\\" today, but which Alcott herself termed \\"lovering\\", writing in her journal:\\"I don't like sequels, but publishers are very perverse and won't let authors have their way, so my little women must grow up and be married off in a very stupid style.\\" In a letter to her friend, she expressed her frustration with the mindset of her readers, all of whom were simply interested in: \\"who the little women marry, as if that was the only end and aim in a woman's life.\\" She went on to say: \\"I won't marry Jo to Laurie to please anyone...Jo should have remained a literary spinster, but so many enthusiastic young ladies wrote to me clamorously demanding that she should marry Laurie, or somebody, that I didn't dare refuse and out of perversity went and made a funny match for her. I expect vials of wrath to be poured upon my head, but rather enjoy the prospect.\\"So if you were upset at the fact that Laurie and Jo didn't end up together, then you can blame the scores of female fan \\"shippers\\" of the early 19th century, who wrote in so many letters to Alcott asking when the two of them would marry that she eventually wrote something else out of spite. Later in \\"Jo's Boys\\", the character of Nan plays out Alcott's original plans for Jo: as a female character who has no interest in marriage, but rather forges out a successful career and happy, independent life for herself.The popularity and endurance of \\"Little Women\\" speaks for itself. Although the title may naturally imply that it is only for girls, Alcott has some very astute things to say about gender relationships, and male readers may discover a thing or two about the opposite sex (boys, have you ever wondered what girls get up to behind closed doors? This may be set over one hundred years ago, but the essentials haven't changed). In any case, Alcott's general wit and warmth makes this a book that is accessible to a wide range of readers - it would be a shame for the title to prejudice readers against it when there's so much to be learnt and enjoyed from it."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Every Christmas, I enjoy watching various versions of \\"Little Women\\" on video. My favorite is the latest one starring Susan Sarandon, Winona Ryder, and Christian Bale . . . lovely, true to the spirit of the original work, and the scene depicting the death of Beth (played to perfection by Claire Danes) breaks my heart, no matter how many times I see it. AS FOR THE BOOK . . . it is dated and preachy and quaint for the modern reader, no doubt; still, it is easy to see why the work has endured through the years. All the universal themes of family togetherness (and the pain of separation), self-sacrifice, faith, joy, love, and hope in times of war and deprivation and hardship (what family today with a loved one in a war zone could not relate to the March family of 1861?) -- we recognize ourselves in the book despite the Victorian mannerisms and concerns, and the sometimes stiff dialogue Alcott produced. I know I read it years ago, but I've forgotten so much detail (or perhaps the movies have dulled my recollection of the book, which is quite likely) that it seems almost a first reading.

In a very precise way, their lives together are documented in accordance with the times - of what's expected of them as women and what contradictions arise and also social situations that demand attention to several of the sisters.The characters are almost unreal - they're so exaggerated that one cannot help to relate SOMEHOW although weakly to any of them. Even the trials and tribulations warrant a very soft feel to them. I found myself emotionally detached to most of the situations and was scanning after near half of the reading and I feel as if I had gotten just as much out of it as I had previously.If you're going to read it, be a 7 or 8 year old girl learning the value of friendship and family and other kindly things that involve morals, love, and adaptation to change.Otherwise, read Anne of Green Gables instead.

Meg, who is sweet and shy, is also the oldest, Jo is a tomboy but also has a gentle heart, Beth, who is very down to earth and ends up with a undeserved ending, and Amy, who learns that she is selfish and does change her ways, are all the most wonderful sisters and characters anyone could hope for in a classic like this!

Her warmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and sweet stories of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel poverty with their mother Marmee; their father is away in the Civil War. Despite having little money, the girls keep their spirits up with writing, gardening, homemade plays, and the occasional romp with wealthier pals. Their pal, \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, joins in and becomes their adoptive brother, as the girls deal with Meg's first romance, Beth's life-threatening illness, and fears for their father's safety.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding (if not to the man of her dreams, then to the man she loves). Things rapidly go awry after the wedding, when Laurie admits his true feelings to Jo -- only to be rejected. Distraught, he leaves; Amy also leaves on a trip to Europe with a picky old relative. Despite the deterioration of Beth's health, Jo makes her way into a job as a governess, seeking to put her treasured writing into print -- and finds her destiny as well.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women.\\" Not surprising -- the March girls really are like the girls next door. Alcott wrote them with flaws and strengths, and their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster -- have the feeling of authenticity. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.Sure, usually classics are hard to read. But \\"Little Women\\" is mainly daunting because of its length; the actual stories flow nicely and smoothly. Don't think it's just a book for teenage girls, either -- adults and boys can appreciate it as well. There's something for everyone: drama, romance, humor, sad and happy endings alike.Alcott's writing itself is nicely detailed. While certain items are no longer in common use (what IS a charabanc anyway?), Alcott's stories themselves seem very fresh and could easily be seen in a modern home. And as nauseating as \\"heartwarming\\" stories sometimes are, these definitely qualify. Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.Jo is the quintessential tomboy, and the best character in the book: rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and Beth just avoids being shown as too saintly. Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, but by her teens she's almost as good as Jo.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. Louisa May Alcott's best-known novel is a magnificent achievement."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I purchased a copy of this book strictly based on the graphics of the cover.

This cover is disgusting. I was hoping to find a lovely copy of this book for my sister as a gift because she loved the copy I purchased for myself a while back. Mine is from Borders classics but unfortunately I don't think they are making the same copy anymore. It is a beautiful hardcover, fabric covered, bright red with gold embossing and nice victorian female silhouettes. I was hoping to find her something comparable. I don't know why they decided to make beautiful fabric versions of other classics such as Pride and Prejudice and Jane Eyre which i have purchased and love, but to release this horrible version of Little Women. I truly wish they had made it along the lines of the faric covered hard cover classics. I guess this was an attemt of modernizing a book which doesn't need to be modernized in order to be loved, that is what makes it a classic after all.

Thewarmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and fun little anecdotes of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel New England poverty with their Marmee, while their father is away in the Civil War. The girls don't let lack of money hamper their fun and happiness. But their world starts to expand when Jo befriends \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, and soon he and his tutor are almost a part of their family.Along with him, the girls encounter many of the bumps of growing up -- the destruction of Jo's treasured writing, romps with wealthier pals, Amy's expulsion from school, and Meg's reluctant first romance. But their lives are turned upside-down when Beth contracts scarlet fever, and they receive news that their father has been seriously injured -- and these crises threaten to destroy the heart of their family.The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding -- if not to her dream guy, then to her love. But while time has mellowed and matured the Little Women, it hasn't lessened the capacity for conflict and unintentional comedy -- particularly with the now-attractive Amy, whose attempts to pursue art, culture and the appearance of wealthy sophistication usually go horribly wrong.But the platonic friendship between Laurie and Jo is shattered when he admits his true feelings to her... and gets rejected. Distraught, he goes to Europe, as does Amy with crusty old Aunt March. And left in New England, Jo is faced with the question of what her life has in store, despite Beth's picturesquely poor health. Her new job as a governess leads her to put her treasured stories into print... leading her to love and her future.There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women\\" -- and since the March girls really are like the girls next door, this doesn't exactly come as a shock. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays a post-\\"blood and thunder\\" Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.And it does. Alcott's writing is a warm, smooth string of interconnected stories, some of them quiet and some peppered with silly jokes, moments of tragedy, poetry, and unintentional humiliation (\\"Salt instead of sugar. And the cream is sour\\"). Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.The best part of this book is the March girls themselves -- they have flaws and strengths, ambitions and dreams that never quite turn out as they expect. And their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster, or Meg's makeover at a rich friend's house -- have the feeling of authenticity.Lovable Jo is the quintessential tomboy -- rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and while Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, by her teens she's almost as likable as Jo.It must be admitted that Beth is not quite as endearing -- she's canonized with the 19th-century approach to the deceased, and so is continuously sweet, loving and understanding. But Laurie makes up for this: a wealthy, artistic, passionate young man who goes through all the growing pains, as he tries to be worthy of the girl he adores. Don't worry, things turn out all right for him.\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today.

I was quite disappointed compared with other audiobooks that I have listened to."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Set during the Civil War, \\"Little Women\\" is the story of the four March sisters. Meg, the oldest, is sixteen and very much into being a \\"young lady\\". Jo, fifteen, is the exact opposite of Meg, a tomboy who hates everything girlish. Beth, thirteen, is a homebody, always cheerful and looking at the bright side of things. Amy, the youngest, is loving but a bit selfish and shallow. The March's don't have much money, but they are rich in love and that love carries them throughout the course of \\"Little Women\\" which takes place over a span of ten years. The March's have many adventures as they grow up, several of them with their next door neighbor, Teddy Laurence. There is joy and sorrow in their lives, but the love they have for each other carries them through everything.\\"Little Women\\" is old fashioned, sentimental but not too sentimental, and a wonderful book to read. The book is partially autobiographical, based on Louisa May Alcott's own sisters and the love she had for them is evident throughout the book. There are heartbreaking parts which make me cry each and every time I read \\"Little Women\\", yet there are heartwarming and comical moments that make me smile every time I read it. The four March sisters are very realistic, even Beth, who is almost too good to be true. Alcott was an imaginative writer who could make inanimate objects, such as roses, seem alive. \\"Little Women\\" was originally written in two parts and Alcott's style changes a bit in the second part, as she addresses the reader directly and at times delivers little \\"sermons\\" to her readers.\\"Little Women\\" is a delightful book for readers young and old."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I love to read and have begun reading many classics. My teacher recommended \\"Little Women\\" for me to read. So, I went off and bought it at the bookstore. In this edition you read an introductin first which I thought was a bit boring and long. It tells about the back round of the author and how this book was made. This story is broken up into two parts. The story starts out with four girls- Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. Their father is away at war. The first part of the story was too drawn out I thought. There is a description for everything. I did however enjoy reading it. The second part had a lot of action. There are weddings and births, and sadly even a death. It was more paced then the first part. I think Jo had the best character. She was so realistic. All in all, I thought this story was pretty good and I am not disappointed in it. I am very happy I read it. I know it is a classic and I do understand why."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This particular hardcover book is an abridged version of the books Little Women/Good Wives, (The movie is actually the two books filmed in one). The text is sort of a mixture between what happens in the actual books, and what happens in the movie, a happy medium.It is all in colour and has beautiful big colour picture stills from the movie. Some being of the four girls together and individually, Marmee, Lauries proposal, Jo and the Professor, Amy and Laurie. A good read for a younger person who doesnt want to go through the two books, but even better for a fan of the movie.FYI- If you are interested in one that doesnt have a dustjacket from Amazon, it's exactly the same underneath so you don't have a blank cover, still the big glossy picture and text."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"As much as I enjoyed this book when I was a girl, I still enjoy it now. It's a wonderfully warm tale of family love. There is tragedy, but from that tragedy comes hope. Real family values are taught by this book. It is a story about four sisters and their mother. Life deals them a series of blows, and the story is how each of these remarkable women persevered, and how they actually got the better of life. Miss Alcott has a real knack for characterization, and each of her characters in this story are so very real. If you've read this book before, but not for awhile, I strongly suggest that you take it up again. There are unlimited surprises in store, not the least of which is how much you'll enjoy reading this book again."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"this book was such a lovely book.

I don't know what took me so long to read it, I've seen the movie version a few times.The four March sisters named Meg, Jo, Amy & Beth live in a cozy home with their mother 'Marmee' while their father is away in the Civil War. The family was wealthy at one time, but it is hinted that he helped a friend who did not repay the debt, and that is how the family ended up living in poverty. The girls do feel sad having so little, but their mother reminds them that they have more blessings than most.The one thing I didn't like about this book was that it got real 'cheesy' at times. At one point Jo and her professor are singing together out loud in front of family, him in his German accent none the less...lol. It also tends to get 'preachy' as well at times. Looking past that, I highly recommend Little Women. I found it to be a 'comfort book', a very sweet read. It's about family, friends and love."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"In researching whether or not this is \\"half a book\\" I found the following information: Alcott wrote a second part, which was published in 1869. Both parts were called Little Women, or, Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy. Part II picks up three years after the events in the last chapter of the first part Little Women (\\"Aunt March Settles The Question\\"). In 1880, the two parts were combined into one volume, and have been published as such in the United States ever since. In the UK, the second part was published under the title Good Wives, though Alcott had no part in the decision.So, I guess you could say this is half a book but only in the U.S.I do have a problem with Amazon's search engine not being able to find this book. Maybe because they don't stock it?"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Not sure what I can add that other previous reviewers haven't already added except to say I liked it too!

Presenting an idealized view of life beginning in Civil War era New England, it gives a glimpse into the world of their class and time.

They are faced with many challenges they must overcome bringing them closer and closer. Little Women brings the trials and tribulations of young people dealing with family crises, the mending of broken hearts, and the death of a loved one. The four sisters of the March family, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy manage to live their lives willingly, and interesting lives despite their father at war and the lack of money the family has. The closeness bondage of the sisters intrigues you as you read through the long, but exhilarating book. The love that the March family share is remarkable and leads to my jealousy due to the childhood I grew up without siblings. Marmee March is the mother of the family and holds the family together. She displays infinite wisdom in dealing with her daughters and also shows unlimited patience with an exceptionally charitable nature. Marmee also diligently teaches them the lessons they need to achieve a happiness that will carry them through their adult life.The story of these sisters describes Meg's joys and mishaps as a young wife and mother, Jo's struggle to become a writer, Beth's tragedy, and Amy's artistic pursuits and unexpected romance. Meg, the oldest, is somewhat vain and does not like the poverty status she has to live. She dreams of having money to spend on beautiful clothes and live like the rich society girls that have become her friends. Jo is the second oldest, and is the tomboy growing into maturity with a quick temper. She is always quick to chastise her inner self and live the values that Marmee has taught her. Her main goal in life is to be a writer and she spends endless time pursuing this goal. Beth is the quiet, very shy, child who is third oldest who strives to help the less fortunate in any way she can portraying herself as an angel. Amy is the youngest, who is quite selfish and spoiled. Her desire in life is to be an artist in which she diligently looks for the beauty in the world around her to paint on canvas and dreams of painting in Paris. Alcott portrays the characters that make them come to life as you read and the thrill you have that lures you into reading more and more. This book leads you to realize what family love is."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Little women is a timeless masterpiece in which Louisa May Alcott describes the lives and adventures of four sisters coming of age during the Civil War. Alcott shows the trials and tribulations of young people dealing with the death of a loved one, family crises, and the mending of broken hearts. Readers today are still inspired by the lessons taught by Marmee on how to be a good person and how to achieve happiness in life.Marmee (Mrs. March) is the mother of the family and the glue that holds them together. She displays infinite wisdom in dealing with her daughters and also shows unlimited patience with an exceptionally charitable nature. Her main goal in life is to be a pleasing wife and secure the happiness of her dauthers. She diligently teachs them the lessons they need to achieve a happiness that will carry them through their adult life.In reading this novel it gives the reader a glimpse into what its like for women growing up in the 1800's. Readers today remain inspired by Meg's devotion to her family, Jo's commitment to her writing, and Beth's willingness to help the ones she loves. Meg is the oldest sister. She is plump and beautiful with a sweet temper and very motherly. She appears to be somewhat vain and does not like the poverty status she is reduced to living. She dreams of having money to spend on beautiful clothes and live like the rich society girls that have become her friends. She fights a constant battle with her feelings even into married life but comes to the realization that she will be content with what she has rather than spend her life wishing for a wealth she will never achieve. Jo is the next oldest and the main herione. She is very much the tomboy growing into maturity with a quick temper. She is always quick to chastise her inner self and live the values that Marmee has taught her. Her main goal in life is to be a writer and she spends endless time pursuing this goal. Jo's personality is real and evokes sympathy from the reader in her attempts of trying to fit into a society that she doesn't relate to and falls short of those expectations. Jo's quick temper proves to be a constant battle for her but she diligently battles her demons while being consumed with self doubt. She works very hard to be a good and pleasing child to her parents. I feel her character most resembles the author's life. Alcott goes to great lengths to paint a picture of Jo's character giving great detail and attention to explaining her because she most likely understands her the best. She is very self sacrificing and has a strong maternal instinct to her younger sister, Beth. After the death of her sister Jo tries to become her sister in an attempt to hold on to her. This was her way of keeping Beth close to her but she soon realizes that given her rebel nature it will not work. Beth is the quiet, very shy, child who is third oldest. Throughout the first half of the book I wanted her to blossom and mature to become a personality that would equal her sisters. This never happened as she always seemed to be content with her state of life and wrapped herself up in her cats and dolls while tending to the minute details of the house trying to make it as happy as possible. If this was her allotment in life she achieved it very well. I thought of her as a little angel. Amy is the youngest, being quite selfish and spoiled. Her desire in life is to be an artist in which she diligently looks for the beauty in the world around her to paint on canvas. Amy is, however, to be admired for her persistence in dealing with the elite society and striving to rise out of her poverty stricken life which she accomplishes by marrying Laurie, the rich boy next door. But instead of just enjoying her wealth the couple decides to use that wealth to help the less fortunate.Little Women serves as a reminder of just how fragile life and feelings can be. Alcott breathes life and existence into the characters that makes them come to life on the pages before you. The reader feels as if they are a part of the family. I had feelings of joy when they succeeded and sorrow when they didn't. When Beth was very sick I could sympathize with Jo and I also wanted deperately for her to recover.Alcott does not profess openly any political or religious beliefs but the story has undertones of the beginning of the women's rights movement and it suppports religious beliefs of the Quakers while promoting the ideals of married life. Quakers in those days believed that divine relation was immediate and individual; all persons may perceive the word of God in their soul. It recognizes the presence of human evil and works to eradicate as much as possible. The girls definitely followed these beliefs. When Meg was having marital problems after her twins were born it was Marmee that told her, \\"A woman's happiest kingdom is her home, her highest honor the art of ruling it not as a queen but as a wise wife and mother.\\" In the end Jo inherits the estate of her rich aunt. Prior to this time in history women were not allowed ownership of property and centainly not the right to vote. A woman was discourged from concerning themselves about politics. But Marmee gently suggests to Meg this may be a way for her and her husband to reconnect. This would also explain why the book is more self-centered on the characters than the realities of the era which are not brought into focus.I would not read the book again but I did feel it was worth reading the first time and I am glad I did. I would very much recommend it to anyone searching for a book that you could relate to the characters and can't help care about them"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"There's a reason why some books like Little Women manage to live on for years and years after it's been written and that is simply because they're wonderful, timeless stories. Little Women is definitely one of them. I still to do this day consider it one of my favorite books, as my tattered copy will prove. You can't help but fall in love with the main characters as you get to know them so well over the length of this book. While I must admit that each time I reread it I hope and pray that by some miracle Jo won't refuse Teddy, I always finish it happy that I was able to be a part of the March's little world. It's a wonderful book for young girls as the lessons to be learned in it are numerous. Read it with your daughter and you won't regret it."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I'm so glad to see that the cover and illustrations for the hardback version of LITTLE WOMEN have stayed the same; this book (along with Frances Hodgson Burnett's A LITTLE PRINCESS) were staples of bedtime reading when I was growing up, and as I became an avid reader on my own later on, LITTLE WOMEN revealed more layers to me. Some people think of it as old fashioned, when actually the novel was considered unconventional in its time, focusing as it does on what is -- for the first half of the book, anyway -- a single parent home made up entirely of women. The girls in this story are DOERS, and their lack of funds don't hold them back from attempting things. (In fact, it pushes them to be imaginative, as when Jo ruins her gloves with lemonade and can't go to a dance, so Meg lends her one of her own clean ones to wear and they both carry a stained one. Genius, Meg.) The second half of the story, especially, has scenes of tender drama, which is one of the reasons the material has been adapted to the screen so successfully and repeatedly over the years. (Was there a dry eye in the house when Winona Ryder came across Claire Dane's dusty childhood trunk in the attic and ran her hands across it?) The bond that the March sisters share is extremely moving, and like all good drama, it's based in recognizable human emotion. I've always been at sea when my gay friends report that they've &quot;come out&quot; to their brothers or sisters. Aren't siblings the people you walked to school with for years, the people whose diaries you shared or broke into, the people you ran away from home with for an afternoon? How could they not know you to begin with? LITTLE WOMEN is primarily about that bond, and it's a great, malleable dramatic subject."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"LITTLE WOMEN BY LOUSY LOUISA MAY ALCOTT( I THINK THAT'S HER NAME ) IS THE UTMOST WORST BOOK YOU WILL EVER READ IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Most people love it but I did not"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This is a book that I'd heard about all of my life, so I figured I ought to finally read it. Unfortunately, it is truly miserable. I would have given up on it about halfway through, but our internet died for a few days so I wasn't able to download anything else from the library.To be fair, the book was written for prepubescent girls, and I am (at the time of this writing) a 38-year-old man. But I have to believe that even the target audience - in this generation at least - would find it a slog.This book features the March family - primarily Mrs. March and her four daughters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy. It describes the daily joys and travails of these mid-19th century New England women. Unfortunately, nothing much happens to them. Trivial events - such as a disastrous meal, or a picnic lunch are the subjects of full chapters. The girls mostly sew, do their chores, play outside, eat, and sleep. The book is full of moral lessons, admonishing us all to be selfless, good, pure, and true. Some of these morals are timeless, and good behavior is something we can all aspire to. But the lessons are delivered with as much subtlety as a sledgehammer, in such a cloying way, and with so many superlatives as to make you want to stick a finger down your throat.The book also has lessons that are not (thank God) timeless. Three out of four of the little women who feature in this book have interesting talents: Jo writes, Amy draws, and Beth plays music. Each initially aspires to do something great with her talent, but these dreams are summarily squashed. By the end of the book, and with the admonition that \\"talent isn't genius\\", Alcott has impressed upon her audience that such dreams are almost always fanciful. The lesson seems to be: harbor such dreams at a young age if you must - - but in the end, you'll be much happier if you get married, have kids, live puritanically, and take care of your husband.

Also, as I learnt some years ago in my teachingdays, this is not a book to be used in the classroom. It is best savedfor long winter days, when reading a chapter can be a daily visit withappealing friends.Much of it is way too puritanical for mytaste. Daughters cannot so much as have their rare good breakfast onChristmas Day, and presents need to be sacrificed because how can oneenjoy oneself when soldiers are not? But the characters are oftenvivid, and the relationships between the sisters are quiterealistic.That said, it does tend to be a winner. The very youngtend to focus on the fun parts rather than the New Englandcongregationalist preaching ... don't spoil it for them, at the youngage, by telling them just why the Alcotts, on whom this work wasbased, were the &quot;poor&quot; outcasts in the wealthyneighbourhood. END"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I hate to say it but this is a book designed primarily for women. I am a male and I would have to refrain from calling it a classic as it failed to cross the sexual divide. The characters are well developed and undoubtedly you care for the four children and their mother especially. The girl's lovers are unfortunately less developed as characters and they come across as prissy men. The plot is overlong and unexciting. Is there even a plot? However the plot of Emma was also non-existant but the writing had an edge to it that dismissed any boredom. Unfortunately boredom can creep in while reading this tale. The death of one main character seemed to drag on and on and on... Am I the only person in the world who rejoiced upon reading that the girl had passed on. &quot;About bloody time!&quot; I cried. I thought about giving this book a solid three stars but that would have been too generous. It is regarded as a classic but to me it was a sentimental piece of rubbish. 2 generous stars"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"She is better then any other writer! Sakespeare is tied with her. Alcott saw her life and made it into a gorgeous book and then followed by her school life as a teacher. She is a role model for me since I am a wtirter trying to publish a book. She deserves the top star."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"i am athirteen year old girl who today finished the book little women on my kindle. to be honest i normally stay far away from classics as i can because they bore me. after reading little women, i was positively and negativley surprised. i loved learning thestory of meg, jo, beth and amy. it was much more interesting than i originally anticipated which was lovely. the charaters were all well thought outand each one had its own unique personality. my favorite charaters were jo nad laurie when they were together. they had such nice chemestry and although they had good reasons for not marrying i wish they had ended up together. for the cons of the novel well they were just some parts that had begun to bore me to the point that i continually announced to my family that i was dropping the book. however i kept reading it and it would eventually pick up again. the last fifteen percent of the book was the hardest part for me to keep focused though the ending was marvelous as it turns out. over all i thought this book was pretty good just not worth 4 or 5 stars."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"The book was absolutely wonderful!! But the introduction was written in very bad taste. The insinuations were offensive and with out just cause!!Had I read the introduction before I purchased the book, I would have chosen another copy. I had purchased it and then read the introduction, so as I write, the pages have been cut out of this book. Louisa May Alcott did not deserve the insinuations from this person."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I had to read a novel for my high school English class. I picked &quot;Little Women&quot; because I had seen all the movies. I thought that I would be able to get through the book without concentrating, or wanting to...but was I wrong. Not only did I enjoy the book, but it was different from the movie which made it exciting to read. Meg- the mature one, Joe-the adventurous one, Beth-the fragile one, and Amy- the pampered one come together to prove how important love is. One would not expect that these four &quot;young women&quot; have the knowledge and intelligence to not only teach, but make an impact on the reader's life. But they do! Throughout the life of these girls, they suffer a great deal of hardships. Their father is at war, and their mother forced to leave for a great deal of time. These girls manage to take care of themselves and eachother, never forgetting the lessons their mother has taught them. Read the book. It is about 450 pages and it took me two weeks. (That is only because my English teacher made me keep a journal). The great thing about this book is that it did not spend 50 pages giving an introduction to the story. The first line is a quote- most of the novel is dialogue which also makes the reading easier. I recomend it. For school, or just recreational, &quot;Little Women&quot; by Louisa May Alcott is a book that every 11-18 year old girl should read."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I read Little Women when I was a Little Woman. I just recently decided to buy it for my daughter and read it again. What a classic! This is a must for anyone's reading list both male and female. The story chronicles the March family, in particular one of the daughters, Josephine March. It is a story of hope and love. This is not a love story of romance, but one of tender, unconditional love that exists in a family of a mother, father and four very different daughters. There are moral lessons throughout the book that are refreshing and the character of all the girls comes through vividly. Alcott does a wonderful job devloping the different personalities of her characters. There are lessons for young people written between the lines on strength, wisdom, love, patience and quiet service. Boys and girls alike will benefit from the examples of polished and refined manners. A beautifully wirtten story that well deserves the label of a Classic.Just a note about this particular copy--We like to buy classics that are nicely bound and not cheap looking. I was a little hesitant to buy this online. I was pleasantly surprised when it came in the mail. It is nicely bound. The cover is hardcover cloth. The pages are not great quality but are sturdy and seem \\"old fashioned\\". It was a great value for the money and as well, looks good on the shelf. I am expecting it to hold up to lots of readings!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I love the novel and have been given several copies over the years, but I actually bought this edition.

Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Little Women is one of my favorite books of all time! In this heartwarming story about four sisters growing up during the Civil War, I have learned so much about the world around me, and ironically, myself. It tells of how people can choose to live their lives and how happiness can be found even through hardships.The Marches are a picture of a happy home - with brave and moral Father, who has gone into the army to do what he can for the North's cause, and kind, caring Marmee, who watches over her girls with gentleness and love. Then, there's the little women: sixteen-year-old Meg, who's pretty and mature; rough-and-tumble Jo, determined to become a famous writer; timid Beth, always putting others before herself; and spoiled Amy with her artistic talents. There's also their amiable neighbor, Theodre Laurence (Laurie). Join in on the fun and read all about Amy's trouble at school, Jo's precious book being burned, Meg going to &quot;Vanity Fair,&quot; Beth's tragedy, and so much more! I highly recommend this book for guys and girls of all ages! No one can resist this incredible story!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"The story of four sisters, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy is one that will forever be a part of American liteary culture. Set in the mid-1800s in a small New England town, Louisa May Alcott invites the reader into the home of these four sisters as they deal with the struggles of having a father off fighting in the Civil War, having to mature and grow up supporting themselves with little jobs here and there and finding out about the joys of love, children, and the sadness of death. This coming of age novel follows Jo mainly as she is faced with the day to day choices that will help her sisters and mother make it through the harsh New England winters. My nana gave this book to me and I hope to continue on the tradtion of passing this book on. It's a wonderful book to be shared by mothers and daughter and granddaughters alike since it shows the true spirit of women."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Little Women focuses on the four March girls; Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, as they grow up from childhood to adulthood. The characters in the book try to teach each other helpful lessons about life, virtue, and morality. The novel is a real eye opener for everyone. Each of the mistakes the girls in the novel make are intended to provide some guidance for the reader. Society is explained, the harsh winters are described, and the profound work ethic of the people is described to also give the reader a strong sense of what life was like during the nineteenth century. I can strongly relate to all the character's feelings which are strongly depicted in Alcott's writing. I firmly believe all teenage girls should read the novel to hopefully be as strongly influenced as I was. The girls are constantly troubled by the necessity of being good, even when they feel the desire to be bad. There are also many issues on relationships between girls and boys. Friendship turns into love and vice versa, making a strong theme out of gender relations. The girls also struggle with the ideas of motherhood, sisterhood, pride, education, and marriage. After reading this novel, the reader will hopefully look more at their own life and his/her morales. Through the novel there is clear representation of the benefits of what good does."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Buy this book now because in a year or two you'll want to read it again -- no matter what your age.I think I read Little Women first as a preteen. I identified strongly, probably like most girls, with the protagonist Jo, a tomboy who struggles to find her place in society. But as the years have worn on, I have found myself returning again and again to this enthralling story. The book has an emotional impact unlike any other I have encountered.The girls' antics will make you laugh; alternately, the book features two of the saddest scenes you will ever read. If you want to become engrossed in another world, affected profoundly not just by the fictional girls but by the knowledge that this book is semi-autobiographical for Louisa May Alcott, read it. Little Women is wholesome but not boring; classic but not hard to read; better than all of the Little Women movies combined. At the heart of the book is pure love and goodness -- what we all long for in life."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I give this a one-star only for the introduction. The book \\"Little Women\\" itself is a wonderful and lovely classic. However, this Barnes and Noble edition with the introduction by Camille Cauti is what I have decided to rate and I give it a one-star rating. If you are wishing to read a 21st century review of a 19th century book and desire to bring into the story links to homosexuality and questioning the sexual orientation of the author, Louisa May Alcott, then by all means, buy this edition and read the introduction by Camille Cauti. I bought this book to give to my 12yo daughter not realizing the introduction would be discussing this topic ...I thought the edition a beautiful copy...cover picture, etc. It wasn't until later that I read the introduction. Altho. I did not buy this from Amazon(I bought it at our local Barnes and Noble store), I offer this review of this particular edition to provide others with awareness of the introduciton by Camille Cauti and her unfortunate 21st century analysis. If you wish to have this sort of analysis of this book in your personal home library, then so be it...buy this edition. If you, like me, wish to have a copy of a classic and lovely story of Little Women without the 21st century analysis, then do not buy this edition.

I stand corrected!I absolutely fell in love with Jo's tomboyish headstrong character and furthermore, I must confess that next to Dolores Price (from Wally Lamb's \\"She's Come Undone) and David Copperfield (Dickens' own), Laurie has become one of my all-time favorite literary characters.There are a lot of overly religious maxims being spewed forth in the first half of the book, but it was not enough to detract from my overall enjoyment. And while the book is \\"light hearted\\" in many respects, there are many serious topics worthy of graduate level discussion, such as the suppression of feminine anger and utilization and importance of self control, inner versus outer appearances, Victorian expectations of behaviors across classes and genders, and the cause and effect of the absence of the \\"father\\" for the sisters, as well as Laurie.My overall literary experience has been greatly enriched by having read this book and I recommend it to all who have not yet had the pleasure of reading it. Of course, I especially recommend it to those skeptics out there, like me, who think they already have the whole thing pegged for \\"fluff\\" :)Alcott's \\"Little Women\\" is, without question, an American masterpiece and deserves to be on the shelves with the \\"Huck Finn\\"s and \\"Great Gatsby\\"s."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I have read Little Women nearly every year since childhood.

I did not realise it then that the book we were reading was an abridged version .. that ends with the father returning home to his family. All through the years I've had vivid reminiscences of what I had read in the book .. the four daughters, the guy next door, the dinner party, Beth falling ill, day-dreaming .. for real life seemed to live in every page of that novel (like the dessert with a pinch of salt) and I could identify myself being in a similar situation almost every day.It wasn't until later, much later, that I realised that Louisa May Alcott's original novel ended very differently then I could have ever imagined. I happened to read the unabridged version a few months ago and it came as a big shock to me to realise that Beth had passed away. It was so sad. I wept. All these vivid characters had lived in my memory for all these years. They were an epitome of a caring family. It had ended all so well twenty years ago. And now, all of a sudden, brute reality struck. One sister was dead and the guy next door was torn between two sisters.Now that the ending has finally sunk in, I'd say that this novel is one of hope .. not of marriage alone as one reader points out. HOPE. This is what keeps us all alive. We all dream that one day we'll achieve something .. peace, prosperity, happiness .. and this novel reinforces that sentiment and can be rightly dedicated to &quot;those who dare to dream&quot;.Read this novel if you feel like saying &quot;If only ...&quot; and it's gonna make you say &quot;I will ...&quot;."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"this is a book filled with tons of adventures"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I am nine years old and read Little Women recently. This book is very poetic. I like the way the four girls are each interested in different things; for example Meg is very motherly, Jo is a tomboy and loves to write and do plays, Beth is shy and thoughtful and Amy is good at art and is very concieted. Some parts did go a little slow. It's very realistic because the girls do have some fights and act very much like sisters. Their father is at war and they are not very wealthy, but throughout the book they learn that they love eachother and have good times without money. They realize that without a lot of money they are really very lucky and also realize that there are others with money that don't have as much family love as they do.

I have been considering this question since finishing the book a few days ago.Hailed as one of the best books written for children, Little Women has stood the test of time and is still read by many today, clearing showing that most love this book...however, I did not enjoy it that much. This brings us to the difficulty in reviewing, as book critics, schoolteachers, and children the world over disagree with me.The writing is beautiful with descriptions of the girls, their home, and their lives..but I didn't really relate to any of the characters, even Beth or Jo, which would be the two most memorable of all the girls. I also wasn't caught up in the plot and found it easy to walk away from the book for days at a time.I would still recommend this novel as it gives a glimpse into another time and is an important piece of classic literature, but just don't expect it to be too riveting."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I've read \\"Little Women\\" several times through the years - the first time when I was about 10 years old I guess, and always enjoyed it.The story is simple and sweet, but I think it still carries a strong message about the strength in the bonds of women. Progressive for the time, Alcott presents in the March women different \\"types\\" - Meg, the pretty, domestic one; Jo, the tomboyish, independent rebel; Beth, the too-good-for-this-world moral angel; Amy, the flighty, spoiled, bratty princess - at least at first; and then Marmee, the redeemed wild child who is now their strength and moral compass. The men, while not maligned are almost incidental, serving as props to highlight the different personalities of the women.The characters are wonderfully developed, as we see them grow through the years. The setting is very well described - you can \\"see\\" the gardens and rooms. And again, having been written for young women, the writing is easy to read and follow, if a bit long-winded. Despite Jo's detailed character development, I feel her love story was rushed and not developed enough - as opposed to those of Meg and Amy. I imagine her relationship with Bhaer is delved into more in the sequel \\"Little Men\\", which I haven't read yet.Although I like the book very much I think it suffers in comparison with Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\". Even though the time frame of \\"Little Women\\" - during and after the Civil War - is almost 100 years later than \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" - late 18th century/early 19th century - I think Austen's classic feels more relevant.I definitely recommend \\"Little Women\\" to everyone, not just pre-teen and teen girls. It's a beautiful, well-told and surprisingly progressive story."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I first read this book when I was in third grade. I was about halfway through the book when I had to fling it across the room from me in utter horror. Eventually, the pull of the book was too strong: I picked it up, finished it, and sulked for a week. And ever since then, whenever I try to reread it, I end up tossing it across the room, screaming, pulling my hair: the characters just get under your skin. You *care* about what happens to them.The little women are Meg, Jo, Amy, and Beth. They have flaws, just like real people: Meg is vain, Jo is boyish, and Amy is a bit of a brat. Beth is utterly angelic, and can do no wrong. But while these may sound like pasted on personalities, they're not. Over the course of such a long book, you become deeply attached to the characters, and get to know and love them.The story centers primarily around tomboyish Jo. She is constantly getting into scrapes, but is dedicated to her family and goes to great lengths to prove it. It's a growing up story: we follow Jo from a carefree girl who whistles and runs outside to a wife who would give everything for her husband.Now for the bad: Louisa May Alcott is fond of injecting moral lessons into every chapter. That might have been nice in the 1800s, but now, it can seem a bit cloying. That said, the stories themselves are enjoyable enough if you can get past the morality.Further, this book offers some of the most emotionally dissatisfying scenes I've ever read. Hence me throwing the book across the room. I don't want to spoil it for you; you'll know it when you get to it. And you'll be as upset as I was. So be prepared.Overall, Little Women is a good family story with realistic characters. Young girls will probably enjoy it the most, but I think anyone can get something out of it."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I must have read LITTLE WOMEN when I was about ten years old, yet, it is one of those exceptional examples of literature that stays with you years after you've first come to know the March sisters, their trials, triumphs, joys and sorrow. This beautiful book truly captures the strength of family, the courage one must exercise in the face of great adversity and the wisdom we are lucky to acquire if we get through it in one piece. Jo March is the epitome of the irrerepressible, hot-headed and adventurous tomboy. Her character was actually based on the personality of the author, Louisa May Alcott. Meg is the eldest and the most traditionally-minded, Beth is the more retiring, shy and selfless one and Amy is the selfish and strategic one. Together, they all are devoted to and have great respect for their mother, Marmee March, and await the arrival of their father who is serving as a chaplain for the Union Army.LITTLE WOMEN is the first book in a series chronicling the lives of these intriguing and well-developed characters. Even more than one hundred years later, this book still presents timeless themes of friendship, courage, dedication, faith and determination. It's not difficult to see why this story was retold so many times in film."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This version of Little Women is only half the book, the cover says complete and unabridged but that is not true. It is not complete; it is only Part 1, which is very disappointing when you're expecting the whole book.I have nothing against the story, that is not why I rated this product low, I just thought people should know its not all of the story and have to be disappointed."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I just love this book!!YOU should READ THIS BOOK"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I had the great pleasure of reading the book \\"Little Women,\\" written by Louisa May Alcott, a story of real experiences and new feelings one experiences through the miracles of family and letting life take it's course; to live it to it's fullest. The March family is a true loving family who is as tightly woven as an old pair of blue jeans. In fact, they have as many stories to tell as old jeans that have been worn by so many. The March family had some hard times, but even burning of each others manuscripts can't put holes in their pockets. I believe this story is worth reading, because Louisa May Alcott defines si wekk in words how a family like the Marches can use their abilities for good and to learn a little more about life's true meaning. When I read this book I can see their life like I was a curious on-looker peering from behind a bookcase. I have become friends with these characters, and feel as if I had been a part of their noveled life. I became so engrossed in \\"Little Women,\\" when it was time for the light to go off I just realized that in fact I was not touring Europe with the Carroll's, I was laying on my old lumpy mattress with sleep nipping expectantly at my eyelids. To be truthful, the books I had been reading, such as \\"Babysitters Club\\" or \\"Vampires Don't Wear Polka Dots\\" hadn't been keeping me up so late that my light bulb flickered off with a sputter.There are not any faults in this wonderful story that my peering from behind the shelf could notice. It was as if Alcott wrote about her own real life and saw it from all her family's point of view.This book may be sad in some parts, but the blue jeans threads held it together. This was so inspirational to me I decided I should be a Beth or Jo. Maybe even a Meg or Amy. This book isn't just entertainment for the young (or even old) person's mind, but it is a lesson written to fit 400 pages. It can teach you about life, I recommend it greatly.I will not give away the ending, but here is the summary: a dear family holds on to each other through thick and thin, and with their friend's help they still are a family. The family gets smaller then bigger, and the book ends with one sentence, \\"Oh my girls, however long you may live, I never can wish you a greater happiness than this,\\" and this is where I end."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Alcott's 'Little Women' is delightful and heartwarming, ever since I started reading it at 10 years old. The novel never fails to show me how we all make mistakes, we all fail, and we all triumph. Some of my friends have told me the book is boring, slow-paced, and idealistic. Little Women is simply about a family facing trials during the Civil War, and every chapter presents a fresh situation with a good deal of humor too. Alcott's style allows you to feel you are one of the March family, and her development of all characters is fantastic. Her details and dialogue allow the story to flow smoothly, and I've learned a lot from this great piece of American literature. I never tire of reading Little Women. It's that wonderful."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I'm writing this review, not to tell you the classic story of Little Women, but to strongly advise you to buy this beautiful hardcover.

The pictures and layout of the book drew me in to read that book countless more times! Even now, I glance through the illustrations and remember how they enhanced my numerous readings.

Didn't someone edit it???Very dissatisfied and will be returing it."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I can't say I regret reading this book, since I did enjoy the descriptions of day to day life during a period of time in the U.S. (Civil War era) in which most writings of or about the time, focused on the war. Also, it is a classic and it's always fun to finally read something you've heard about for years. I have not seen the Winona Ryder movie version, but I'd like to, just to see how it compares to the book.Alcott's writing is provincial and preachy, though, and I thought her characters were two dimensional at most. I can't help imagining Marmee as a statue of the virgin Mary, with a frozen little smile on her face as she peers down on her children scattered around her. And Dad (what was his name?)! An image doesn't even form in my head about him. Jo rejecting Laurie is an interesting twist, but disappointing, especially when she falls for an old stodgy absent minded professor. Laurie was the only character given human qualities, and I couldn't help liking his grandfather, too. Beth was just unreal, and Meg was annoyingly subservient (I know, that was how things were back then). And how many times did her characters blush? If there was anything the sisters had in common, it was the propensity to change colors at the slightest whim. Otherwise, their qualities seemed mutually exclusive which, as another reviewer pointed out, doesn't seem realistic for sisters.To be fair, I realize this was written for a younger crowd than me, so I should not have expected edginess or depth. So there are my 3 stars."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"this is my favorite book of all time, one I re-read every year around Christmas time - nothing will ever be able to compare, even Pride and Prejudice (which is also one of my favorites).Little Women was originally written in two volumes: Little Women and then Good Wives; today these two books are combined, so will be my review... ((this may be a bit long of a review so bare with me - there is just soo much to cover in this book))Loosely based off of her own life, Alcott presents a story about four women who grow both individually and together as a family during times of trouble, turbulence, and peace. Each sister has their own hopes and dreams, and each sister finds their place in the world only after discovering heartache, pain, love, and loss. Jo, who is loud, rambunctious, hard headed and impatient, finds solace through her writing. She struggles greatly to find peace within her self and accept herself as she is. Meg, the oldest remembers a time when the March family was revered and was not in financial hardships, making it hard for her to accept life as is, all the while being kind and understanding to her young sisters. Beth, the quite and timid sister, who is always kind and sees the good in everyone and everything, desires nothing more than to remain at home with her family and dolls. Amy, the youngest of the sisters, is constantly concerned with how prime and proper she should look, act, and speak, but remains true to her character.Laurie, the boy next door, finds himself a home he never expected in the March household as he finds it hard to live up to his grandfather's expectations of him. He is seen as an older brother to all the sisters, never faulting in his devotion to them, that is until his feelings for Jo grow into something more. However, Jo is unable to see Laurie and he wishes and her desire to find her place in the world is never greater.You really see the divide between childhood and adulthood when each of the sisters go their own way: Meg gets married, Beth remains at home, Amy travels abroad to Europe, and Jo goes to New York (Laurie is also left to his own devices, first going off to college and then working for his grandfather in Europe). It is only when tragedy hits the sisters, are they all able to come back together, as new adult women.While this novel is filled with girls knitting, needlepoint, and darning (which were expected of women of the time), it goes much deeper than that. Alcott presents the constant struggle that many women had, and even many women of today, between their loyalties to their family as well as to theirselves, and trying to find a balance between the two. This is a wonderful novel that can teach anyone many different lessons about life and love and family."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"this is my favorite book of all time, one I re-read every year around Christmas time - nothing will ever be able to compare, even Pride and Prejudice (which is also one of my favorites).Little Women was originally written in two volumes: Little Women and then Good Wives; today these two books are combined, so will be my review...

The story of four sisters - Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy and their trials, tribulations, joys, and life with their beloved mother Marmee appeals on so many levels. These young ladies go through so much, and bear it all stoically, especially with their father being away during the Civil War.Jo, the protagonist in this story is a strong-willed, independent-minded young woman and the character that appeals to me the most. She chafes against the strictures imposed against the women of her time, and struggles with her losses whilst trying to establish herself as a writer. The themes in this novel are varied - poverty, family, friendships, grief, and female emancipation and are deftly dealt with. This will always be a classic and one I hope to share with my own young daughter in the near future."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I read this book for the first time 25 years ago. It was one of my favorite books as a child. Each of the girls is an amazing charactrer with her own strengths.I love this book as much today a I did when I first read it. There are no formatting issues with the kindle version and you can't beat the price!!A fantastic read that showcases the strength that is woman."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"i had heard of this book back in school... i am 27 yrs old now and read it for the 1st time and let me say i have no idea how i let this book slip for so long. it a wonderful story and i will always remember it. it a must read for all girls of any age. so glad i finally read it. would give more than 5 stars if i could."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Near the end of the nineteenth century, a family with four girls is growing up in \\"genteel poverty;\\" their lives derive much strength and goodness from the example and teaching of their loving parents. They are the March family, and they consist of Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy, guided by their loving \\"Marmee\\" while their father is away in the war.We first meet the \\"little women\\" when the older two are in their teens and the younger two are approaching those adolescent years. We follow their progress as they learn life's lessons via their beloved \\"Pilgrim's Progress.\\" We see their faith tested, and the goodness they strive for is elusive--especially for Jo and Amy.ThroughoutLittle Women (Signet Classics), we observe the warmth and nurturing they receive and which others long for but never achieve.I first read this book as a child; in fact, I read it over and over, until some of the more memorable moments were so completely ingrained that they became part of who I was at that time in my life.Now, many years later, I reread it, wondering what I would think and feel about this book. Would my own experiences in those interim years somehow change the story for me? Would my love of this book lessen because I am in a different place now? Well, I am happy to report that I read and achieved each milestone with the March family, all over again, with joy and delight; I remembered and celebrated those moments, almost as if I were reading them for the first time, yet with the extra special glow that comes from reexamining a beautiful treasure from the past.This adventure in reading was well worth it. Next I will be rereading some of the other Alcott books, knowing that I will surely enjoy them (again) as well.I am awarding this wonderful book five stars."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Somehow I missied this classic growing up and only downloaded it as I was looking for something to read with substance that was free. What a lovely tale. Definitely on my list of alltime favorites. I am now inspired to peruse more \\"great classics\\" I passed over in favor of NYT bestsellers in the past. Thank you Amazon."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I think the title of this book is wrong. They are women, but they aren't little. They are very mature for their ages. Beth is 13, almost like me, but she acts like she is Meg's age and above. Amy is a little whiner. She dislikes her nose and loves to paint. Jo is a dreamer. She has all the dreams of writing and such. Meg is the oldest. She has a job as a governess for two little kids. Little Women is a great book, although it gets a little lengthy."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I admit...I watched the movie so much to the point where I can recite it word for word. It is one of the best. Just to let you know it is the one that has the cast of: Susan Sarandon, Clair Danes, Kirsten Dunst, and Winona Ryder.The book was so lovely. It naturally has a lot more detail and happenings than the movie. Oh I loved it. It is a great classic. And it is deffinately in my top five."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Little Women, a classic novel written by Louisa May Alcott, is about four girls coming of age during the Civil War. It tells of the lessons they learn and how love conquers all. Even though I had seen the movie before I read the book, I found the book to be intriguing, romantic and kept me hooked from the beginning. The one aspect of this book I did not care for was how the author described relationships or objects, which went on for sometimes pages at a time. That was the only downside, beside it being over 750 pages and not letting me read any other books for a month.Otherwise, this was an excellent novel that I will remember and keep as one of my treasured books; it has taught me many lessons that I will remember always."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"The book Little Women, is about four sisters, Meg March,Jo March, Beth March, and Amy March, and their mom Marmee. The mother is rearing the four girls to be loving, responsible young women.They are living in the time of the Civil War. Marmee teaches them values that will result in happiness for each of them.The values would make them happy throughout their lives. The most important lesson Marmee teaches her daughters is love,and how to overcome their hardships.They achieved these things by through God, and the love of each other.Meg was the oldest at age sixteen. Meg was pretty and had soft hair. She worked because her dad lost his job and they needed money. Meg was a happy child. She sang with her sisters.Jo was the second oldest at age fifteen. She was tall and skinny. Jo sometimes acted like a tomboy. She had one beauty, her long, thick black hair.Beth was thirteen years old and very shy.Beth was timid and rarely left the house.

Its story of family love, loyalty, fun, daily life experiences, and sacrifice in difficult times is an inspiration to all readers. It is one of my favorite youthful reading memories!..."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"The book, Little Women, written by Louisa May Alcott, is the most captivating book I have ever read. I watched, and fell in love with the movie, but I never realized how much more I would get out of it, by reading the book. The famous saying, \\"Money can't buy you happiness\\", really shows through in this book. Living in the 1800's, during the Civil War, and very little money, the March family shows what little things can make you happy.At the beginning of the book, the four daughters are introduced, but as you continue reading, you become apart of their lives. Alcott really has a way of bringing out each character, and making them so strong and powerful. Meg, who is very mature and grown up, thinks about getting married and taking care of children. Jo, is the tomboy and doesn't seem to take anything seriously. Beth is the most selfless, and is always willing to do anything to help others. Young Amy tries so hard to be perfect and loved by society, but is spoilt and selfish. The March family is faced with many trials and tribulations, and fight so hard to overcome them, especially the death of a loved one. Through everything that they go through, they stay positive, and continue to follow their dreams.Reading this book, helped me to find the importance of family. No matter what happened to this family, they were always able to turn to each other for love and support. This is how I want to be able to live my life. Not to be poor, but to have such a strong bond within my family.I have read this book once, and I plan on reading it many times over, and hopefully passing it on to my daughter when she is old enough to read and understand it. I recommend this book to any women, whether they are young or old. I hope that whoever does choose this book, apreciates it as much as I did, and always will."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"With these four girls growing up together many other girls can easily relate to many of the simple problems that they encounter even though this takes place so long ago. From hair, dances, boys, and growing up. Little Women is a timeless classic that all are sure to enjoy forever!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Little Women is a period piece no mistake. I recall being quite mystified by certain aspects when I first read it at twelve. If the Marches are so poor how come they have a maid? (today household help is a luxury, back then it was a necessity. One woman simply could *not* run a home alone) What's so awful about having to work for a living? (middle and upper class girls were supposed to be supported in idleness by their fathers until marriage, having a job was quite declasse) I was fascinated by the idea of school being optional, (No public schools back then, and no truancy laws) and I'd never heard of 'Pilgrims Progress'.Yet dispite the increasing alieness of 19th century life most young girls fall in love with Little Women at some point in their development and I was no exception. I think it is character of Jo who captivates us. It is with her, restless and unconventional, that most of us modern girls identify not with goody-goody Meg, or pathetically saintly Beth or spoiled Amy."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Growing up in the March house is no easy task. Four girls growing up during the Civl War was hard for tomboyish Jo, gentle Beth, helpful Meg and exciting Amy. When they meet their wealthy nieghbor, Laurie, life becomes anything but boring.

I think that is why I rated okay instead of one star higher. The older language does make it a little longer of a read, not as easy to just read through. A great moral story, especially when you are or have gone through those moments in your own life. There is a little of everything for every girl/woman. Not a page turner, but definately lightens the heart."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Little Women (the book) is a great novel, and deserves 5 stars, it's wholesome and innocent, and it's a genuine classic ... but if you want the best edition of the novel, I suggest the Barnes&Noble print of it, and that's why I gave this review only 3 stars. The Barnes&Noble edition at their store is only about $10 and it's hardcover, you get the exact same words, PLUS ~ introduction, time-line, short bio of author, end-notes, and even questions and comments at the end about the novel... although I really love this painting on the Signet Classic paperback edition, the painting on this one is \\"Home Sweet Home\\"."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I quite enjoyed the book. Although it's long, I think it captures many readers because so many events happen, and so randomly.Little Women is the American classic tale about Margaret (Meg), Josephine (Jo), Beth (Elizabeth), and Amy growing up during the Civil War, with their mother, who they affectionately call \\"Marmee\\". Their father is off in battle, and while the girls are unhappy about being poor, they learn that they don't need that much to be happy.Meg is the eldest, at 16 at the start of the story. She has lovely dark hair, and is sensible and pretty. Jo is a regular tomboy who loves to write, and at one point cuts off her chestnut locks to help get money for her father. Beth doesn't have much of a physical description, but is very kind and sweet. Now Amy, who I don't like too much, has golden blond hair and blue eyes.This book was nice, but it rather focused too much on who's pretty and who's not. Laurie was a delightful character that added a lot to the book, however.I liked the chapters about Demi and Daisy, but I really didn't like the part when Jo dismissed Laurie, for I think they would have been perfect together. I also hated that selfish Amy went off and left poor Jo in misery so she could have a good time, AND stole Laurie away.While the outcome of the book is rather disappointing, this is truly a timeless tale of love and poverty, of life and death, and all the while very amusing."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I bought this edition of Little Women for my niece. I chose this edition because the product description mentions margin notes that provide a historical perspective. There are no margin notes! You get the great, classic story, of course, but the description is inaccurate. There are several illustrations, but be warned that the margin notes do not exist."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"When I started reading this to my children, I had to read ahead. Soon I had finished reading it to me, but not to them! My oldest has since read it. I liked this book so much better than Little Men and Jo's Boys. Girls coming of age really strike a chord with me. I wish I'd discovered these as a girl!I would highly recommend this classic for girls and women alike. The stories are engaging enough for boys as well, if they can get past the title. :) It definitely belongs on my list of my 10 favorite children's books of all time."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Girls of all ages should read this book and come back to read it again as women.

But that helped me to understand it, which payed off in the long run. If you're thinking of purchasing this book, a word of advise: Go for it!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Oooh, I have for years wanted to read Little Women by Louisa May Alcott, and I finally got the chance. This book is so amazing, you actually learn to love each one of the characters, yes, even that selfish and smoiled 'Lady' Amy March. The story focuses on four charming yound ladies, Margaret 'Meg', Josephine 'Jo', Elizabeth, 'Beth' (Who by the way is my favorite) and Amy March, these girls are tought several and important lessons, some softly and some a little more harshly by one of their greatest teachers, their mother, Mrs. March, called sweetly by the girls as \\"Marmee\\".The story begins, slowly and happily in what seems like a perfect world, even if Father is away at war. The sisters make new friends, attend elegant parties, and each find small adventures of their own, at home, at school and everywhere. Of course, things change, dark days come along, Meg is falling in love with Mr. Brooke, Laurie's (The Marches' neighboor) tutor and Jo fears that her sister might soon leave them, and poor shy, sweet Beth gets the scarlet fever, who at the end has very serious and sad consequences.There are happy and sad moments in this wonderful masterpiece, and I recommend anyone to read and enjoy them as much as I did."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I am a young girl myself like this book very much because it gives girls like myself something to read that is not inappropriate.

A must read!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This was delightful! I have wanted to read this book for many years and finally got to it, and I am SO glad! It is a wonderful story, full of charming characters, emotions, and situations which are amazingly relevant to todays world. I was truly surprised at how much the various situations in the book written nearly 150 years ago mimmick the same situations of today. For example, I laughed at the March girls getting ready to go to a dance, with all of their primping and preparations, burning their hair with a curling iron, etc. I could easily remember my own primping for school dances and picture my daughter and her friends getting ready for theirs. I was afraid that the language used might be quite stuffy or antiquated, given it is quite old, but didnt find that to be the case. I thought it amusing how often Alcott says they will have a \\"capital time\\". Obviously, the use of this phrase has not stood the test of time, but then again I wonder which phrases we use now will die with time too. The family goes through joys, troubles, and near tragedy, just as in real life. I cried when Beth was ill. I laughed at many of their antics. I loved the kind and quite manner of Mr. Bhaer. Laurie is such a treat and gives a nice balance to the girls. This is by far the best book I've read this year, and after reading it I only wish I would have read it sooner. I wanted the story to go on. I loved it!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This book really makes you think about what you would do in their place.

Delivered quickly and will no doubt order from them again."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"I first read this book when I was 29 years old, and I was really quite amazed. I was inspired to pick it up after seeing the opera \\"Little Women\\" by Mark Adamo, and I have to say that the book is really quite a lot better (and different, to my way of thinking) than the opera.Rather than being a ponderous, dull book, this was actually quite a good read. It's straightforward, making it accessible to kids, but it held my interest as well. There's not really a single well-defined plot, but rather a series of episodes in the characters' lives over several years, with a few common threads running through them.This is the type of book I would like my children to read someday (boys or girls!). Besides the obvious emphasis on family life, a very important underlying theme is an emphasis on virtue. In each \\"episode\\", the girls (and the boys too) learn something, \\"build character\\", or increase in virtue in some way, and the lessons they learn carry through the rest of the book. I found that incredibly refreshing in our post-modern age! (Contrast with the common notion today that \\"personality\\" is a rather privileged, self-defined thing, and challenges or obstacles must be negotiated so that the character can basically maintain his or her own unique identity, warts and all). Also an important theme in the book is finding our role in service to others - that we do not live simply according to our own whims and fancies. Sometimes we have duties in life that may seem unpleasant, but it is in the performance of said duties that we find fulfillment.*spoiler warning*Another common theme that I see running through this is that, through their marriages, each of the characters is given the opportunity to become a better person. So while we might wonder wistfully at what may have been with Laurie that Jo, in the end it is Amy that allows Laurie to grow into a virtuous and responsible man, and the Professor that allows Jo to move beyond her own self-interest. Similarly, Meg and John have a positive effect on each other, despite various trials.Perhaps this all sounds very old fashioned. The book is very clearly grounded in 19th Century Christian values. But a look at this book suggests that such notions are still very relevant today!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"My God-mother gave me this book. After chapter one, I was hooked, but since I'm not usually into the \\"classics\\", I was quite surprised at how much I liked it. I read this book in about 3 or 4 days. It's a must read. Read this one. Your eyes will thank you later."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Much to my delight I read this book after a semester of boring classes and this was the PERFECT distraction. Even as an adult (almost there anyway), I could identify with nearly all of the March sisters, moved to tears and laughter throughout the whole book. I recommend Little Women to everyone especially young girls - you will absolutely treasure this book. Another reviewer said it best - this book will make you late!"},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This is one of the most touching tales ever written, a classic. It is also one of the best books, along with Leah's Way and the Red Tent, ever written about women.

This book never gets old, and it will inspire future generations and generations. I wish more contemporary books strove for this kind of permanancy."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This book is just as much fun to read at the age of 33 as it is at 13. I laughed out loud and stifled sobs throughout the book as we watch the four March girls - Jo, Meg, Amy and Beth - turn from young girls to young wives. As I read, I worried that that description sounded a bit boring although it really is an entertaining book. Then it dawned on me that, as each chapter is a small vignette from the progress of their lives, this is a lot like watching Little House on the Prairie. This would be an exceptional book to read to children and is quite enjoyable for women of all ages to read for themselves.It was a bit of a blow when reading the afterword to find that Louisa Alcott did not like the book. She had been pressured into writing it by her publisher and regarded it as \\"moral pap for the young\\", calling the first part \\"The Pathetic Family\\" and writing an alternative second part she called \\"Happy Women\\" in which the sisters flourished in professional careers in a community of spinsters. \\"Good Wives\\" obviously won out and I can't say that I am not happy about that.One thing the book and the afterword did do is awaken an interest in Louisa May Alcott herself. This might be a wonderful place to start on a women's study given the disparity between the work produced and the authors ideals.Whether you are interested in reading it for sheer enjoyment or as a \\"jumping off point\\" for broader studies, you will enjoy the book. It is almost impossible not to."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This is a wonderful little book -a definite GREAT BUY!

While reading this book you will meet Amy, Meg, Beth and Jo. You will get to take adventures with Jo and see what it was like for her to br a tomboy, a writer, and an older sister.

The book is about the life of a small American family that is facing hardships and trials during the Civil War. It deals with holding on when things around you are failing and time is so precious. I recommend this book, and its sequels, to any person that likes fun, adventurous, and love stories that have to deal with the love of your friends family.Jo, Amy, Meg, and Beth are four sisters that care for each other very much. They are all very optimistic, and that helps them to stand their teenage years without their father and through many other hardships. They have a mother that loves them, Laurie a good friend, and Mr. Laurence a kind old man, to take care of them. All of the characters are very well rounded and have strong family ties within the book. Jo is wild and outgoing; she wants freedom but also respect. Beth is shy and very musical. Amy is only interested in pretty things in the beginning but soon grows up. Meg is friendly and tries to be helpful.The girls are all very upset when their father goes to fight in the war. They do their tasks willfully, but they begin to dwadle. Days become long and hard for the girls until Jo gets up the courage to ask Laurie if he would like to play. They all soon become good friends. However, being in the time that are, things go to terribly wrong . . .Little Woman is a wonderful book. I believe that everone should take some time to read it."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Little Women captures the heart of four young girls as they deal with a changing world, growing up, and the harsh realities of the Civil War.

It is a charming story about 4 sisters, Meg (Margaret), Jo (Josephine), Beth( Elisabeth), and Amy. The book includes the truth about real life. It's not perfect and the author, Louisa May Alcott, understands that and therefore includes some tribulations throughout the lives of these charming girls.

I was first attracted to the book because of the obvious factor: the youngest and most rebellious had the same name as me! I first read the children's edition to get the main idea of the story, then bought the original novel and read that. I was captivated by Alcott's style of writing and subtle-ness at important parts of the story so that the reader can decide for themselves what was about to or already has happened.I would suggest this book to anyone because it inspired me and I hope it will inspire somebody else."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"When it's cold outside, they huddle together. When they are sad, they are sad together. When they are poor, they work through it together. They are always there for each other. Little Women, by Louisa May Alcott was published on September 30, 1868. Even though that was over 100 years ago, it still captures the heart and attention of the majority of its readers. After their father was shipped off to war, Jo, Meg, Amy and Beth March lived with their mother, or \\"Marmee\\" as they normally called her. They lived a life together, and although they never seemed to have enough of anything, they almost always got along. They were very few moments when they didn't. The daughters are fairly creative and act out plays that Jo wrote by herself in her free time. None of them were old enough to work yet, so the family struggled together to stay together. At one point the March family was having so much financial trouble that Jo decides she has to do something for the family. She was very dedicated to keeping their family together. She must have felt that since they had so little to begin with, losing anything more would be unbearable. Jo went out and sold her beautiful long brown hair in order to earn money for the family. Back then, long hair was everything, so for her to cut it so drastically was a huge deal. Jo wants nothing more than for her family to be happy. This book doesn't really remind me of any other books. In most books, family problems and arguments are normal occurrences. However, in this book, family came first all the time. I think it should be that way, but realistically, that is not how most families work. Other books I have read are not very determined to show the bond a family maintains by spending time with each other. Also, I didn't like the way they kept their opinions to themselves during this story. I think that people are very open with their feelings, especially towards family members, but in this book they weren't. Even with the drawbacks I have mentioned about this book, I would still recommend it to everyone. It has a great storyline. I think it will make a place in your heart that will never close up."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"This is the best version of Little Women that I have ever read.

For example they respected thier mother greatly.Also when in need they helped one another. Jo sold her beautiful long locks of hair for a train ticket so her mother could visit her wounded father. Another example of maturity was when Beth knew she was dying she handled it in an adult way. The young ladies in Little Women should be called Not so Little Women because they &quot;came of age&quot; in this book."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"The book Little Women is truley a literature classic.

The girls have many adventures and meet Laurie, a true friend for life,and share many good times together. The girls begin to marry when they face the loss of one of their sisters and their aunt. However, in true March fashion, they get through the difficult times and focus on the successes in life. This book is truley inspirational and makes you think about how you can become a better person through sharing the experiences of these girls.

Of great hopes and tragedies. A story someone has to read till the end."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Louisa May Alcott's book, Little Women, does a great job of showing how five women and a lot of love can make it through anything.The plot of this book is adventurous. With every new chapter, there is an exciting new thing about to happen. Every chapter has a story involving one of the characters. As one chapter comes to a close, you can't wait to see what new adventure lies ahead.The best audience for this book would be women. Since the book is about a mother and her four girls, women enjoy it immensely. Teenage girls may also enjoy this book. The girls in the story are all in their teens, so it is easy for teenage girls to relate to. If you are younger than a junior high student, I wouldn't recommend this book.Other similar books are: Little Men and Jo's Boys. In fact you can buy these books in a set of three. They are all written by Louisa May Alcott, and they follow right after the one before. If you enjoyed Little Women, I would definitely recommend reading the other two. The style of writing in these three books is very much the same. If you wanted to know more about what happens to the family after Little Women was finished, then you would definitely want to check these two out.The themes and lessons in Little Women really go straight to the heart. Every chapter has it's own little lesson to be learned. The book as a whole has a great theme. This book gives hope to many readers and brings families closer. Mrs. March along with her four girls prove they can handle anything. The family is very close and each person portrays a different personality. They stick together through the good and the bad. The bond that this family shares makes others families want the same. Through every trial that life throws as them, they stick together and prove they can handle anything."},{"Title":"Little women; or, Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy,","review":"Little Women is one of the best books I've ever read.

Take my advice and read both Little Women and Jo's Boys."},{"Title":"America in Vietnam","review":"Though this book was published in 1978, only three years after Vietnam fell to the Communists, this book says some insightful things about the war in Vietnam and makes many valid points. Lewy demonstrates the superficiality of the more extreme opponents of the war--those who accused the US of violating international law but were blind to the horrors involved in the actions of North Vietnam and the Viet Cong. This is a well-researched and balanced study of the issues which engaged the interest of the world while the war was going on, and is illuminating and full of important information."},{"Title":"America in Vietnam","review":"Lewy's history of the war in Indochina is balanced and judicious.He is not an apologist for the war, but rather highly critical. He does, however, demolish the arguments of the Left that held the U.S. responsible for genocide, quasi-, de facto-genocide and war crimes as policy. He refutes these and other such claims in what are, in my opinion, perhaps the three most important chapters: \\"Military Tactics and the Law of War\\", \\"Terrorism, Counterinsurgency and Genocide\\", and \\"Atrocities: Fact and Fiction.\\"Lewy takes apart the assertions of the pro-Communist Left on their own terms, carefully citing international war crimes treaties and conventions, to show how such \\"legal experts\\" as Prof. Richard Falk have misinterpreted and ignored crucial sections of such conventions.He studiously compiles statistics on many U.S. atrocities and in no way tries to downplay their severity. However, his study of NVA/VC show that terrorism was methodicol, highly organized and an integral part of Communist strategy. They \\"rallied\\" the \\"support\\" of the population through a major program of murder. 37,000 people (80% civilian - typically school teachers and other potential anti-Communist leaders at the village level) were killed. Individuals were tortured and disembowled in the town square as their family and friends were forced to watch. Such acts had the desired effect of terrorizing the peasants into passive support. While holding Hue for 26 days in 1968, the NVA murdered and kidnapped some 5,800 civilians (many of whom were buried alive). A favorite NVA tactic was to shell civilian areas of major cities and massive throngs of civilian refugees fleeing South.The important distinction Lewy makes is that while American atrocities were perpetrated at the small-unit level by a few individuals who then tried to cover-up their crimes, Communist atrocities were official strategy, committed on a wide-scale. Those who committed them did not cover their tracks because they were in no danger of being penalized.Lewy also carefully examines the existing data regarding the proportion of African-American casualties to the number of African-Americans of draft age; the level of drug use among US soldiers; the incidence of racial violence among US soldiers; and the social condition of Vietnam veterans. The results are very interesting. Some myths are demolished.I don't mean to imply that the whole book is about war crimes and so forth. This is a general history that broadly asseses the major aspects of the war from the political to the military to the social.This is one of the best general introductions to the war out there. Another excellent starting point, though less comprehensive and more polemical, is Podhoretz's \\"Why We Were In Vietnam.\\""},{"Title":"America in Vietnam","review":"A testament to the quality of this highly readable book is the fact that it is still in print thirty years after its initial publication. That is all the more impressive considering that Guenter Lewy began writing this book only a few months after the fall of Saigon. History normally requires the detachment and distance that time offers.Lewy's central argument is that the United States failed in Vietnam because of the incompetence of its military. The person most responsible for this outcome was General William Westmoreland. Under Westmoreland, Americans sought out and engaged the North Vietnamese Army in big unit, fire-power intensive battles, ignoring pacification where Lewy and North Vietnamese General Vo Nguyen Giap believed the war was won and lost. The U.S. Army pursued this strategy out of ignorance, arrogance, and impatience. The Americans wanted to focus on what they did well--what are now called \\"kinetic operations,\\" which is to say combat,--and ignored things at which take too long and required skills they did not possess--understanding the land, people, and history of Vietnam.Although Lewy's overall argument is persuasive, putting the onus on Westmoreland is a bit unfair. The General never had command of U.S. Marine Corps or U.S. Air Force assets. Also, as Lewy points out, the flawed operational approach continued under Westy's successor General Creighton Abrams. Lewy also shows that there were several systemic issues that worked against the military. The caliber of officers diminished as the war progressed, because draft deferments allowed the \\"best and brightest\\" to avoid duty in Vietnam. The enlisted ranks also began to deteriorate. The heavy drug usage among soldiers was a product of the fact the military was taking more and more individuals who social misfits before they joined the service.Lewy tackles a number of issue, many of which were and still are emotionally loaded. He dismisses arguments that the war was immoral. All wars are cruel and to focus on the suffering is beside the point. Atrocities happened, but they were never intentional on a large-scale basis. Then enemy had a dirtier record than the United States in this conflict. He also dismisses allegations that the military doctored intelligence reports. This issue became a bone of contention between Westmoreland and CBS News and led to his famous lawsuit in the early 1980s. These charges were floating around long before CBS reported them and Lewy calls them \\"unfounded,\\" because the disputed figures did not reflect individuals that caught the United States off guard in the biggest surprise of the war, the Tet Offensive (p. 75.)Despite all these problems, the United States came much closer to winning than most people think.

The treasures of living are not always found in the end product, according to this book, but are found through the process of deepening relationships with God and other people.The eight lessons in Women of Purpose offer an abundance of real-life stories, along with Scripture, to lead women into a more intimate period of spiritual growth. One of the goals of the series is to \\"help women identify who they are, based on their unique nature and in light of God's Word.\\"Each chapter begins with a snapshot into the life of an \\"everyday woman.\\" Readers can easily recognize themselves in these scenarios. Next follows a brief look into the Bible for God's answers, and two more sections offer hope and relevant take-away points for life application.Like anything published by Focus on the Family, I'm impressed with the high quality and integrity of this tool. The author (Sarah O'Brien) has taken considerable measures to give women a useful tool for small group ministry. Since the book concludes with a leader's discussion guide, anyone can gather a few friends together and embark on this study - I'm ready to try it myself! - Heather Ivester, Christian Book Previews.com"},{"Title":"Women of Purpose (Focus on the Family Women's Series)","review":"This is just too easy.

The set is great and well made, but what was missing was a good set of instruction (they had a single sheet of paper with only 6 exercises) - I've never used exercise bands before.The Great Stretch Tubing Handbook was just what I needed. A real nice collection of well illustrated (photos) exercises. I also appreciate the extense set of stretching exercises.There is a great variety of upper-body exercises, but I do wish there was a little more lower-body.All-in-all a great little book -- even if it is 2 or 3 dollars more than I would expect to pay for a book this size."},{"Title":"The Great Stretch Tubing Handbook","review":"I found out about this handbook from my aerobic instructor. We use the stretch tubing with most of the classes. I immediately searched at Borders bookstore. Couldn't find it. Went online and found and ordered it from Amazon.com. I ordered one for me (a gym junkie who needs a stretch tubing routine for rainy days) and for a friend who works out at home with his home gym. We both agree that the handbook is very useful.The Great Stretch Tubing Handbook includes exercises that work each part of the body. If you want to maintain a toned figure the handbook is for you. It is not to be used for heavy \\"stretching\\".First there are a dozen stretches listed and displayed by a model. Then the exercises for: chest, shoulders, rotator cuff, back, biceps, triceps, forearms, core, and legs.The only equipment you will need is stretch tubing (or bands). The handbook explains how to make and use your door attachment.Each exercise (and stretch) is demonstrated by a model. You don't have to guess about how the movement is executed.Also, for those body-conscious folks, each exercise explains EXACTLY which muscles you'll work. Example: For the downward chest crossover: muscles worked = anterior deltoid, pectoralis major.pros:=low price=great photos=small enough to pack in a gym bag=easy to follow step by step instructions=general and specific descriptions of muscle groups being workedcons:=lots of instructions (for a newbie)=too small for someone trying to follow along (posters are available)"},{"Title":"The Great Stretch Tubing Handbook","review":"Injuring my upper arm and shoulder in a minor motorcycle spill, and refusing to pay $40/hr. for physio-therapy, I needed to find a less expensive alternative. The Great Stretch Tubing Handbook was the ideal guide for me. Using inexpensive tubing at home, I was able to exercise the exact muscle groups required and working slowly through the clear instructions and well demonstrated routines, I now have over 90% of my original mobility back in my left arm and shoulder. I found the section on the Rotator Cuff of particular interest for my application. The guide is colourful, simple to follow and a good value for [the money]-- when you consider I would have spent about $400 going to a clinic. Although I'll never use the latin names for the muscle groups in daily conversation, the body diagrams in the book provided a good review, should I ever need to talk to my Doctor about specific muscles."},{"Title":"The Great Stretch Tubing Handbook","review":"I liked this book very much.What was great for me about this book:1. Small format and only 64 pages.This book is small enough to take anywhere, it includes everything you need and nothing you don't.It doesn't waste pages on trying to motivate or make you feel good, it just tells you how to do it, exactly what I needed.2. Every exercise has a description of, not only how to do the exercise, but the reminders on how to protect yourself, like stabilize your torso and position of your feet. Some books only list these once at the beginning and are too easily forgotten, particularly in the home situation.3. Every exercise was on its own page.This meant I could scan each page, print it and display it on a wall while I was doing the exercise, great when you change the routine every 4-6 weeks for a reminder.4. The muscles targeted are listed with each exercise.This meant I could easily make up my own workout routine and know which major and minor muscle groups were included or excluded.5. Sample workout routine.This gives you the basics on how many exercises to include in each major area of the body and assists in planning my own variations.6. Muscle anatomy diagrams included.Knowing where the muscles are that the exercise is targeting helped me in correctly carrying out the exercises as well as the stretches.7. Stretches included.What was not so great for me about this book:1. Time required for stretching.There was no way I could do each stretch 3 times on a daily basis; this would have meant a minimum of 69 minutes of stretching daily, if following the recommended stretch duration of 60 seconds.I felt this recommendation was excessive; surely 30 minutes a day of stretching is enough.Either do each stretch once and hold for 60 seconds or do each stretch 3 times and hold for 20 seconds, would have been more in keeping with the time constraints of the average person.A suggestion of a variation for time poor average citizens would have been useful."},{"Title":"The Great Stretch Tubing Handbook","review":"If you intend on completing all the exercises in this book I'd highly recommend that you order a light, medium and heavy resistance band. Most of the exercises can be completed with a medium resistance band, however there are some that are impossible to do properly without light or heavy resistance. The \\"Bell\\" resistance bands have a door attachment but there are also instructions for creating your own door attachment using nylon cord/rope.The exercises are all fairly simple to do. The only problem I encountered was the fact that you had to keep changing the resistance band height in the door. This is a minor irritation that could have been prevented by putting all the exercises in a different order. In this book they are organized in the following order: Chest, Shoulders, Rotator Cuff, Back, Biceps, Triceps, Forearms, Core and Legs. So if you want a full-body workout you have to just adjust the band for each exercise. Some that might be familiar to you include:Incline Chest PressChest FlyeOverhead Shoulder PressSeated Low RowCrunchSquatIf you don't have time to go to the gym then these exercises are fun to do at home. The place I felt the work was mostly in my upper body and back. If you have any back problems you might want to try the light resistance band first. Once you have three bands you can just write the color of the band that works on each exercise.As with the Medicine Ball Workout, the easiest way to use this book (so it stays open) is to cut it in half. Then, simply punch holes in the corner of each page and put it on a metal ring. This will allow all the pages to lay flat when you are exercising. This book also includes a brief section on stretching, muscle diagrams and information on aerobic training. You can start with as little as 8 reps per exercise and work your way up to two sets of fifteen reps.~The Rebecca Review"},{"Title":"The Great Stretch Tubing Handbook","review":"I teach a group exercise class that uses tubing.

Perhaps that's true but I'm a beginner. Regardless of whether or not the book is for beginners it has many attributes:It is:Very well organized: It starts by explaining the pros and cons of Resistance Tubes and the difference between resistance tubes and resistance bands.It stresses and outlines very clearly with easy to understand language and excellent color photos on high quality paper:1. Warm up2. Using Proper Posture3. Using Proper Form4. Breathing properly5. When and why to stop training (e.g. pain)6. How frequently you should train,7. What the expected time duration for a training session is8. Understanding the goal of fatiguing a specific muscle group9. Range of Motion10. Speed of your movment11. the importance of proper form12. When and why the routine should be changed, and;13 Rest intervals between one exercise and the nextEvery exercise is beautifully illustrated and explains what muscles are being worked.The book is small in terms of number of pages and size but the paper quality is excellent. In my mind, that the book is small is a bonus because it's easy to through into your bag of tubes and take with you wherever you go.I needed a book for Beginners. This book fits the bill and I suspect it will be of value to me for at least a year and perhaps longer. Maybe then I'll want or need something more in depth but maybe not. There's a lot of Web sites where people can get tubing exercise routines. I would think that once you've mastered the basics, provided in this book, you may never need to buy another book because you'll have a good solid understanding of what's important, namely, warming up and all the other aforementioned twelve items.Now, you just have to get into the routine of doing the workouts. If you do them diligently, I believe good results will be had."},{"Title":"The Great Stretch Tubing Handbook","review":"I mostly like this little book or booklet. Here's why.1. It offers a stretching routine to do before a workout for those who prefer to stretch.2. It offers the basics of using rubber resistance. The pros and cons.3. It breaks the exercises down into the muscle groups the exercise works so you can plan your workout.3. Has a nice anatomy of the muscles. A page for the front and a page for the back side.4. Good quality color photos of each exercise. Two to three in most cases.5. Good instructions for each exercise.6. A small section (couple pages) on working the rotator cuff. Important to many people.What I didn't like.1. Many excellent and important exercises are missing. For example, the chest press. It offers a number of variations of the exercise but not the basic chest press.2. Lacks many lower body exercises such as leg curl.3. Advises a 45 minute or more workout plus cardio. That's way too much and very unnecessary. One set to failure of five or six exercises is more than enough and cardio is not necessary unless you really want to do it.Included in the book are:A series of stretch tubing exercises to work the whole bodyHow to make and use your own door attachmentA section on rotator cuff exercisesStretch tubing safetySample routineA complete stretching sectionTraining tipsMuscle anatomy diagramsI've ordered some Bodylastics and expect to get a large manual of exercises with that. Of course, I know most of the exercises this book lacks but I find it a bit of a disappointment that fitness experts would publish a book that's basically incomplete.I do, however, recommend the book to beginners to this great workout method. It's also a good little reference book for anyone who uses strength bands. Strength bands are wonderful and they work. So if you're new to strength bands and need a place to start, this book is fine.

Orthodox Christainity is reinforced through this collection of angel appearances. The authors gathered stories from contributors and also researched the subject historically, going back to accounts in the Bible itself.In citing \\"Summa Theologica\\" by Thomas Aquinas they point out that a lot of his work was drawn from \\"The Celestial Hierarchy\\" by Dionysius who was believed to have a contemporary of Paul in the first century. Subsequent research revealed the book had not existed prior to the sixth century.An interesting story concerns the sister of Stephen Vincent Benet, Laura. At age 92, she was an active writer herself. Her New York City apartment was described accordingly: \\"the walls were lined top-to-bottom with books(from which old newspaper clippings were forever escaping) and boxes of letters.\\"This encouraing book will build your faith.

In asking the general question \\"why did X do that?\\" at least three sorts of answer might be relevant: (a) Just as an anthropologist seeks to discover the systematic framework of norms and goals in terms of which he hopes to classify the actions of the people he is studying, so for our own society we have to refer to a set of purposive rule-following models in order to show what is X's reason for acting. (b) However, there may be occasions on which X's reason for acting does not coincide with the reason for his action; a motive, without necessarily being unconscious, may be obscure. (c) Apart from reasons we sometimes ask \\"What made X do that?\\" We seek for a cause for a lapse or breakdown in behavior. Peters argues that this latter type of explanation is only appropriate in highly specific sorts of context and that it is a mistake to think of motives as causes of behavior. Causal explanations of behavior are inappropriate except in special circumstances. So too are explanations in terms of the satisfaction of specific needs.Psychologists have mishandled the concept of motive by thinking of all motivated behavior in terms of causes. Freud's unconscious wishes, the hedonistic pleasure-pain criterion and the behavioristic notion of drives are all causal concepts. Peters argues that to think of motives as inner states which determine overt behavior is to be the victim of conceptual confusion. When we ask about X's motive we are asking what is the goal towards which his behavior is directed and whether or not his actions are relevant to a specific goal. We are not searching for causal factors which determine behavior mechanically or for the biological ends which the behavior remotely serves.After his preliminary discussion of \\"what we mean by motive\\" and \\"what questions can we legitimately ask about motivation\\" the results are applied to three psychological theories.(1) Freud. Peters suggests that Freud evolved two theories. One was a logically respectable theory which attempted to explain specific types of abnormal behavior. The second was a general theory which claimed to explain all kinds of behavior and which was the product of confusing different kinds of question and the sort of answers which each requires.(2) Drive Theories. One of the most exciting chapters deals with the theories of Hull, Tolman and Guthrie and their followers. Peters shows how, as a result of failing to understand the logic of the concepts involved, certain psychologists extend the use of the concept of a drive to cover many very different types of situation. Thus all motives are conceived as the sort of causes which we appeal to when we wish to explain the behavior to which a man is driven under conditions of stress or when suffering from a psychotic breakdown. Several misleading mechanical and biological models which are favored by behaviorists are subjected to searching analysis.(3) Hedonism. Attempts to reinstate the principles of hedonism as an analysis of motivated behavior are examined and exposed.With a wealth of illustration Peters draws his conclusions. Attempts to build an all-inclusive theory of motivation are mistaken. It is not possible to answer all forms of the general question \\"Why does X do that?\\" in terms of a unitary theory. There are too many different forms of this question each of which demands a logically distinct type of answer. Failure to realize this has led psychologists to construct theories of motivation which are not merely false but absurd. Causal theories are appropriate when activities break down (e.g., brain lesions) but usually we can explain behavior by reference to a rule-following purposeful model. It is also wrong to explain everything a man does in terms of motives; Peters gives examples of other explanatory concepts.Peters writes with a scholarly knowledge of psychology to which he applies philosophical acumen with rigor and insight. This is indeed an outstanding book and a wonderful study in philosophical psychology. It is highly recommended to read F. A. Hayek's elaboration on the thesis of Peters inLaw, Legislation and Liberty, Volume 1: Rules and Order."},{"Title":"Shame: Thief of Intimacy","review":"My wife read this book.

Found it on Kindle free.. Had heard about Ford Madox Ford forever but not read anything he had written. English, wrote and edited literary magazine in early 1900s. I am going to search him out. Very undated and insightful tale about the changing relationship of two upper-middle English married couples. I haven't yet finished it but am really enjoying it."},{"Title":"The good soldier: A tale of passion","review":"The book appears to be about the destruction of five people's lives by the illicit passion of two of them for each other, and about the diabolical deceitfulness which they use to conceal their relationship from those around them. It seems to center on the narrator's process of discovery of this, and his outrage. In fact, and buried with great subtlety, it is really intended to be a condemnation of the closed sexual morality of the time, and the person of the narrator is used to bring the reader to the conclusion, through the most unlikely of people to become convinced of it, that the total removal of moral restraints in these matters will be life enhancing and morally right, given human nature as it is.It was a brave book to write when he did, and perhaps a brave point of view to take before penicillin and in the middle of a syphilis epidemic - we are speaking of the time period of Ibsen's Ghosts - it isn't surprising he so disguised it. What is a little surprising is that modern readers seem not to have understood it - the clues are pretty obvious once you know what you are looking for.How good is it? Well, it is a craftsmanlike lesson in how to do certain things, but his inability to get away from caricature stops it from being really moving. It is a bit like Flaubert, you feel he has envisaged the characters as ideas, but does not really feel with and for them, so in the end there is a curious coldness and want of moral feeling. But worth reading: it will make you think."},{"Title":"The good soldier: A tale of passion","review":"Summarily, &quot;The Good Soldier&quot; is about domestic turmoil and cheating spouses, but it's all the more interesting because it was written at a time, not long after the Victorian era, when marriage was still considered an institution of the utmost sanctity. The story concerns two couples: John and Florence Dowell, who are American, and Captain Edward and Leonora Ashburnham, who are English. One of the first things we learn at the beginning of the book, of which John is the narrator, is that Florence and Edward are presently dead.The two couples met nine years ago at a resort in the Hessian town of Nauheim, noted for its salt springs which are used to treat heart and nerve diseases; Florence, who indeed has a bad heart condition, is there to convalesce. Over the years Florence and Edward fall in love, unbeknownst to John but not to Leonora.Both marriages were built on shaky foundations. John's and Florence's backgrounds are differentiated financially (she is from an extremely wealthy family; he isn't) and the Ashburnhams religiously (Edward is Protestant; Leonora is Catholic). But the roots of their marital problems are more personal. Florence is a social climber and aspires to associate with English nobility, while John is ingenuous, naive in practical matters, and not very interested in money. Edward has a history of indiscriminate love affairs (initiated by a misunderstood sexual advance), immoderate gambling, and imprudent spending. His and Leonora's marriage has grown cool and passionless and is gradually turning into a state of mutual hatred, exacerbated by the presence of a girl named Nancy Rufford whom both Edward and John love.John is not the best of narrators; he tends to ramble and comes off as high-strung and jittery, like he's had too much caffeine. The reader gets the impression this personality trait of his may have been one of the reasons his wife sought an extramarital affair. It is easy to symphathize with this confused man for his misfortune but not for his gullibility. As he points out at the end of the book, everything everybody wanted was available to each, but eventually nobody got what he or she wanted. It is this conclusion that makes this &quot;the saddest story&quot; John had ever heard.This is the kind of story that F. Scott Fitzgerald could have written, only he would have let the scenes develop with more dialogue, and I think he would have focused more on the class distinction aspect. &quot;The Good Soldier&quot; is nowhere near the saddest story *I* have ever heard, but it does invoke a fair amount of emphathy for these people who only wanted to be happy but ended up in undesirable situations they were unable or unlikely to avoid or foresee."},{"Title":"The good soldier: A tale of passion","review":"DeceivedFirst of all, I thought I was getting a real book, with introduction, forward, publishing dates etc. for my book discussion group.

This book turned out to be &#34;printed on demand; indicated by a print date at the back of the book &#34;December 27, 2012&#34;. There was no indication that this book would be &#34;printed on demand&#34; with only the story, no context.

Absurd characters wandering through a tedious story about the accomodations that people make in order to be perceived as \\"proper\\" in their social, cultural and religious milieu."},{"Title":"The good soldier: A tale of passion","review":"Although this has the reputation of an antique, buy it immediately. Stephen King never wrote such a horrifying novel--it's about the savagery and madness than lay behind the thin surface of ordinary, polite society. In it, Ford virtually invented the &quot;unreliable narrator&quot; and raised the question: how do we know what anyone tells us is true? Jim Thompson's psychotic protagonists are unimaginable without this deceptively genteel predecessor."},{"Title":"The good soldier: A tale of passion","review":"The Good Soldier may not force you to reevaluate your life or question your morality, but it will prompt you to think about that curious barrier/nexus between reader and story that is the first person narrator. For me, this book's defining feature is its style of narration: non-linear, with the narrator jumping back and forth between earlier and later episodes and then returning to expatiate and fill in details. While this may sound convoluted or annoying, it makes sense when we think about how people tell stories in real life--we get excited, we skip around, we go back to embellish a bit more and most importantly: we wait until the end to lay our last card down.Some may not like this style of narration and in inexperienced hands it could quickly become a crap-storm. However, Ford is simply (amazingly) that good: the story never escapes his control for a moment, and while Dowell seems to drop details accidentally, Ford precisely governs the moments when he will allow Dowell to reveal vital information. And some of those \\"slips\\" are like verbal punches--they have the ability to stun you, to make you reread what you just read because you simply cannot believe what has happened. Only a few books have made me feel as though I'd been slapped in the face, and this is one of them (trust me, it's a good thing).Now, my other reason for adoring this novel is the narrator himself. The Good Soldier's heart and soul, its \\"core,\\" so to speak, is its concern with perception. The Modernists were quite interested in epistemology (how we know what we know) and Ford was not an exception. Ford filters the entire story through the consciousness of Dowell, a man who (as some incredibly astute readers have noticed) is dull, wimpy, and unlikable. But we don't initially read The Good Soldier to learn more about Dowell. We read to learn about Edward Ashburnham (the titular hero) and his interactions with his wife Leonora (a powerful female character) and the antics of Dowell's scheming wife Florence. Which brings us to Dowell's most important quality: his unreliability. The analogy of the \\"goodly apple\\" prompts Dowell to ask in so many words: \\"If for nine months I possessed a goodly apple, and only at the end discovered that it was rotten, isn't it true that for nine months I possessed a goodly apple?\\" Some would say yes, others no, but the analogy is clear enough: the same story will look different through the eyes of any person; some will notice the rottenness from a distance while others will only taste it in their mouths. Dowell, to our most excellent fortune, is one of the latter. As readers we are obliged to look through his eyes, and try our best to understand what \\"really\\" took place. Is there a way to know? Not really, and some have called the book cynical in this regard. But the vein of cynicism runs deep in modernist literature, and I think it is fairer to say that TGS is astute and unflinching concerning the realm of objective truth.Let's talk about pacing. The Good Soldier starts slowly, but gradually gains momentum with the development of character, the strange plot twists and the final d&eacute;nouement. Towards the end, I had to force myself to slow down and read carefully, rather than plunge ahead and trip over the lines. While the latter may be an acceptable reading pace for a John Grisham novel or one of the later Harry Potter books (Order of the Phoenix, anyone?), failing to miss a few words of Ford's prose could damage the reader's experience. You only get your first time once, as they say, so take care and enjoy!"},{"Title":"The good soldier: A tale of passion","review":"This is not war fiction. It is a soap opera, of rich people who subsume their longing, fear, religion, everything, to decorum. Narrated by a hollow man -- Holden Caulfield of the upper-crust, minus the sharp wit. It's all bitterness and sigh-heaving -- a man sits next to you at a bar and starts talking, with the following first sentence, &quot;This is the saddest story I have ever heard.&quot; He talks and talks, he's not a slick storyteller but you listen -- it's a sad story largely because the storyteller is sad, as in pathetic, and you become more fascinated in him than in his story (which you suspect is grotesquely slanted to his point of view anyway).There's a British couple and a British-like American couple. There's an affair, there's a suicide, there is lots of falsity. Only main events are narrated, and the narrator digresses, digresses and describes the mental states of his characters: so you're left with thin characterization but vivid impressions. I could not relate to the rich, British ways of the characters; and there are subtleties of religion -- Catholic vs. Protestant -- which are over my athiest head. It is Henry James-like, in its abstruseness as to what the heck is at stake for the characters, but witten in a looser style at least.The novel was written in 1913. Ford wanted &quot;to show what I could do&quot; -- because -- &quot;I had never really tried to put into any novel of mine all that I knew about writing.&quot; But he goes on to say (in a preface), &quot;the story is a true story...I could not write it till all the others were dead.&quot;"},{"Title":"The good soldier: A tale of passion","review":"This has been on my reading bucket list since it first showed up on a recommended list distributed in a British lit survey course I took in college. It continued to show up, like \\"Best of the 20th Century\\" lists. Now I've found out why. From its great opening line that sounds a tad Russian--\\"This is the saddest story I have ever heard\\"--to its last revelation of many revelations of character and the human condition--it is always in top artistic form.It predates The Great Gatsby by a decade and I'm guessing Fitzgerald read it. The first person narrative structure begins similarly, one man, the American John Dowell, discounting himself as a major player as he promises to tell the story of a bigger player, the British Captain Edward Asburnham, the \\"good soldier\\" of the title. Like Gatsby, the circles in which they move are largely affluent, and marriage conventions are flouted. But there the similarities begin to disappear. FMF's characters are more self-deceived than self-made, and there are the cultural contrasts of American vs. European character and protestant vs. Catholic tossed in for good measure. John Dowell proves to be a difficult narrator: though he suggests that it is the understandable problem of ordering memory that he builds the story hesitantly and thus sometimes doubles back to fill in more facts, the tangled story telling may be due as much to his own reluctance to deal with certain truths until he is finally ready. He may not be as much of a bystander as he initially suggests, or as innocent.To say more would spoil the plot. This is an absorbing read, and relatively short. It is also worth reading as a model of modern literary art. It is well informed by the recent arrival of psychology, it strains against the rigidity of Victorian and Edwardian social codes, it smashes Aristotle's rules about plot progression. How the story is told is as important as the story. Energy electrifies it and that makes it a pleasure to read despite the fact that it deals considerably with pathetic human weaknesses.The critical introduction is reliable as most Penguin classic supplementary essays are, and is best read afterward since there are spoilers. Helpful notes do not intrude on the text but are discretely listed at the end."},{"Title":"The good soldier: A tale of passion","review":"The post-mortem of a good-on-paper marriage that much later turned out to be even less than the little the narrator thought of it. The crux of his questioning of the marriage really is, \\"If for nine years I have possessed a goodly apple that is rotten at the core and discover its rottenness only in nine years and six months less four days, isn't it true to say that for nine years I possessed a goodly apple?\\" Is it possible for something to be bad if you don't know it? Where does the bad lie? Is it something empirical? Does it have to be measured in order to exist? Or is it a property of something waiting to be discovered and measured?This book really describes fully the needs of a person to be acknowledged and the consequences of acknowledging the fullness of another. The non-affair that kills Edward really only hurts him because he acknowledges something that had probably been building for a while, but harmlessly while it went unnoticed. Acknowledgement is really the driving force behind the novel, both in the positive and negative aspects. The impetus of the narrator's story is his final acceptance of what his marriage really was, an acknowledgement of his wife's true nature. But at the same time that he is criticizing his wife for her shortcomings, he is illustrating his own and acknowledging them. He sees that he allowed himself to be deceived and so was a party in his deception. The question that comes to me is would he have been happier without the knowledge? Would I be happier if I didn't have the knowledge, being in his place? Do we need to know or do we want to know? And why? Is it just to punish ourselves, show ourselves how little we really matter? Is the thirst for acknowledgement a way to verify our own existence or a way to embitter it?\\"We are all so afraid, we are all so alone, we all so need from the outside the assurance of our own worthiness to exist.\\""},{"Title":"The good soldier: A tale of passion","review":"So, I am about 400 books into the 1001 books to read before you die (I'd better read faster) and THE GOOD SOLDIER is my favorite book so far.

This is a great book with lasting lessons."},{"Title":"The good soldier: A tale of passion","review":"Other novels have featured what are called \\"unreliable narrators,\\" figures who explain a story to a reader in a way that presents important facts in a skewed, self-serving way. But John Dowell, the narrator of Ford Madox Ford's \\"The Good Soldier,\\" may be one of the most unreliable of narrators because it's never quite clear whether he's playing a game with us or himself.On one level, \\"The Good Soldier\\" is a tawdry but juicy tale of misbehaving patricians and their head games in the last days before World War I. Dowell, a rich Philadelphian, is effectively stranded on the European continent as the \\"sedulous, strained nurse\\" of a woman named Florence. She must not be allowed to travel over water because of a weak heart, John is warned. They make the acquaintance of an English officer and lord, Edward Ashburnham, and his Irish wife, Leonora. Over time a friendship develops, yet one with a lot of secrets that seem to elude the trusting Dowell for a long time.On another level, the book is about Dowell's difficulty telling this story, in part because it is one that was only revealed to him in bits and pieces, and in part because the guy has a strange diffidence in explaining himself. The absence of meaning on even a basic level becomes a major theme of the book.\\"For who in this world can give anyone a character?\\" he asks us at one point. \\"Who in this world knows anything of any other heart - or of his own?\\"You can take the date of \\"The Good Soldier's\\" publication - 1915 - and its title and ascribe a kind of statement about Europe before the First World War, of people lost in their alternate truths, not seeing a larger world until it is too late. There is some coming to grips here with the impressionistic and surrealist strains of modern art, of reality as \\"a sort of maze\\" that everyone must find their own path through. But the book never goes down the kind of path that aligns it with any one artistic or literary movement of the early 20th century. It follows its own quirky, at times outrageous, muse and pulls you along.Dowell's wife Florence is probably the one outsized character, the most liberated from social convention but a seeming slave to her own bodily needs. She's also the novel's funniest character once you learn her shocking secret, which Dowell reveals in typically haphazard style. Ashburnham and Leonora seem the perfect couple at a spa dining room but can't say a word to each other in private. They are a bit more tragic, yet alternate as the villains of the piece depending on the narrator's shifting perspective.Ah, the narrator. The secret to \\"The Good Soldier's\\" lasting interest for modern readers will no doubt be Dowell. Dowell is one odd duck. He not only toils to keep up appearances, he seems to embody a dutiful nature that goes beyond the call of duty - or of reason. People use him with impunity, but he tells us it is of no concern. Often he will come to a major crossroads in the narrative, only to shrug off any personal notions of others' guilt or innocence with a bland interjection like \\"Who knows?\\"\\"She excused herself on the score of an overmastering passion,\\" he says to us at one point. \\"Well, I always say that an overmastering passion is a good excuse for feelings.\\"Can Dowell really be this self-denying? In his intro to the Penguin Classics edition, David Bradshaw points to some curious comments that suggest darker shadings to Dowell. Bradshaw also notes the many strange and often goofy metaphors Dowell employs that lend \\"The Good Soldier\\" a comically macabre quality, of suitcases swallowing characters whole like alligators and another character being likened to \\"a phosphorescent fish in a cupboard.\\" Yet while you are reading \\"The Good Soldier\\" you come to take such things naturally. It's a one-of-a-kind experience.Except you really do need to read it twice; it really comes alive on a second reading. Then you see Dowell holding back key information and discover the possibilities underneath his bland exterior. Ford Madox Ford does more than craft an elegant tale of the jaded rich in crisis, he plays a character as if he were on stage performing for us the reader, and leaves you wanting more after the curtain falls."},{"Title":"The good soldier: A tale of passion","review":"Last week I reviewed THROUGH THE WINDOW, a book of essays by Julian Barnes, including three on the Edwardian novelist Ford Madox Ford, an author I hadn't read and wasn't sure I wanted to. But Barnes' words on his most famous novel hooked me, so here I am: \\"Looked at now, the novel barges its way into the modernist club for very different reasons: its immaculate use of a ditheringly unreliable narrator, its sophisticated disguise of true narrative behind a false facade of apparent narrative, its self-reflectingness, its deep duality about human motive, intention, and experience, and its sheer boldness as a project.\\" Indeed. In this quite slim novel about two couples who spend their summers together at a German spa, nothing is quite as it seems, as the characters and their feelings are shuffled and redealt again and again. The normal processes of linear narrative and gradual revelation go out the window; this is a book where you know everything, but understand delightfully little.\\"This is the saddest story I have ever heard.\\" The famous opening line introduces what appears to be a typical Jamesian narrator, a wealthy American Anglophile who will spin us a tale from his leather armchair. But that \\"heard\\" is deceptive; so far from being disinterested, Dowell, the narrator and husband in one of the couples, is involved every inch of the way. But as he goes back over events again and again, seeking ways of reconciling facts with his own ignorance, contradicting himself not only between one section and another but often within a single sentence, he weaves a web of obfuscation and desire that has soon ensnared even him.Move on to the second sentence: \\"We had known the Ashburnhams for nine seasons of the town of Nauheim with an extreme intimacy -- or, rather with an acquaintanceship as loose and easy and yet as close as a good glove's with your hand.\\" The simile is doubly striking: first, because it implies a world where gentlemen have their gloves hand-sewn to order; and second, because it introduces a sexual metaphor at odds with the propriety of Dowell's diction, but that will turn out to be entirely relevant. For within a few pages we learn what another novelist might keep to the end, that Captain Ashburnham, the Good Soldier and epitome of the English gentleman, has in fact been the lover of Dowell's invalid wife for the better part of nine years.\\"I have, I am aware, told this story in a very rambling way so that it may be difficult for anyone to find their way through what may be a sort of maze. I cannot help it.\\" Oh no? It slowly becomes clear that Dowell, the bumblingly inept storyteller, is quite conscious of what he is doing. Describing a sad farewell at a rural railway station, he throws in the line \\"The signal for the train's departure was a very bright red; that is about as passionate a statement as I can get into that scene.\\" By giving away events long before they happen, he gives himself the right to come back to them again and again, adding detail, expanding the back-story, questioning motivation, showing things in an entirely different moral light. We soon get the idea of Ashburnham's philandering and his wife's forbearance; Florence Dowell's duplicity takes a little longer to emerge; but even so, we continue to reevaluate them as questions of religion and pedigree come into play. But Dowell keeps himself in the shadows. What sort of a husband is he? What keeps him looking up to Ashburnham no matter what he does? Is everything he says even true? This awkwardly proper, but quite unreliable, narrator is as fascinating as they come."},{"Title":"The good soldier: A tale of passion","review":"I wasn't sure what to expect from this book as, being an ebook, it comes without the usual blurb on the cover.

Ford Maddox Ford thought this was his finest novel; that is not much of an inspiration for reading more of his stuff."},{"Title":"The good soldier: A tale of passion","review":"This is an unusual novel in that it focusses tightly on the psychologies of two couples. One of the men is the American narrator, then there are his wife, Florence, and an English couple, Edward and Leonora Ashburnham. Edward is the eponymous \\"good soldier\\" and generous, public-minded citizen in the English countryside. The novel portrays the emotions and motivations that lie under the surface of \\"good people\\" (if we assume that such people exist), a fantastic, sweeping collage of contradictory, conflicting personality elements of love, hate, duty, greed, justice, naivet&eacute;, pride, reserve, propriety and more. Maybe you'll say that you can find these in any soap opera. But Ford's is not just any soap opera. He skillfully unwinds the tangled web of relationships as it inexorably grinds on in England and at various places on the continent. Though some minor description of places appears, the author insists on analyzing adultery and the general intricate patterns that lead to hatred between husband and wife and to unfaithfulness. He tries to trace the trails that lead each character to his/her ultimate fate. Florence becomes Edward's lover, one of a long chain, but the narrator (her husband) remains unaware of this till close to the end. He is an exceedingly dim chap in any case, waiting on his wife hand and foot because of a \\"heart condition\\" which has never existed in fact. Leonora, much more the \\"eyes wide open\\" sort, knows about her husband's activities, but wishes that he would grow close to her anyway. A fifth character makes an appearance, but it is not fortuitous. Two people wind up dead (you learn this in the first few pages).Ford did work in America for some years, but his understanding of English character is much better than of American ones. His choice of an upper class American for the narrator may have been to write as an outsider looking in, but this top-drawer Philadelphian does not always ring true. Pre-WW I England is surely a foreign culture, and very exotic, for non-Anglo-Saxon, 21st century Americans: we just happen to share a language (more or less). Pride and reserve are not often stressed as values anymore, at least on this side of the Atlantic. While the focus on personality and psychology means that there is not much action as such, this novel must be one of the great studies of adultery, of looking behind the scenes of marriage, which so often, in life as in literature, turns out to be a tragedy. Above all, Ford successfully attempts to show the complexity of the simplest actions and their consequences, the craziness and despair that may lie behind seemingly 'ideal marriages'."},{"Title":"The good soldier: A tale of passion","review":"So many books and movies have the adjective \\"important\\" attached to them that the word has lost its significance. But if you'd like to use it anyway, here's a novel on which you can. And for those of us who consider ourselves writers, \\"The Good Soldier\\" is doubly important: first it displays the skills of a genuine master of the language, and second it reinforces our awareness of just how far the rest of us hacks still have to go. The plot? It's difficult to discuss without giving too much away; besides, it's the way the story is told that we remember afterwards--the astonishment as the main character, John Dowell comes to realize that everything in his marriage has been a lie, that his relationship with his wife did not deteriorate--it, in fact, never existed. This is no simple tale of adultery and deceit--those words hardly do it justice.So many famous writers have extolled \\"The Good Soldier\\" that any one reader's review seems superfluous. Including mine.... Read the book."},{"Title":"The good soldier: A tale of passion","review":"There are few things in life to equal the great classics of literature and I am spending my retirement re-reading those I have encountered only once and looking at new possibilities. The reputation of Ford Maddox Ford is not quite of classic status yet he has always had strong advocates and these seem to have increased in number and intensity over the years, so I thought I should give this a go. At the start I felt very much \\"Hats off - a genius\\": interesting style, quirky narrative point of view, themes of great potential, engagingly \\"modern\\" structure, intriguing plot, living characters - surely a classic. But as I read on I felt I was increasingly engaged in a limited domestic drama with little interest beyond itself - rather as if Macbeth were just about an odd couple who go about some nasty murders or King Lear about a dysfunctional family with a troublesome aged parent. By the end I did not see the point of engaging with these essentially trivial lives in such detail, the \\"unreliable narrator\\" stance was a cheat (since it was not in ironic counterpoint with anything - in contrast to The Great Gatsby which it reminded me of at the start)and the random structure fell apart. We are left with a superb style and I have generally felt that the how of writing is more important than the what (as in, arguably, Jane Austen) but in this case I felt that some things are barely worth saying however well said. At the same time, like all classics, the book has \\"got into me\\" and is unlikely to go away. I may well have quite a different view of it as the years go by - another characteristic of the true classic!"},{"Title":"The good soldier: A tale of passion","review":"The Good Soldier is one of the greatest masterpieces of literature. From beginning to end, the characters in this tale that is told in random sequence of events (the events happened in normal time, but the narrator recounts them haphazardly) stay absolutely true. I have read this book a dozen or more times and it never ceases to fascinate. I actually attempted a screenplay once which is why I ended up reading it so many times. What happens that is hidden, and what doesn't happen that is in plain view reveal the secrets of the psyche. A MUST READ."},{"Title":"The good soldier: A tale of passion","review":"The most fascinating aspect of this novel is that it is more about the narrator than the other characters. Throughout the novel the narrator attempts to justify his decisions and actions. His lack of judgement on the final pages is appalling. &quot;The Good Soldier&quot; is an enthralling character study that, at times, seems all too real."},{"Title":"The good soldier: A tale of passion","review":"Dowell narrates the story of his loveless marriage to his hypochondriac wife,Florence, and their meeting in Nauheim with the Ashburnhams;they equally sharing a loveless marriage.Telling the tale in unchronological flashbacks,that lack consistency or are deliberately vague,the tragedy of the Dowell's and Ashburnhams finally unfolds...Dowell narrating as an unreliable source or witness adds hugely to the realism of this novel and underscores its themes of repression; the stiffling of the individual due to social ettiquetes, of peoples sentamental and unrealistic idea's of love. Added to this is the religious pressures brought upon the situation by Leonora and Nancy's Catholicism that is a distant apart from the Protestantism of the Dowell's and Edward Ashburnham-a theme that Maddox Ford keeps supremely relevent and in context to the story-something Graham Greene always attempted, though his Catholic characters and themes always came accross as gratuitious !The narration style reminds very much of Fitzgerald's \\"Tender is the Night\\" and \\"Great Gatsby\\" and the modernist novel that was to come (The Good Soldier pre dates them all)and it is certainly up there with the rest of them as an undeniable classic of the genre.A great book."},{"Title":"The good soldier: A tale of passion","review":"The Good Soldier is a book not of our time, perhaps in that it requires you to read it discerningly, and in so reading it yields the wisdom to be gained, as well as the pleasure of the reading experience. Starting with the unforgettable line, \\"this is the saddest story I have ever heard\\" requires that the reader consider every part of that sentence: the story itself, the perspective of the speaker (the listener, the unreliable narrator), and more importantly that the element of the listener, though apparently inert, is one of 4 main reagents, and several catalysts, in the story itself.This is not a novel that lays out the facts. It is not a police report. And despite the subject matter, it is not even a Dr. Phil expose. It is the account of a man who does not even tell you that his first name is John until Part II (of 4). His companions are his wife, Florence, and the Ashburnhams, Leonara and Edward. You will learn of what they did and how he came to know of it, although the question of how much he is actually conscious of it is never directly answered. But it is masterful and delightful by putting facts forward, in a way a report would not.And while the topics of adultery we imagine to be not spoken of (in polite society), nearly every social circle has a tangent to an impolite one. Though things may not have been spoken of in the circle, they were nonetheless done, with or without conversation.It's dated as a story that assumes an upper class, in a way that may be difficult to relate to for those in the active, modern, busy, workaday world. To criticize it for being thus, is like criticizing War and Peace for being too long, or Joyce Ulysses for being disjointed. But it provides insight to us because we do not live lives of leisure and privilege, and it's a window to a world that, whether you think it deserves preservation or not, reflects back into our own."},{"Title":"The good soldier: A tale of passion","review":"This production of the novel is unreadable. Pages are almost square. Margins are narrow. Each line of type stretches too far from left to right.For readability, the standard rule is 60 characters per line. The lines here are about 85 characters. Short paragraphs are manageable, but there are many long paragraphs in this text. When the paragraphs run ten or twenty lines deep, it is very difficult to move from the end of one line back to the beginning of the next.Also, there is no copyright information or publisher name anywhere in this production. It's just a bunch of words with the author's name. The only hint is a note on the back page: Made in the USA, Lexington, KY, Jan 25, 2012 (two days ago). Obviously, it's a print-on-demand version. But how do I know it's the copyrighted version that the author actually wrote?I'm going to return it and buy a different production."},{"Title":"The good soldier: A tale of passion","review":"The Good Soldier is a story of the bizarre relationship between two couples seen through the eyes of an aggrieved husband. Captain Ashburnham's wife seems to control him by enabling his sexual affairs with various younger women. The narrator seems quite naive as he untangeles the deciept of all the parties involved. He seems to respect every one except his own wife. I would recommend taking notes as you read this. The story does notunfold in a chronilogical manner, a fact thenarrator apoligizes for throughout the story. A study in charactor motivation that may leave you scratching your head.This is not an easy read but if you are a Henry James or Grahme Greene fan you will probably like this book."},{"Title":"Jews fight too!","review":"I read this book, from my Hebrew school's library, in the early 1960s. Written for teens, as I recall, it details achievements of Jews, as fighters. I particularly remember stories of Jewish American soldiers. It's been a long time, but I remember enjoying the writing.Since the book was written shortly after World War II and the Israeli War for Independence, the concept of Jewish fighters was still novel. I believe that the writer intended it as an antidote, to the idea that all Jews were helpless victims.In the 50+ years, since the book was written, Israeli fighting prowess has been proven, over and over. However, these older stories are still interesting."},{"Title":"Dr. Martens: The Story of an Icon","review":"This book is a beautiful, colourful, illustrated history of those very cool shoes. It is more than the history of a shoe, but the history of the people who wear them. Filled with quotes and annecdotes from famed punks and other musicians. Brimming with beautiful photos with an emphasis on the footwear.Singing to readers praise for various bands including The Who and The Clash, as well as providing a very thorough history of a number of doc-wearing subcultures. There are the stories of the skinheads, punks, mods, and more.Steeped in tales of history from the 60s til the present, with mentions of all the things that made these decades important, from The Clockwork Orange to Madness.This book is witty, attractive and very easy to admire."},{"Title":"Dr. Martens: The Story of an Icon","review":"I am a huge fan of Dr. Martens, the made in England kind, not much experience wih the made in China manufacturing. I thought this book was going to explain how the shoes are made, why they last so long, etc. It isn't exactly what I got.The book mainly focuses on pop culture from the 60's till today, especially in the realm of music and what bands wear what. If I wanted a book on Brit pop and pop culture in general I could have bought that.The book DOES have some nice pictures to leaf through. The book also makes no mention of movIng the majority of their manufacturing to other countries. This may be because the book was published in 2003 when they began to make most of their shoes in China and the like or because the author wanted to avoid the topic altogether. You can draw your own conclusions.Not a bad read if you pick it up cheap, but I wouldn't go out of my way to get it."},{"Title":"My friend God (A signet book)","review":"A light-headed description of our friend GOD.

While this is a novel, it is also nearly a memoir. On their own merit, the stories and events are honestly written, and full of life. Many authors &quot;milk&quot; such sweet childhood moments, and make them just too &quot;precious&quot; for an adult to read -- there's no antidote for copious amounts of sugar. These, though, are honestly written, and have a continuing emotional impact on this reader, even luring her to re-live her own memories from similar times and small towns. I wondered on almost every page, &quot;Is it just me, or is there a power, here, calling and charming us to share in some of Charlotte Woodham's life?&quot; The &quot;power,&quot; I think, originates from how genuinely she has put herself -- and the other characters -- on the page, and in our company. Some authors write beautifully, but are distant strangers. Charlotte Woodham writes beautifully, the way you wish your sisters and old friends could write.You'll enjoy reading this work!"},{"Title":"When the Bay was Blue","review":"Charlotte's book is at first a sweet and simple story, but you can feel the tension underneath. She tells her story with great detail and a huge dose of what it is like to be a child who knows that heartbreak is a breath away. I hope this entices you to give it a try."},{"Title":"When the Bay was Blue","review":"The author uses her ability to make a very real place but an earlier time come very much alive in this book. My mother grew up in Parker, FL, on the bay \\"when it was blue.\\" Woodham has the uncanny talent to bring that time alive for me. I was fascinated to read of activities and people just as my mother described them to me when I was a child. I'm thrilled to have this book in my collection. I find myself wondering how much of this fictional story must surely be based on actual occurrences. I can't wait to read more from this particular writer!"},{"Title":"Covenant with Death","review":"Regarding the 'Great War', this is probably the best book ever written.

The brutal blood and guts hand to hand fighting, the ripping of machine guns, the boredom and sheer terror move accross the trenchlines like an artillery shell and explodes on July 1st, 1916. Meat for the grinder, a whole generation lost, their stories and lesson must not be forgotten"},{"Title":"Themes and Variations for a Christian Doxology","review":"Hughes Oliphant Old is a scholar and a pastor deeply concerned about worship in the Reformed tradition. Old originally wrote the book, \\"Themes & Variations for a Christian Doxology,\\" as lectures at the University of Dubuque Theological Seminary. The book reads like a collection of lectures. Each lecture is fascinating, but one is never sure where the author is going to go. The lectures include topics as varied as prayer, liturgy, preaching, art, architecture, music and hymnody. If you are looking for a systematic treatment of worship, this is not it. For a methodical study, I would invite the reader to ready Old's \\"Worship Reformed According to Scripture.\\"That being said, the title is extremely appropriate for the book. Just as a fugue has a particular theme that is given a variety of voices, the lectures explore the theology of worship as doxology. As typical for a Reformed theologian, the themes are thoroughly rooted in the Scriptures--invocation, proclamation, wisdom, prophecy and covenant. These biblical themes are then voiced by the varied elements of worship. The index becomes a valuable resource. It allows one to follow the voices through the book's themes.Old's writing is clear and delightful. Each lecture will provide interesting discoveries and insights from the Scriptures and the history of worship."},{"Title":"CSET: Multiple Subjects (Cliffs Test Prep)","review":"I took all 3 CSET multiple subjects test in March, 2009. I just found out that I passed all 3. To my shock, I even passed the math/science exam even though I stopped studying for that exam a few weeks earlier to concentrate on making sure I would pass the other 2 exams. I figured I would fail the math part because I dropped out of 10th grade pre algebra and haven't revisited algebra in over 3 decades. I felt it would make more sense to pass 2 of the exams and retake the math/science subtest in May which would allow me to devote all my study time to that one test. I attribute my passing mostly to the Cliffs CSET book. It really was the best organized and most \\"user-friendly\\" of the big self-help guides. I kept coming back to this book over the others. This book seemed to cover most of the material without getting into too much detail which the others tended to do. Also, if you read many reviews here on Amazon, you'll be as shocked as I was to discover how error-ridden some of these books are. It won't take long for anyone to find such errors in these books and the nature of the errors really makes one wonder who does editing/review on these. Cliff's seemed to have the fewest errors although it isn't error-free. I think it's a good idea to get a variety of books on the test and then let your comfort level determine which guide is the best for you. If you can only pick one guide, I would pick this one over the others without hesitation."},{"Title":"CSET: Multiple Subjects (Cliffs Test Prep)","review":"for the CSET.

I am a past MSAT taker and 1st time passer-- I unfortunately have the pleasure of having my MSAT score not count due to new CA regulations, and was confident that the information required for CSET success was less than that required for MSAT due to the oversimplifications in the Bobrow and Fisher text and course.Should I have to take the test again I will utilize more specific content materials.

All these negative reviews saying that it is missing stuff or it needs more content need to grow up and realize that the CSET is suppose to test everything that you learned in a 4-5 year BA and cred program, thats not going to be in one book.

I read this book first and I feel like it was very good in covering many subjects, and was especially helpful as the first book I read to prepare for the CSET because it is organized in such a concise, easy outline manner. The Human Development chapter was enough to pass the test. The Art section lacked a good explanation on reading music and that was unfortunately what my short answer question was on. The math section was good, but I am strong in math so I didn't study math at all. The science section was good, I was surprised how easy the science section of the CSET test was. The reading acquisition section was thorough and effective. I bought the Boosalis book because it was supposedly the strongest one on Language Arts, but I found it too long winded. I liked the Cliffs version better. The History section was the only section that I feel was way too brief. I would not have passed the CSET History section if I had only read this book, you must do outside reading if you are not strong on Social Studies/History. I would strongly suggest buying this book along with doing other studying.

But I can tell you first hand that this study guide alone will not prepare you for all the subtests. There is simply too much information to know. I agree with the posters here. The Cliffs guide is a rough, sketchy outline of the test. The sample tests will not be like the ones you'll see on test day.Recommended Resources:1. Official CSET website - download the practice multiple subject tests. This is a must. The outline of what is being tested should also be downloaded. It guides you as to what you need to know. It's a lot of topics, but you need to go through it and tough it out.2. Cliffs - not a bad idea to include this in your studies. The history section is decent, but unfortunately you need to supplement the rest.3. Barrons - posters say that there are errors. True, but I thought that the sample test were a little (slightly) better than the Cliffs.4. Hirsch's Series - 4th, 5th, 6th grade. I found a few questions here were actually on the test!5. Everything You Need to Know books - subjects in history, math, science, geology, etc. The colorful pictures can aid you on test day. They are great if you are a visual learner.6. Do use the internet to supplement your studies. Online searches, encyclopedias, etc. Get your hands on other study guides to supplement your studies. Cliffs is not the only one out there.7. Last resort, purchasing the recommended textbooks for each of the subtests. This is a very costly one, as the recommended texts are rather expensive.Not Recommended:1. CA Teaching Solutions - I agree with the poster here who had a negative review of this company. I made the costly mistake of purchasing their CD. Don't fall for this internet scam company as I hear they are being investigated.2. MoMedia - another poor product. An e-book, c'mon guys. Even you can make an e-book. The math in there was not even on the CSET, and it really needed a lot of heavy editing to do. Get yourself a real book.3. Ace the CSET - if you have extra money you want to spend, fine. But I found that it was more of an entertaining purchase, rather than a serious, academic one. The questions and quizzes were designed for kids, not students who are preparing to take the CSET.If you do not agree with the \\"Recommended List,\\" fine. But please do not make the same mistakes I did with the \\"Not Recommended\\" list. You will be flushing your money down the toilet and regretting it.

I believe that this book is the most updated and accurate one out there. I took the Bobrow Test Prep course that uses this book and the instructor was FABULOUS and the book itself was very helpful. My biggest advice: just keep studying-just lock yourself in the room or library and keep reading it over and over again.

They came in handy for the material I found a bit harder to study for (history and science). It does provide 2 practice tests which are beneficial to take to get an idea of how the test is laid out and how fast you need to move to get through the test to finish in time.

The stuff you need to know is nowhere near the exam itself, not to mention that Cliffs test itself are a total flop ..."},{"Title":"CSET: Multiple Subjects (Cliffs Test Prep)","review":"I was given this book as part of a test prep class, and had to supplement its contents with extensive outside reading -- consider the Hirsch books, the &quot;Everything You Need to Know About...&quot; series from Scholastic, online encyclopedias, and the Usborne published books to up your knowledge.Also, I discovered by accident that much of this book is copied VERBATIM from the Bobrow-published MSAT study guide. Even though the test is supposedly different, and the science supposedly easier, this book is almost identical to the MSAT test prep book. Which makes you wonder why they couldn't fix the numreous typos between publications...Haven't taken the CSET yet, but I know I wouldn't feel prepared relying on this book alone."},{"Title":"CSET: Multiple Subjects (Cliffs Test Prep)","review":"I didn't find this book as bad as other reviewers have. The math and science portions were all I needed to pass that section of the CSET. The practice tests, item explanations, and strategies are useful. The history sections are admittedly very lean, but they really can't be more than content outlines, and they serve that purpose well. I feel it's a good overview, but certainly not everything one needs to pass the test. Beware: it's got mistakes, including the name of the test (it's not the California Subject Examination Test, it's the California Subject Examinations for Teachers) and test content (like the order of the cell stage drawings on p. 98)."},{"Title":"CSET: Multiple Subjects (Cliffs Test Prep)","review":"I have been advised by those who help others prepare for the CSET that this is not a good study guide. So much information and so overwhelming and not all the answers are accurate.I studied the books What your 6-8th grader needs to know.....I did that for math, geography, ca history etc etc and passed the CSET on the first try. I am not young..almost 50."},{"Title":"CSET: Multiple Subjects (Cliffs Test Prep)","review":"I've taken the test for the CSET multiple subject, and I can honestly say that the Cliff's book is really poorly edited and drafted for the CSET multiple subject. I'm not sure where the poster who was hyping about the book is coming from, but you really need to look into other resources to study from. The practice tests in the Cliff's is NOT representative of the actual test. The official CSET website is a good way to go. Keep your chin up, save your money, and do well on the exam."},{"Title":"CSET: Multiple Subjects (Cliffs Test Prep)","review":"I read the book cover to cover and passed all three sections with no prior education background. I am not sure why the other reviews are so scathing. Supplemental reading is definately recommended, but this is a real all-in-one study book that covers almost every topic you will need to know. It also helps you assess your trouble spots and strengths. Its the best thing out there!For additional reading check out the Hersch books: &quot;What your __ grader needs to know.&quot;Good Studying!"},{"Title":"CSET: Multiple Subjects (Cliffs Test Prep)","review":"Wasted my valuable time using this and the Kaplan guide (which I have given an equally bad review...) The practice tests are NOTHING like the real thing. The actual multiple choice questions were far more difficult than anything the guide prepared me for. As I anxiously await my results, for subtest I and III, I plan on taking a prep class for subtest II. My advice is don't waste precious time and money on this....BIG thumbs done."},{"Title":"CSET: Multiple Subjects (Cliffs Test Prep)","review":"I am using this book to study for my Multiple Subject CSET exam. Let me tell you what I have found useful about this book, as well as the areas that did not help in this book. First of all, I like the fact that there are two practice exams in the back of the book. They have the answers for the practice exams, as well as the explanations for the answers in the case that you would like to go over them afterwards. However, I agree with some of the other reviews posted here, and I am very disappointed in the content and the review sections. The information reviewed in each of the subjects does not nearly go into the depth of the knowledge needed for the exam. In my opinion, it doesn't efficiently review the test taker for the CSET Exam."},{"Title":"CSET: Multiple Subjects (Cliffs Test Prep)","review":"Read the previous reviews and did not use Cliffs Test Prep but instead used everything need to know 4, 5, 6th grades. I also went to the cset website and did the practice test over and over again. This was very helpful!!! I passed my tests on the first try. The test was very long and draining took all 5 hours for the three subtests. Good luck!"},{"Title":"CSET: Multiple Subjects (Cliffs Test Prep)","review":"The review sections of this book are completely worthless. For instance, for the Communications/Media/Drama review section there is only 2 pages of the most basic terms, that any idiot would know what they mean. And for the Literacy/Language section, there is only about 8-9 pages focusing primarily on grammar and not the type of linguistic concepts that appear on the real test. The Literature section is equally weak, with only the most general of timelines and glossaries. I wouldn't bother with this book."},{"Title":"CSET: Multiple Subjects (Cliffs Test Prep)","review":"This has been a disappointing year! I now have to take the tests again. I DID NOT PASS. I don't find it clear and helpful. I truly wish there were more options and taking a class is not an option.

These things are killing my brain and pockets. And they have nothing to do with your teaching ability. ~exhale~ sorry, had to vent. I also used a program by CA teachers which provides a concise and brief cross-section of real CSET content at cateachingsolutions.com. This stuff at Teaching Solutions was more to the point and closely reflected what I saw on the CSET. I would also recommend the CSET classes if you have a few weekends of free time."},{"Title":"CSET: Multiple Subjects (Cliffs Test Prep)","review":"The theory of organization in this book was good, but in practice it was a disaster. The book includes subtests to show you your trouble areas, which I thought was helpful. however, the actual review sections are poorly put together and leave out a lot of crucial information. It doesn't explain, but rather just gives vague statements and drawings. On one of the sample questions it talks about what a paper will look like after being folded and cut in a certain way. As an explanation for this answer, the authors simply state to cut it out and see for yourself. Well, that's not very a practical explanation as you can't do that during the test. I haven't gotten my scores back from the CSET yet, but it was ugly that day."},{"Title":"CSET: Multiple Subjects (Cliffs Test Prep)","review":"This book was the biggest disappointment ever. Not only is the CSET a stupid test to begin with but this book does everything but give you an idea of what to expect on the test. I walked into the test confident and feeling very well prepared, when I left I knew I was doomed! Do everything you can to avoid buying this book!"},{"Title":"CSET: Multiple Subjects (Cliffs Test Prep)","review":"I just received my scores for the CSET exam, and I passed ALL THREE subtests on my first try, and all taken on the same day, thanks in large part to Cliff's CSET test prep book by Jerry Bobrow and Stephen Fisher.There was a test prep workshop that I enrolled in that recommended the MSAT book by Research &amp; Education Association. However, the CSET exam replaces the MSAT exam; the reason given for using the older MSAT book was because it contained more detail in the history and literature sections. To this day, I never opened the MSAT book; rather, I used the Cliff's CSET book extensively.Here is how the Cliff's CSET book worked for me:First, I studied the CSET Web site (URL: http://www.cset.nesinc.com/) to find out exactly what the exam was all about. There is a link that provides you with a comprehensive outline of the subject matter requirements that you are responsible for on the CSET. Print this out and study it! THEN, I started reviewing Cliff's CSET book and saw how closely it mirrored the official CSET Web site's content requirements that would be tested for on the exam. It was this organization, and additional detail not found on the CSET official Web site, that helped me tremendously in preparing for the exam.Second, after reviewing each section in the Cliff's CSET book, I referred to a series of books that provided additional detail. I have read complaints about this book not having enough detail from other reviews of this book. I also read reviews that recommended supplementing this lack of detail with a series of books by Hirsch: &quot;What Your 4th (or 5th or 6th) Grader Needs to Know.&quot; When I took a look at these books, I said to myself, they are good resources if you have the time to sift through them all by grade. But I am a busy mom raising gradeschool children, trying to maximize my time studying in order to work towards obtaining my teaching credential. I am also 40-something with a several-year period break in my career to raise kids, and I don't remember a thing about what I learned in gradeschool. I referred to a series of books that were a TREMENDOUS help to me, and moreso in a shorter period of time: the &quot;Everything You Need to Know About (World History, American History, Science, English, Geography, and Math) Homework&quot; series by Anne Zeman and Kate Kelly. I purchased all six (there are more, but I focused only on the key subject areas). You can either buy them new or used, or check your local library. If you are a visual learner like I am, these books are for you.Third, having reviewed the CSET Web site, reviewing all sections of the Cliff's CSET test prep book, reviewing content areas in more detail using the homework series of books, I then took the entire Practice Test 1 in the Cliff's book. For those that I missed, I read the detailed analysis of what the correct answers were, and why. The Cliff's book does an EXCELLENT job of explaining the answers to each question. Once I reviewed my mistakes, and tallied my scores, which the book tells you how to do, I then took Practice Test 2. I also made sure that I answered all of the practice essay exam questions. Again, the book does an EXCELLENT job of describing to you how to approach answering the essay questions. When you review the breakdown of the entire CSET exam, you will see that the essay questions are worth a lot of your score. But if you practice the ones in the book, you will realize that you do not have to write perfectly written prose to answer the question correctly. You can make a list of your answers or draw diagrams with labels if you want to, so long as you get the main points identified.Finally, I then had two days to go before exam time - all five hours of it on an early Saturday morning. There were no surprises. And I had 10 minutes to spare to double check my exam booklets that I had answered every question.The Cliff's CSET book guided my overall test taking strategy: I focused more on those content areas that were worth the most points (e.g., history, science, math, and language arts comprising Subtests I and II) and less on those areas that were worth less points (e.g., human development and the arts in Subtest III). But I did not ignore any of these subject areas.I also kept reminding myself that this is an exam of what I should know as a future teacher of gradeschool kids, and NOT as a single subject high school teacher or college professor (those require different exams [grin]). This is why I found the homework series of books I mentioned above helpful; they kept me focused on what my appropriate level of understanding should be. And it made my studying actually quite fun. Otherwise, it is very easy to get overwhlemed with too much information. I only needed to pass the exam, not get 100%. Perfection was not my goal here; a passing score that demonstrated my basic level of competency was; and I achieved that.I believe that if you focus your study around this book, you can easily test for what you know, identify what you don't know, list and prioritize the additional resources you need to refer to to get the additional content detail you require. Further, if you continue to work through the book's practice tests, it is highly probable that you will be well prepared, and with minimal surprises, when you take the actual exam.Thank you Cliff's, and thank you Jerry Bobrow and Stephen Fisher for a very effective study guide. This book definitely took the &quot;anxiety&quot; out of the test for me."},{"Title":"CSET: Multiple Subjects (Cliffs Test Prep)","review":"First of all, let me say that this book, the CliffsTestPrep guide on the CSET, is a big disappointment. I waited 2 months for this book to be published, and when it finally came to my door i was overjoyed. I happily scanned through the pages, and by the time i got to the last page, i felt like there was something missing. The contents seemed very general and not thorough enough. The book was filled with outlines and reviews on the topics that were \\"supposed\\" to be on the test, however, it does not go in depth with these topics.Nevertheless, i stuck with it anyways, since i had never taken the CSET before, and Cliffs had gotten me out of trouble many times in the past. So i studied this book religiously for 3 weeks. Then when it came time to take the CSET, i thought i was ready. I went into taking the CSET with confidence, and came out shattered. The topics that were covered in the book came reasonably close to the actual test, but it didn't matter because the questions in the test requires you to know more of the details... which was not provided in this book.Let me give you a preview of Cliff's guide on the CSET. There are three parts to it. The first part is: Analysis of Exam Areas, which is pretty pointless, because this info could be downloaded off the CSET website. The second part is a review of the subject areas. And like i said earlier, was insufficient. Finally, the third part of the book consists of 2 practice exams with detailed answers. The only thing i thought was useful about this book.I did not get my results yet, but it doesn't look good for me. If i didn't pass, i don't blame anyone but myself. I guess if there is an advice i can give you is to use more than one study aid. I don't recommend this book, but you can buy it for reviewing if you have extra money and time to spare. Hope this helps."},{"Title":"CSET: Multiple Subjects (Cliffs Test Prep)","review":"The Cliff's Notes covered the basic material of the new CSET, but I thought it wasn't as thorough as it should of been. The CSET test had questions that were not covered on this book. The route I took was to read some of Hirsch's work. It helped out more than the Cliff's. Also if you are a new CSET test taker, don't purchase any of the products from teaching solutions. I just read about it on the internet that it is a scam and a bogus product. I had just got mine, and I could tell you to save your money. It's a no go.Hirsch's book is probably the best bet to go."},{"Title":"CSET: Multiple Subjects (Cliffs Test Prep)","review":"Most negative reviewers found this book lacking because it did not contain all the information found on the CSET - and it doesn't. There is no way one book can cover American history, world history, English, geometry, P.E., science, dance, etc., etc., etc... What it does do is give a good outline. Do not plan on using this book as a \\"bible\\". Use it as a good starting point and if you lack knowledge in any of the subjects you'll just have to spend a bit of time in the library.(When one buys a Cliffs book there is the expectation that one is buying a short cut (i.e. the answers). Don't expect that from this book.)"},{"Title":"CSET: Multiple Subjects (Cliffs Test Prep)","review":"I agree with the poster below me. The CSET test prep book was a complete waste, that did not come close to providing the necessary material for the real test. The test questions are really a breeze and compared to the actual thing.I took the subtest II science/math on November '03, and I can honestly say that the material from this book was scant, weak, and just too light. The actual CSET tests you on material and concepts that you won't find in this book.If you want to fool yourself into thinking that this test prep has the whole package because it is by &quot;Cliff's Notes&quot; and the author has a PhD, your in for a BIG surprise come test day.I am really starting to wonder if the author is publishing these superficial books just to make a quick buck. I am beginning wonder if this is the type of quality he is shooting for in all of his test books. The best bet would be to go with the Hirsch's series. They tend to cover a wide range of relevant material. If you still are not convinced by what I am saying, then just sit down in the bookstore, and flip through the CSET Cliff's Notes book instead of buying it. Save your money for the next subtest you need to take."},{"Title":"CSET: Multiple Subjects (Cliffs Test Prep)","review":"I thought the Cliff Notes was a good study guide to start with. It gives a nice overview of the contents (maybe not as detailed-but hey) and it gives some sample tests in the back, so it was a big + for me. I had a good feel for how the CSET would test me out in terms of the format of the test. Although I had to use \\"What my XX grader needs to know\\" to supplement my studies, I found the CLiff's study guide a helpful tool.I also purchased the Teaching Solutios CD (cateachingsolutions.com) and it is a total bogus product! Watch out for this product, cause the material is not relevant to the CSET AT ALL. They have weird fonts all over the material, they have NO sample test or sample test questions, and the content is nowhere near what the CSET is testing. This is one of those internet scam companies, so watch out. I deeply encourage serious customers to do an internet online search about this product, to re-verify what I am saying (if you think I'm making this up). If you had already purchased this product, file a complaint with your credit card company, and have it removed and blocked from your account. Just my thoughts ..."},{"Title":"CSET: Multiple Subjects (Cliffs Test Prep)","review":"I used this book three months prior to taking the 3 cset multilple subjects tests. It took that much time for me to read all of the material covered in the book! Don't expect to read through the book one week before the test and ace the exam. You'll be covering alot of material and will have to remember alot of it. This book is comprehensive, well organized and breaks down the material covered into palatible slices. Just start early with it and like me you will be able to pass the cset tests in the first go!"},{"Title":"CSET: Multiple Subjects (Cliffs Test Prep)","review":"Just received the good news. I passed all 3 subsets of the CSET the first time. Must say studying for and taking the test was one of the hardest things I've ever done. The volume of material (7 subjects) was overwhelming at times. Here's how I prepared. Hope it helps you. I started with Cliffs and the Hirsch series (4th, 5th, 6th grades). I then took an online practice test from the CSET website and failed all but the PE questions. It was very unsettling and discouraging. With one week left before the test (I started studying one month before it), I purchased and read the Boosalis book. After not doing very well on another online practice test, I went back and reviewed the history and science sections (my weaknesses) of Hirsch. One day before the test I reviewed test taking strategies. Although I'm glad I was scared by the practice tests and they forced me to study more than I thought would be necessary, know that the real test isn't quite as hard. Do not rely on Cliffs alone. They are a good starting point. Hirsch and Boosalis go deeper. Part of the challenge of the real thing is time management. I finished it with only 10 minutes to spare. It's a 5 hour test that seems to fly by. Be sure to manage your time wisely if you are taking all 3 subsets on the same day. The good news is it is possible to pass it all at once. I'm 25 years out of college and admittedly was a bit rusty. Had I known how difficult the test would be, I might have taken it in parts. Good luck everyone!"},{"Title":"CSET: Multiple Subjects (Cliffs Test Prep)","review":"Book gave a nice overview of the CSET content, but I thought it wasn't as thorough as it should of been.

And to any new students taking the CSET, don't purchase any of the products from Teaching Solutions. I had just learned that it is a scam, and the CD (they say they have a book, but they don't) is just filled with useless, garbled information."},{"Title":"CSET: Multiple Subjects (Cliffs Test Prep)","review":"I disagree with the poster who was giving the Cliff's CSET book such a glowing review. A CSET test taker knows a bad study guide after having taken and seen a real exam.As with the majority of the posters here, I agree that the content of the Cliff's Notes fell short of meeting the contents for subtest I, II, and III. The material presented in the Cliff's Notes, is either based on a loosely outline format, or will contain sporadic information that is basically a rehash of the contents of its previous edition (MSAT). If you really need to study for these tests, you CAN include the Cliff's Notes, but only use it as a last minute review. The sample tests in the Cliffs Notes are just exercises, and do not reflect the real CSET multiple subject test in question format or content. Hirsch's book (and yes, this is the correct spelling, not the one made by the previous poster) is a good reference, and you can find this book here on amazon. I also agree with the previous poster who said that you should save your money and not purchase the Teaching Solutions CD. All in all, just study, make flash cards, use other resources, and you should be fine."},{"Title":"CSET: Multiple Subjects (Cliffs Test Prep)","review":"The book had writing on almost every page, AND there was pink highlighter EVERYWHERE!

That may sound bleak, but I cannot begin to adequately express how much this work impacted me as I read it. The people and places haunt you. The two best compliments I can think of are...First, if only the book were longer, much longer, and the details in the \\"holes\\" between the chapters/short stories were brought out clearly, removed from the beautiful veil that now exists. Second, this book feels as if it were channeling the very best of William Falkner's sense of place, Graham Greene's overt Roman Catholicism and his depiction of the plight of the common man, George Orwell's descriptions of the misuse of language for political ends and how people can be enslaved, and Alexander Solzhenitsyn's description of the complex interaction of people, politics, climate, and culture. Like in their best works, Bastos brings Paraguay alive, its people, their history, and its physical geography. Bastos reveals the religiosity, both for and against, that undergirds this culture at that time, as well as the all enveloping banal political graft, greed, and corruption that is everywhere.Be warned that this is not a happy book. It is not about personal redemption (though some are redeemed). Nor is it about personal bravery (though many are quite brave). This is about people who suffer. They suffer in the small things of daily life due to privation and oppression. They suffer due to the inhumanity of others (e.g., thru rape and forced economic slavery). They suffer due to the failure of those they put their trust in, whether it is their government, leaders, or those closest to them. And they suffer through the living hell of war! Anyone interested in the Chaco War should absolutely read this to experience what life was like for the common soldier. Bastos, born 1917, was a medical auxiliary late in the war (1934-35) and saw first hand the sheer pain, suffering, misery, and agony that was this modern desert war between \\"brothers\\".This is neither a hard book to make sense of (thematically) nor to read. The translation into English is wonderful. I felt like I was experiencing the poverty of village life and the horrors of the Chaco War. The decent glossary supplies the meaning of the few untranslated Quarani words that don't have an immediate meaning; thus many Quarani words for specific flora and fauna are left untranslated but we know they are a type of bird or vegetation.But the overall structure of the book may cause some readers to pause. At first the chapters appear to be relatively unrelated short stories, sometimes set in one place or another and with changing characters. But trust me, the reader is rewarded by the end as squares are circled and nearly all is essentially revealed. Sometimes one story appears to end but something important is revealed about it later. Once a story ends and the next story ends at the same ending of the previous one, with the two stories showing how the respective protagonists ended up where they did. So for me, yes this is novel, an equisite masterpiece of writing.Interestingly, we do not learn the name of the author, Miguel Vera, until chapter VI. He narrates in the first person chapters I, III, V, VII, and IX (except for the letter at the end). Based on the final letter, it appears both highly possible and probable that Vera also wrote the remaining chapters in the 3rd person.Historically, the book takes place from about 1910 (when Haley's Comet appeared) through 1936 (the year after the Chaco War's end), though the first story has elements going back to the period of the 1830s through the 1870s. I'd encourage any reader to do a quick study of Paraguay, esp. the period from the founding to its defeat in 1870 during the War of the Triple Alliance and then from 1910-1954, the period of the \\"Liberal Era\\" which entailed so much civil war and revolution, the Chaco War (1932-1935), and eventual long-term military dictatorship.Contents:- Foreword (pgs. 7-10)- Chapters 1-9 (pgs. 15-263)I. Titled Son of Man, set in the village of Itape. This is the story of Gaspar Mara, the leper, and Macario Francia, the beggar.II. Wood & Flesh, set in the village of Sapukai. This is the story of the Russian doctor who establishes the leper colony and goes mad.III. Stations, set on a train ride from Itape thru Sapukai to Asuncion. This is the story of Miquel Vera taking a train ride when he is a small boy.IV. Exodus, set in the mate slave plantation in Takuru-Puku. This is the story of the imprisonment and escape of Casiano and Nati.V. Home, set in Sapukai. This is the story of Miguel Vera finding the railroad coach of Casiano miles away from the village, moved quietly, miraculously, laboriously for over 20 years.VI. Fiesta, set in Sapukai. The story of the defeated rebel, Cristobal, hiding from the Army forces looking for him.VII. Doomed Men, set in the Pena Hermosa island prison and in the Chaco, during the seige of Boqueron (these diary entries start on 1/1/32 and end 9/29/32). Miguel Vera's diary entries for 1932.VIII. Special Mission, set in the Chaco, during the seige of Boqueron (Sept. 1932). The story of Cristobal trying to get his convoy of trucks (water & medicine) to Miguel Vera's lost battalion during the seige.IX. Aftermath, set in Itape. The story of Miguel Vera coming back to Itape and the returning war veteran Crisanto, who cannot forget the Chaco War because it became his entire life, his reason for existing.- Glossary (pg. 264)- Afterward (pgs. 265-279)I am now going to read his 1974 masterpiece: I, the Supreme, about the megalomaniac founding dictator of Paraguay who ruled from the mid-1810s until his death in 1840. The story of Dr. Francia, who is obliquely mentioned in the first chapter of Son of Man.Note, this is the very first work of Spanish fiction I have ever finished. My previous attempts failed, possibly due to the translation? I am so glad I read this most important and vital work. Some day I hope to see the movie."},{"Title":"Son of Man","review":"After reading about the military operations in the Chaco War, I wanted to know further and read contemporary literature of both beligerents.

This is a wonderful system for children to develop faith in their prayer life. It gives the parent an opportunity to discuss the prayers and why some may not have been answered the way the child expected (such as why the prayer to win the soccer game did not work). Journalizing gives the child the opportunity to go back and see how prayers were answered, how they may have been answered in an unexpected way, and when they were answered. It also gives them the opportunity to reexamine their prayers as they grow and learn how to pray effectively.

The information presented here is very basic and easy to follow. Herman Wouk was a very gifted writer and his talent helps this work flow very smoothly from cover to cover. He presents Judaism's history, traditions, religious practices, and worldview.What is presented here is a basic guide for understanding Judaism from an Orthodox perspective. While quick glances are given to Reform and Conservative movements, Mr. Wouk practiced Orthodox Judaism and so the majority of the information concerns that movement. While I can recommend this as a good place to start for converts or non-practicing Jews looking to reconnect, anyone who's had any exposure to Jewish practice is probably above the information presented.As a person in the midst of conversion this got me pointed in the right direction. If nothing else it made me realize that I had a whole lot of learning left to do. I ordered this along with \\"Jewish Literacy\\". While \\"This Is My God\\" offers the basics, that one gets a lot deeper and is highly recommended as a companion reference to this work."},{"Title":"This is My God","review":"I've studied the Christian religion with some intensity as a layman. Having attended a Synagog with my Jewish friends I still couldn't get a handle on what it was the Jewish religion taught their members about God or what it meant to be a Jew who was part of a Jewish nation. Mr. Wouk explained it to me in his wonderful prose and powerful intellect. His representation of the schisms within Judaism is very helpful and not polemic. When I finished, I couldn't help but chuckle and wonder if the American State Department has read this book. With the Hassidim becoming a strong political force in secular Israel, after the American government has given billions of dollars to Israel, we could end up supporting a nation that discriminates against women. What's wrong with that picture. This book is now part of my top 25 that I recommend my children and grandchildren read."},{"Title":"This is My God","review":"Herman Wouk examines Judaism in a modest manner that informs without preaching. Wouk looks at his religion from his Orthodox practice, but with easy-reading prose made for all audiences (Jews, Christians, etc.). Readers learn about the Sabbath, Torah, holidays, rituals, feasts, and other vital traditions in this, the world's oldest monotheistic religion. We also learn about Judaism's three main branches (Orthodox, Conservative, Reform), plus pious and non-practicing Jews. Additionally, Wouk examines his own perspective. The result is an informative and personal look at Judaism, particularly in the USA.Some note that Judaism has changed somewhat since this book arrived in the late 1950's; today there's more ultra-Orthodox, non-practicing, even messianic Jews. Still, this is an informative, valuable book. Readers might also enjoy Wouk's popular novels, including THE CAINE MUTINY and WINDS OF WAR."},{"Title":"This is My God","review":"This is my God has become a classic on Jewish Thought and Culture. If you are just beginning or are a seasoned scholar, This is my God has something for you.I totally recommend this book. You will enjoy immensely. Read it with a highlighter, you are going to want to quote it later."},{"Title":"This is My God","review":"This work is a wonderful introduction to and survey of Orthodox Judaism. This book stands out from the pack of other works on the same topic in that This Is My God was written by a master novelist (Wouk gave us Winds of War, War and Remembrance, The Caine Mutiny, et al). Herman Wouk is passionate and candid in what he writes here.The tone is conversational, unconfrontational and uncondescending. Although packed with factual information, Wouk keeps it personal and interesting by moving back and forth between the mechanics of Orthodox Judaism, and his own personal experience - especially his formative years under the hand of his beloved, learned and pious grandfather. Considering the scope, it is brief, by the author's own admission.Wouk explains the basic approaches marking Orthodox, and to a lesser extent Conservative and Reform, Judaism. He discusses the practice . . . dietary laws, tallit, the Sabbath, the Feasts, etc. He sketches history and historical figures (I especially appreciated his sorting out of the great sages and each of their places in Judaical history). He describes the source texts - Torah and Talmud. Also, Wouk easily could have - but did not - bury the reader with Hebrew phraseology.This book is unique and well worth the time for an interested truth seeker of ANY faith to invest. I could continue with the praises of this work, but I would just be repeating what other reviewers have already written.I will add a couple of critical comments. This book, published in 1959 (written while the State of Israel was only 10 years old, how remarkable!), has become a bit dated. (Obviously no fault of Wouk's here). Orthodox Judaism has evolved increasingly into what people call \\"Ultra-Orthodox\\" and has become largely identified with Hasidic dress and practices. In today's world an observant Orthodox author, out of reverence, may well have refrained from penning the title \\"God\\", preferring rather \\"G_d\\" (interesting since the diety's personal Name is not actually God . . . a gentile word having rather pagan roots). Orthodox vs Conservative vs Reform have all changed a bit over the years. I was disappointed that Wouk did not even mention the phenomenon of Messianic Judaism, which has grown greatly since the book was authored. Wouk also more or less wrote off the Karaites as an extinct sect . . . but that movement has also grown greatly since the book was authored. But of course Wouk's passion is Orthodoxy, and my point is that there has been much change even in the brief historical period since 1959. This is a minor criticism and hardly detracts from the value of the book.Secondly, although I was drawn to this book by its enticing title, it would have been more accurately titled, \\"This Is My Religion\\". Orthodox Judaism wholly embraces the the Talmud. Unlike the Torah, the Talmud is arguably the work of great men, but not necessarily of God. There is wide and heated disagreement on this point. But in Wouk's book, any insight as to the nature of God will have to be inferred from the general discussion.But again, any truth-seeker, and especially followers of the God of Israel, should have this information. An observant and learned Orthodox Jew will likely find no new information here, but may enjoy Wouk's personal perspectives."},{"Title":"This is My God","review":"I'm atheist, however I enjoy religion like a human activity.

This work focuses on Herman's experiences with Judaism as a young adult, through his middle aged years in the late 1950s (with updates in the back of the book from the 60s and 80s, coupled with annotated updates when necessary, throughout the work). If you are an aspiring convert, or you practice Judaism of any sort, and you want an experiential view on the subject from another's perspective, this book is for you."},{"Title":"This is My God","review":"I was pleased to find a hard cover copy of this book in stock.

Thank you."},{"Title":"This is My God","review":"Given this is not apologetics, an overload of what is done, with continual references to the lifelong study required, I felt I did not know much more about the reasons behind the liturgical rites and the precepts of this religion than I did before starting this book."},{"Title":"This is My God","review":"In 1959, Orthodox Judaism was a dinosaur. Its members didn't have to fight against being arrogant as they must do today. It took a great deal of Chutzpah for Herman Wouk to write this book where he discusses and then dismisses Reform and Conservative Judaism in a chapter. Without rancor or overt criticism he discusses these movements within Judaism but he doesn't accept them as Judaism.That said, this is an excellent book on what Judaism means in regards to marriage, history, Israel, prayer, observance, Torah, Talmud, kashrut and study. He writes in a clear concise style concerning the daily life of an observant Jew as well as the history that went into it. Many times he argues for the education of young Jewish children in Judaism (taking issue with the refrain &quot;they can choose it when they grow up&quot; since it is easy to reject what you've learned but hard to learn something you should have learned when you were a child.) and against the rising tide of assimilation. He tells personal stories about studying Talmud with his grandfather and his time fighting in World War II. One particularly amusing one is how he was disappointed to learn that &quot;an eye for an eye&quot; meant compensatory damage payments as it was one of his best arguments for rejecting observance altogether at age 14 when he would have rather gone to Saturday afternoon movies.A caveat in that if you are an observant Jew, you will probably not learn much from this book. This is the book that rabbis have conversion candidates read in order to make sure that everyone has a good idea as to what is going to happen if the conversion goes through. This is a great book for non-observant Jews and Jews who consider themselves Reform or Conservative, as Wouk has a talent for saying potentially explosive perspectives with enough humility and candor that you aren't personally insulted if you disagree. This is also a good book for non-Jews wanting to know what Judaism is all about.What makes this book exceptional is that Herman Wouk's perspective is becoming a rare voice in Orthodoxy. Orthodox Judaism is increasingly moving to the right partly as a reaction to the intermarriage and assimilation of the liberal movements within Judaism, partly as a sign of formerly non-observant Jews becoming observant and finding distaste in their old lives.Wouk's perspective was probably a standard voice in 1950s Judaism, but it is one that is not heard often enough in today's Judaism that finds itself pulled between the stark limiting observance of the Haredi and the &quot;whatever-you-think-is-right-is-right&quot; lassez faire of the Reform (including the Renewelists and Reconstructionists). It is easy to condemn. It takes effort to reach out without rancor or snap judgement as Wouk does in this book. This is what makes Wouk's book valuable to people who already know the material"},{"Title":"This is My God","review":"Herman Wouk blends Jewish history, Jewish practice, and personal experience in a wonderful tour for Judaism, appropriate for nonJews, Jews, and even those who think they know it all.While his discussions of Shabbat, Hanukah, and other observances are fine reading, Wouk reaches his peak when discussing his own and his family's experiences--his grandfather, whom he obviously admired a great deal, his father, who spent an immense sum of money (for the times) to buy the honor of reading the book of Jonah on Yom Kippur afternoon. Wonderful images of a time in Judaism gone by.I do not find it limiting that Wouk writes from an Orthodox perspective (he assumes, for example, that only a man would wear a tallit, which is the Orthodox practice, but not the Conservative). Wouk was what he was, and I do not think he should have modified his book to an egalitarian perspective to satisfy the wolves of political correctness.Well worth an annual read and a place on your shelf."},{"Title":"This is My God","review":"A formidable book, written for everyone, from the pious Chassidim who seems to know all about Judaism to the secular Wall Street Jewish Banker who is far from his faith but feels every now and then the sweet but stern internal calling of his demanding heritageThe best chapters,in my opinion, are related to the experiences related to the secular Jewish people when they got involved in the Jewish religious rituals at the synagogue or at home during childhood, \\"one feels like he is telling ones own experiences when he was a Jewish kid, so unexplained and uneasy situations at that time become hilariousGenerally speaking, Wouk, who is observant, tried to be very open avoiding dogma and intended to convey to the Jewish reader the precious value of his 4000 years heritage and a way to learn how to feel proud about it.Wouk did not forget the non-Jewish reader either, he wrote this book with simple concepts and language so anyone interested about Judaism can get a good basic introduction through these pages"},{"Title":"This is My God","review":"As a Christian who is very curious to learn about Judaism, this book served as a fine introductory lesson. Herman Wouk researched this field exhaustively and relied on the expert knowledge of ordained rabbis on matters of religious law, and I think he tried to avoid overwhelming or intimidating a newcomer to this field of study with excessive details or exposition. In its directness and lucidity it has the same qualities as his other works, and after having read The Winds of War &amp; War and Remembrance twice each, I could not resist the opportunity to delve into this book. As Wouk noted, many top quality writers have almost a conversational style - and he certainly does. Wouk's dry sense of humor is very effective. This is worthwhile not only to read through in a few sittings, but also for reference on specific topics. I also appreciated the author's attempts to explain his methods of transliteration from Hebrew, and suggestions on their English pronounciation.I hope to use this book in doing further study. Recommended."},{"Title":"This is My God","review":"A must read for all Jews and those considering becoming Jews.Wouk gives, among other things, an understanding of why it is important to observe the Jewish dietary laws and why improvised prayer has meaning.The result is that I am now incorporating more observances into my daily life. For the first time, I see their importance. This book has changed my life."},{"Title":"This is My God","review":"I was interested to understand the Jewish life to understandBuber better. This book is a great help, for a good introduction toJewish life. Terms like Torah, Kosher are made clear here. The section &quot; Chosen People&quot; was an eye opener to me. I was under the wrong impression about the concept of &quot;Jews&quot; as chosen people. I will repeat his words &quot; But this idea of salvation limited to one group never had place in the Jewish faith and has no place in it today. In Judaism right conduct is the path to God. This path lies open to Jews and non-Jews&quot;."},{"Title":"This is My God","review":"The great advantage of this book has, is the readablity of it. It almost reads like a novel.

It includes every topic you'd want in an introduction: the Sabbath, the High Holy Days, kosher rules, the Torah, the Talmud, Hasidism, Israel, and so forth. Wouk's obvious love of Judaism is contagious, even to non-Jewish readers like me.One warning: When I read this book for a class on Judaism at a Christian seminary, some of the students had trouble with the extravagantly non-gender-inclusive language. I personally can deal with masculine language for all humanity in books more than a few decades old (this was first published in 1957), but when Wouk assumes that the reader is male, as when he refers to the reader's beard (I'm female)--well, it's almost too funny to be offensive.In any case, I highly recommend it.P.S. (eight years later): I assigned this book as the main text on Judaism (along with the Bible) in a college class on Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and the students really liked it."},{"Title":"This is My God","review":"This Is My GodHerman WoukThis is the perfect starting point for anyone-Jew or Christian -who wants to learn about Judaism. It is thoughtful, insightful, entertaining and sensitively explains Judaism to a broad readershipThis is not simply a guide to the Jewish religion .Herman Wouk-a well known novelist and playwright - is clearly a man of the world but is also an observant JewHe speaks about his own illuminating insights and experiencesWritten in 1959 it is still equally relevant today as then . He points out the contradiction of leftwing secularists who claim that their rejection of religion is a result of the conformity in inherent therein , when their own entire ways of life and thought processes are based on conformityHe explains a conversation he had with a radical young student thus:\`She had been reading sociology and was full of terms like anomy , other-directedness , acculturation and similar jaw-breakers which she got off with athletic ease. The burden of her tale was that Judaism meant ritualism , and ritualism meant conformity which was a great evil.\`The interesting thing about my charming enlightener while she delivered her polemic against conformity , was dressed in a garb as ceremonious as a bishop's from the correct wrinkles in her sweater sleeves to the prescribed smudge on her saddle shoes. She spoke her piece for autonomy in a vocabulary of the teens as rigid , as circumscribed , as repetitious , as marked in intonation , as a litany'His social commentary is one of observation rather than of judgement and he states for example that while his preference is for Orthodox Judaism he is unable to join the wringing chorus of denunciation of Reform and Conservative Judaism of some fellow Orthodox Jews.He also refuses to pass judgement on the 'assimilators' while fully voicing his grave concerns about the threat of assimilation to JudaismHe also points out the common roots of Christianity and Judaism and in a discussion .A good example is his discussion of the Jewish Festival of Lights : Hanukkah , which falls in the same month as Christmas and is often celebrated so that Jewish children do not have to feel that they are missing out on the Christmas enjoyed by their Christian peersHanukkah is observed in remembrance of the defeat by the Israelites of the Greek and Syrian overlords led by Antiochus who aimed to obliterate the Jewish faith.Wouk reminds us what the real point of contact between the two festivals is :' Had Antiochus succeeded in obliterating Jewry a century and a half before the birth of Jesus , there would have been no Christmas .The feast of Nativity rests on the victory of Hanukkah'Overall this is an explanation of the religion for anyone interested to learn whatever their faith or orientation."},{"Title":"This is My God","review":"A heartfelt and personal discussion of Judaism.

Most quilters I've seen would tend more to a 1\\" log, and many antique quilts have even significantly narrower logs than that.I bring this up because it will greatly affect the look of your quilt. I like the antique quilt look, so I prefer to use a much smaller log and make more blocks for the quilt. This difference isn't immediately apparent from looking at small photos in a book.The most recent version of the book does show a number of projects in differnet fabrics, colors, and block arrangements.

Eleanor Burns is there for you, with great illustrations, easy to understand instructions, and delicious photos of finished projects. An added bonus: detailed info on fabric quantities for various sizes of finished quilt (wall hanging, crib, twin, etc.) You don't have to struggle with the math! In fact, your only real challenge will be picking colors. She classifies &quot;Log Cabin&quot; as an &quot;easy&quot; project. Don't be misled; the finished projects can dazzle, despite the relatively simple construction methods. You can probably turn out that baby shower quilt in about 2 evenings. A king-size quilt obviously takes longer, but that's because of the time you'll spend wrestling with the greater amount of finished piecework in the machine quilting stage. Although you'll find the basic instructions for log cabin blocks in any number of quilting books, &quot;Log Cabin Patterns&quot; rates a place on any quilter's bookshelf."},{"Title":"Make a Quilt in a Day: Log Cabin Pattern","review":"Eleanor Burns does an excellent job of making quilting simple for beginners. Every step, *every* one, is clearly photographed, so that you know what to do. She works hard to simplify the task of making a quilt, and I think she succeeds. If this had been the first quilting book I picked up, I would have approached my initial projects with a lot more confidence -- and with fewer mistakes.However, the book has been valuable for me even though I'm... well, I'm not sure of the \\"intermediate\\" label, yet, but I'm far from a rank beginner. One reason is the clarity of her instructions. I had attempted to make a log cabin quilt as one of my earliest projects, and I made two boo-boos that Burns would have warned me against. (They were dumb enough, in retrospect, that she should have slapped me. That quilt top is hidden in a drawer, because I'd be too embarrassed to give it away.)Also -- and the reason I picked up this book in the first place -- the instructions are given for every size quilt imaginable, from a wall hanging to crib quilt to extra-large king. Most quilt books give instructions for just one size of quilt; if you want to make another (such as a king instead of a double), you have to figure out the fabric requirements on your own. This book tells you exactly how much you'll need for each size; even better, it reassures you about the fabric usage during construction (\\"at this point, you should be able to sew three blocks for each strip\\").I'm almost done with a crib quilt (a gift for an expectant niece), and I'm quite pleased with the results. It's a pretty quilt, and for the first time my blocks require no trimming! I'm also happy with the speed of construction; this really has been very easy and swift.However, do keep one thing in mind: _Burns is simplifying_. For example, she doesn't have you iron at each step; instead, you finger press and use a stilletto to ensure that you sew seams in the correct direction. (I pressed, anyway.) I suspect that the method she imparts is like the 10-minute simplified recipes for complex dinners -- they can taste just fine but they aren't \\"authentic.\\" On the other hand, this book will get you off the ground, and give you a successful quilt in a short time. You can develop the fancier techniques later.A definite winner for beginners, and quite useful for intermediate quilters, too."},{"Title":"Make a Quilt in a Day: Log Cabin Pattern","review":"This book's step by step instructions on how to cut and speed piece this type of quilt makes it easy for beginners.

I definately recommend this book if you want to create a beautiful quilt that looks like you spent months piecing it together.

The book is full of step by step good instruction. Great for the new quilter."},{"Title":"Make a Quilt in a Day: Log Cabin Pattern","review":"I first bought this book back in 2005. This book has been very helpful to me. It showed very detailed instructions as the pieces were sewn together. I especially liked the quick guide for fabric requirements for each sized quilt. I have made almost every size and pattern in the book by now. The only thing I have found with this book and others printed a few years ago, is the actual size of the quilt may be short for the newer, wider mattresses. For example, the Queen Size will require an additional 4\\" to each border in order to cover the top mattress. I usually add 1\\" to each border until I get an add'l 4\\" on each side except for the top. I personally got stuck on log cabins for about a year before I decided to move on with other patterns! Now I am teaching some new quilters & will get them stuck, as well!"},{"Title":"Make a Quilt in a Day: Log Cabin Pattern","review":"This is a very good book, it has beautiful photographs and is very easy to understand.

Book was in great shape so I am happy with it"},{"Title":"Make a Quilt in a Day: Log Cabin Pattern","review":"I have sewn for years and I always admired quilts but could not see me having the patience in sewing these tiny pieces of scraps to make a square. Eleanor's, Quilt in a Day series makes quilting really simplistic making the project complete quickly. Her instructions are clearly documented, giving visual examples for EVERY step in the quilt. Eleanor's trick in quilting is that you are sewing by color, not by the block, and you work on one color at a time, for each block. In no time, you'll have the front of the quilt completed. The log cabin quilt, is a great starter quilt. And if I was teaching a class, this is the book I would use. Mistakes are easily hidden using minimal amount of fabric. Without taking a quilting class, I used this book to teach myself to quilt. I started making quilts for baby showers, and found myself finishing a baby quilt in a weekend. I also make quilt throws for our family room, and those are the quilts the kids grab when they're cold and watching TV. Quilting is a great hobby for cold or rainy weekends and the quilts make great gifts. Don't waste money on buying quilting magazines, buy Eleanor's book, you'll use them time and time again."},{"Title":"Make a Quilt in a Day: Log Cabin Pattern","review":"This instruction book is extremely well-written. The author clearly illustrates and describes every step of the quilt-making process, and anticipates any confusion which might arise on behalf of the novice with reassuring explanations and pictures. I am an experienced quilter, yet I can tell that someone with less experience would be able to make a beautiful quilt by following these instructions carefully."},{"Title":"Make a Quilt in a Day: Log Cabin Pattern","review":"Book was in excellent condition.

Thanks Amazon.com!"},{"Title":"Make a Quilt in a Day: Log Cabin Pattern","review":"I met a quilter this summer who had this book, and turned me onto the Log Cabin quilt. I had been doing some triangle quilting, and found it very hard to match all those little corners. This is all straight pieces, and with this book you can really find many ways to put together the same quilt block for different effects."},{"Title":"Make a Quilt in a Day: Log Cabin Pattern","review":"Whether you're a skilled quilter or a beginner this book benefits all. Each page has a wealth of information. It tells you how much yardage to buy according to the size you want it, makes all kinds of suggestions to help you decide on fabric, colors, etc. It's second title could be \\"Quilt a Log Cabin Quilt for Dummies.\\" Each page has step by step instructions on cutting out and shows specifically how to lay out the pieces for sewing and gives you many variations of how to turn the blocks to make a different design. It tells you how to cut fabric with a rotary cutter whether you are right or left handed and also gives you a list of products to make the job easier. Then there are instructions for the actual quilting and binding and even gives you directions for pillows or shams and how to make a tote bag.Would I recommend this book to others? You betcha!!!!!! I have been quilting for years but only by the old way of scissor cutting and hand piecing and quilting. At my age of almost 70 I decided to learn machine quilting and this book has been such a help to me."},{"Title":"Make a Quilt in a Day: Log Cabin Pattern","review":"The book was in better shape than I expected for the very low price. Looks almost new. It also arrived much more quickly than I expected."},{"Title":"Make a Quilt in a Day: Log Cabin Pattern","review":"This is the first quilting book i bought. I've heard for years that quilting was hard and a lot of work and exacting and all that stuff. Well I decided to do something about my fabric addiction and decided once and for all I'd make a quilt. I thought the log cabin looked masculine so I bought Eleanor's book. The book describes Eleanors QUICK quilting technique and I must say it is! I don't know that this is called SPEED quilting, but it seems to be! All I had to do was make strips, sew, cut, sew, cut, sew, cut, ... I have 16 beautiful squares that I am trying to figure out what to do with now. :-) If you want to learn piecing, this is a great book to start from. If you want speed techniques, this is also a great book! I'm very pleased with my purchase."},{"Title":"Make a Quilt in a Day: Log Cabin Pattern","review":"I have had this book for about 6 months now and am very happy with it. I bought it to help me make my first quilt on my own.It gives very clear step-by-step instructions and also a list of all general supplies one needs, such as a rotary cutter, cutting mat, different types of batting, pins etc. I did not feel the need to buy all of it, but it does give a good starting list. I probably spent $50-75 to get started, excluding fabrics and a sewing machine of course.What I also love is that it gives very exact amounts of the fabrics you need. I found they are highly accurate, leaving just enough room for a mistake but without having a pile of scraps left.The book offers many different sizes and patterns, showing clearly which patterns go with which size.I highly recommend this book, because it guides you through every step from cutting, assembly, layout, sewing, batting, with text and many helpful images.The only thing I found slightly misleading is the title. Except for the smallest quilts, I don't think many people could finish a quilt in a day."},{"Title":"Make a Quilt in a Day: Log Cabin Pattern","review":"Yes, you really can make a quilt in a day! Her instructions are beautifully organized, supremely clear and easy to follow. Variations on the Log Cabin pattern include Barn Raising, Fields & Furrows, Light & Dark, Zig Zag, and Arrow.

I will definitely make more quilts from this book and buy more books from Eleanor Burns!"},{"Title":"Make a Quilt in a Day: Log Cabin Pattern","review":"A group of friends and I went to VT for a weekend to learn to quilt, and our instructor basically gave us an overview and sat us down with this book. The three of us were able to finish most of our quilt top in a few nights, and have been working on the rest since then.The book is easy to read and has clear pictures. The one area where it could provide more detail is the actual quilting -- it focuses more on the assembly of the quilt.Also, this book doesn't focus on how to sew or use a sewing machine or anything like that, so it is really for someone who isn't a total total beginner (as one of my friends was). I think it is great to use alone or in a group."},{"Title":"Make a Quilt in a Day: Log Cabin Pattern","review":"I just made my very first quilt using this book.

After receiving the book and paging through it, I've decided I need my own copy.

There is also helpful information on fabric selection and cutting instructions. A great resource for any quilter!"},{"Title":"Make a Quilt in a Day: Log Cabin Pattern","review":"I have never taken a quilting class but made my first quilt using this book! The instructions are easy to follow and the photographs clearly illustrate step-by-step how to proceed. She tells you exactly how much fabric you need once you decide the size quilt you want to make and how many blocks are necessary. I had not been excited about the log cabin pattern, but when I saw all the different ways the blocks could be arranged, I developed an interest. I have four small children under the age of 8 and began my quilt in August so that it would hopefully be completed by Christmas. Much to my surprise,I finished it (about 70\\"x70\\") in a month! I would recommend this book to any beginning quilter.4/21/09 I just located the picture of this quilt in our archives and posted it with customer images (ha ha....I've never done that before!)"},{"Title":"Make a Quilt in a Day: Log Cabin Pattern","review":"Eleanor has made strip quilting easy for everyone.

If you have quilted before you have basically what you need already."},{"Title":"Make a Quilt in a Day: Log Cabin Pattern","review":"I attended a workshop by given by Eleanor Burns in 1981 in Houston and bought this book. The next day I started a quilt for my son and I have been quilting ever since.This is a great book for any quilter, but especially for beginning quilters or quilters who are making their first full-sized quilt. The directions are easy to follow and the book is very understandable. Eleanor Burns makes quilting easy and enjoyable and opens quilting to everyone."},{"Title":"Make a Quilt in a Day: Log Cabin Pattern","review":"This book was and still is one of my favorites. I have made several quilts using this book. If I want to make a quilted gift that goes together quickly, this is it! The directions are first rate and if you are a beginner this is an ideal book. I'm an experienced quilter now and still enjoy the ease and joy of a log cabin quilt."},{"Title":"Make a Quilt in a Day: Log Cabin Pattern","review":"First, let me say that Eleanor Burns is, of course, very knowledgable when it comes to quilting. That being said, this book is boring. Being a quilter, I need color photographs to visualize the color arrangement for a quilt. This book is printed on ivory colored paper and all black ink. There are NO color photographs whatsoever.If that doesn't bother you, you will like this book. The directions are easy to follow and well illustrated."},{"Title":"Make a Quilt in a Day: Log Cabin Pattern","review":"I first bought this book, over 30 years ago when I was a young mother. I had very little sewing experience but wanted to tackle a challenge that would create something beautiful. Together with my Mother, and then My Mother In Law we built several Log Cabin quilts. They have been cherished not simply for their beauty, but for the memories of the time spent together. Due to the rough economic times 2 of our children needed to move back to our home to try to get things back on track for their families and themselves. Needless to say there can be a lot of stress when combining 3 familes and 10 people under one roof! So I had a thought, hopfully our working together to create an heirloom item for each of the 5 children might aid the harmony and necessity of working together!My original copy had long ago been loaned out and never returned. So imagine my delight to find they had re issued it with a few updates! The book is so well written, (actually better than in it's first run). You needn't be an expert to follow the instructions. It has the formula's needed to plan and purchase the materials, photos of the different steps and even of the differing patterns that these simple blocks can make. Allowing us to use the same material for the 4 beds in the girls' room yet assuring each quilt will be different! The kid's themselves will be included in the design and making of the quilts. Making it a true family activity. When times are hard people need activities and goals to help strengthen bonds. Today families are more likely to isolate themselves from the very people they share their lives with by emersing themselves in video games and social networks. We need to work together to survive the difficult times our nation is dealing with. What better place to start then in your own home?"},{"Title":"Make a Quilt in a Day: Log Cabin Pattern","review":"This book is wonderful.

I attempted my very first quilt with it this month and am thrilled with the results! The combination of very clear written instructions with step-by-step-by-step color diagrams that don't presume you know anything already gave me much-needed confidence to tackle this project on my own and to succeed at every point along the way. In fact, I was so impressed with it that upon finishing my quilt (whose 16 blocks really were completed in a single day) I have already purchased two more of Ms. Burns' books and plan to use them for my next two projects. I can't recommend it highly enough!"},{"Title":"Make a Quilt in a Day: Log Cabin Pattern","review":"I bought this book several years ago, when I first started quilting. I made 5 quilts (for gifts) at one time with this pattern. I am a visual learner so the illustations and easy to follow directions were perfect for me. I especially appreciated the easy to follow instructions on cutting out, laying out and piecing the strips. They all came out beautifully. One tip; I do not have a quilting sewing machine and had trouble finishing the denim quilts by machine. So I tied these off. I prefer Eleanor Burns' books over others because of their simplicity."},{"Title":"Make a Quilt in a Day: Log Cabin Pattern","review":"I'm a new quilter and had been intimidated by the Log Cabin pattern. I took a class that taught this method at my local sewing machine center, and was able to complete a wall hanging (which at 68\\" x 68\\" is more like a throw) top in an 11 hour class including cutting and chattering time. I'm an Eleanor Burns fan for life now."},{"Title":"Make a Quilt in a Day: Log Cabin Pattern","review":"I am not an experienced quilter, but I have made several quilts. When I came across this book and thumbed through the pages, I was fascinated by her method. When I last made a king-sized quilt, it took me 3-4 years, mostly because I was discouraged by how long it was taking me to assemble it. I started with this pattern recently to make a king-sized quilt as a gift, and I am astounded with how fast I am progressing. With this method, you can work on it in short bursts if you want, but if you have an entire day, you can get a lot done! I highly recommend it! I look forward to using this method to make quick baby quilts in the future!"},{"Title":"Make a Quilt in a Day: Log Cabin Pattern","review":"No way one day!.

I have a sewing machine with which I am pretty familiar but had never attempted a quilt. After looking over this book I decided that it was simple enough that it could probably walk me thru the basics. This book is all I could have asked for. It started with the very, very basics like selecting your fabric, all the way thru to deciding how to quilt the top of the quilt. I didn't know that there were options to finishing it!! Eleanor Burns makes it so easy that she literally assumes you know nothing (good assumption in my case) and tells you step by step what pieces to sew together and in what order. Make a daunting issue very simple. I strongly suggest that you consider this book if you are unsure of yourself at any step in the process. She will help you gain your confidence and come out with a quilt that will make you proud."},{"Title":"Make a Quilt in a Day: Log Cabin Pattern","review":"A great book by Eleanor Burns.

She takes this position at a place called Thornfield Hall where she teaches a young girl named Adele.This novel is well interpreted to show the struggles of an orphaned girl.

The numerous movie versions of it, including the most recent, never do Bronte's prose justice. I believe all modern romance novels sprang from the Bronte sisters' great works, Jane Eyre and Wuthering Heights. Jane Eyre is the more tightly wound of the two. Charlotte spins Jane's interior monologue and her emotional dialog with Rochester into a taut emotional web at the core of Jane, who is a complex and powerful lead character. Rochester is painted as an aloof, arrogant elitist, who is then humanized as Jane's gentler character opens him up.The story itself is masterfully plotted with the same craft and care as the characterizations. Charlotte wastes nothing and no seed planted in Jane's lonely and loveless life early in the novel goes without bearing fruit later in her tale.

It has romance and action. Everything you could want in a good book. This is one of those rare classics that are actually cool."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Whew...I finally finished! I have been holding on to this book since April 2011. It's not because the book was loathsome but because I began to feel as if Jane and I had become friends. As crazy as that may sound, I really hated for this book to end because it felt as if I was parting ways with an old friend.We are introduced to Jane Eyre as a young orphan residing with her uncle's (deceased) wife, Mrs. Reed, and three cousins. Jane was not welcome in their home and was sent to Lowood boarding school. The conditions at Lowood were horrible. Lowood was about survival and Jane soon found out that some didn't. Jane remained at Lowood until she was nineteen where she then transferred to Thornfield Hall to become a governess. It is at Thornfield Hall where Jane's strong resolve and concrete emotions are put to the ultimate test. Here is where the love story begins. Jane and her new employer Edward Rochester fall in love but not without challenges. Even though it was the perfect fairy tale \\"rich man falls in love with lonely orphan,\\" this is where the story takes a turn. Mr. Rochester has a secret. Just when you think nothing else bad can happen to Jane worse knocks the door down.Needless to say Jane had to flee Thornfield Hall abruptly without any direction or much else. She was stranded, starving, and sick when she ended up on the door step of a family that would nurse her back to health. The Rivers family took Jane in and she began to gain her strength mentally, emotionally, and physically. The family was made up of two sisters and a brother. Jane became instant friends with them all. The brother, St. John Rivers, actually discovered the destitute Jane who had been turned away initially by the family servant. During her season with the Rivers family, Jane received one of the best revelations of her life. Her ending up on the door step of the Rivers home was not a coincidence it was \\"divine\\" intervention. St. John Rivers had other plans for Jane once he had studied her for a while. St. John is very stoic and manipulating individual all under the guise of \\"minister.\\" Jane does not fall for his manipulative tactics and follows her heart back to Thornfield Hall. When she arrives at Thornfield Hall she stumbles upon a shocking and horrifying surprise.Jane Eyre is just a \\"boss\\" type chick (if can describe her in hip-hop terms). She faced some insurmountable odds but all these back to back hardships birthed a certain unexplainable resilience in her. Jane was not easily broken because she was grounded in her faith. Bronte developed a character that we need to encourage all young women to read and get to know. Jane didn't succumb to fleshly temptations but instead she fled and this led to a great rewards. Jane's valley experiences let her to a mountaintop of blessings and real love.This book is a classic that has been reviewed numerous times. Most that read Jane's story count her as an old friend because they have been reading her story since high school. Prior to reading this book, I saw several references to it being \\"gothic\\" and there is even a goth illustrated edition. As I read, I began to think it should be categorized as \\"Christian\\" fiction. I absolutely fell in love with all the Biblical references and how grace and faith played major roles throughout the entire story. Jane Eyre started out an orphan who was pressed on every side by adversity but she grew to be a strong woman that one could liken to the mythical phoenix."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"AHHHH! I simply love this book. It has been many years since I first read it, and yet, it still has the ability to sweep me away. This is a true classic in my opinion. If you have never read it, you are truly missing out on one of the most engrossing stories ever written."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is written by Charlotte Bronte, who is a famous female novelist in England during nineteen century. This is also the first famous book she wrote. The book was written in Sheffield, England which is also the hometown of Charlotte. A lot of people consider this book Charlotte's autobiography. That's not exactly true but we still can find many personal experiences of Charlotte's in that book. The entire book's theme shows the values that humans should always live with dignity and love.The book tells a story about a woman named Jane Eyre. Jane was born in a very poor churchman's family and her parents died of enterotyphus when she was very young. She had to live in her uncle's family. Her aunt was a very mean and snobbish woman. She used a lot of ways to abuse Jane and even taught her child to bully Jane. Jane lived there for ten years, but she never yielded to her aunt so her aunt just treated her worse and worse. After Jane's uncle died, her aunt sent her to an orphanage. Although the life in the orphanage was still hard, and children there could not get enough food and the teachers treat them very curly, Jane got her first friend in the orphanage, a girl named Helen. Helen gave Jane much comfort and support but this happiness for her did not last too long; Helen also died by enterotyphus. After that the orphanage improved. Jane studied there for six years and taught there for two more years. Then she left the orphanage and was hired by the steward of Thornfield Hall as a tutor. Thornfiled was a big manor owned by Edward Fairfax Rochester. The life in Thornfield was good and after a long time Mr. Rochester spent with Jane, he was deeply attracted by Jane's dignified character. Jane also fell in love with Mr. Rochester. Before their marriage, bad news come, Jane was told that Mr. Rochester was already married and his violently insane wife was locked in Thornfield Hall. Jane could not bear this shock and left Thronfiled manor. Her life truned harder after she left Thornfield. After a few months later, a clergyman named St. John took Jane in and gave her a job teaching at a local school. One day, Jane got a large amount of money as inheritance from her dead uncle, which her aunt had been keeping from her, Jane also learned from her aunt that St. John is her cousin. At this time St. John asks Jane to marry him and go to India to do missionary work. Jane refused him and realized she was still in love with Mr. Rochester so she decided to go back to him. When she came back to Thornfield Hall, it had already become a ruin. She was told that after she left, the insane woman set a fire in Thornfild Hall, and died during the fire. Mr. Rochester also was hurt during the fire. When Jane returned to him, he was not rich anymore and had become a poor disabled man. But Jane did not care about this at all; she found Mr. Rochester and married him.I strongly recommend Jane Eyre. This novel is very engaging. The plot of the novel is continuous and changes a lot. Every girl should read this book because it teaches you how to be an independent woman with dignity. There are so many characteristics of Jane's that are very valuable in today's society.When I first connected with Jane Eyre, I was a fairytale age girl. Strange thing was when my mother read the novel for me; I was fell in love with it very soon. The story was interesting and I was always curious about what's happen next. Little Jane's poor experiences and her brave impressed me deeply. Those contents really motivated me a strong sense of compassion which is really important for every child in their growth. I still remember when I knew that Jane was locked in a dark room by her aunt. I felt so worry about her and after her recovered form that disaster, I felt so happy for her. That's definitely a good lecture for me that how to share the same feeling with a friend. Little Jane also taught me that no matter how bad thing you experience, you should keep your heart pure and dignity, and always fight against unfair rules until you get the freedom. One more important thing I learned from the book is grasp every opportunity to study. Jane read a lot of book during she lived under her aunt abuse, she learned so much in the orphanage. The difference between Jane and others is she never gives up study or the process to enrich her inner world no matter how terrible the outside environment is. She successfully transfers her miserable live to her tenacious soul. All of these made her a thoughtful woman, and that also the reason for Mr. Rochester is attracted by Jane.The second time I read Jane Eyre was during my high school. At that period I was very depressed due to a heavy course load and a sharp competition. In an unexpected chance, I decided read Jane Eyre again. From I opened the book; I could not drop it any more. I finished it in three days. During I read the book, I felt so peaceful and calm. That's exactly what I needed for that period and I had lost this feeling for a long time. Beside my spiritual enjoyment, the book also gives me a strong influence on my value system. Until now, I still strongly believe that true love should build on the respect of each other. That's what Jane Eyre told me. This time I have a deeper understanding on the relationship between Jane Eyre and Edward Fairfax Rochester. At the beginning, Edward is a rich, strong and talented upper class man. But the real of him is a lonely heart, until he met Jane. A lot of women approach him in order of him money, but Jane is totally different. She did not care about him money or his social statue, she care about him just because she loves Edward and she really wants to comfort him from his painful experiences. Edward also loves Jane and appreciates her. He respects Jane and views her as his true friend in soul, he likes to talk with Jane and share his feeling with her. Their love is deep and stable. The ending of the story is not perfect but it's the best ending for Jane. She needn't choose from her love or her majesty. She obtains both of them. In the end, Edward became an old and poor blind man, but Jane still married with him. The only thing changed is they love each other deeper. This ending emphasizes Jane's characteristics as well as the substance of the book, which is the wroth of live should be respect and love.The negative part of Jane Eyre is the writer strength too much on Jane's insistence and independence. But in real world, things may much more complexes and cannot be overcome just by insistence and independence. However, I still believe Jane's characteristics will always shining in all times. Another negative echo for Jane Eyre is the book is not profundity enough. It only tells a story about a woman's life and her love experience, it did not tell enough about the time-background or the class contradiction. But I think that's just the reason that Jane Eyre do not bring too much heaviness to reader but the enjoyable feeling.All in all, I love the novel Jane Eyre. I believe everyone should read it; because it likes a cup of ice water, simple and clean, purify every reader's sprite."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I love this book. I am a hopeless romantic and I read this book because it is a classic, but I thought it would be boring. I was so wrong. The love in this book is so good! I love how Mr. Rochester is so witty -he is so smart and i don't know, his wittiness just makes him really attractive. I love it how he is a bit out there and he is always asking for her hand, he shows simple ways that he wants Jane. I love how he was trying to make her jealous, I don't know why I just like it! I love how he treats her when they are together, like she is so precious to him. The way he explains his love, I just want to swoon and have someone say these things to me. He is a bit odd though, but it suited him. There were such funny moments between them also! Even though he is not described as handsome, It doesn't matter- the affection he feels for her is just beautiful, something which is hard to find. But he has a secret and things happen....I have read many romantic books and this is my all time favorite even though this isnt really classified as romance. This book doesn't have things that a romance book has like shagging scenes. That makes it all the better because the dialoge is so good that you don't need scenes like that. I love when the characters in a book really get to know eachother before they fall in love and in many romance books you won't find that. I take out this book almost every week to reread what I feel are the good parts; I look foward to doing that in free time that is how good it is. I don't know what your tastes are in books but this book is as good as it gets for me. There are times where it does get a bit slow, but I just love to read the bits with Jane and Mr. Rochester; they just make the book. I love the scene where she is leaving and he asks her about money; it is very funny."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"It is said that you accidentally trip on a stone and find it out to be a gem. Jane Eyre for me is something like tripping on a book full of gems. Never in my life, have I ever read for which my heart has so passionately cried, laughed and felt sad. Every page of this book is craftfully written to make you want read the next. Oh, from where does the author gets a vision to make someone cry over what are essentially black inked words. When Jane leaves Rochester to go to the Moors, my heart really sanked into an oblivion. And when she came back was overjoyed as though Jane Eyre is me. Right from the first page till the last, the author has painted a picture. One that induces you to travel with Jane from her childhood to adulthood. A piece of gem, one that you can cherish for ever. As a reviewer had written earlier, it is one that would force you to give up watching that stupid idiot box, it really does. At least it did that for me."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Someone below complained that only English teachers were giving this book 5-star ratings. And while I'm guilty of this, it's the other way around: I don't love this book because I'm an English teacher. I became an English teacher (in part) because I have always loved this book. I suspect there's been a school project somewhere requiring the class to write Amazon reviews of JE. If that's the case, hang in there, kids: it's a spooky, touching, dramatic story, well worth some of the less interesting bits (like the St. John subplot). Not all of you will like it, and yes, the language can be a bit difficult. (In case this shows up on the test, it's Victorian, not Old English--a difference of approximately 1000 years.) You don't have to love it or have it change your life. But it's a window into the literary tastes of the past (almost like 19th-C chick lit), which shaped and reflected pretty much all other ideology of the time. That's why it's important, and that's why a lot of people, even those who didn't have to read it (like me), continue to genuinely love it.My only problem is with the ending. It still bugs me that Jane can be so powerful and end up doing such a cop-out. I hate to think that Bronte was pandering to popular taste, but that's the only explanation I can think of."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I adored this book. I cried over and over again. Jane Eyre is beautifully wtitten. I give a standing ovation to Ms. Bronte."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Odd, how re-reading a classic can become a meaningful experience. I'm sure I read Jane Eyre at least two times when I was in high school and again at college. Then there were the films, the most memorable being the one with William Hurt playing Rochester. Yet, last weekend when I was visiting friends and had nothing at hand, I looked at the first chapter and thought &quot;I've don't remember any of this,&quot; and was hooked.No wonder this book endures and no wonder that readers are entranced: it is an extraordinary story of an individual's struggle to live in a harsh world, find and create physical comfort and sustain an unacceptable love. Even though the story is intensely atmospheric (food, structures, furniture, temperature, clothes and flora are in constant reference), it is Jane herself who drives the story. Where she will find herself and what she will do next is the surprise. No wonder feminists were interested in this book: Jane never succumbs to anyone's idea of what she should do, she wrestles with decisions and bases her choices (that she insists on having choises is already delightful) on her own moral, social code. Hard choices she makes too and we wonder if she'll manage when, for example, she leaves Thornfield and finds herself forced to beg for food.The writing is sharp and intelligent and...funny too: take, for example, the little girls toppling off their stools during prayers, or the description of Adele's &quot;French&quot; personality. The plot is a stretch but a loveable one. Jane, we are told often, has neither beauty nor stature, the type of person that gets ignored in any social situation. However, this seemingly ineffectual person has two highbrow offers of marriage,inherits a fortune and reaps the bounty of a geniune, loving relationship with the one man who is her intellectual and emotional equal. Not bad for a poor, plain governess in the 1830s.Today, it might be that religion, scripture and even the idea of morality are concepts that carry too much weight for popular fiction. Jane, a level-headed girl, is neither silly nor preachy. That her thoughts are informed with the religious moral tone of the period makes this story more than a romance or tale of finding true love. It demonstrates how conviction is founded."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I throroughly enjoyed reading Jane Eyre. Although it was quite lengthy, it was filled with suspense and excitement. I feel that Jane Eyre was a strong, independent and proud character which makes her a great role model for women and children. From when she is only ten years old she already possesses courage, honesty and generosity despite her unpleasant life. Going to Lowood School only adds to her miserable childhood, but somehow she has the strength to overcome it and move on. Even though she is a poor, unattractive woman in the Victorian era she believes in economic and social equality. When she meets Rochester he is amazed at her intelligence, wit and frankness and though he is a man, she is his intellectual equal. When she realizes she must leaves Edward, she is able to resist the temptation of being with him to uphold her strong morals. This is also a very commendable quality that Jane Eyre possesses. Through her determination, she is able to survive poverty and loneliness and find a home with the Rivers. Here she exhibits true generosity when she divides her fortune among her new found friends. Again, she resists the temptation of a good home and safety and leaves St. John to find her lost love. Jane shows compassion when she decides to stay with Rochester for he rest of her life, and nurse him in his unhealthy state. Reading about a woman like Jane Eyre is very empowering and it makes you want to be a better person. Cudos to Charlotte Bronte for a novel very (long and) well written."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Lost yet somewhat hopeful, Jane Eyre spent some of her child hood with an evil aunt after her parents had past. Troubled by the haunted shadows that lurk in her mind, young Jane decides that she needs change in her life. Slowly yet surely she does find some happiness which appears to be a struggle. The character, Jane, seems vulnerable throughout the telling of the story. At the age of eighteen, Jane finally presents herself in a newspaper as a governess. As a penniless orphan, Jane Eyre is appointed as a governess at Thornfield Hall by the mysterious Mr. Rochester. Her integrity and independence are tested to the limit as their love for each other grows, and the secrets of Mr. Rochester's past are revealed.This story tells of a young woman, Jane Eyre, who makes modesty and plainness appear to be the most noble and admirable qualities in a young woman. She learned over time to be independent and had developed a strong mind. It's almost a romance novel underneath all the inner searching. She struggles through many obstacles and when faced with them, she does what is right for her and no one else. What I liked about it the most is that it was a real person's story to some extent. It glorified female independence and seemed almost like a fairy tale. Jane Eyre becomes someone because she puts in her best effort, not because of a wish, or a dream, or someone else's pity. She made herself beautiful in the way she saw fit.This incredible book brings detail of what's written and both love and sadness that people can relate to. An example of this would be Jane as she was experiencing friendship for the first time when she started school and then had lost someone she's close to. If you're a person who loves romance novels then I recommend this book to you. She is a great role model for women today. And this should be read if over the age of fourteen and up."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I am only 12 years old but at least read a book a week.

I love Jane Eyre's way of thinking and how she trys to make her life as full as possible. I would recomend this to everyone!

Being a rebel among its contemporaries, Charlotte Bront&eacute; presents the detailed psychological aspects of human nature in the most deliberate manners.The novel itself has a very attractive story line with the orthodox format of &quot;good fictions&quot;-- gloomy mansion with dark mysteries lurking out, and a plain governess as the conqueror of all evil through the redemption of the soul of one man who's escaping from the past and from the truth. In this madly materialized society, Jane Eyre has withstood the test of time to continue embark echo in the heart and mind of the thoughtful."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"After her uncle dies, Jane Eyre is grudgingly raised by her aunt (bound unwillingly by a promise made to her husband), in a home where she's constantly reminded of her inferior birth, orphaned state and dependence on her relatives. To top it off, she is of unremarkable appearance and is as poor as a church mouse. Yet there is something in Charlotte Bronte's protagonist that sets her apart from the rest of the world, a sense of self-worth and self-discipline that gives her strength and resilience against the many hardships that she'll face in her lifetime.Charlotte Bronte's story begins with Jane as a young girl, living unloved and neglected amongst the untouchable splendour of Gateshead and the Reed family. Jane's only escape is in her love of books and learning, for her spiteful aunt and cousins have no control over the power of her mind - though reading must be done on the sly as John Reed will stoop so far as to deprive her of books he has no interest in himself. When such an event occurs, Jane summons up the spirit to defend herself against her cousin and is duly punished for it. Estranged from human company, her aunt orders her locked in the red room, the chamber in which her uncle dies and which holds imaginary horrors for Jane. This terrifying experience is the catalyst of her childhood which will be remembered in all frightening and unnatural occurrences henceforth in her life.Relief from her extended family comes only when she is called away to school, and despite the poor living conditions and the zealous religious restrictions of Lowood School's patron Mr Brocklehurst, Jane finds a new outlook on life through her somewhat sentimental friendship with the pious Helen Burns. Amazed at Helen's patience and resilience with teachers that constantly heckle and beat her, Jane discovers Helen's devotion to God which puts to shame her own practice of fighting back at those who wrong her. An important stage in her inner growth, Jane takes upon herself Helen's teachings, survives illness at the school and enters the world as a governess.It is here that the story begins proper (not that the proceedings are unimportant), as Jane takes up a governess position for the young ward of Mr Rochester at Thornfield, stretching her wings for the first time. Here she befriends the elderly housekeeper Fairfax and her young charge Adele, and finally comes to meet her master, the intimidating and elusive Mr Rochester. Sharing a prickly and awkward acquaintance at first, Rochester soon recognises the intelligence and wittiness hiding behind Jane's modesty and plainness. Respect turns to friendship, and from there comes the first inklings of love...But something is amiss in Thornfield in the novel's most overtly Gothic thread. Jane becomes increasingly aware of sinister goings-on in the house: mad laughter rings throughout the halls at night. Mr Rochester's bedchamber is set alight and only Jane's quick action saves him from death. A stranger arrives at the house whose presence upsets Rochester and who is found badly wounded that very night. Jane suspects the quirky housemaid Grace Poole, but ultimately this mystery has a far more devastating answer, which once more upturns Jane's life and ambitions.Charlotte Bronte's heroine is one of literature's most unique and introspective characters; an ever evolving and maturing individual, who constantly searches her soul and conscious for meaning and identity. Jane's self control is remarkable, as his her ability to rationalise problems and follow through with the decisions that she makes. By today's standards, where self-indulgence and reward-systems are the norm, Jane's state of mind is like a bucket of cold water over the head. When the moment of Jane's great choice comes, she reacts exactly as should be expected, not as some overly-virtuous, too-good-to-be-true Victorian girl. Unlike other heroines, who might be repulsed or frightened at Rochester's offer, Jane is very sorely tempted. It is from herself and the knowledge of her own weakness that she flees, not from Rochester and his pleas. In this moment the strength of her conviction and will-power is sure to impress.It is important to know that this is not just a romance novel, though it is certainly the driving force of the latter half of the novel. What is most fascinating about the relationship between Jane and Rochester is the complex power struggle that goes on between them, something that often does away with romantic disillusions and deals with the practical and often uncomfortable components of attachment. Mr Rochester is Jane's employer, her social superior and a man considerably older than our teenage protagonist, yet Jane is constantly attempting to exert a sense of control over him and her feelings for him, knowing the cost that would come in succumbing to the man she describes as nearly taking the place of Almighty God in her estimation. The games they play with each other, the testing and the intrigues formed between them are riveting stuff and explore the darker power-struggles of male and female relationships that are almost always lost in typical romance novels. Bronte creates an astonishing amount of equality between the two lovers, for as the novel progresses Rochester becomes more and more reliant on Jane.Jane Eyre is in many ways a feminist novel, addressing to its contemporary audience the drudgery and monotony of female existence that \\"confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags\\". Jane's \`adventures' through school and into the world of employment, her experiences of passionate love and destitution in the wilderness, reflect Charlotte Bronte's own struggles in a man's world. Most (if not all) of the men that Jane meets in her travels attempt to control her in one way or another, and Jane is constantly fighting to walk her own path. As she says at the crucial point in her life: \\"I care for myself. The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself.\\" The loneliness apparent in this passage, and the aloneness in which she spends most of her time is what makes the character of Jane so memorable - here is girl that has no one to look out for her but herself, and yet she keeps her kindness, faith and honour without falling into self-pity or bitterness.\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those classic books that everyone's heard of - but it's up to you to take the next step and read it for yourself."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"The epic story of Jane Eyre, Charlotte Bronte's 'poor and plain' 19th century heroine, is a rare and wonderful combination of intelligent prose and keen emotion. It's a sweeping masterpiece of a love story, and a book which, even now, remains as accessible and valid as it did upon its first release.Jane, the heroine, is an orphan, being raised by her cruel Aunt Reed. Tired of her troublesome charge, Mrs. Reed sends Jane to board at Lowood Charity School, where she discovers a new way of life, sometimes as cruel as her time at Gateshead, sometimes full of friendship and laughter. Presently, she accepts the job of Governess to the precocious daughter of Mr. Rochester in Thornfield Hall, and falls in love. She discovers inner strength and self-worth through the redemptive power of that love.Unlike the novels of Jane Austen, Bronte's heroine is from an underprivileged class, and the mood of this story is generally sombre. However, compared to 'Shirley', or Emily Bronte's masterpiece 'Wuthering Heights', 'Jane Eyre' takes what is essentially a sorrowful tale and imbues it with vivid, if brief, descriptions of happiness and love. A sense of belonging pervades the latter half of the story, thrown into high relief by several traumatic events, and culminating in Jane achieving her heart's true desire - a family of her own.It's a more straightforward and rewarding book than most 19th century epics, and for that, it's a better way of introducing oneself to 19th century literature. Bronte's acute awareness of the complexities of human emotion is palpable, and her heroine Jane displays a sense of isolation and self-reliance not found in many other novels, contemporary or otherwise. This is the hook, this is what draws the reader to the character of Jane, she is hard and self-sufficient, without resorting to bitterness or introversion. This subtle contrast forces us to empathise with Jane's plight, and we are all the more satisfied by the story's end.Basically a love story played out against the backdrop of harsh, austere 19th century rural England, 'Jane Eyre' is a book you will return to, again and again. It's romantic, gothic, sparse and, conversely, lush, and truly deserving of its status as Classic. Buy it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"The title character of this novel is unusual, indeed, extremely rare - Marian Halcombe in The Woman in White is the only other such romantic literary heroine I can think of - in that she is not physically attractive. She has neither looks nor fortune. Most romantic heroines have the former but not the latter. It is Jane's character alone that the hero falls in love with. It is clear from the writing that Charlotte herself was unattractive and painfully aware of it. Strangely, the reading public have been unable to accept this, the very element of the book that makes it a perfect romance. The portrait of Charlotte that is most often reproduced is an idealized effort that makes her look beautiful. And whenever a screen adaptation is made of the book, the actress playing Jane is always beautiful. This reduces the theme to that of a rich man falling for a pretty servant girl. As always with classic literature, if you have only seen the movie, you emphatically do not know the book.My first Bronte novel was Emily's Wuthering Heights, which I found very disappointing, with its heavy-breathing masochistic melodrama. But sister Charlotte is a writer of a very different caliber. From the first few pages, the reader knows they are in the hands of a great artist. The heartrending portrait of childhood with which the story opens is based on the author's own experiences, and it shows.The book is not without flaws. The latter stages of the plot are carried along by a series of totally incredible coincidences and there is rather more Victorian melodrama than most modern readers would care for. But it remains, with its Plain-Jane heroine and its unlikely hero (in the end, he satisfies none of the conventional requirements of a romantic hero) the perfect romance. Never was the power of love more satisfyingly expressed."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I'm sorry and rather shocked that our kids apparently find this marvelous novel a drag. I'm 53, and I've read it about once a year since I was 12. . .never once as a school assignment, much less a punishment. I've read for pleasure all my life. . .voluminously, addictively. . . and Jane Eyre is my alltime, number-one favorite novel. Dull?!? Good grief, silly girls, it's the first fullblooded feminist novel in English, and still the very best! It has a bright, strong, creative, misunderstood and abused kid heroine who nearly dies of her maltreatment, but survives, thrives, ignores her era's view of women as brainless porcelain dolls, experiences passionate love on her own terms rather than his, refuses to give up her enormous integrity for a false heaven, lives homeless and nearly dies of it rather than become anyone's plaything, fends off patriarchal religion with rare spirit and honesty, and finally. . .well, I'll let you read the absolutely splendid ending for yourselves, if you haven't been rendered incapable of understanding it by today'salleged educational system. Suffice it to say that it was sufficiently radical in its day to get the author a lot of hate mail. . .to which she replied with a spirit that would've made Jane proud."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's \\"Jane Eyre\\" has been one of my favorite novels since I first read it in high school. It is one of those special books which can be read and savored over and over, and seems to improve with each reading. The tale is narrated by Miss Eyre, herself, inviting a special and intimate relationship with the reader. It is through Jane that we meet and grow to care about, or hate, so many of the memorable characters one becomes acquainted with on these pages. And it is through her narrative, first as a little girl, then as a young woman, that Jane's complex persona is revealed. From an early age her morality, wit, determination, sheer grit and romanticism are evident.Published in 1847, the novel, at first glance, appears to be another well written gothic romance, of the kind so popular in the Victorian Age, with its mystery, horror, brooding hero, touch of the melodramatic, and dark castle-like setting. The rise of poor orphaned Jane, who against all odds, redeems her tormented hero through her steadfast love, is really not unique at all. Charlotte Bronte did not, however, write a mere romance, no matter how riveting the read. Throughout, the author makes some serious statements about women's equality, the treatment of children, and of women forced into a dependent state during the Victorian epoch, religious hypocrisy, romantic relationships between men and women, the nature of true love, and the development of self. This is a beautifully written work of fiction which combines a riveting storyline, compelling characters, vivid descriptions along with a powerful testimony about the period in which the book was written.Young Jane, orphaned at an early age, is grudgingly taken-in by her Aunt, Mrs. Reed, who seems to despise the child. The Reed children are spoiled rotten, and the eldest son is somewhat of a sadist who abuses his young cousin terribly. Aunt Reed always finds a reason to blame Jane for the household's ills. When the boy takes his torture too far and Jane attempts to defend herself, her aunt has her locked in the room where her uncle died, terrifying the poor girl into hysteria. Unwilling to care for the girl any longer, Mrs. Reed packs her off to the harsh Lowood School, a miserable charitable institution which is more like a prison than a place of education. Lowood's despicable headmaster, Rev. Brockelhurst, does everything in his power to break Jane's spirit. At one point, when he asks Jane how to avoid going to hell, she defiantly responds, \\"I must stay well and not die.\\"A particularly compassionate teacher recognizes Jane's intelligence and sensitivity and befriends the girl. When Jane graduates she stays to teach at Lowood until her mentor leaves to marry. Jane then decides it is time for a change, and applies for a position as a governess. She is offered a job at the distant Thornfield Manor. Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield's housekeeper, welcomes her warmly and introduces her to the staff and to little girl who will be her pupil, the precocious Adele. She is not, however, introduced to all the household's inhabitants - especially not to one who inhabits the uppermost floor. Thornfield's owner, Mr. Rochester, (one of my favorite literary heroes), is away when our protagonist arrives, yet it is he who will have a most profound effect on her life - and she on his.If you have not read \\"Jane Eyre\\" yet, why wait any longer? If you have not reread it for a few years, now's the time! My highest recommendations!The Barnes and Noble Classic Edition provides an excellent Introduction and Notes by Susan Ostrov Weisser, a Professor of English at Adelphi University where she specializes in nineteenth-century literature and women's studies. Her research centers on women and romantic love in nineteenth-century literature, as well as on contemporary popular culture. This is a hardcover book. Highly recommended!JANA"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Reading any Bronte work requires the rare ability to speak in both a refined and musical woman's English accent, and immediately switch to the voice of a commanding and brooding male who likes to throw things.Susan Erickson is up to the challenge. Her fitting voice and intonation naturally rise and fall between Jane's contrasting Victorian reserve and fiery passion. Whereas some reader's tones obviously change between cuts, Erickson's are seemless. Her speed and diction make the story very clear.This unabridged performance seems to sell for cheaper than the others, but that is not because the performance is lacking.Technical issues: Each CDs track number goes up to around 97, 98, or 99.

It captured my imagination as a young teenager and it continues to capture my imagination as a grown woman with a child of my own. I read it probably about once a year and every time I read it, I find more to love. The story is timeless and the themes are relevant even in today's world which is certainly a mark of Bront's prodigious talent and insight.This is a feminist tome in so many ways. Right up front, we are told of Jane's plainness and in an age when being pretty was about the best a woman could hope to be, this is an especially significant detail. It quickly becomes clear that Jane will not make her way in the world thanks to her looks and it immediately frees the author to focus on what is truly important: Jane's heart, soul, and mind.Her grossly abusive childhood is repugnant in all senses of the word and especially so when one considers that there were likely many, many young girls who suffered in exactly the way Jane suffers. This is a great characterization of the concept of heartless charity and false piety. Aunt Reed and Mr. Brocklehurst are textbook examples of Christians who have no real connection or adherence to their beliefs, who are more or less going through the motions in order to make themselves look good in the eyes of others. I find the scene where the sumptuously attired Brocklehurst women visit Lowood to be one of the book's many stellar scenes. With great subtlety and skill, Bront drives home her point that those who excel at making themselves appear superior to others are often those leading the most hypocritical of lifestyles.I am also always struck by the realization of how bleak Jane's prospects are. Ultimately she is fortunate to find a position as a governess in a house with one obedient and affectionate child. Though Ad&egrave;le is nowhere near an intellectual equal to Jane, she is not the wild, spoiled child that many governesses likely had to suffer. What's more, Jane has an employer who may be absentee, taciturn, and mysterious but pays her well, solicits and respects her opinions, and sees her as his intellectual equal. Again, Bront vividly underscores Jane's lot with the scene in which Lady Ingrahm bemoans the \\"martyrdom\\" she has suffered because of her many governesses, at which point her spoiled and gold-digging daughter professes how much she and her siblings enjoyed tormenting the women forced to attempt to educate them.As for the romance, it is one of the very best. There is no scene that can even hold a candle to Mr. Rochester's description of the string that binds him to Jane. The passion between Mr. Rochester and Jane is so vivid that it practically leaps off the page and it is sexy in a way that no tawdry novel could ever hope to replicate.Ultimately, though, it is Jane who makes the story what it is. Though it may break her will or her heart or both, Jane refuses to be anything less than true to herself, a truly revolutionary concept given the era in which the novel was written. Jane is strong-willed, loving, and intelligent and she never seeks more than to be exactly who and what she is. Though she is a kind person, she seeks no one's approval and when she must ultimately make a choice between her own soul and her heart's desire, she refuses to compromise herself in any way. There are few messages stronger than this for women of any age.This is a truly ageless masterpiece that demands repeated readings and that deserves a place of honor on the shelf of anyone who loves literature. I can hardly wait to share it with my daughter when the time comes. In this age of Bratz dolls and Britney Spears, girls need a role model like Jane more than ever."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"More than a simple love story, a gothic romance, a Victorian novel, or even a female picaresque work, Jane Eyre is, quite simply, a wonderful book. Written, as it was, in Victorian England by a female author, Jane Eyre has occasionally been pigeonholed as a garden variety gothic romance. It is much more than this, however: not only is it a genuine classic, it epitomizes its genre. There are several factors that set it above the pack. For one, it is extremely well-written: Bronte's characterization is masterful and the plot is well-developed. One comes to identify with the character of Jane, who narrates, and the other characters in the book, most of whom are well-drawn, rounded characters. The book also features other elements which are unusual for a book of its kind and which were genuinely new at the time. For starters, take its protagonist, the title character: she is not beautiful, like Edith Wharton's Lily Bart; she is not rich, like most of Jane Austen's female characters; she is not ambivalent and wish-washy like Kate Chopin's Edna Pontellier; she is not an intellectual. Jane is a well-drawn, rounded, truly believable character -- and a genuinely likable one. The reader comes to empathize and identify with her. Strong-willed, independent, and indefatigable, Jane is not a hard-to-like character like the aforementioned Edna Pontellier from The Awakening; the book could almost be called a female picaresque novel, were she not so practical and solid a character. Also setting the book above its ilk are several dark story details that set the book above the of the typical love story. Bronte also uses the book as a medium to criticize certain aspects of Victorian culture: the inhumane and non-emphatic treatment of the poor by the rich, the denial of the pursuit of happiness, the plight of orphans and other who had no well-defined place in society, the often cruel sternness of church and other authority figures, among much else. Bronte also pauses from time to time to take on spiritual and quasi-philosophical elements, which give the book an added depth and sophistication. With all of this, Bronte succeeds in bringing the book out of the sphere of mere feminist literature: its universal theme and eclectic contents set it above the works of Austen and Chopin, among others. Though many aspects of the novel show it to be a clear product of the Victorian era, the book, with its just-mentioned strengths, is a universal work that will endure for centuries yet to come. In this way, it is much more applicable to our present day than works such as, say, The House of Mirth, which deal primarily with ephemeral concerns. On top of all this, it is a wonderful and delightful read. What we have here is a true classic.This is essential reading for any fan of romances, gothic literature, or Victorian literature in general; readers looking for a truly great and easily-accessible classic need also look no farther."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte, is an enticing Victorian love story of a young woman as she grows and matures. The plot made me want to read so I could find out what happens. The characters have realistic feelings and thoughts, which made me sympathize and feel with them. Even though I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I often found myself re-reading a paragraph so I could fully understand what I had just read. These long paragraphs, however, did not stop me from reading forward and liking the book.I would recommend this novel to late high school and college students.

My only guess is that they have not read them.I will skip giving a plot overview here. But I will mention that one complaint I have heard frequently is that there is little action in this story. Well, just because our attention spans have decreased drastically because of TV doesn't mean that good books should move just as fast. The beauty of the macabre and ethereal Jane Eyre is not in the plot, though that is also wonderful, but in the descriptions of Jane's own feelings and turmoil and love. She is easy to relate to for women of all ages - who hasn't understood the feeling of wondering where to go with one's life?I have also heard complaints that there are problems with the edition, especially spelling mistakes (i.e. Rochester calling Jane Janet). This is a pet name. It appears in every edition true to the original text - often, it is taken out to avoid confusing people. Overall, Penguin is a wonderful classics publisher, especially the annotations and footnotes. They explain a lot of the dated references or confusing dialect.Though I personally would have preferred a bit darker a novel (i.e. Wuthering Heights), I believe this to be one of the timeless classics of English literature and a must-read for everyone, lit major or not."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"The story of an innocent young woman who falls in love with a mysterious older man with a dark past is tried and true. In the hands of Ms. Bronte, it acquires a depth of feeling and sincerity of emotion that raise the story type above the maudlin. There may have been other gothic romances similar to \\"Jane Eyre\\" before this was written, and there have certainly been many after it, but none have been quite so wonderful.Lord Byron may have supposedly invented the Byronic hero when he wrote about \\"Manfred\\", Mr. Tortured By A Troubled Past... but Bronte's Mr. Rochester is a perfection of the type. He's sensitive, yet abrupt. Demanding, yet tender. Proud, yet remorseful. Every time I read this book, I fall in love with him all over again.Jane Eyre herself is an even more complex character than Mr. Rochester. She's tough and stern, yet playful. She has a firm moral center and does not hesitate to do what she believes is right, even when it hurts herself or those around her. And by being true to herself and what she knows is right, she ultimately triumphs over a variety of people who might do her great injury (intentionally or not). Again, literature has seen many sturdy, spunky heroines come and go, but Jane Eyre is a perfection of the type."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Last night I finished reading Jane Eyre and I just cannot ever remember being so moved by such a book. Throughout the whole novel, I screamed in shock, in agony, and in suspense. To the very ends of its pages, I would turn each leftlet in fevor, waiting wishing and trying to imagine what would happen. I would not have had the strength to run from the man I loved; I would not have the dignity to turn down St John; I would tremble in the presense of such a strong willed and determined woman as Jane. She set her faith on the One Above and let him guide he no matter what. Her challeges and triumphs are proof of that in itself. I really wonder what Charolette Bronte could have possibly been going through when she sat down to write this book. Every word is delicious and savoring yet some are quite agonizing, so much in fact that I once threw the book down and didn't want to read on, for fear of what Mis Bronte woudl throw on me next. This book will probably be my favorite book of all time. I just dont think I can desribe in words how much it has effected me. I really want to discuss this with someone, but it seems everywhere i talk about it it falls on deaf ears. One day I hope everyone in the world has the pleasure of reading this masterpiece. for that is what it is, a pure work of genius!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I enjoyed this book tremendously. I picked it up off our bookshelf after having run out of things to read, and was not expecting much. I think it was left over from one of my children's school assignments. Anyway, it just grabbed me, and never let go. The plot twists are wonderful (although maybe there is one that is a little hard to believe, but that's why they call it fiction!). Jane's character is one that anyone could identify with, not pretty, not special in any way, and low in the self-esteem area. But through the course of the book, she blossoms, and reveals herself to be a woman of great strength, intelligence and integrity. Her relationship with Mr. Rochester is complex and satisfying. It is the kind of book that will cause you to ponder it for some time to come."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Charlotte Bronte is one of my favorite authors of all time. She is praised not only for her beautiful and eloquent writing but also for her captivating stories that fascinates readers of all generations. In this riveting novel that many considered the most prominent literary work of Charlotte Bronte, the life of a 19th century young English woman, Jane Eyre, is portrayed vividly. It is a life of shocking reality, a combination of misery and at the same intrigue and triumphs. Starting from her youthful years, she is met with great obstacles. As a small girl, Jane lived under the scrutiny of her cold hearted aunt, who not only showed bias but also cruelty. Sent to Logwood School at a young age, Jane is cast aside from the other students. Constantly tortured by her teachers and declared as a definite sign of evil and wickedness, she has grown up through a bitter childhood into a woman of great determination and tremendous courage. Striving in a world meant for the wealthy and fortunate, Jane is granted a job as a governess in the mansion of a rich yet mysteriously shrouded man, Mr. Rochester, who only visits the place years at a time. Handsome and prosperous, Mr. Rochester has had his own life of torment, one complicated by deception and remorse, and a shadowed past of beguilement concealed by intricate lies that haunted him for years. Yet, either by coincidence or fate, he unexpectedly went back to his mansion right after Jane's arrival. Inspired and warmed by Jane's calmness and wisdom, the pair soon becomes entangled in a complicated labyrinth of romance mingled with obscurity and dark secrets. With the greatest chance of happiness inches away, Jane discovers a terrifying truth, one that can ultimately destroy ...or save her.Through the main character, Jane Eyre, Charlotte Bronte graphically woven this book into a world where we, as readers, can all connect to. I highly recommend it to everyone! It is a classic that cannot be put down!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"The story of Jane Eyre is a classic tale of a search for human compassion. From the tragedies of her orphaned beginnings and a childhood with a hateful aunt who, out of spite, sends Jane to a prison-like life at Lowood Boarding School, Jane's strength of character shines through. Through each ordeal the reader develops a true concern for this \\"plain Jane\\". When she finally begins to find a more content life at Thornfield and as her relationship with Rochester develops into love the reader feels happiness for her, but follows her through the depths of despair at the shocking revelation that prevents her from marrying him. The reader cheers for her as she rebuilds her life as a strong, independent woman who is able to choose her destiny.Jane Eyre is a beautifully written book, although at times Charlotte Bronte's descriptions were very wordy and therefore the reading process was difficult. Understandably, this descriptive style of writing was typical of an era in which the average person did not have the opportunities we now have to envision different people and places."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Charlotte Bronte takes a plain Jane, and makes her one of the most memorable characters from the likes of Bronte sisters. This novel starts at a boarding school, as we learn of Jane's painful childhood, grows into an exciting love story as governness Jane falls for Mr Rochester, (whose daughter she tutors), and after a lot of twists, drama, separation and engrossing trains of events Jane finds home, love and happiness.I have had read the abridged version at age of 11, and loved it then. Over the years, I have repeatedly reread the novel. Like all classics, everytime I read it, it offers an array of previously unfelt emotions and of course remains as enchanting as ever. To say very least, it is like your favorite soap opera that you watched while growing up, has characters and events you nearly can never forget, and due to its ageless charm, you revisit those times and emotions through all the reruns and remakes. Maybe the weight of my years of association makes this novel unforgettable for me, but trust me, read it and you will definitely feel the romance, the pain, the emotion, the passion: and maybe like me, return to read it again!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte, is a touching love story from the 19th century. Within the first few pages you will be swept up into a poor orphaned girl's troublesome life. Jane Eyre's sorrows, triumphs, and love are woven together in an almost magical way that keeps you reading until the end. There is mystery, suspense, and drama in this book, and also humor and happiness.Jane is an orphan who was raised by her cruel Aunt Reed. She was sent off to a charity bording school called Lowood. There our 'poor and plain' heroine spends eight years. With sad and happy memories from Lowood, Jane departs to become a governess at Thornfield Hall. Little does she know of the mystery in the attic or the love that awaits her.I reccomend this book to anyone who enjoys reading a good classic. It's really a magical tale that is worth reading over and over again.The reading is moderately hard, it is probably about high school reading level. I loved it, andunderstood it, even though I am in 8th grade.I think that when I finished this book I was slightly changed from what I was when I started this book. I can really relate to Jane Eyre, and that is why I think that girls tend to like this novel more than boys. Also because it is a romance,but who knows, it really depends on what kind of person you are.Jane Eyre is a passionate novel that sketches the way women felt in the 19th century, and what they went through. Jane Eyre's passion pours out of her so strongly, especially in this sentence:\\"...my soul began to expand, to exault, with the strangest sense of freedom, of triumph, I ever felt. It seemed as if an invisible bond had burst, and that I had struggled out into an unhoped-for-liberty\\""},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I thought I was seeing things, so I enlarged the picture of the cover: does it *really* say Jane Eyre, by Emily Bronte? I know that it's the thrift edition, but was it necessary to be so thrifty that they credited the wrong sister? Maybe I wouldn't have been so \\"up in arms\\" if this weren't my favourite novel of all time... I still remember reading it for the first time... wondering about the mystery and fear surrounding Grace Poole (don't worry: I've given nothing away). Ms *Charlotte* Bronte has written a romantic, mysterious, heartbreaking page-tuner of a novel, and everytime I get to the last page, I'm bereft. Read it, at any cost...I see that the people who've dissed the novel have largely been *forced* to read it at school etc. Shame that they feel this way, because it's one of the most powerful novels with a woman protagonist that has ever been written.Yes, Charlotte has written what feels to our 21st-century eyes like a romantic piece of pap, but consider this in the context of the time: it was written by a woman (albeit under a male pseudonym initially), about a woman character who was in control of her own life, and able to make her own life decisions, rather than being under the male yoke. This was groundbreaking stuff, and actually manages to subvert the apparent genre. Read from this perspective, this novel is revolutionary, and far from pap.(By the way, if you want to read a *real* Emily Bronte novel, then it's probably Wuthering Heights you'd be after)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I don't especially know why I picked &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; off my shelves recently.

I thank the Lord that I did because it's been the best read I've had since &quot;Girl With a Pearl Earring&quot;. The plot: compelling and captivating. The narrative: descriptive, philosophical, flawless. The charaters: both believable and lovable. I was so engrossed I found myself getting angry when plans went awry and on the verge of tears when they went right. I recommend that you DO NOT read this while you are young, as a previous reviwer suggested... I did so the first time around and in no way shape or form was able to appreciate its subtleties and sheer elegance to a thousandth of the degree I do now. It IS romance; but even if that's &quot;not your bag&quot;, you'll enjoy the pure power of Ms. Bronte's work. READ THIS BOOK: you won't regret it.

This orphan girl never got loved from her aunt \\"Mrs. Reed\\" or her cousins \\"Eliza, Georgina\\", and her bullying cousin \\"John.\\" She was like any other child, trying to survive in this world.

Mrs. Reed decided to send Jane to Lowood for free, to an orphan school where she was treated harshly and overworked. Growing up in this school made her stronger. Six years later she became a teacher in the same school where she was treated crudely and her best friend died. Then she decided to move out to a new city, Thornfield.

The narrator is a plain girl, who has morals and lives by them(however much it makes you scream). The fancied is Edward Rochester, a genius in his own right, with brilliant plans.

I read it again the summer after seventh grade (last summer) and I still love it just as much. It's one of those books that you can just read over and over and over....and you never get tired of it. Charlotte Bronte tells Jane's heartbreaking storing of being mistreated as a child and growing up into a shy, reserved young adult so well. I can see everything in the book happening as I read it. I especially love the ending - I'm so glad it's a happy one. This book is SO a two thumbs up in my opinion!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"One of the things that I liked most about \\"Wuthering Heights\\", by Charlotte Bronte's sister Emily, was the \\"scenery\\", the way in which the author conveyed a weather, an opressive environment, a climate of tension and impending doom. In Jane Eyre this too happens, but in a different way. For one thing, the characters move around more and it is not always foggy and rainy. You can actually see the novel like a film, and feel the damp air and the ominous silence.\\"Jane Eyre\\" tells the story of a woman, since her childhood. The orphaned daughter of a poor Anglican priest, she goes to live with his uncle and aunt, but the man soon dies and she is left to live under the iron fist of the aunt, a horrible woman with horrible kids who torment Jane constantly. Of course, we get only her version, since the book is narrated in the first person. After an incident when Jane is left to terrorize in the \\"red room\\", where her uncle died and where she fears his ghost will appear, she gets out of control and sent to an orphanatory. A brief digresson is worth here: ever since she is a child, Jane shows enormous self-assurance and pride. Her strong character refuses to be mistreated, and she reacts even violently to injustice. Her personality will grow through the novel, giving her the endurance to sustain repeated blows of fate. So she goes to the orphanatory, where after a period of incredible suffering and mistreatment, she finds a home and a friend in one of the school teachers (a young woman). She becomes a teacher herself, and when she's 18 she feels the time to fly away has come, so she advertises in a newspaper as a tutor for children. She receives a positive answer and moves to a manor house far in the countryside, the typical Bronte scene in the moors. The job consists in teaching a young French girl, with whom she develops a strong, if not too intimate, bond. But, and it's a big but, there is a mystery. The girl is not (at least not legally) the manor's lord's daughter. He's not even there when Jane is hired. He's supposed to be a stern, unpredictable man near his forties called Mr. Rochester. Finally the man appears, and he and Jane slowly develop a strange relationship. He's initially cold and sarcastic, but somehow he becomes impressed by the girl's strong character, ability for irony, and her unwillingness to be defeated. As time goes by, the other mystery of the house starts to intrigue Jane: in the third floor there's a locked room, from where sometimes come, muffled, a hysterical laughter and incoherent and incomprehensible words. Jane is led to believe it's one of the servants, an efficient but \\"strange\\" person. Subsequent episodes not worth revealing in a review slowly happen, and believe me they are terrifying, Gothic and violent. Little by little Jane falls in love with Mr. Rochester, but it takes time for it to dawn upon her, and at some point, when she realizes, she realizes too taht she has no chance. He's rich, she's a poor thing without a name, heritage or fortune. She thinks he's going to marry a beautiful and arrogant woman from the neighborhood. One day, the horrible aunt gets terminally sick, and Jane is sent for. She shows remarkable ability for forgiveness and stands by her aunt's side until the witch finally dies. When she comes back to Mr. Rochester's house, she will find her Fate, which I won't spoil for you.This rare novel is a jewel. First, because of the perfect construction of the character, indeed a person. Even though unbelievable coincidences happen sometimes in the novel, Jane is created so well that she is totally fleshed out before us. She is rather plain and short, a tiny, seemingly insignificant woman. But in truth she happens to be charming, funny, a little shy but courageous to the point of recklesness. She has a penetrating and acid sense of humor. Jane's life is an example of braveness, of the truly free individual creating his or her own destiny. Sometimes you just want to take her in your arms and comfort her, only to receive a bitter comment. At the time the novel was published, it raised eyebrows for the uncondescending presentation of an independent woman, always figthing for her rights and conscious of her being a free spirit, slave to no one. Jane is easily on of the best created character is all literature. For people like us, usually living in big noisy cities, experiencing life in the moors is a refreshing, even if sometimes terrifying, thing.Finally, \\"Jane Eyre\\", like \\"Wuthering Heights\\", is totally original literature. It comes from the fantasies and dreams of a woman who, like her sisters, lived practically isolated from the outer world, from the inelligentsia and from any literary or political circles. The Brontes were girls from the wild, and lived tragic and Gothic lives which get greatly reflectd in their books. Excellent."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"And each time I still find something new to love. On about the fifth or sixth reading, you finally start reading all those long descriptions word for word rather than breezing through for plot. They're wonderful and frequently humerous. Bronte has a tremendous sense of humor.My favorite things about the work are its humor and how it attacks fundamentalist Protestant Christianity while embracing Christianity. Unfortunately it has little tolerance for Catholicism. But that is only a minor theme and I think Charlotte Bronte herself was much more liberal minded when she was dealing with particular individuals rather than stereotypes. At the very least it is a lesson in the prejudices of her day.Jane Eyre is ultimately a fairy tale. Everything is made right in the end. But it has far more edge than a mere romance. How many romances have ten year olds telling off the fundamentalist ministers who threaten them with hell? How many of them have the eight year old outlive her anger and grow into a generous and forgiving spirit. How many mere romances rely so heavily on playful intellectual banter? Jane Eyre is Cinderella and she is rescued not by beauty and a fairy godmother and pumpkin coach, but by wit and heart."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This book was a complete surprise to me.

When her uncle dies, it falls to her aunt to provide her care. Unfortunately, her aunt despises the young girl and eventually finds a way to send the young girl away. The young girl, Jane Eyre, enters a boarding school for girls of less significant means and it is there she can truly begin to take charge of her life and where her adventures, so to speak, begin.Jane Eyre did catch me up immediately and keep me involved through the first half of the book. It moved fairly quickly. However, I thought the story dragged a bit about halfway and throughout the second half. Personally, I found the book suffered from what most Romance era and Gothic writers had an affinity for: why use 5 words when 15 or 20 will do. The novel became wordy and overlong at times and I found myself putting it down for long periods of time. Quite frankly, I think the story is better told in the myriad of movies that have been released. I am quite at a loss as to exactly why this novel is such the classic it is.The character of Jane Eyre bothered me as well, but I think she was more truthfully written and my dislike reflects the wordy nature of the book. Jane is morally strong - and that is to be admired - but she is so emotionally cold - I never imagined her being \\"in love,\\" passionate or otherwise. Even though she states she is in love, there seems to be no passion or fire. What an oddly matched pair! Though, I get the same feelings when I read Jane Austen, so perhaps readers of Ms. Austen's novels will appreciate this one.This novel is not all terrible, despite what I've said. It is engaging, though I think parts can be skimmed. Those who absolutely adore Gothic romance will love it.

There's the issue of class boundaries, marriage, faith and religious zealotry, self-realization, the circumstance of women in Victorian times, and so on. But being a self-confessed simpering romantic, I have no choice but to focus on my favorite theme.I loved Jane most whenever she's in the company of Mr Rochester, or even when she's just thinking about him. Somehow, for me, she becomes quite fervent, feels more human and behaves more womanly. Plus, I loved the fact that the author fully expressed in words the love that Mr Rochester himself feels for our eccentric heroine--so passionate, in fact, that I think some readers may gag at the \\"syrupy-ness\\" of his avowals. Not for me though. In fact, I feel a sort of regret that such emotion from a male character is rarely encountered in romance novels nowadays.Though a bit rough for me to begin with, Jane Eyre, as both the novel and the woman, became engaging as the story progressed. Dark, emotional, often dialectic, at times drily humorous, this story is sure to be remembered for a long while."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"if i had to say anything about jane it would be that she seems to revel in pain. the injustic of her childhood caused it i suppose or, perhaps, she was always that way. was rodchesters wife crazy before she was locked up? or did locking her up make her that way? well, jane seems to like to be in pain and rodchester seems to like to cause it, they make a happy pair. it was a dark book with a happy ever after, as happily ever after as a dark book can be.the book was interesting, clear and well written though something of a slow read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"With an unexciting introduction of Jane's abusive childhood, Jane Eyre later develops into a dramatic struggle in search of autonomy and love. The story constantly shifts between poignant moments in Jane's life and triumphant ones. Like a typical classic, the novel starts with an abusive childhood and ends with a happy marriage. As mundane as it may sound, the story is unique and the reader grows to respect Jane for the hard choices she makes.Jane struggles to choose between her passionate love story and desire for independence, asserting that satisfaction results from a balance between emotions and desire. Jane develops from a miserable and mistreated child, to a well-respected and independent woman after she learns to discern between passion and reason.Jane decides to flee Thronfield and escape from the luxurious style of life to find her identity. She sacrifices her true love for Rochester and prefers starvation in order to flee from passions and desires. Yielding to her emotions would cause Jane to be a prisoner in her own eyes.Jane's social status does not compare to Rochester's wealthy possessions. When Jane, however, becomes rich, from an unexpected heritage, she willingly returns to Rochester, after having balanced between morals and passions.When Jane finally leads a comfortable life, she refuses to yield to reason, choosing love instead. Jane refuses St. John's proposal because she finds it necessary for her to choose love and happiness over the ideal woman society expects of her. Jane once again leaves her previous comfortable life in search for her true love. Even with Rochester's physical and social deteriorating conditions, she is able to find true love because she balances between desires and expectations. Jane's sense of freedom is to not yield to the position she is in if her conscience and desires are not both satisfied.Adding to its thrills, the Gothic character of Bertha Mason portrays the dark romanticism movement of the era in the late 19th century. Setting the house on fire, and tearing Jane's bridal gown on her wedding night, she is the conflict that tears Jane and Rochester apart. She also causes Rochester's blindness and loss of his house. She is killed in the fire and Jane, much stronger now, is back to compensate Rochester for all what he has suffered."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is an unusual, mysterious and refreshing love story. Right from the start Jane's suffering sets the tone for the novel. Jane is mistreated by her aunt Mrs. Read and abused by her cousins. When Jane is sent to the charity school Lowood, her life is not much better, as the neglectful school is a brutal place to grow up. Sad, plain and orphaned, Jane is a new kind of heroine.Jane Eyre is not the beautiful, perfect and delicate character dominates fairy tales. After years of watching Disney's various versions of handsome Prince Charming fall in love with a beautiful girl whom misfortune has befallen, Jane is most certainly a welcome change. After surviving an epidemic of typhus, near starvation, intense cold and chilblains, she certainly makes Sleeping Beauty look pretty pathetic for fainting at the prick of a needle. Indeed, Jane's life begins as more of a tragedy than a fairytale. However, her story really begins when she leaves Lowood and becomes a governess at Mr. Rochester's Thornfield.When Jane first encounters Mr. Rochester, she is happy to help him and feels comfortable doing so. As Jane and Mr. Rochester talk and spend time together, their love for each other grows. Despite the presence of haughty and beautiful Blanche Ingram, Mr. Rochester and Jane become engaged. At this point in a typical love story, the couple would be married and live happily ever after. However, in Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre Mr. Rochester's mysterious past seizes the fairy tale moment to reveal itself and haunt the happy couple. This portion of the book is a bit long but is pleasantly new, as Mr. Rochester is a welcome substitute for the ubiquitous Prince Charming. Rochester is not handsome or young, instead he is bad tempered and is rescued by Jane more often than he does any rescuing of his own. It is very rare to find a novel with such fresh characters, and it's bracing that the book is not dominated by excessively beautiful people. Rather, Jane and Rochester are easy to relate to.After the marriage ceremony is interrupted and Rochester shows Jane his wife Bertha, the novel slows to about the pace of a sloth. Charlotte Bronte's novel would have benefitted greatly from an aggressive editor who could have cut about a hundred pages out of the book. Jane makes the dramatic and frustrating decision to leave Thornfield, and preserve her honor as well Mr. Rochester's. At this point in the book the level of my admiration for Jane plummeted along with my interest in the story. As starving Jane wanders through the wilderness in apparent agony over a decision she made of her own free will, she happens to stumble on the home of her distant relatives. After recovering, and beginning a job as a teacher she receives an inheritance from a long lost uncle. Unable to suppress her curiosity as to what had become of Rochester, and receiving no response from Mrs. Fairfax, Jane searches for her beloved Mr. Rochester.As the novel ends, it regains its excellence with the sweet reunion of Jane and Mr. Rochester. Although Rochester is crippled and blind, the story gets its long sought after happily ever after. Jane and Rochester are unusually fascinating characters, who make a more lasting impression than their beautiful fairy tale counterparts."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre, written in 1946 by Charlotte Bront, tells the story of an orphan girl who struggles to overcome the hardships that threaten her relationship with Mr. Rochester. After leaving her hateful aunt and cousins, and then her school, Lowood, Jane Eyre travels to Thornfield Hall to become a governess. It is here that she encounters Mr. Rochester, and the two fall in love. However, the novel is full of surprises and their love does not go untested.The chapters describing Jane's time at Gateshead and Lowood bring to mind characters such as Matilda and Harry Potter. As familiar as it is, the story is still heart-warming and builds up the reader's feelings for Jane for the rest of the novel. At Thornfield Hall, it is obvious that Jane is falling in love with Mr. Rochester. It is less clear that Mr. Rochester has feelings for Jane. After waiting out the suspense, the reader is finally rewarded with Mr. Rochester's proposal to Jane. Jane herself is not excited, and I found myself wishing that she was happier. Even though Charlotte Bronte's foreshadowing hints that something is not right at Thornfield, the horrific revelation of Mr. Rochester's deranged and murderous wife is a twist that surprised me. I was irritated with Jane for her choice of reason and pride over true love, but eager to find out what becomes of her.For one chapter, Jane wanders through villages in Yorkshire, desperate to find work, food, and shelter. I was angry with her for forgetting her parcel on the carriage, and I just wanted her to return to Thornfield Hall. Reluctantly, Jane reasons that returning to Mr. Rochester goes against her pride and sense and she refuses to go back. Eventually, she encounters the Rivers, who provide a place for her to stay. Simultaneously, Jane discovers that she has inherited a fortune and the Rivers are her cousins. Jane is far more overjoyed because she has a family rather than that she is rich.St. John Rivers trying to persuade Jane to marry him is the only really low point in Jane Eyre. These chapters are full of long conversations in which Jane agrees to go with him to India but not become his wife, followed by St. John saying that she must marry him. The same points are debated between the two many times, making this part of the book slow and boring. Finally, Jane leaves the Rivers and returns to Thornfield. I was disappointed that Jane didn't put her foot down immediately because it is obvious she will never marry St. John.Jane does suffer many hardships throughout the book, but Bronte rewards her with a happy ending. I liked the fact that Charlotte Bront wrote the prologue so that it took place ten years later. The reader finds out what happened to most of the characters in the book, including St. John, the Rivers sisters, and Ad&egrave;le. I like books that finish completely, with every loose end tied up, and Bront certainly does this in Jane Eyre. This novel is not a simple love story: it is filled with hardships, gothic elements, and mystery."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"The plot revolves around Jane as a child to adulthood. Orphaned since an infant, she grows up with her harsh aunt and unpleasant cousins. Around the age of ten, she gets sent to charity-school, where they provide education for the poor and orphaned. The school is run so poorly, many of the students die from meager provisions and disease. Jane survives the hardships of being at school; she would rather be anywhere than her aunt and cousins. She stays until the beginning of her adulthood, where she obtains a job as a governess to a child within the moors of England, namely Thornfield Hall. Thornfield Hall is owned by Edward Rochester, whose satirical character meets Jane's sharp wittiness, creating an intense bond between the two.Bronte intrigues the reader with the intricate development of the characters, making them truly realistic. For example, the choices she has Jane makes choice that are never straightforwardly done. As she goes through a great deal of obstacles, the author has Jane dwell on them in a heart-wrenching and analytical manner. The characters are also realistic to the Victorian time period in which it is set in. The roles of women and men are clearly distinct to the 1800's. It critically explains the patriarchal domination that she's constantly up against with the men in her life (Mr. Brocklehurst, Mr. Rochester, and Mr. Rivers) and England's social hierarchy while in her discovery of the complicated social position of governesses.****SPOILER ALERT****The author also explores a couple themes make the book quite interesting to its readers. One is the concept of morality. Jane decides whether her commitment to her philosophies is strong enough to resist the appeals of Mr. Rochester and refuses to be Rochester's mistress because of her \\"impassioned self-respect and moral conviction.\\" She rejects St. John Rivers' marriage proposal because they were not in love and forgives her Aunt Reed despite the cruelty she had Jane endure. Another was religion, when Jane attempts to gain a balance between happiness and faith. She encounters three extreme aspects of Christianity - Mr. Brocklehurst's strict religious discipline, Helen Burns' submissiveness, and St. John Rivers' commitment to charity and accomplishes stability between the three to help control her passionate personality but not completely changing her true self altogether.*****SPOILER ENDS*****Honestly, from the title and cover of the book, you would think it would be an uninteresting biography. However, Charlotte Bronte's story of Jane Eyre has a great deal of twists and turn of events and constantly keeps the reader interested. The book has it all - a blend of passion, romance, mystery, drama and suspense. I believe this to be one of the everlasting classics of English literature and a must-read for everyone."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This is one of the best readings of this book I've heard - and I've heard (and read) the book many times.

Jane Eyre in no way is one of those bad books.

The story of Jane Eyre pulled me in and found myself thoroughly interested in what happened to her. I now know why Jane Eyre is such a classic novel and is still being read today. The character of Jane Eyre is very strong, however she keeps most of who she is to herself due to her class in society.

And I'm thinking maybe it's been a mistake. If only every book could be as wonderful as this one.

She is clever, direct, honest and true to herself even when holding true to her principles costs her dearly.It is a gothic story, dark and heartbreaking full of love, devotion, obsession, isolation and oppression.

Some people may be put off by the fact that Jane felt like her life wasn't worth living without a man, but that's the way things were in that era. And hey it is really kind of a modern tale because Rochester did after all have a wife, which didn't stop him from falling for Jane. And he lied to her about his wife, and almost marries her while still already married. And that certainly seems to be common these days, maybe Bronte was just ahead of her time.

I guess my judgment must have been blinded on account of my being taken with myself for reading the classics . . ."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I've had a like/dislike relationship with this book since my college days. All right- mostly dislike.Everyone knows the plot by now, since they at least watched the televised versions, so I'll be brief- neglected orphan who grows up with abusive aunt and cousins is sent to charity school, where she experiences more misfortunes, grows up to become a governess in a gothic countryside mansion and falls in love with her Byronic employer. Eventually she finds fortune and happiness through various plot twists, some completely implausible.I've read this book several times since I was 19 and seemed to dislike it more with each reading. I think that what has always put me off this book is Charlotte Bronte's prose. It's just so cumbersome and long-winded and I find the imagery and descriptions heavy-handed and awkward- sorry, when she describes the \\"bonny beck\\" I just don't feel it. I much prefer her sister Anne Bronte's simpler but clearer writing, not to mention Emily Bronte's masterful prose. Additionally, Charlotte is completely humorless. What passes as humor just isn't very funny. By contrast, again, Wuthering Heights has surprisingly funny moments for such a dark gothic tale, once again demonstrating Emily's superiority as a writer.I additionally dislike Jane--somehow, I can't feel much liking for her. I appreciate that Bronte broke the mold with having a poor, plain heroine, but it's stressed so frequently that it loses its effect. She was also stupendously blind not to suspect that maybe, just maybe, there's another person there with the stony-faced Grace Poole who was the source of that mad laughter. And Rochester is a manipulative git. He really is. And he says \\"Jane, Jane!\\" too much and has an irritating tendency to compare her to elves and fairies.What's most surprising is that St. John River is actually a much more interesting character than Rochester. He's a strikingly handsome, repressed ascetic who directs his passion to his religion. Nowadays he would have made either a splendid villain or a disillusioned hero. Rochester and his angst are boring by comparison.If you think that Bronte is a good writer I dare you, just dare you, to read any of her other works. \\"Shirley\\" is painful and I heard that \\"The Professor\\" isn't much better. The only work where I felt that Charlotte finally got a handle on her art was her last novel, the emotionally difficult and thereby much less popular \\"Villette.\\"The best thing about Jane Eyre are the television and movie productions. There's a million of them and I find myself compelled to watch every single one. So I guess there is still something in the story that appeals to me. This is why I give this book three stars rather than two."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is a young woman, grown from a rash girl in a harsh life and boarding school, working as a governess to a French girl. This is Bront's romance novel, though it is somewhat vague to call it that, for there is much more involved than just a petty romance. Through some sticky language, and some boring sections-whole chapters, even-Bront relays the life of Jane Eyre through Jane's own eyes tastefully and with flexible, rich language, stringing the reader along.We begin with Jane Eyre's childhood. Through some difficult wording, we find that Jane lives with her Reed cousins and aunt. Her Aunt Reed sees her as a vile child compared to her own vile children, who she sees with a golden halo above their heads. Jane is often tortured physically by Reed's children, while taking the brunt of anger and blame from her aunt. We are brought through the agonizing years of her childhood, making her a rash young girl with dreams of a new life, which comes in the form of a boarding school that she is to be sent to. With such a rush of feeling, she spills out her heart to her aunt about how she really feels, but at such the young and tender age of 10, begins to discover truths about the world that normal 10 year old children do, such as what vengeance and anger could bring about. As Bront describes the feelings and compares them to some rather unrelated things, \\"Something of vengeance I had tasted for the first time; as aromatic as wine it seemed, on swallowing, warm and racy: its after flavor, metallic and corroding, gave me a sensation as if I had been poisoned,\\" I gained a sense of familiarity, for of course, when I pursue revenge, it's often a cold and empty attempt, leaving me cold and empty as she describes.The boarding school is anything but lovely, but Jane often refers to it as better than her previous surroundings; of course, as I, the audience, felt, it was. She begins to accept the discipline and conform rather well to the strict rulings of Mr. Brocklehurst, and, lonely at first, finds someone that she can relate to - Helen Burns, who also often gets lost in her own fantasy world as Jane does. The next chapters are really just an explanation of time in the boarding school, and though rather boring, explained her transition from a brash young girl into something more disciplined. The only truly interesting thing I found in this piece of the book was how Bront utilizes the technique of the \`drop' sentence. To explain it, she builds and builds up to a heavy-impact event, and then uses one sentence to release the suspense, in a rather harsh way, making the impact of the shock all the stronger. In the end of her explanation of Jane's childhood, she uses this here: \\"\\"...my face against Helen Burns' shoulder, my arms round her neck. I was asleep and Helen was - dead.\\" Of course, one thinks that there would be much more of a draw out here to Helen, her best friend, dying, but really, it was just a dropped ball, and I found myself shocked. Even so, there was a good five chapters of useless plot that I found to be quite tiresome.As Jane herself transitions to the next chapters, she explains the things that happened the eight years after that that she stayed in the hall, and how things improved, she improved, etc. This seemed to be one of the least confusing parts of the book, since it was straightforward and not so tangled up in language. Either way, she decides that she needs a change from the boarding school that she now taught at, and advertises herself, quickly replied to for a young girl. She immediately accepts and takes her journey to Thornfield. She is to teach a little girl named Ad&egrave;le in a large manor in which the master never seems to be around. There is an in depth, albeit easy to skip over, description of the lavish home that she now resides in, and Jane quickly falls into the routine. Before Mr. Rochester, the owner or Thornfield and a main character, shows up, I enjoy the passage (and the many after them) when Jane falls into her own fantasy world and fails to realize that something is happening, like this, \\"...Bessie's Gytrash,-a lion-like creature with long hair and a huge head... with strange pretercanine eyes, in my face, as I half expected it would... The man...broke the spell all at once.\\" They often occur, but they're so shrouded in incomprehensible old language, usually, that I can't catch them until I realize that I haven't understood a thing I've read, and read it over again. Once Mr. Rochester shows up, the actually romance novel-esque story begins, the true heart of Bront's novel. The two begin to seduce and fall in love with one another, though not right away like in a woman's fantasy, but over time as if it did in reality. There are many events after this, but I've said enough already!Jane Eyre is an entertaining, albeit sometimes confusing and boring, read. This is more of a novel for a person with an in-depth knowledge of the English language (and perhaps a little French) and that's looking for a satisfying read. Bront places foreshadowing and certain events with elegance and not without reasoning, for those small events begin to fall into place for what comes in the end, but are something the reader may skip over, for they're shrouded behind a tangled language and wordy sentences."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I first read this book when I was about 15 and I loved it. I love Mr Rochester and the playful way he has about acting with Jane. I loved the way their love was the perfect romantic love, not Mills and Boon but a more sedate, beautiful, mature love.As an afterthought though it has shaped my view of love and at 17 am shocked to find out that most people's idea of love is a prenup and till death to you part while I have a view of love as never part and don't need a prenup because you should love someone so much that you couldn't consider getting divorced.

I read it when I was in seventh grade and have read again at least once a year and I'm now in 12th grade. Each time I read it, I understand it better and the love and depth of emotions of Jane and Mr. Rochester becomes so overwhelming. When I saw that 3rd and seventh graders were reading it and finding it \\"odd\\" at times, and boring perhaps, it's because of the age thing. You've got to wait a few years and read it again. Trust me, after all those idiotic teen movies, you'll develop a priceless love for Jane Eyre. The only book I've ever found that was so harshly honest and real was Gone With the Wind. And that book I really don't recommend to young readers. I've once saw a reviewer say Jane Eyre wasn't original at all and the parts that were original were bad. I can't possibly fathom how J.E. isn't original. This book is one of the few books in the world where a normal, poor, average girl finds love that usually happens to supermodel types (Dickens was a big fan of the supermodel love). Jane's life has been anything been peachy, but she has the courage and determination to make the most of everything and let bygones be bygones, and she does. If anyone deserves love like Jane and Edward's, it's the both of them. And even in books and movies of the 21st century you'll rarely see a girl as independent as Jane.

She becomes a governess, then at 18 gets a job as a governess of a French girl. This is where she meets Mr. Rochester, a wealthy, handsome in his own way, man, who develops a hidden interest in Jane. When he asks her to marry her, Jane finds out he has an insane wife hidden away. She runs away, suffers poverty and hunger for a period, then returns. Finding Rocherster blind and burned.Details are needed in a book to let you know the surrounds, what each character SEES. Books aren't just to read, they're also to see, the world.Anyways, if you dumped this book, try read it again, and hopefully you weren't forced to read this for a college or high school class, or else you won't enjoy Jane Eyre; Jane Eyre is for individuals with class, and a love for great literature."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre sounded like a depressed person, and almost all of the people in this book didn't have much personality. Also, the writer discribed to much things."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Wow. This is such a great book. I wish I hadn't waited so long to read it. Once I picked it up, it was almost impossible to put down. Unlike other almost stuffy and boring books like Pride and Predjudice, this was an exciting thriller. I loved the part when Mr. Rochester asked Jane to marry him. On the whole, this is a brilliant novel. While some parts were unrealistic, in my opionion, they only made the story better. I would definatly reccomend this to everyone, especially girls!!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I love the story of Jane Eyre. I've seen several versions of the movie, but I never read it. So, I bought the book and started reading. After five minutes, I was forced to go to the dictionary. After another five, to the dictionary again! I know she is from a different time, but goodness. I never had this trouble from Jane Austen. I took two stars away for that and for the long drawn out descriptions and conversations. I had to force myself through the book in order to get to the story, which as great as it is..is hardly worth the headaches if your vocabulary is not up to par."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"JANE EYREBront, Charlotte. Jane Eyre. New York: Penguin Books, 1996 (reprint edition). Genre: Classic Victorian literature; gothic romance and suspense. Age range: Middle school to adult.It is sad that only mad dogs and Englishmen go out in the noonday sun. Clearly, the sun rarely shown at Haworth Grange, or anywhere near the wind-blown Yorkshire Dales--it might have reversed the unfortunate Bronts' madness. Page for page of gothic drama and angst, Jane Eyre can be a frustrating read. Jane's insecurity, low self-esteem, and then dramatic personality change near the end of the (very long) story hardly seem worth the agony for the dubious benefit of the love of Mr. Rochester. Those Bronts were all mad as hatters, and the unfortunate Mrs. Rochester wasn't the only one who should have been kept under lock and key. Be that as it may, the Bronts wrote classic British literature in the early Victorian Age, and therefore should be read, if only to see where gothic romance has come since then (not too far, unless you include &quot;Rebecca,&quot; by Daphne DuMaurier, a far tighter story, with as much spinelessness in the heroine, but at a far faster pace), and to understand that women did not have much else to write about in those days--thank the gods for Jane Austen, I say. At least her heroines were role models well worthy of attention by impressionable female readers."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Don't get sucked in by the pretty cover and cheap price (like I did)! This is apparently a printed-on-demand book, and the print font is all but unreadable. I tried, but could hardly get through the first page because of the font.

There are plenty of other versions of this classic to choose - they're probably all easier to read than this one."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I read this book thinking it would be lame because its so old. I read it in less than three days. I LOVED this book. The only thing is that upset me was she is my opposite. Her actions would have been way different if i was her.

Thats why I gave it five stars."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This is a nice edition of Jane Eyre. One reason I bought it was because the cover resembles Joan Fontaine, my favorite actress to portray Jane. It has some helpful introductory material, if you are teaching this novel in an English class.One thing that's different about this is it divides the book into volumes, which my previous copy didn't do.I think this book will be very useful as I teach the novel this year."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I love a good book and this is certainly one of them."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Do you like drama, excitement, action, and adventure? If so, do not read this book! Jane Eyre is a little English girl who is forced to live with her relatives that hate her. At the age of eight, she is forced to move to an orphan school where she has no friends and is continually abused. The book slowly drags through her life at school until she graduates. After spending eight years at school she becomes a governess for a little French brat out in the country. While living at the manor and tutoring the girl, Jane falls in love with the master of the manor. Mr. Rochester is an older man who has traveled all over the world searching for happiness. The rest of the book spends time explaining the controversy between their personalities and how they deal with each other's love. I give this book points for originality, but it needs a more gripping storyline. Only read this book if you need more reading material."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This book surprised me not having pages long descriptions of nature and place, which I like.

I will admit that some parts are a bit boring. But it is still a good book, and a worthwhile to any classic literature collection.Personally, I feel that the plot could have done better without Mrs. Rochester. The story was interesting, but the part with the crazy wife felt rather contrived. I would have liked for Jane to leave Rochester Hall for another reason, since the ending felt rather cliched to me, the story of her childhood was more interesting in some ways than the later parts."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I had wanted to read Jane Eyre since I was a little girl because, for some strange reason, I was always drawn to the novel. It took eight years for me to finally get around to doing so (I'm 18 now) and my God, I could not be more pleased. Bronte's story is phenomenal! While some may say that the story is nothing original, it should be remembered that this was published in 1847, so it is everything that followed it that is unoriginal. I don't wish to give any of the plot away, but I must say one thing: The novel excellently explores numerous themes, but the one that particularly stood out to me upon reading it is the inability to ever truly love someone else and to stand side-by-side with them before learning to love oneself. Following Jane, our beloved heroine, as she journeyed down this long and winding road, was wonderful for me. I felt that I too grew in some ways and what more could one want from a novel?"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I first read Jane Eyre when I was thirteen years old, I was captured by the powers of Jane Eyre's life and struggles. Every couple of months since then I take out my used Jane Eyre book and am again mystified. The novel is a story about a woman's journey and finally to true love. Both Jane and Rochester are the best of kindred spirits, and it is Jane's own bright spirit that is never tainted by \\"passions\\" and whims. She follows the path that is hers alone and one that is full of independence. Read the book, it won't disappoint."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I'd been wanting to read Jane Eyre for quite some time. I even had a copy in my possession. The problem was that it was a boring edition. I couldn't get into it.All that changed when I saw this illustrated version on a shelf.

I'm hoping she does more illustrated editions in the future."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Wow! This woman can write a book that keeps you interested from the beginning.

What really made me fall in love with this book, initially, was the cover. If I was going to get a classic why not do it in style?? After receiving my book in the mail I got started and really fell in love with the story.

Thank you for the prompt service and wonderful product!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"The beginning is kind of boring to get through, but once you get into her adult life it was a great page turner and one of the best Gothic love stories I have ever read. In fact, someone pointed out to me that her childhood dragging on and on helps you suffer with her and gives you a lot of sympathy for the character (Thanks Miriam!). Oddly enough, when I read this a second time before I saw the movie, I found the beginning went a lot faster. So you'll have to judge for yourself if you like the pace, but either way the beginning is worth it.The movie adaption of Jane Eyre by Focus Features was very well done and I really liked it. They were especially faithful to the characters. A few of my favorite scenes got left out, but I liked the characters so much I forgave them. The Gothic themes in the novel were played up as well making it a little spicy."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I had ordered two DVD's of Jane Eyre. Both are good, but the one has scenes in it what the other doesn't.Also diaologues. As the book I had was shortened for school reading, I wanted to have the complete book.That is what I have now and it pleases me very much.I have read it already 4 times and still am.I am happy with it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane is not the average person, she has been through a lot and she has chosen to overlook some of other things as well. The point which haunted her was during the orphanage her aunt has consigned her to: she kept thinking those who are talented are destined for greatness, but her best friend with the fair hand was let off and killed. That was the most disappointing part of her youth and haunted her to no end and no beginning. She most willingly settled to be with a mocked up version of male counterpart of her friend from youth as repairing the damages she saw but could not escapes. Who could not but questioned her senses on why would she not accept the person who she is, but she tries to escape her own drawing ability and let the skinny girl have the crown, in the end, she makes up by letting her of all the grieves with which she felt as a child and watches another woman die in her own care. In fact, she condone murder twice to marry into her unloved imagination. I am not sure if in fact, when love being equal, she herself is any more sane and/or shameful for her desire to escape the part of her soul that does not want to see her friend as gone awry, but she could have chosen to say no, to the man who has thus found her to be a willing body for his child in custody. So the subject became the unacceptable girl and her mother became more of disowned love tale's antagonist. I don't believe the author hints at polygamy, but it wanted to be so to satiate its own desire to compete with all the other females at all cost for a chance at marriage."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"My mom encouraged me to read this book when I was 13. She said that it was a great classic for girls and that I would love it. And so I did read it and love it, but now I'm amazed that I got through it. I don't have a copy of it anymore, so I read some of it on-line, and I was surprised to see that the writing is rather ponderous and even tedious. I'm amazed at the length of some of the sentences. When I was young, I didn't worry about difficult words. I certainly never looked up unfamiliar words in the dictionary because I didn't want to destroy the momentum and flow of the story. I could usually tell from the context the meaning of the word. I'd been told that it was an exciting story so I buckled down and forced myself to get into it.Before I knew it, I'd put myself in Jane's shoes, and my own life started to look really good in comparison. Terrorized by the family who raised her, abused by the administrators of the school she attended, my heart was bleeding for her and then, finally, she received some emotional sustenance from a caring, understanding teacher and a saintly, loving classmate.When she goes to work for Mr. Rochester as a governess for his \\"ward,\\" Adele (actually his illegitimate child), she is a love-starved, vulnerable young woman. Worldly Mr. Rochester has been around shall we say, and his heart has been hardened by various circumstances in his life. However, Jane's goodness, innocence, and intelligence win him over. They fall in love and wish to marry.But remember this is a gothic novel, and there are mysteries in the big house they inhabit. Screams can be heard coming from the attic. There's a fire one night. Strange laughter can be heard on occasion.Suffice it to say, they're not allowed to marry--as they're about to exchange vows a man storms the church and insists that he can tell why the couple should not be allowed to marry.Jane goes away, she nearly marries someone else, and then one night she believes that Rochester is calling her...Enough said, this is the sort of information my mom gave me when she was seducing me into reading this book--a Cinderella sort of heroine falls in love with an older man who lives in a big spooky house--that was enough for me. I proceeded to make my way through all those long sentences and was richly rewarded at the end. I can tell you that this isn't exactly a fairy-tale ending but it's more happy than sad. Very poignant. You'll cry, but you'll be so happy that you shared Jane's misery and witnessed her happiness."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"At 50, with the kids all growing up and moving out, I'm finding more time to read, and most of it is on my Kindle I recieved for my birthday. Free classics from Amazon seemed like a good place to start. There are many books that I know the story line to from other sources (movies mostly), but never had a chance to read the original source material. Jane Eyre is one of those books. It wasn't a quick read, and it did drag on at times. Honestlyh, I thought to myself quite often, \\"What amd I doing reading a gothic romance\\", but I carried on. I had also seen the 2011 movie adaptation (which I also recommend) and wanted to fill in the missing pieces. I also wondered what I would have thought of this book if I HAD read it as a young person (teenager)? I probably would have hated it! I'm glad I read it this summer as upon reflection I did enjoy this Bronte novel. I hope you enjoy rereading the classics like I am."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre follows the life of a Jane Eyre - a poor, plain, unconnected and very small-bodied young woman. When the novel begins, she's ten years old and lives with her horrible Aunt Reed and her equally dreadful cousins, who enjoy bullying her. Deemed a troublesome and disagreeable girl (even \\"passionate\\", gasp, the horror!), Jane is passed onto Lowood, a school for orphaned girls.After six years in that hell-hole, having survived a typhus outbreak and malnourishment, Jane is promoted to teacher, and stays on for a further couple of years, until the headmistress gets married and takes off. Eager to broaden her horizons now that her friend is gone, Jane advertises for a position as a governess. The only response is from Thornfield Hall, where a young French girl needs tutoring.At Thornfield, Jane finds her pupil to be very vain, but agreeable nonetheless. The housekeeper, Mrs. Fairfax, is an old dear and life is a bit monotonous ... until the master of the house happens to finally return. Edward Fairfax Rochester - harsh, sarcastic, brooding ... and oh such a darling deep within. And about 20 years older than Jane, but what does that matter when you're in love? Question is, can an unconnected governess really find happiness with the rich master of Thornfield?While I love the story and the characters, I'm not necessarily a huge fan of the novel itself, because it has issues. Charlotte Bront's pacing is peculiar - the first twelve chapters tend to drag on a bit and she's too fond of very long, rambling descriptions. Not to mention the over-the-top \\"coincidences\\" which might have been classed as \\"providence\\" back in the day, but today they sound far-fetched.Regardless of anything else, Jane Eyre is a powerful (and somewhat melodramatic) story of love against all odds, self-respect and female independence. It stays with you ... at least if you manage to get through the chapters where Jane isn't at Thornfield. I have to admit I find the Gateshead and Lowood parts quite tedious - I'm just waiting for her to get to Thornfield so the story can start for real. Then, I tend to shoot through the chapters and then it grinds to a halt in Morton and the pages drag on until finally, it picks up again at the very end.There is a reason some books are still read and cherished 160+ years after their first publication. It's because they're well-written, tell a compelling story and have themes which we can still associate with and understand. We can still relate to Jane's passion and a good love story always works. Charlotte Bront's most famous novel has stood the test of time so far, and I think it will live with us for many years yet.4 out of 5 dreadful charity schools for orphans, because while I love the story, I'm not keen on the very convenient \\"coincidences\\", nor at times the writing itself. Charlotte Bront was a great dialogue writer, but her descriptions ... sometimes she just doesn't know when to stop."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Got this book for my daughter.

I have read it at least 20 times through the years, I consider Jane Eyre a must read especially for all females regardless of age."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Today's literary environment is filled with books that read like a bowl of popcorn--they are quickly devoured and lack any substance. However, I understand why many readers shy away from the classics. Most of the time, when I pick up a book I'm just looking to be entertained and diverted--I don't want to feel like I'm in my 12th grade English class. Don't despair if that's you: there are some classic novels that capture the best of both worlds. Jane Eyre is one of those books.Jane Eyre is filled with poetic and beautiful prose that will enlarge your vocabulary and stimulate your imagination. I especially enjoy the dialogue between Jane and Edward Rochester. Not only do the characters speak beautifully, but they also speak intelligently. There are many times a soliloquy will cut right to the heart of the matter in question with the precision of a scalpel, but with language that is poetic as it is accurate. It's a pity many modern novels can't achieve this same balance.Reading Jane Eyre is not like eating your literary vegetables. This book is hugely entertaining. It's gothic romance at its best. Edward Rochester is brooding, seductive, passionate and troubled--the quintessential bad boy. He is infinitely more compelling than that other Edward you'll find lingering around Forks. Jane is a tower of strength. She is a woman who falls deeply in love, but is not defined by that relationship. She does not find her identity in any man, but in the treasure of the spirit God gave her. She faces what would seem to most of us like unendurable suffering in the most admirable way--yet she doesn't come off as superhuman. This is the kind of character teenage girls should be reading--not the simpering, swooning Bella Swan.If you pick up this book, I promise you'll be entertained--but while you are entertained, you will also be uplifted."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I've read the book and watched the excellent BBC video. But the audio book version is a revelation. The narrator teased apart the different strands that lie behind the obvious storyline with great sensitivity. Parts of the book that in my previously too-hurried reading I had found a bit slow and heavy-going, Susan Ericksen reads with considerable thoughtfulness and tenderness. Jane's provoking episodes come across with a gentle lightness, and I could go on. Sufficient to say that each character comes effortlessly and believably alive. I've come away with a whole new respect for Charlotte Bronte's skill and insight. In this reading the book becomes a very special experience.Oops!

Jane never forgets or loses who she is no matter what she goes through. And in the end, not even her wildest dreams could compare to what became her reality and it's all because she stayed true to herself. Jane Eyre, in all her bravery, quickly and easily became my most beloved heroine. She never tried to change Mr. Rochester into something he wasn't. She wouldn't allow him to spoil her with superficial things. She didn't want anything his money could buy, she just wanted to be needed, to be loved. And in the end, that was all Mr. Rochester wanted as well. What more could you ask for? Charlotte Bronte worked wonders. She made Jane feel as if she is an old friend telling her life story through laughter and tears. Reading this book will be one of the best decisions you've ever made. I guarantee it.

Living as an orphan she is driven to become successful and fall in love. She becomes a young writer nd often expresses her feelings and thoughts through her writing. As a young teenager I can easily relate to a lot of how she feels. I felt comfort in reading this novel because I am not the only person going through a lot of changes in my life. I recommend this novel to a lot of young readers and especially young teenage girls. Jane Eyre contains a point of view that captivates the reading."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I don't remember when I first read Jane Eyre. I have read it on and off for years now, along with hundreds of other books. When I was younger, I admired everything Jane did; every decision she made was the right one. Jane was the heroine of the story and I didn't question her decisions. But.. after much reflection on the outcomes of her decisions, I have come to the conclusion that she was TOO strong, too determined that she must lead a faultless life. It was almost creepy, how iron willed she was. I think the true victim of the novel was not Jane herself, but the rich and powerful Fairfax Rochester, who was so much in love with her that even Jane hoped her leaving would not drive him to madness and despair.. His plea, \\"You will not come? You will not be my comforter, my rescuer? My deep love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer are all nothing to you?\\" .. but Jane, in her determination to be true to her morals,walked away and left him in a near suicidal state. \\"Oh, Jane, this is bitter. This is wicked.\\" These words fell from Mr Rochester's lips when he saw that she meant to leave. I tend to agree. It DID seem wicked to leave him on the verge of madness. He ask no more of her, at that time, than to just stay in residence until some alternative plan could be embarked upon. However, she didn't want to be suspetible to the worldy temptations embodied in Mr Rochester...She almost died because of her decision to tear herself away, and what happened to Mr. Rochester will make the reader shudder. But.. Jane's \\"integrity\\" and strength remain intact,and supposedly that is the lesson the reader is supposed to carry away. But I love Jane Eyre anyway,love the story, and have a leather bound edition of it on my bookshelf. It's beautifully written and deeply interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I read &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, against my wishes, when I was a junior in high school and found it stuffy and dry, much like other books from the Victorian period. However, when I read it again as a sophomore in college my opinion change. I saw &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; as a heroine who fought her way from the bottom of society in order to make something out of herself.What I liked about the title character was that she was smart and even more importantly she was strong-willed. Somehow, Charlotte Bronte created a female heroine who had real character at a time when most women were used solely as ornaments and child-bearing machines."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"The protagonist is clear-headed, thoughtful, and independent. Even when she falls in love, she doesn't let that love take over her life. She knows that it's better to lose her love than to lose herself. That doesn't happen that often in &quot;love stories&quot; of the time.Even the &quot;happy ending&quot; of the story isn't completely happy -- it took a great deal of sacrifice and trouble for both Jane and her lover to get there.Most of today's &quot;Gothic&quot; novels are inferior copies at best of this book. Their heroines don't have half the brains or the personality of Jane."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre was a very good book. At first glance, I wasn't sure if I was going to enjoy this book because I didn't like the previoius Victorian book I read. This book proved to be a lot better. It was not a typical romance novel. Jane Eyre was a love story, but also had many unforeseen twists that kept my attention. I had no idea what was going to happen, and when something didn't go the way I had expected, I was worried about how it would turn out. I enjoyed the basic plot, but I liked the unpredictablility the most. This book took me a lot longer to read than I had expected. This was because Jane Eyre is at a high reading level. It had many vocabulary words that confused me. This was the only drawback to this book. I would recommend this book to ages 14-20 and to people that enjoy classical literature. It was very enjoyable, but I would not suggest reacing Jane Eyre to anyone who likes more action because this book describes each event in great detail. Overall, I thought this book was very enlightening and enjoyable."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Alright, joint greatest with Wuthering Heights. This novel for all its faults (journalistic style, over reliance on coincidence, a certain Byronic vulgarity to Rochester) simply transcends other English fiction of its time. Charlotte Bronte magics Jane Eyre into existence, the reader inhabits her consciousness. The book's first readers had never read anything like it: you can see why. It is has been continuously in print for over one hundred and fifty years and is a classic in the truest sense of the term. Fie on those who gave it one star!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Mixed with Charlotte Bronte's eloquence is a character you actually feel when you read this book. The descriptive characteristics of Jane's surroundings make it easy to imagine what Bronte is trying to portray. Her writing is a work of art in itself. I have read this book over and over again and would highly recommend it to others who want a story about love, fear, pride, hope, sadness, and experiencing life all rolled into one."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is an 18th Century classic that has continued to be published and sought after for over 150 years. The story is an extraordinary one. Jane Eyre is gripping in its intensity and the plot continues to keep the reader guessing until almost the last page. Rarely has a story contained such a diverse content. There is cruelty, romance, gothic undertones, joy, sadness and the torment of unrequited love. Here you will find human emotions in their extremes. It's a fantastic story! The 18th Century dialect may be troublesome if your not used to it, so keep the dictionary to hand and enjoy!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"What a wonderful book! I just finished reading Jane Eyre for the first time, and I already know that it will be a book I return to often! I absolutely loved Bronte's writing style...it's a book that grabs your attention from the very first page and holds you there 'til the very end! Not a dull page in the book! I was in awe by the time I reached the last page....what an ending! As they say, &quot;Be still my heart&quot;. If you are a fan of Victorian romances, I *definitely* recommend this book to you! Take my word for it, you will be returning to these enchanting pages again and again!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Romance and love. Principles and rash decisions. All these are included with much more in the edge-of-your-seat novel: Jane Eyre, by Charlotte Bronte.The main character, Jane Eyre, is first pictured as a poor, neglected, mistreated ten-year-old. Her temper is yet wild and uncontrolled, so she gets into many scraps, consequentially landing her in a boarding school fifty miles away. After a bad epidemic of typhus, the unhealthy structure of Lowood school is discovered. It is at once put to rights.After eight years at Lowood (two total as a student and six as a teacher), Jane discovers that she longs for a different life. She puts an ad in the paper, and soon receives a letter from an old lady named Mrs. Fairfax. This lady writes to hire Jane as governess of a little French girl. Upon taking the job, Jane presently meets the owner of the house, Mr. Rochester, and falls in love. However, while at the altar, about to make their vows, a disruption occurs.Jane runs away with nothing but a few pounds, which she accidentally leaves in the coach. After three days out in the open with hardly any food or sleep, she encounters a happy family, which takes her in. Se doesn't give her true identification, but soon becomes at home and gets a job as the local girl's schoolmistress.However, not very long after, Jane meets a bend in the road. No sooner does she get settled in, but she finds that she does have family and a large fortune after all! She begins to feel restless and uneasy to have left Mr. Rochester, and sets out to find him.I won't say the ending, but I will say that I loved this book! It is so romantic and sweet. I would definitely recommend it to anyone. Besides, \\"they all lived happily ever after,\\" and that's the best part."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Young Jane has a tough childhood growing up with her cousins and aunt after her parents passed away. Treated like a servant, and not like a member of the family, Jane felt she was all alone in the world, and it doesn't make it better when she's sent away to school. First as a student, and then as a teacher/guverness, but neither is like a dance on roses. Then her skills bring her to a mysterious and quite arrogant Mr.Rochesters house where she becomes the guverness...This book illustrates very well the passionate love from a woman's point of view. No longer is the female character a background character, but becomes independant with feelings, passion, integrety and a strong mind.The book is very realistic, and you can easily identify yourself with the feelings that the main character has. Her devotion for what she loves, and her effort to make the best out of her life.Charlotte Bront, who first published this book under a pseudonym, is probably the most well-known of the Bront sisters who all died very young. Jane Eyre is a brilliant book of a woman who can be a role model for young girls of today. Her determination to make life the best for herself as no one else seems to bother, and her passion for what she loves. One of the first romance novels written. A true classic that I very much enjoyed to read, and I'm certain I will read it many more times. Even my friend, who doesn't like reading very much, totally loved this book. I warmly recommend this to anyone who loves a good novel, and most certainly to young girls. I think the language might be a little advanced for anyone younger than 16."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"JANE EYRE is a wonderful story about a woman's struggle to survive and go on to realize her full potential. It is also a stirring tale of romance in which love conquers evil and despair.The plot is interesting while the main characters are multi-dimensional and very intriguing. The book has almost too many characters but some are memorable simply because they seem so real.The story begins with Jane Eyre as an unwanted orphan in the care of a cruel aunt who has two spoiled children of her own. Jane is sent to an austere boarding school where she develops into a remarkable young woman able to overcome tremendous obstacles and discouragements. She gets a job as a governess for a young girl at Thornfield which is owned by Edward Rochester. The evolving love relationship between Jane and Edward becomes the focus of the novel whose broad message is uplifting in spite of the sombre mood and tragic events which often intervene.I like Charlotte Bronte's writing style. It is easy to see why she became an immediate success with the publication of JANE EYRE in 1847."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This book is probably my favorite that I have ever read. The story is about a young governess who grew up as a neglected orphan. When she moves to the home of Rochester, her life takes quite a turn.

This book is passionate, romantic, mysterious, exciting, and altogether wonderful! I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane my hope,my love, my life.Charlotte is brilliant! Truly Brilliant!I love this book!

Jane is one of my favorite characters in literature. It is an incredible, beautiful story, one of the best ever written. Jane Eyre is a plain, unattractive, poor orphan. She goes through a difficult childhood, first in the house of her abusive aunt, then as a student who endures the harsh and unjust conditions of Lowood School. At eighteen, she takes up the post of governess at Thornfield Hall, meets and falls in love with Mr. Rochester, her employer.Despite the wrongs and harsh treatments she recieved as a girl, despite having no family and few friends, Jane at eighteen is strong, thoughtful and intelligent when her character meets the nasty and sarcastic Mr. Rochester. Their conversation is so full of wit, humour and hidden meanings. There is nothing more charming than how Mr. Rochester attempts to provoke Jane and tries to bully her a bit, but his efforts miserably fail as he finds he has met someone who is quite his equal. In her novel, Bronte stresses that their relationship is based on 'sympathy' and 'a likeness'.A dark secret of Rochester's past impedes their marriage, and after an emotional and heart-breaking scene, Jane adheres to her morals and leaves Thornfield in the night. What follows are two days of degredation, neglect, and pain, as Jane finds herself in an unfriendly town where none will help her. An unusual twist of fate brings salvation at last, in the form of the handsome St. John and his sisters. Again Jane's strength of character is tested when St. John (is it me, or is he a lot like Enjolras of Les Miserables?) makes her a difficult proposal. She has to make a final decision of either sacrificing her heart or seeking Rochester again.The novel is full of heart-warming moments, suspense and intrigue. The narrator, Jane herself, constantly addresses the reader, and makes you feel like you know her personally. Through this and the beautiful use of language I've found a friend and an idol in Jane. She is a wonderful character, and you come to realize she is not at all plain, she is interesting, complex, and passionate.When speaking of her Rochester says \\"Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing looking out of it, defying me, with more than courage...And it is you, spirit - with will and energy - and virtue and putiry - that I want: not alone your brittle frame.\\"Did I say the language is beauitful and thrilling? My copy of the book, although new, is quickly wearing out! Again and again I pick it up to read my favourite passages, which I've marked. Although I absolutely adore this book, I must say if you are not a fan of the genre and don't read classics, you might think it slow. But with some patience, your efforts will be rewarded. Read this book if you think yourself unlucky, Jane's courage and faith will inspire you."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"When I was little, my mother would always read this to me. I was named after the writer, who my mother loved. This book is a classic. You must read this to be considered a true reader or &quot;book lover&quot;."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"True, the first few chapters are difficult to get through,but after those this story brought out tons of emotions in me.I felt ashamed when Jane heard the ladies talk about her in the game room with Mr. Rochester there.I felt shunned when Mr. Rochester brushed Jane aside seemingly without a second thought.And I felt the romance in the garden.Not to give away any more, I will just simply state that I felt some emotions that no book has ever brought out so fervently in me.This isn't your classic love story..boy meets girl, boy and girl fall in love and live happily ever after. There is tragedy and heartache on the sides of both characters.There isn't just the longing of one or the heartache of one, you see each,longing and heartache, in both.The characters are put into such detail and described so well you can almost imagine what they will say in response to other characters in the book.This is a truly unique book and if you like feeling angry,fearful,mourning,loss,and romance this book is for you!When I first started it,it really was not that interesting to me, and it actually took me two times to go check it out before I eventually got past the part I didn't like.So if you bear through the beginning you'll eventually get to the really good stuff...oh, and one more thing. If you have seen any of the movies,don't go by them.Of the movies I have seen based on this book,none live up to the standard set by the book.I hope this was helpful:)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I absolutly loved this novel. It does not matter how long ago it was written or how much time has passed since I have read it. The characters are interesting, well-developed, and exciting. I had forgotten about how Jane Eyre's childhood was such a struggle. She experienced mental and physcial abuse at the hands of unfeeling and wicked relatives. Later in the story when she is &quot;left&quot; at a &quot;school&quot; her life is again that of a sad and angry child. Somehow through it all she manages to become a affable, caring, and trustworthy adult. This assures her not only a position has a teacher at her school but later has a governess to a child in the care of the intimidating and wealthy Mr. Rodchester. What a formadable opponent she was has an adult to Mr. Rodchesters wit and saracasim. The end of the book is full of surprises and twists. I hate to sound cliche but it is true.

It's nice to get a copy of Jane Eyre on my Kindle - I like re-reading bits from this book from time to time, it's kind of inspirational.

As an over 50 yr old female I enjoyed Jane Eyre in a different way to the times I read it earlier.

It is a wonderful book and a great love story."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"One of the challenges in reading a great work of literature is that it often has many imitators. The imitations may be flattering or unflattering; they may be complimentary or subversive; they may borrow just little bits or just about everything. In addition to spoiling surprises (thanks a lot, I Walked with a Zombie!) it is possible for the original source to look cliched or hackneyed after experiencing all those others. Did that torpedo this book for me?Consider some various elements in the story: The first conversation between Jane and Helen Burns at Lowood School reads like the best of Dostoyevsky. The plot meanders from location to location across England like the best of Dickens. Jane has romantic entanglements with noblemen and churchmen (it's Church of England, after all) like the best of Austen. Ghosts, crazy people, and supernatural/horrific events pop up like the best of Val Lewton.Jane Eyre does not suffer at all by comparison. The story of the orphaned girl growing up in an unloving home with an indifferent aunt and cousins, moving out to a harsh boarding school where she gets her education, and taking a job as a governess at the lonely estate of Mr. Rochester is compelling reading. Her character grows throughout the book in believable and engaging ways. There are many deep conversations about Christianity, duty, missionary work, matrimony, etc., that fit naturally into the story and arise from the people's lives. I found the book fascinating and hard to put down. This is a great work of literature undiminished by other similar works.Thanks to Julie and Scott at A Good Story is Hard to Find for getting me to read this wonderful novel.I did read the book on Kindle for Android, which means I didn't really have a book. Unfortunately there was no annotations or notes and quite a bit of dialogue is in French (with a small bit of German, too). I remember just barely enough to get through but it would have been nice to have translations available. I don't know if other e-versions have better support for language-challenged readers. It is something to consider if you haven't read Jane Eyre and don't know French. I think a reader could get by without it but it can be frustrating."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I am not one to cry when reading a book, but this one made me cry, laugh and love. I have seen movies of Jane Eyre and they never do it justice. Very moving and so sad that a child should ever go through such things but I know that they do.

You must read this classic to find out, and you will be rooting for this story's heroine all the way. I loved the depth of this character's relationship, not just one of those dime-a-dozen love stories like Twilight. She was a fallible human being, and I admired her for it.

Jane Eyre was summer reading, and I figured he could knock out this assignment on our trip AND we could have some fun talking about it. This plan worked out wonderfully. The narration was great and we had some good discussions.One area that I made my son nuts was complaining about the character of Edward Rochester. I look at his behavior, and cannot understand why so many readers consider him a romantic hero.He treats women terribly. He ignores the emotional needs of Ad&egrave;le Varens. While it is noble that he pays for her care while his paternity is not clear, he has assumed the role of guardian and is not emotionally present for her.Next, Lady Ingram is a narcissistic gold digger. At the same time, she is a feeling human being (in the context of the story). Rochester just uses her to make Jane jealous. He gets Lady Ingram to dump him by telling her a lie when posing as a gypsy fortune teller. This is not an honorable way to end a relationship.He does his worst to Jane. He knows full well that he is already married. Yes, he really does not like Bertha Mason Rochester. No, he really REALLY does not like Bertha Rochester. But, he is legally married to Bertha and he knows it.We find that his plan is to wed her, take her on a honeymoon, ruin her for other men (by the standards of the time), and then drop the bombshell on her that he is already married and that their marriage is not legal.So why do so many women seem to overlook how badly Rochester was going to treat Jane and love this is a romantic story. Jane should have dumped him and not looked back. He is a cad and not worthy of true love. What am I missing?"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I was just looking for a free classic to read for fun this summer; this book far exceeded my expectations.

She is faced with incredible temptation yet she choose to do what is right rather than what feels right and Providence rewards her for it.I have been reading this on my phone rather that a reader, but I've found the kindle edition to be just as easy to read as having the book and I always have it with me, even when I just have a few quiet minutes in the car waiting for kids."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Charlotte Bront's Jane Eyre was truly an enjoyable novel for me to read. Jane Eyre, the protagonist of Bront's novel, grows up as an orphan child in oppressive surroundings; however, she overcomes the repression of her cruel childhood and follows her heart to find out who she is and where she truly belongs. Readers, especially female readers, can easily identify with Jane because they are all searching for themselves or have already done so at some point in their lives. Although there are a few parts of the novel which are difficult to read, the novel is essentially easy to read and understand, mainly because it is actually written to and for the reader. Readers are still able to make a connection with Jane's passionate feelings, her love of religion, and her struggle with difficult decisions, because the readers of today must still deal with those same situations that Jane dealt with over one hundred and fifty years ago. Readers can learn from the balance Jane maintains between her conscience and her intuition as influences to the difficult decisions she makes. Jane's undying sense of hope is inspiring and shows readers that hope and faith are the only things needed to carry on in life."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre has an odd place in literary history. It is one of the most compelling reads ever written, and in my opinion, it uncovers so much about the nature of being a human. The novel's a page-turner for its entertainment value as well as for its ability to enlighten.Jane is a poor orphan born in a society that fights her ability to attain financial, emotional, sexual, and spiritual freedom. From the beginning of the novel, Jane is on a quest to gain her liberation. Of course, she cannot do so by herself. She must retain enough fortitude to be her true self, and she must be an instrument of grace, of change, in the life of Rochester.Everything in the novel conspires toward the creation of a near-perfect novel. I cannot believe I waited so long to experience this masterpiece, but I will certainly be returning to it over and over through the rest of my life. This novel cannot be missed by anyone who wants to read truly great literature or by anyone who just wants to experience a great read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I first read Jane Eyre when I was thirteen, and I fell in love with it almost instantly as soon as I finished the first chapter.

After all, aren't we all plain Jane Eyre's at times?"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"It took me a while to get into this novel.

Don't be intimidated by the length, because you will certainly get so enraptured, and taken in, that you wont even notice it. I must say that Jane Eyre is one of the most endearing and enjoyable characters that i've encountered. Charlotte Bronte develops her perfectly. I love her ability to poke fun at and tease her admired one, Mr Rochester; it's refreshing, and my idea of love. It develops at a nice, steady pace, never lagging. The tone and the references to the reader suit the book quite well, and I believe that the story was far ahead of its time. Why four out of five? Well, i found certain parts of the story far too unbelievable, and Mr. Rochester seemed to go from stern and haughty, to love-sick and passionate all too quickly, that I found it somewhat ingenuine. I believe that the end is what really made the story worthwhile, when Jane goes back to see her beloved once more. That is when i started to tear.

For the most part ;)!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"One of the reasons Jane Eyre is such an enduring piece of literary excellence is because of it's simple theme, in a book of numerous themes battling for #1, is of the ability of one human being with absolutely nothing to rise above hell and survive. Yet anyone can write about that, but only a true talent can make you give a damn about it all.Going back to those other themes, they consist of feminism, morality, personal blindness, social reform, and more. A plethora of characters that you'll despise or love or feel like kicking at one moment and hugging the next, it's a breathtaking array of humanity drenched in dysfunction, and one woman who's known nothing else and with great difficulty can still find those rungs on the ladder.Jane is appealing because of her complexities and endurance. Bronte's contemporary audiences found Jane a bit of an enigma, she's a moral strength in the toughest sense but so independent and (has been called) the first feminist in literature. Bronte gives us ample opportunity to see what the social climate was back then, and it only adds to the atmosphere of difficulty for Jane's saga as a poor governess in a male dominated world. Yet Jane is realistic because we see how she evolves from being an free spirited child to a beaten down teenager/adult who strives only to escape to follow her dreams and follow God's word, and eventually the governess who must come to terms with the man she loves and the dark secret that he carries. That's Rochester, who represents everything Jane isn't. He's immoral, crude, nasty, and is inexplicably held down by a bundle of secrets and one rather large one that keeps him a captive of his own life. They have one thing in common, they have thick shells they don't know how to get rid of.And yet Bronte weaves us a story that is full of passion and shows us the cracks in the dams that keep these characters apart, and as the numerous events and intrigues take place, we see how they grow and finally come to terms with their reality and whatever tragic consequences must occur. And at the root of it is Jane who leads us through decision and pain and her intense desire to just be a good and fully human person in a society and situation that won't allow her to.Jane Eyre is a book about us, and is an inspiring book even 160+ years later, not just because of the quality of Bronte's talent, or the brilliant plot weaving and what not, but because it's a masterpiece look at the strength of the human spirit."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane may be a meek, rather plain, dull young girl...not to mention shy and quiet.

And Christ taught us that we are the light of the world.Helen is a kind friend of Jane Eyre in the school and has the heart like the angel.That chief director did the evil that he lets weak Helen walk in the rain .Thus, Helen dies.Furthermore, everywhere in the novel, a British beautiful rural scenery is pictured with the fresh and young sensitivity of a young woman .The mansion which she visited as a tutor is right attractive like an old cave.A big mansion has a secret.A thing that suggests a modern horror novel drifts.Gradually young Jane Eyre is charmed by middle-aged Rochester with the naivete such as the wild beast.This description will be a example of the love story's masterpiece .There are \\"The sorrow of young Werther\\", French \\"The lily of the valley\\", Russian \\"Anna Karenina\\" in the world love stories.But in their novels ,three women are the noble or the rich.In that respect, Jane Eye is from the misfortune.I am interested by the existent problem that this human being is born.Jane Eyre gets true love by power of her intention in the misfortune.It is not at all a light novel.On the contrary, it is a heavy novel.I read Jane Eyre and remembered \\"Light in August\\" of Faulkner."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"It had been years since I read this book.

My printed version is really worn out now but I am enjoying my Kindle version greatly!Love all the features! Highlight and mark all my favourites paragraphs - and find them in a second! I gather more easily now all the lines that show how empty, wounded and deeply hurt EFR's soul was and how Jane gave Rochester's heart a voice. And a voice is meant to be heard... and followed.J+E's characters symbolize now to me an encounter of one spirit seemingly divided in two. But they both had to learn their lessons of acceptance and forgiveness before such awareness arose in their hearts.After leaving Thornfield, Jane's journey was about acceptance. She had to acknowledge - fully and wholeheartedly - her love for EFR past any conventionality. She came back to him out of love. She had no expectations but to be with his \\"best earthly companion\\".Rochester's journey was about forgiveness. He himself had to admit - heartily and unconditionally - his wrong actions and forgive himself. He lied, hid and manipulated out of fear.

The book is a little long--but then all Victorian novels are (people had more time to read then),but the material before about who Charlotte Bronte was and that she served as a governess herself gave tremendous background to what might seem like an over-dramatic story. Charlotte Bronte was one of the first novelists to talk about the plight of single women (who had to make a living) of that era in England. Descriptions of the country side and the travel by coach are amazing and the reader feels as if he/she can actually see and experience what it must have been like to live and travel there.Charlotte Bronte's characters are sharply delineated and the main character is a strong woman in an era of weak ones; I compared them with some of the strong women found in the novels of Jane Austen.

There at Gateshead Hall, she is horribly mistreated by the Reeds, against the dying wish of her Uncle Reed.At the age of 10, Jane is accepted to Lowood School after being interviewed by the schools owner: Mr. Brocklehurst. Jane takes an instant disliking to him, and when she arrives at the school, he stands Jane on a pedestal and tells everyone that she is a liar, which is not true. She later proves to everyone that she is not a liar. During her time at the school, Jane meets a girl named Helen Burns. They immediately become best friends, to the very end. Sadly, this end comes all too soon. Helen is one of the 7 fatal cases during the typhus epidemic at the school. Jane remains at the school for a good 10 years, 2 of which were spent as a teacher, until she advertised as a governess.Jane's advertisement is answered by a Mrs. Fairfax, of Thornfeild Hall. Jane arrives to meet her pupil: Adel&eacute;, a French little girl, who was left to Mr. Rochester by her mother. Mr. Rochester is the master of the Thornfeild estate, and first meets Jane when she assists him and his spooked horse on a lane one afternoon. By this time, Jane has been at Thornfeild for a few months. Mrs. Fairfax had previously informed Jane that she will rarely see Mr. Rochester, as he sometimes leaves for days, weeks or even months at a time. Mr. Rochester then accuses her of being a witch and casting a spell on his horse, and then asks her some questions, learning that she is his newly appointed governess.When Jane returns to Thornfeild Hall, she sees the dog she encountered earlier, and discovers that the stranger from the road is Mr. Rochester himself when he calls for her later that evening.Evening talks become a daily habit, and both characters fondness for each other grows...One night, Mr. Rochester returns home with group of friends he has invited to stay. There Jane meets Blanche Ingram, one of the many people who treat her as if she is a servant, whom everyone expects Mr. Rochester will marry, although she is only attracted to his money.That night, another guest, Mr. Mason, is badly injured, but Jane is not told how, only that she must care for his wounds in silence until the doctor arrives. Jane assumes this has to do with the strange and violent Grace Poole.During Jane's stay at Thornfeild, Jane witnesses a series of strange happenings, as well as a strange laugh she will hear periodically at night.

The whole plot and the literature is so descriptive and beautiful... I could not let it down. The author grasps you into the story, with the delightful romance and the plot elements here and there, it is put together very coherently. Everyone of Jane's decisions are vital to the progression of this novel. The excellent narration was one my favorite highlights in this novel.

I have read it quite a few times and I have enjoyed it each time. Actually Charlotte Bronte was being quite daring in creating this heroine. Jane was a new development in fiction during the time of the writing of this novel (1847). Jane was intelligent, passionate and totally unconventional. The other characters in this novel are just as memorable. Who can forget Rochester - broody, moody, and somewhat sinister? The plot of the book is exciting and it carries the reader along with a sense of urgency. This is an enduring novel that I continue to love and enjoy."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"A true classic. In this not so typical love story, the heroine, Jane Eyre is unlike any other. As opposed to the archetypal heroine, Jane is simple in both demeanor and appearance. She is a modest young woman who has been raised with much turmoil and tragedy, but despite this is able to deeply care for others. A deep and mysterious romance develops between Jane and Mr. Rochester, the man whom employs her as a governess. But will it last? Will a mystifying secret destroy their relationship and leave Jane with another emotional scar? This book is quite the page-turner, you will not be able to put it down for the anticipation of what comes next. Bronte evokes strong, intimate emotions within the reader that give hope and motivation to love in life to the fullest. The character of Jane proves that any one can be a heroine, no matter what your physical appearance or character, that any woman is capable of being loved and of vast romance.

The story tells the life of a young woman and how she gets through the troubles of work, a hard life, and heartbreaking relationship. Although boring and bare at times, Jane Eyre could be inspirational to the desires of love and romance in the early 1800's.Hard life starts at the age of 10 when she is orphaned and left to her critical aunt. Putting her faith in front of her, she tries to get through all the tough times. As she grew older, she becomes more knowing of her surroundings. Jane ends up falling in love with a man secretly still married. Jane finds out and runs away with no money and finds a family who can care and be her friend. In a twist, Jane, gets a big inheritance from her now passed away uncle. The man that she still loves comes back to find her after a tragedy of his family. They both have come to realize that they have both have found true love and would do anything to be with that other person. The two are married and have one child.The book Jane Eyre is the romantic novel that most women would dream for. It has the perfect fairy-tale ending in a true love that can never break. Jane worked hard and had a rough life and in the end it had paid off by being with the man that she had loved so much who loves her back. He had said, \\"I ask you to pass through life at my side, to be my second self and best earth companion.\\""},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I enjoyed reading this gothic novel. The story takes place in England, during the 19th century. Jane Eyre is orphaned at a young age. Raised in Lowood school, her only friend is Helen She is annoyed by the headmaster Brocklehurst. She is employed as a governess at an estate, where she falls in love with her employer, Rochester. This is a fine example of a coming of age novel."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This book is truly a classic. I read it for my A.P English class over the summer. It's just very long. There are too many dead points in the novel. The novel jumps back and forth between different thoughts and actually speaking often. It has a lot of good symbolism in it however. I reccomend reading wide sargasso sea afterwards for it is a novel from Bertha's point of view!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Review:Pride and Prejudice is a love story between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, an uptight man who has too much pride. Their first impressions gave a big start to this story that developed into the major conflicts and story line. My favorite chapter was the first one because it sets the tone for the story. It gives us the setting and the introduction to the characters. We really get to see how Mrs. Bennett is a really loud mother who all she lives for is for the search of husbands for her daughters. We know that Mrs. Bennett favors Jane, which is the eldest and most beautiful one of all. Then we start to understand Mr. Bennett's attitude towards his wife's plea and towards his defense toward his daughters. He isn't judge mental towards his daughters when it comes to men.I would recommend this book mostly to women/girls between the ages of 17-50, because this story deals with the trouble of what girls go through and it deals with five girls living in the household, which we can relate to. The daughters were not that old yet they were mature for their age. Teens will like it because we all go through these stages of male, and women can relate because of the maturity level that is in this story.One literary term that was used in the story was Analogy. It is used to describe two characters (Elizabeth and Darcy) that are alike by comparing them. In the story we can see their differences but along with it their similarities and common interest start to show.Overall I can say that I liked this book, Pride and Prejudice because it was an interesting story. Nowadays we read about homicide detectives and mysteries happening with murderer, but this story is nothing like this. Is builds its own suspense through characters personalities. It's based on feeling rather than action so we can all relate to this story psychologically. It captivates us in an imaginary world in the 18th century that sets us rules and regulations that were use back then. For example women were just suspected to marry wealth and make a family. They played no other role whatsoever, so since we don't live in that type of environment anymore, than we can just picture how life was back then and see what they went through, and their approach through these situations, to help us get through the book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte was our book club selection for this month.

We all know the story of Jane Eyre, and it is here in it's entirety. The issue I speak of is with the actual book itself, not the novel or story. I was looking for a book to start a library for my wife. Jane Eyre is one of her favorite pieces of fiction, but if we were to start a library that we could pass down, the book should be something worth passing down. The cover here caught my eye, simple enough. Utilizing the \\"Peek inside\\" feature for this specific edition, it notes that it has a cloth bound cover and illustrated interior front and rear pages. Upon receiving the book itself, the cover looks the same, but is not cloth bound and the illustrations are missing. The print is extra large with wide margins. This seems to be more of a textbook or school issue version of the novel than a collector's item. It makes me wonder if the book is misrepresented by Amazon by mistake or if the book itself has done so. If a collector's edition of this novel is what you are looking for, stay clear."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane was orphaned as a baby and thrust upon her widowed aunt, to raise alongside her own three children. Her aunt, resentful of Jane and distrustful of such a quiet and sad child, makes her life miserable. When Jane is ten and the opportunity for her to go away to boarding school arises, she jumps at the chance. Aside from not being constantly harassed by her aunt and cousins, things are not much better at school, at first. The teachers are strict, uniforms are painfully plain, food is scarce and sometimes inedible. However, Jane feels at peace with her life there, even staying on to teach when she is too old to be a student.When Jane is eighteen, her dear friend and former teacher leaves school to marry. Jane decides it is time for a change in her own life. She advertises herself out as a private tutor, and is soon hired to be the governess and teacher for young Adele, a little French girl under the guardianship of Mr. Rochester, who lives in a grand English manor.Mr. Rochester is moody; he is more often grouchy and irritable than pleasant. He insults Jane, and seems surprised and charmed when she returns his barbs without taking offense. Jane begins to dare to hope for a relationship to develop between them. But Mr. Rochester is a society man. He is wealthy, and he surrounds himself with other wealthy folks, including some very eligible young ladies who look down on Jane. Furthermore, Jane can't be certain Mr. Rochester is always truthful with her. Something very strange is going on at Mr. Rochester's manor, something certain to shock Jane.I liked the fact that the protagonists of this story are not beautiful people. Jane is small, thin and plain. Mr. Rochester is often described as ugly, and certainly fierce. It's nice to read a love story about people who are more normal than the usual cast of characters in a romance. I also liked Jane's resolve in staying true to herself. She is confident in who she is and even her love can't make her betray her morals. However, despite her decision to become independent, she still knows that Mr. Rochester has a claim on her heart, and she isn't ashamed of that fact.The weakness of this story is simply that of time and style. It was written in the 1800s, when writers had a tendency to focus on description and long dialog, sometimes at the expense of action. As a result, there are parts of this book that are tedious and require skimming in order to get to the good stuff."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Charlotte Bronte beautifully constructs each sentence in \\"Jane Eyre\\" with an exacting precision that is at once dated and elegant.While the story can be a bit overwrought in almost a parody like way--it hasn't aged especially well--all of that is a minor distraction to enjoying the exquisite craftsmanship with which Bronte writes.Bronte is as much an architect as a storyteller--every sentence and event ties to an often unexpected event or occurance later in the book. She doesn't just churn out prose in the assembly-line fashion of hacks Janet Evanovich or Stephen King. When you read Bronte, you understand what is meant by \\"classic.\\" She is the difference between junk food (Evanovich/King) and a gourmet meal.This isn't airplane reading and you won't breeze through it in days. It's the sort of book you savor for 20 or 30 pages and perhaps return to a week later.And if you are not a student who resents it as \\"required reading,\\" you'll truly thank yourself for voluntarily finishing a book of such style and class."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I found the beginning of this book interesting enough, but in my opinion it just went down from there. Unlike the other people who have reviewed this book, I believe that Jane Eyre could have been reduced to half its size. The plot was good, but it was a struggle to finally finish the book. I know, many who have read this might hate me, but I just found the it rather uninteresting. Or maybe I just can't appreciate good books, either one.

I decided to read it again before the movie comes out. Although I enjoyed it, I didn't enjoy it as much as I did as an idealistic, romantic teenager. I can understand why some students have said this book is boring, as they probably can't relate to it. Relationships today, at least in the US, are very different than in Bronte's days. I think readers need to read and understand this story in the context of the culture, mores, etc. of the 1800s.I am giving this only 4 stars, because Bronte is overly wordy in my opinion. She often wrote several paragraphs to say something that could have been written more succinctly in a few sentences.I think this book is more likely to appeal to girls and young women who enjoy romantic, gothic novels than to males."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I needed this book for a school project.

Jane's dignity is stricken away from herself when her cousin John causes her to be cast into the haunted red room, for he accused her of using \\"his\\" books and made her lose her temper.During her stay in the red room Jane sees the ghost of her uncle, she faints and attention of the house is drawn upon her.

She placed an ad in a paper for a job which is answered by Mr. Rochester. There she takes care of a French girl and falls head over heels on Mr. Rochester.This book hasn't been of any significance in my life. The first pages were dull and any excitement was sucked out of the pages. The overall quality of the writing was absolutely superb but the author didn't have enough life in the book. I only recommend this book to people who have a lot of spare time on their hands, or wish to give it to their children to read as punishment."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"The book Jane Eyre was only okay. In the beginning it was very hard to get in to. Nothing interesting really happened until later on in the book. It was also really boring in parts when she described things like the weather. She would go in to so much detail and drag it on forever. There would be pages of her describing one thing. In a way it can be good because you can really make a good picture in your head, but it can get really annoying and boring fast. As the book went on it did seem to pick up a little bit. There were very interesting things actually happening in the book. There were times where I did not want to set down the book. For instance, I liked how the main character, Jane, wasn't the rich, beautiful, popular girl. She was plain and simple. I liked this because it is different from most other books. It shows a life about a girl who, like most of us, does not get everything she wants. I really enjoyed that part of the story. I also enjoyed the part when she inherited a lot of money from her uncle. At the same time she learned about three new cousins of hers. Not even knowing them, she split her money. It showed how much she cared about family more than money. That was a good lesson in the book. In another part of the book there is something that goes along with that and that is when Mr. Rochester tells Jane about Adele and her mother. He took care of Adele even though he did not believe that she was even his. That showed some responsibility in Mr. Rochester. However there were a lot of things that happened in the book that I did not like. I did not like Mr. Rochester. He was a selfish liar. It seemed like he was always keeping a different secret and lying about it. He lied to Jane many times but yet they still get married. I thought that was ridiculous. At first I thought Jane was stronger than that, but this really showed how weak she was. She went back to him although he kept lying to her. I mean he had a wife who needed help locked up on the third floor. That seemed a little too crazy to fall in love with a guy who does that. I felt like she got married because she did not want to be so lonely and she did not really care what kind of person it was she did marry. Although, she did know that she did not want to marry Mr. St. John which was a good thing because I do not think that he wanted to marry her for the right reasons. After Jane told him that she did not want to marry him, he went right back to his religion and it did not really bother him. Overall, the book was not the best or anything. It had a couple parts I enjoyed. On the other hand, there were many parts that either bored me or annoyed me."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Beware when you buy this tape.

Charlotte Bronte has trouble explaining the setting of the scenes, for one. Normally, the average reader can comprehend what the setting is like just by reading a few well-written lines. But Bronte bores the reader by over-explaining the setting, as if we needed to know every single detail. Unfortunately, it is this lengthy prose that makes the story itself hard to read. Secondly, the characters are bland, which makes the difficulty even greater. Maybe with livelier characters this novel would be easier to read.

It is the story of a young orphan who is raised by her mean and unloving aunt who sends Jane away to Lowood boarding school at age ten. Lowood isn't the most loving place either. It is a charity school where all the students have lost at least one of their parents. This means that the conditions are far worse then other schools. These poor conditions result in a great erupion of typhoid within the school and many die at school or are sent home to die. Jane Eyre survives this however and stays at Lowood for eight years. She is a student there for six years, and a teacher for two. Then she decides that it is time to move on, and puts an ad in the paper for a job as a governess. Her ad is answered by Alice Fairfax. Alice Fairfax is the house keeper at Thornfeild and it is her job to also find a governess for the ward Adele. Thornfeild is owned by a man by the name of Edward Rochester. He offers money a job, a house, love, and everything else that money can buy to Jane, but it is still not enough for her. All through her life Jane has craved loving family and she is determined to find her relatives.After Jane learns the terrible secret of the attic she decides that she must find her way on her own. She leaves Thornfeild and travels by foot, and by carriage. She is turned into a beggar because she leaves many of her belongings in the parcel that she carlessly left on the carriage. When she is at the point of almost dying she is found on the door step of Moor house, where St. John brings her in and his sisters Mary and Diana help bring her back to good health. St. John gets her a job and a little cottage to live in. There Jane is almost as happy as she could be, but still something is missing. Will Jane ever find this one last element to make her life perfect?"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I first read Jane Eyre when I was 9 at the recommendation of my 4th grade teacher. After that, I would always say that it was my favorite book. At 25, I looked back and wondered if I had really understood the book at age nine. So I reread it, and realized how deeply I had understood. The character of Jane had seeped into my subconcious as a role model against whom I unwittingly checked myself. She is level-headed, but not rigid. She falls into things, but is conscious while falling. She is neither a namby-pamby nor a Polyanna. She stands up for herself, while still respecting others. On top of all of that, she is very real. Her mental journey is recognizable to me, more so the older I get. The book is also swooningly romantic at times. Mr. Rochester is wonderful and arrogant, and vunerable, and grouchy. The conversations they have are beautiful, and fully engaging. This book will live inside me until the end of my days, and I'm so grateful."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"When I first read Jane Eyre in high school, my initial reaction was one of ennui. I thought the book was a little slow with a heroine in serious need of some self-esteem lessons. However, after I finished it, I found myself wanting to read it again, and again, and again! Now, I am thoroughly addicted. I probably read the book at least once a year. After the second reading, the reader learns to appreciate the beautiful language and wonderful plot devises that make for a ripping good story. I now understand Jane and Rochester in accordance with their societal upbringings and their ability to overcome the social barriers between them. Jane is a strong and gentle heroine, unlike our blow-'em-up heroines of the 90's. I recommend this book to anyone who realizes that you don't have to be rude and aggresive to be a strong person. One more comment. My only qualm with this book is the aggrivating character of St. John Rivers. No matter how many times I read Jane Eyre, I can't bring myself to like his puritan presence. Oh, well, I guess its too late to mention the criticism to Charlotte!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Let me first note that I am still in high school but I didn't read this as an assignment. So far in the past couple of years I have had to have read numerous boks in a modern day point of view and I have just become so sick of all of these stereotypical plots. Girl finds boy, they fall in love, save the day, the end.But when i read this book I was so awakened, so jarred into the brutality of reality that I was fascinated by Ms.Bronte's writing and frank honesty of everything.It was disturbing, witty, insightful, and overall captivating. Nothing ese really compares to this classic. I was sometimes lost at points and was forced to look back. It was philosophical and even though it didn't have much elegance, it was charming. It showed loss, failure, a world without love. Jane Erye is like nothing I've ever read before.I know several people criticized the way Bronte took away all love from Jane's world. But to me it just made everything so much more worthwhile; whenever Jane got the slightest shred of kindness i truly felt it considering all of the hardships he went through.His review cannot do the justice that i wish i could explain but the book was just so amazing i cant put them into words. Please take my word for it and read this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I'm not sure what made me - at 37 - decide to read Jane Eyre. It's obviously been around my whole life. And it seems like the type of book I should have been forced to read -- if not in high school then surely in college. But I'm so glad I finally got around to it.Jane thoroughly frustrated me throughout the book and I actually found myself yelling at the book in much the same way I yell at the Buffalo Bills whenever they do something stupid (every game they play). I also found myself hoping for certain outcomes which is funny considering the ending was written oh so long ago.Jane Eyre is a love story. But more than that, its a story of perseverance, and dedication to principles.About half way through, I convinced my 15-year-old daughter that she had to read it -- just so I would have someone to talk to about it ... and because I knew she'd love it like I do."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Some spoilers are inevitable below, if you don't already know the basic plot.As part of a new series of Goodreads challenges, it was required of me to read Jane Eyre, and I wasn't too thrilled. I've started it before and never penetrated too far. But it was in exchange for the other person watching half of Firefly (it's a shared challenge - two of us read a book apiece in exchange for all the episodes), so ... I will do a great deal for Mal Reynolds, I said.I have a paperback, somewhere, but wound up reading it via literature.org for some reason - where, I should warn, there are a great many typos, and a startling use of all caps where I believe the original uses italics. It's odd to see Mr. Rochester exclaim in the manner of a web post.I was surprised at how very much I enjoyed this. The language has proven a barrier in the couple of times I've started it in the past - no patience for it, or something. But this time having to read it out of Browncoat devotion combined with the right mood and receptivity, and I clicked with it. The sense of humor of Jane and therefore of Charlotte Bront was a wonderful surprise; there was a snark and sarcasm and a touch of simple silliness which for some reason I never suspected in either Bront or book. My prejudgment of the book was purely as a girl's dark and Gothic \\"tale of woe\\", built with archaic language - and that is a big part of it, yes. (After all, Helen at fourteen is given lines like \\"she gives me my meed liberally\\" and \\"collecting all she says with assiduity\\", which simply leaves me wondering if children actually did speak this way in 1847, and my goodness has civilization degenerated if they did). But it's also fun, especially when Jane converses with Mr. Rochester.\\"Am I hideous, Jane?\\"\\"Very, sir: you always were, you know.\\"\\"St. John dresses well. He is a handsome man: tall, fair, with blue eyes, and a Grecian profile.\\"(Aside.) \\"Damn him!\\"--Jane as a child: Poor little precocious wretch. She's obviously much smarter and sharper and more thoughtful (in terms of giving thought to things more than solicitous; she is that, but not overwhelmingly so) than everyone around her - never an easy situation even for someone with a sweet disposition. Jane does not have a sweet disposition. This is undoubtedly due in part to how she's been treated all her life by the Reeds, but she fights fire with fire, no question. She's mad as hell and not going to take it anymore.And that's kind of a surprise. I haven't read so very much 19th century literature, but I have some familiarity with the stuff - and in my limited experience there weren't very many pre-Jane heroines like Jane. I'm thinking of course of Little Nell, the sweet and uncomplaining little orphan of The Old Curiosity Shop, who may or may not be the archetype, and also the much put-upon Fanny Price.Jane Eyre ain't no Little Nell. In fact what just struck me is that she is, in many ways, identical to the pre-Hogwarts Harry Potter. (Someone somewhere has to have done a study of orphans in young adult literature, a comprehensive list and investigation into why they're so prevalent. I can think of half a dozen immediately - Jane, Harry, Anne, Heidi, Oliver Twist and David Copperfield - and Pip. Seven. And then there are all the poor motherless ones, who are probably double in number.) Jane doesn't blow up her aunt, but she does attack her cousin. Her presence was resented, only tolerated out of duty to the dead, and she was ill-treated by everyone in the house to one degree or another, particularly by her male cousin. School came as a surprising solace - at least I was surprised, because again the impression I had formed was a terrible one, all Snape and no Gryffindor. And it actually wasn't. Even at its worst it was well-intentioned and there were positives; once it received reforming attention it improved drastically.It is in some ways so very much a product of its time, with its solid Christianity and its xenophobia (\\"a sound English education corrected in a great measure her French defects\\") - but Jane is a creature of the book's future. Mr. Rochester was incorrect: Jane was not a fairy. She was a time traveler. (Now I want to write that version. Never mind Jane Slayr, this is better.) She is independent, or wants very badly to be, and she is strong in ways women are not expected nor really desired to be in 1847. She has wings, and wants to spread them; the horizon line is too confining for her. And somehow it feels very modern that she is uncertain of her footing when people are kind to her, that she is in some ways more comfortable with rudeness, and can stand up for herself quite well in its face.At this remove, without a lot of research, I don't know if the Gothic themes in this book would have been something its contemporary audience would have been familiar with; my impression is that they would. The \\"madwoman in the attic\\" was apparently a time-worn plot device even then. In a way it was more fun reading it with a fair idea of the ending - even though I've never read it before I knew much of the plot. Even knowing the spoilers, it had some deliciously creepy moments, and Jane never succumbed to the usual behaviors of the swoon-prone Gothic heroine. She acquitted herself quite well."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I'd give the book itself 4 or 5 stars, the 3 star rating is because this Kindle version is a little flawed.'Jane' is sometimes spelled 'Janet' which is a little annoying, but not that bad.One thing I'm unsure of is whether or not this version is incomplete on place names... I kept seeing -shire and things like that, but sometimes the name of the town was complete. Since this is the only version of Jane Eyre I've ever read, I don't know if that's an error or if Bronte intended it that way. ???The book itself I'm glad to have read. It is a good story. I think some of the negative reviews by readers who didn't like it are influenced by the fact this book was written over 150 years ago. Writing styles have changed drastically, as have social norms. I got used to Bronte's way of speaking and it flowed better after that. Glad Kindle has the built in dictionary too. There are just a few passages of dialogue in French that you might want to translate, there are plenty of free translators online that would probably do well enough. I personally think it's possible to pass over them without knowing their meaning; they aren't crucial to the story. As far as the social themes, some of Jane's dilemmas wouldn't have been dilemmas in today's society but I suppose they were huge issues in the time period of the story so you have to think of them that way and think about how someone dealing with her set of circumstances then would handle it, not how you or someone in today's society would.Bronte was quite the author. Very descriptive, great use of analogy, etc. And in this day and age it's nothing for a female as a child or a woman to stand up for herself, speak her mind, and wish to be an equal, but I kept reminding myself this book was written in England in the mid 1800s... it must have been revolutionary at the time. Jane would be considered somewhat feisty by today's standards."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This was my first Charlotte Bronte novel, and I want to read it again and again! A beautiful mixture of darkness and light, I could not take my eyes away from the page. A great story, full of faith, perseverance, and independence...with a dose of human weakness. Very suspenseful, entertaining and intriguing."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This is my first time reading any classic (im 33yrs old). I was always afraid that I would not be able to understand the language of the time well enough to enjoy the story..WAS I SORELY WRONG! I am a beginner reader and I did just fine after the first 30 pages. This was such a dark read that I do not recommend it for everyone but I enjoy dark, gothic love stories. I also love Mr. Rochesters way of drawing out Jane from her own self imprisonment of her spirit. I suggest everyone to read this atleast once and then see the new movie out! I just saw the movie today and it was the best yet!! Mia played the part of Jane SOOO WELL!! I was just mad that they left the gypsy scene out,,that was my favorite in the book.I must warn however that this particular copy of the book has extremelly small and strange print which was okay for my eyes but I can see older people having an issue."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is utterly incredible. The expression \\"page-turner\\" usually isn't associated with Victorian literature, but Charlotte Bronte created just that when she penned this masterpiece. With a fast-paced plot and a couple jaw-dropping surprises, Jane Eyre is a fascinating read. I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys literature of the very highest quality."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Every middle to high school student should read Jane Eyre because it is easy to relate to. It tells the story of a young girl who is mistreated as a child.She wants to go to school so her Aunt sends her to a boarding school. The boarding school develops a serious disease that takes on an important role in her life. I enjoyed it because it is a book where you just can't put it down. It was really interesting. I was able to understand it because of the extrordinary details that Charlotte Bronte included in the story.The story of Jane Eyre is about adapting to new places and conflict between characters. The story starts when Jane is living at her Aunts house because her Uncle died. Then she goes to school. Her Aunt only cares about her three children. The only person Jane likes at her Aunts house is the maid. When Jane grows up she moves to a lot of places.The characters in this book are very different than many people. When Jane is young her Aunt mentally abuses her. That is because she has to live with her Aunt. When her Uncle died she felt betrayed so now she wants revenge. She wants to go to school so her Aunt sends her to an awful boarding school.The setting takes place in many different areas. The main place that the story of Jane Eyre takes place in is England. I think that is cool because I live in the U.S. I also think it is cool because I don't know that much about England. In the story it seems like Jane just can't settle down in one place.Overall I thought that this book was interesting because it is based on a true story. It was easy to get a good picture because of the great details. It is easy for middle school students to read Jane Eyre because many don't realize that someone's life can be so horrible and change into a life that everyone wants.I recommend that you read this book because it is a book about overcoming challenges."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Not intended for the melancholy, this classic literature is full of hope, full of love that you rarely find in writings those days. Jane Eyre, a plain and poor girl, a cast out among her known rich relatives, tried to make her way in this world when she advertised for governess position and received a call from Thornfield Hall. In this place, she was presented with a very agreeable student and company, Mr. Edward F. Rochester. The courting game began slowly but surely towards Jane who was still a naive girl of eighteen. Together they overcame their differences such in age and had planned to be married soon. But a terrible secret broke out and Jane fled from the Hall, leaving her crushed love behind. In her sanctuary, she found another kind of suitor in the form of a cousin, St. John Rivers. She loved him as a brother and she thought the feeling is mutual until a proposal came and the true character of St John revealed but still with power to control her resolution, in the name of his holy purpose. Right at that moment, a supernatural thing happen (which I guarantee will cause your hair stand on end) that called her back to the beloved Thornfield Hall and its master. I don't think this event was out of place. In fact, it served as the last, elegant seal on the round up.A profound love story with two unlikely characters. No beauty beyond compare and no handsome prince 'beauty is in the eye of the beholder'. Through this tale, Ms Bronte also conveyed her opinion and principle about love, marriage, physical display, conceited faith, gender equality and sound educated mind, especially of women.Her style in expressing the main characters' personality and principal was a thorough exploration of the mind and heart without too much side comments which often sidetracked a narrative. Expressive dialogs and vivid description were her main strengths that I like most. Though it is still consistent with the writing style of its era, it will reward satisfactorily every modern reader who faithfully peruses its chapters."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre has been my favorite since I first read it way back in middle school, the 6th grade I believe. I loved it then and I continue to love it. Jane is a remarkable heroine, she is not beautiful or charming, she is quite and bookish. She goes from a smart abused child to a smart stronge young woman. She has hope and bravery when she has no reason to believe in happy endings and that is why I love her. I do love her, for being to my mind one of the strongest female characters written and she does it all without batting her eyes. Not even once. This book may be listed as a romance, but it is also a mystery and a drama. I would highly recommended it for character building."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Many are familiar with the story of the orphaned Jane Eyre. If they haven't read Charlote Bronte's story, they may have seen one of several film versions (my personal favorite being the pairing of Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles). Nonetheless, this classic Gothic tale holds such an important place in the annals of literature that if no introduction is necessary it more than merits revisiting. The audio book edition produced by Penguin Classics and read by Joanna David offers just that opportunity. It's a chance to be introduced to an unforgettable tale or to see the familiar in a new light through the estimable voice performance given by Ms. David.David, an accomplished actress, has experience in the classics - she appeared in a televised version of Pride and Prejudice and played the young Mrs. de Winter in the BBC adaptation of Rebecca. She carries listeners through Jane's resignation, incredulity, dismay, and happiness with an assured, insightful performance.Quite briefly, we meet Jane when she is living with a wealthy but unkind aunt. After being locked in a room where her uncle died, Jane is sent away to a charity boarding school. Regrettably, her lot is not improved as the school's headmaster is a cruel, selfish man who deprives the students while providing luxuries for his own family. When, at last, he is replaced, Jane days are happier and she even remains at the school to teach.Following that, she takes a position as governess at Thornfield Manor where she meets the love of her life, Mr. Rochester. When, to her amazement, he proposes, she happily accepts. Her joy is short lived as she discovers that he is already married, to a mad woman kept locked on the third floor of Thornfield Manor. Distraught and miserable, Jane runs away.After suffering all forms of deprivation, Jane is taken in by a kind family and finds work at a school. Then, almost unbelievably she comes into a small fortune left to her by an Uncle. She also receives another marriage proposal, but knows that there is only one man that she truly loves. Few will forget the sound of Mr. Rochester's voice calling to Jane over the moors.This audio edition of Jane Eyre offers an extraordinary listening experience - don't miss it!- Gail Cooke"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"We had to choose between 5 novels in my english 10 honors class and I choose this one. I definitley advise you to read this book, but only if you're up for a challenge. This is a great novel a great story of a woman fighting her way into society and finding out that she must only marry for one reason pure and simple love. I would recommend this novel for age 14+ I dont think others younger than this age would most likley enjoy it. I personally loved this story at parts the book does drage on with Bronte's many many descriptions. The plot though is one very well planned and thought out and the last 9 or 10 chapters you race through. If you can get through a few dry parts you will enjoy a truly gem of a book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I absolutely love this romantic classic. Although it is something that I might be asked to read in an English class, this is my favorite book ever and I have read it many times.

This is how she ends up at Thornsfield Hall, employed by Mr. Rochester, a man who is old enough to be Jane's father. Despite this fact, Jabe slowly falls in love with him.

Really, though, once you get into it you are in for a treat. The book is an emotional rollacoaster, and though it was written more than a hundred and fifty years ago (I think) it still heldgreat resonance for me; I too could identify with Jane Eyre's dilema over the cerbral duty prescribed by her mind and the emotinal neccessity calling out from her heart. The chemistry between her and Rochester blows away anything you'd see on the cinema screen, and the passages where they are together practically set the pages on fire. I guess it's down to the readers temperment in the end, wether or not they emaphise, and the style is nuanced and therefore could be thought overly wordy ocaissionally, but if you like reading this is such a good book to try. Some people say it's the best novel ever written in english; I'd be inclined to believe them."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"\\"The truest love that ever heart felt at it's kindled core, did through each vein in quickened start, the tide of being pour. Her coming was my hope each day, her parting was my pain; The chance that did her steps delay was ice in every vein. I dreamed it would be nameless bliss, As I loved,loved to be: and to this object did I press as blind as eagerly. But wide as pathless was the space that lay our lives between, and dangerous as the foamy race of ocean surges green. And haunted as a robber-path through wilderness or wood; For might and right, and woa and wrath, between our spirits stood.Well that's all that I can remember of the little song Rochester sang to Jane. I realy love the book. I cried when Helen Burns died, and I cried when Thornfield was a ruin, and I Laughed at how [bad] Wuthering Heights [is]! I even made started puting CBJE on my notebook. Which stands fo Charlotte Bronte Jane Eyre. I totaly recomend it, but you will cry trust me."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"It's hard to imagine a better gothic romance than \\"Jane Eyre\\" -- gloomy vast houses, mysterious secrets, and a brooding haunted man with a dark past.In fact, Charlotte Bronte's classic novel has pretty much everything going for it -- beautiful settings, a passionate romance tempered by iron-clad morals, and a heroine whose poverty and lack of beauty only let her brains and courage shine brighter. And it's all wrapped in the misty, haunting atmosphere of a true gothic story -- madwoman in the attic and all.Jane Eyre was an orphan, abused and neglected first by relatives, then by a boarding school run by a tyrannical, hypocritical minister. But Jane refuses to let anyone shove her down -- even when her saintly best friend dies from the wretched conditions.But many years later, Jane moves on by applying to Thornfield Hall for a governess position, and gets the job. She soon becomes the teacher and friend to the sprightly French girl Adele, but is struck by the dark, almost haunted feeling of her new home.Then she runs into a rather surly horseman -- who turns out to be her employer, Mr. Rochester, a cynical, embittered man who spends little time at Thornfield. They are slowly drawn together into a powerful love, despite their different social stations -- and Rochester's apparent attentions to a shallow, snotty aristocrat who wants his wealth and status.But strange things are happening at Thornfield -- stabbings, fires, and mysterious laughter. Jane and Rochester finally confess their feelings to each other, but their wedding is interrupted when Rochester's dark past comes to light. Jane flees into the arms of long-lost family members, and is offered a new life -- but her love for Rochester is not so easily forgotten...\\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of those books that transcends the labels of genre. Charlotte Bronte spun a haunting gothic romance around her semi-autobiographical heroine and Byronic anti-hero, filling it with brilliant writing and solid plot. It has everything all the other gothic romances of the time had... but Bronte gave it depth and intensity without resorting to melodrama.Bronte wrote in the usual stately prose of the time, but it has a sensual, lush quality, even in the dank early chapters at Lowood. At Thornfield, the book acquires an overhanging atmosphere of foreboding, until the clouds clear near the end. And she wove some tough questions into Jane's perspective -- that of a woman's independence and strength in a man's world, of extreme religion, and of the clash between morals and passion.And Bronte also avoided any tinges of drippy sentimentality (Mrs. Reed dies still spewing venom) while injecting some hauntingly nightmarish moments (\\"She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart\\"). She even manages to include some funny stuff, such as Rochester disguising himself as an old gypsy woman.The story does slow down after the abortive wedding, when Jane flees Thornfield and briefly considers marrying a repressed clergyman who wants to go die preaching in India. It's rather boring to hear the self-consciously saintly St. John prattling about himself, instead of Rochester's barbed wit. But when Jane departs again, the plot speeds up into a nice, mellow little finale.Bronte did a brilliant job of bringing her heroine to life -- as a defiant little girl who is condemned for being \\"passionate,\\" as an independent young lady, and as a woman torn between love and principle. Jane's strong personality and wits overwhelm the basic fact that she's not unusually pretty. And Rochester is a brilliantly sexy Byronic anti-hero with a prickly, mercurial wit.Of Charlotte Bronte's few novels, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is undoubtedly the most brilliant -- passionate, dark and hauntingly eerie. Definitely a must-read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This is the book that hooked me on reading! It has everything that I enjoy reading about: strong female characters, mysterious and preternatural occurrences, secret romances, and indelible love."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre whisks you away to a world of thoughtful detail and slowly evolving love. Although at times the journey is excruciatingly slow, Bronte makes up for that with her strong-willed heroine, Jane.Jane is not your average heroine. At first glance she is a quiet, boring, and tractable girl, but underneath lays an increasingly strong, virtuous, and independent young woman. After years of knowing only a quiet obedience and a passive submission, Jane finally discovers her true nature when she stands up to the Reeds and demands release from their cruel care. In another display of personal strength, through an effort of pure will and a moral code that allows no compromise, Jane gives up security and a life time of happiness and leaves Mr. Rochester to embark on an uncertain path which promises hardship and grief. Jane's moral integrity along with her steadfast and courageous character is what made this story famous. Jane reveals these qualities again and again in the unfolding story, which makes her more and more admirable. She foregoes marriage to St. John and honorable service as a missionary to stick to her beliefs. Also, Jane does not conform to the expectations of the time. Jane is not content to be used once and then forgotten. Originally, Jane was dependent on Mr. Rochester, playing the traditional subordinate female role. However, in the end when they are finally together forever, Mr. Rochester becomes dependent on Jane, and that is just how she likes it. She wants to play an active and vital role in her husband's life. Bronte did an excellent job creating an admirable character in Jane Eyre.When Jane arrives at Thornfield, serving as a poor and lowly governess, she immediately falls in love with her wealthy master. Bronte enriches the reader's experience of their love with long passages describing Jane's conflicting emotions. Such endearing moments add credibility to the author's claims about Jane's strength of character. As their relationship unfolds, tantalizing hints and subtle foreshadowing grip the audience in suspense and hope that perhaps Mr. Rochester loves Jane too. For instance, Mr. Rochester says, \\"'Goodnight my --\\", and Bronte adds, \\"He stopped, bit his lip, and abruptly left me\\". Although cheesy, such moments are effective in holding the reader's attention.Despite the novel's many charms and merits, at times I found myself wanting to rip my hair out at its agonizingly slow pace. My annoyance and impatience were magnified towards the story's end when Jane joins the River's household. Perhaps Bronte slows the story down purposely to contrast the speed and excitement of Jane and Rochester's relationship to its opposite in Jane and St. John's plodding relationship. Whatever the reason, the story takes a downward plunge as soon as Jane steps inside River's door.I also had a problem with the ending. Bronte concludes by quoting St. John's letter, \\"Amen; even so, come, Lord Jesus!\\" This is Jane's book, possibly Mr. Rochester's, but never St. John's! The last words are hardly relevant to the story. Sure, faith in God is a reoccurring theme, but hardly last word material. Bronte made a mistake; she should have either ended with Jane or Mr. Rochester saying something about love. Isn't love what this whole story is about!?Still, the good outweighs the bad in Jane Eyre, and I highly recommend it. Anyone who craves a dark love story between two very unlikely characters and possesses enormous patience should pick this book up immediately!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"...after 160+ years.THE STORY:I read Jane Eyre every 3-4 years because its truly the grading curve for so many writers of the genre. There are times even now when I read the book and I'll say to myself, \\"I LOVE this book!\\"When you think of the date in which it was written in and the author's limited worldly experience and resources, you can't help but appreciate her sharp wit and thoughtful insight into each character. In addition to that, Bront has a way of transporting you into Thornfield's dark eerie halls alongside Jane. It's truly a remarkable story!THE BARNES AND NOBLES CLASSICS EDITION:As for this particular edition, for quite some time I had been encouraging a friend to read Jane Eyre. The compact size was perfect for her to carry around in her bag for long grocery store lines, commuter rides, etc. She finished all 608 pages in one day because she loved it! It also has a great introduction filled with historical and bibliographical information on Ms. Bront to truly transport the reader into the mind and time of Jane Eyre.**If you simply want more Mr. Rochester and Jane after reading this, I suggest seeing the 1983 Timothy Dalton/Zelah Clarke made for TV version by the BBC. Out of all versions (and I've seen all) it is the TRUEST adaptation of Bronte's work and doesn't dumb down her beautiful prose (what the author is most famous for) with modern day slang, nor does it take liberties with Bronte's Mr. Rochester and Jane Eyre to bring them down to Hollywood's standards.

Amanda Root's telling of the story does not sound like someone reading from a book, but rather like someone living a life. I highly recommend this audio book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Charlotte Bronte's \\"Jane Eyre\\" is one of the best literary works I have ever had the pleasure of reading. It has the ability to keep you riveted, unable to put it down. Jane bears an uncanny resemblance to modern day women in that she is independent and strong willed. I had never even heard of this book before attending college and I almost feel cheated. This book does an excellent job of pointing out the many peaks and valleys one will have in their life. The author was able to use her own first-hand knowledge of having suffered through loss in her work.Early in the story we see that Jane has a thirst for knowledge as she finds solace in various books. As an adult she uses her own education to help her become a teacher. She also comes to know love not once but twice. First with Edward Rochester, whom she eventually leaves due to his deceitful ways only to return to later, and second with St. John Rivers who is a missionary on his way to India. Jane doesn't stay with St. John because she believes him to be looking towards her more as a possible missionary than as a wife.I eagerly recommend this book to anyone. It is a masterpiece of literary artwork and lengthy as well. I believe that the young women of today could benefit greatly from reading this book for it will teach them how to stand up for themselves and what they believe in. In my opinion, \\"Jane Eyre\\" is a must read!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"The novel chronicles the tragic life of a young girl named Jane Eyre.

She, then, becomes a governess to a young french girl at Thornfield Hall. Mr. Rochester, the owner of Thornfield, and Jane fall deeply in love, but there are many obsticles in their path to happiness. It is truely a dark romance.I especially liked the books wide variety of genres. This book has everything you could ask for and more. Jane is a character everyone can related to and Rochester is dark and mysterious. Charlotte Bront is truely a genius."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"If you aren't sure you want to read Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte, I have three words for you: READ IT, NOW!!! I'm not sure about the rest of the reviewers, but this book has changed my life. It is a little boring during the first few chapters, but don't get discouraged, it gets so good, you can't put it down. I read it during school, and I cryed when the bell rang! It was so riveting! There are some tough words, so I would keep a dictionary handy. This is definately a book every teenage girl should have on her bookshelf!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I read this book at 11, and recently (several years later) i read it again. I thoroughly enjoyed it - the romance, the excitement, the sadness...The French isn't hard to understand regardless of how well you speak the language yourself because on the whole the context explains it. So don't let that put you off!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"The book is about a girl, Jane Eyre, had a tragic childhood. Her childhood was dull and without anyone loved her, but she still lived bravely and did everything without regard. This was a romance novel which was written by Charlotte Bronte.At the beginning, Jane Eyre parents were dead. She lived with her aunt. Her aunt hated Jane Eyre very much. She broke her promise to her husband to bring Jane up as her own daughter. However, she was sent to Lowood School, study French Drawing and Music for 8 years. Luckily, she met a good friend called Helen to share her happiness and sadness in school since both of them were an orphan girl. Helen was then died of fever. The experience in school made she more mature, sweet and brave. After that, she found a job in thomfield hall to be a governess of a girl under 14year old. Then, she fall in love with the girl&iexcl;s father, the master Rochester. Although many twists between them before they had married, they were still end up happily.The book is a very famous love story. I like this book because the contradiction between two main characters, Jane and Rochester. It&iexcl;s different from others romance novel. It contains a lot of twist such as they loved each other but they were both afraid to tell their feeling to each other. It&iexcl;s because Rochester had a secret and Jane also had some misunderstanding to Rochester. Therefore, many love barriers between them. Besides, after Jane left Rochester. Jane still had many testes of true love. I dislike it only because the book contained many descriptions on background scene such as the background environment when Rochester requested Jane to be his wife. The background environment was a lightening shocking a big tree.I highly recommend this book to the readers above 12 years old. It&iexcl;s because some young readers may not interest in this romance novel. Although the book contains 207 pages, I am pleased to read every page seriously. It is a wonderful story. I highly recommend it to you!!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Words simply can't express how much I love this book. I have Three different copies of the book, I own all of the movie versions that I could find of it (Four, as of now). To say that I am a fan is a huge understatement.Jane is such a great character, a survivor in every sense of the word. She loves her man, but he doesn't own her, no no! She's her own woman, and she makes sure that he knows it. One of my favorite scenes of the book is when Edward is trying to force gifts on Jane, and she gets increasingly annoyed about it. He sees that she is upset and tries to sweet talk her, but she brushes him off completely. You go girl.The emotions in this story are gut wrenching, especially the scene after the botched wedding ceremony. I feel for Jane and understand her despair, but I weep openly for Edward. All he has ever wanted in life is to find someone he can love who will love him back, and just when he finds her she's ripped away. Oh, my! I'm getting teary-eyed just thinking about it!READ THIS BOOK!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is a timeless work that, once investigated outside of your high school english class, has the power to pull you into a world defined by social classes and the acts humans will perform for love.As you enter the world of Jane you realize that love and strength are intertwined deeply. You become aware that love is never simple and only the strong will survive. I will only go into the briefest details because to give anything away would be to steal a very meaningful experiance from the reader.The first time I read this novel I didn't really see the depth of the piece. You follow a young woman striking out into the world working a lower class job for an upper class family. As the governess at Thornfield Hall Jane becomes entangled with Mr. Rochester's dark secrets, and she also begins to find her heart intangled with his in a way that would disrupt the social order of the time. Yet, as you progress through this story you understand every choice Jane must make, even ones that seem so difficult and painful.Yes, at times it's melodramatic and very dark. Once you place yourself in Jane, a very plain young woman who lives a very hard life, you will find yourself searching within the passages and dissapearing into the English countryside.I love to loose myself with in these passages time and time again. I want to have the strength of Jane - this book has truly effected me and I recomend it to anyone."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I am a 12 year old girl who reads classic books.

It was not at all what I expected from an old English novel writen in 1847. I now see why it has been around so long. It is not stuffy and wieghted down with endless babble about manners as most English novels are. It moves along at a speed that keeps you enthralled. Jane Eyre is in a class by inself and has everything you could want in a novel: mystery, intrigue, romance, action, and endless, strong, intelligent drama. Jane Eyre captures your heart. You root for her happeness and truely believe she deserves true love. Revolutionary and richly imagined, Jane Eyre is at least a century ahead of its time; an ultimately triuphant work of genius. Enormous in scope, and vastly entertaining, it is one of the best love stories ever told."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Struggle, survival, compassion and romance: these eternal elements will make this novel an enduring presence. Ms. Bronte must have been quite courageous to write about a free spirited woman like Jane Eyre in Victorian Era. Even though there are so many memorable scenes in this book, what stands out most is the romance between Jane and Edward. The pathos underlying this romance reminds me of the desperate love that Hunchback of Notre Dam professed towards Esmeralda. The lyrical beauty of Bronte's English enhances the appeal of this timeless piece of artwork."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"JANE EYRE WAS A BOOK OF WONDERFUL DESCRIPTION.

Jane Eyre is an eloquently written, surprising, and captivating novel. The beauty of this tale is sometimes overlooked because of the time period from which it hails. However, one must not allow the restrains of the time period in which this novel was written restrict one from reading it. For, not only does Jane defy the roles set for her by the society of her time, but this novel, written under a pseudonym by Charlotte Bronte defies the rules of a novel for its time.The novel is revolutionary in its own singularly, and by what is captured on its pages.This is a must-read for anyone.

Jane not only shows the reader her beliefs on female independence through her actions, but also through her thoughts. Jane desires to see more of the world and have more interaction with its people. While she appreciates her simple life at Thornfield, she regrets that she does not have the means to travel. She relates her feelings to all women, not just those of her class. Jane is disadvantaged in many ways as she has no wealth, family, social position or beauty. Jane does have intelligence though.

Even though it's a \\"classic\\" it's not intimidating like, say, Moby Dick. It has a perfect balance of everything - tragedy without melodrama, a wicked family without the modern day drug/alcohol problems, romance without mushiness, and a happy ending without sappy triteness. If you really (for some weird reason) can't get into it, rent the movie. Then read the book - you'll truly appreciate its greatness...."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Not that bad is truely an understatement. This novel is a classic, all respects to the word. I, a man, find this book to be one of my favorites.The book is strong in creativity, contains a remarkable flow from word to word, and has a grand notion of human emotion. What gives this book these qualities? READ IT!!! The three qualities revolve with each other. Creating a self powering novel that easily controls the moments of you emotion through the revealing of the plot to the audience with superb timing.Only one problem, a little too ironic at times, don't ya think.My small speal isn't even close to giving the novel any justice.&quot;It was near: and as I had lifted no petition to Heaven to avert it--as I had neither joined my hands, nor bent my knees, nor moved my lips--it came: in full heavy swing the torrent poured over me. The whole consciousness of my life lorn, my love lost, my hope quenched, my faith death-struck, swayed full and mighty above me in one sullen mass. That bitter hour cannot be described: in truth, &quot;the waters came into my soul; I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters; the floods overflowed me.&quot;I primarily choose this because of its connectiveness to the traits mentioned prior and because it won't ruin the book. Maybe this will be the first thing you read before reading the rest of the book. Or atleast I hope so."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This is what I call a wonderful novel.

The language is beautifully woven, showing the character's feelings and giving way to shocking occurrances. The tale is not quite original but it does strike the heart--showing society at the time while weaving the tale--the plots just grasp you harder and harder within each chapter--like glue, if you don't try to get out of it, you can't get out--carefully developing the plot with questions, the language, and subtle events that makes the book--not quite original--but giving it a place of its own in the romance genre, getting better and better every time. It is really quite the satisfying experience. Personally, I--not being a picky person--don't have a problem with the printing.

Although the language may not be modern the topics that Charlotte Bronte discusses are very relevant. What really surprises me is that so many people feel so threatened by such an \\"old\\" book. Why is the theme that you have to follow your own heart rather than the dictates of society so confrontational a subject to some people? It has nothing to do with either sex or gender, just a very human desire for freedom. Maybe some of the book's critics should wait a few years and re-read it when it isn't a required reading. It really is a wonderful book if you approach it with an open mind."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is an excellent book. It is a novel that i couldn't put down.

The book itself is one that cannot be put down in pure fear that while you are not reading a tradegy will befall our Jane. The majestry of the characters that Charlotte Bronte offers us is near perfection. With this it is also good to see a refreshing and different perspective of the upper class and its ways during this time period.

Just like Conrad's opinion on forgetting novels, I truly don't fear that I will forget the factual details of Jane Eyre, because it has become a part of me, and it will stay with me forever"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Prior to tackling this work, I had only read one romance novel that I have every liked - Gone with the Wind. Reading Charlotte Bronte's &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; did not change that statistic. While I can acknowledge the worth and eloquence of this novel, I cannot say that I enjoyed it in the least. It took a determined effort for me to read it through, and I was quite relieved to reach the end.From my experience, I have yet to meet any male who has enjoyed this book, and have yet to meet a female that didn't adore it. I don't know what it is about the books by the Bronte sisters and Austen, but for some reason, the gender gap seems a mile wide.For what it is, I am sure it is a great book worthy of the praise it has received."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"It was still well written and CB is good at keeping her readers interested in the characters and the plotting of the story. The ending was rather a bit too predictable for me and after investing two sleepless nights into this book, I was extreamly disappointed in the ending of this story. It is also a romance novel. I am not a great fan of romance novles without a complicated and intensely created plot so this element of the book did not appeal to me at all. I should've read this book as a young adult, as this is the audience the book is geared to. I would've enjoyed it more then. But if you are a fan of romance novels with many trials and tribulations of course thrown in, this is an elegant tale for you.Now in assessing the art of this book. When I first looked through this book and read it I was not happy, though not disappointed in the artwork. After reading this book and looking at the artwork of other versions of this story, I was a little miffed. The artwork is mostly of Jane Eyre, and none of the artwork really captured her features and personality at all. This cast a darkned element over the book and almost \\"forced\\" a victorian viewpoint of this story. I think the artwork of other versions are much better by comparrison."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Of all classic female authors (Jane Austin, Mary Shelly, for instance), and of all classic novels with a female protagonist, I find Charlotte Bronte as the most brilliant, and Jane Eyre to be the most memorable. I first read this book when i was a freshman in highschool, and loved it. Now I'm reading it as an upcoming college freshman. I not only still love it as I did then, but I'm deeply moved. I'm touched by how I personally connect with Jane Eyre, who not only has the wit, intelligence, honesty, and flourishing independence that constitutes the spirit of many female characters, like that from Jane Austin, but who stands the test of time as more than just a witty, intelligent female. Jane Eyre is a woman, a woman that all can relate to. Also, I love how the novel itself was written. Charlotte Bronte weaves in all the elements of a good story--suspense, passion, mystery, gothicism-- while entwining emotions like love, hate, death, regret, sadness, rebirth, and forgiveness. This is more than just a gothic novel, more than just a novel with a statement about Victorian society. It's a novel with heart, courage, and a journey that never ends in the heart, mind, and spirit. This is what real literature is all about."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love nineteenth century British literature as much as anyone. This book, however, is mediocre at best. The symbolism is blatant and contrived to the point of being distracting. In fact, the whole story is extremely contrived, even for a romance. Neither are Charlotte's characters endearing enough to make the novel worthwhile. Jane, Rochester, and Adele are all a bit annoying rather than charming or good or even evil. And I have no idea why this novel would be considered Gothic, the only thing that qualifies that idea is all the ridiculous magic that's going on. Actually, the second half of the novel reads more like an Austen husband hunt with a little bit of weirdness thrown in.The Lowood section is redeeming, however. The description smacks of Dickens, chiding the English for their treatment of the helpless. The characters of the Brocklehursts are beautifully rendered hypocrites.Emily's Wuthering Heights is by far the better read if you're after a Bronte. All of her characters have depth so that even the villains become loved. Wuthering Heights is also fairly contrived and full of obvious symbolism, but unlike Jane Eyre, the mechanics of the story add to it rather than distracting from it. Above all, the pathos and darkness are delightful, especially coming from a nineteenth century British woman. Charlotte herself wrote in the preface to WH that she didn't understand why Emily had to write something so dark. My opinion is that Charlotte could have used a little bit of that darkness herself. Read WH if you want something really complex to savor; JE just makes a good beach read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"It seems to me Bronte's schooling of her own mind rather than the schooling depicted in the book (which are the same thing) depend more or less likely on your inclination to the subject of respect.The willingness to let go all sanity and resume mental thought at a moment's whim is the virtue displayed here.Like most books of this type, not much thought is given to plot or to the romance of being in a plot as much as to the figures at play here, right and wrong, moral and honest, truth and lie-sayer. I would probably say this is the best way for a young girl to grow up, having written a work like this. This is more a study in her life than in the life of a person blessed with any gifts. Growing up modest has taught her something: that she made modesty.The gift of the unique insight of creation in each and every line is apparent and is a unique challenge to the reader to contemplate the meaning of suffering she has placed into every line."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Looking for a classic romance novel? Jane Eyre is the book for you. Jane Eyre follows the life of a \\"plain Jane\\" and goes through the hardships and successes that she does. The author, Charlotte Bronte, wrote the novel from Jane's perspective so the reader can get and insight into Jane's mind and truly feel the emotions that Jane is feeling. At points of conflict, the reader will often find themselves hoping and wanting Jane to make a certain decision. Jane's life does not start out easy and so the reader immediately gains pity and empathy for Jane. It is the classic story of whether a girl should follow her head or her heart. Bronte writes in beautiful, eloquent language that paints a very clear picture for the reader. There are points in the novel where it is just the constant flow of Jane's thoughts, but that adds to the immense character development. As the reader gets to know Jane, they are able to relate to her because she is painted to be a very plain, yet strong-willed, young woman. The mark of Jane's passion comes from the beginning when she is talking to her aunt and says, \\"I am glad you are no relation of mine. I will never call you aunt again as long as I live. I will never come to visit you when I am grown up; and if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with miserable cruelty.\\" From this point on, the reader can see that even though Jane wants to be a \\"good child,\\" she has a more rebellious streak in her. Jane Eyre is a good read for someone who likes very good character development and has patience to get through much detail. I personally did not like the ending very much because it seemed to contradict the main idea of the rest of the novel, but other than that, I found myself engaged and interested in Jane's life and her decisions."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is a novel that follows a woman from the Victorian times in which she struggles to find her true identity and what really brings her happiness. Starting off as an orphan adopted by her aunt who despises her, she works her way up to become a governess. Through her struggle of finding independence in a society where women are looked down upon, she meets Mr. Rochester and hopelessly falls in love with him. Torn between finding independent happiness and romantic happiness, Jane indulges in a self journey fighting between what her heart desires and what her mind wants. Rochester is a man with much power and in a way intimidates Jane with his status but little did Jane know he was hiding a dark secret from her.\\"Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags. It is thoughtless to condemn them, or laugh at them, if they seek to do more or learn more than custom has pronounced necessary for their sex.\\"Not only is this a dramatic romance novel, but it is also a very eye opening novel in which Jane discovers that women should not confine to the expectations society has provided for them, but instead has a whole world to them for them to explore and obtain."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"\\"Jane Eyre\\" by Charlotte Bronte is a classic gothic romance story. Its intense, thrilling, and disturbinging details are told from the autobiographical standpoint of the narrator, Jane Eyre. A definite feminist novel, Bronte created an untraditional character who defies the expectations society has of her. Jane is no Disney character; Bronte's heroine is not blessed with beauty nor money, but she is a fiercely independent character with remarkably complex emotions.The novel begins with Jane Eyre, as an orphaned child, living at Gateshead with her Aunt Reed. From the very beginning, readers understand that Jane does not and will not have an easy life. Bullied and suppressed by her aunt and cousins, Jane is an outsider. She is sent to the Red Room as punishment one day by her Aunt Reed. In defiance, even at a young age, Jane exclaims to Mrs. Reed, \\" I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I love you; but I declare I do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except John Reed.\\" Appalled by her outburst and fueld by her hatred for Jane, Mrs. Reed a decides to sent Jane to Lowood School, an institution for orphaned girls. After years at Lowood, a glimmer of hope appears later when she becomes a governess at Thornfield, home of a certain Mr. Rochester. Since the story is told from the memory of Jane, the reader is given a first-hand impression of the heighted emotional state of Jane and troubles she suffers through.At Thornfield, Jane becomes governess for a little French girl, Adele, and soon becomes entrapped in a spiral of emotions when confronted my Mr. Rochester. It is clear that Jane is the subordinate and Mr. Rochester is the master, but one cannot help but root for their romance and love to endure. Bronte's story of dark gothic elements, insanity, and dark lingering secrets make up this tragic romance story. Bronte draws attention to the cultural assumption of the Victorian woman's role and the relations between a man and women in the 19th century. Her novel calls for women's equality and equal treatment.The characters are very thoroughly developed. From the point of view of Jane, as a reader, we learn every bit of detail about Jane: her plainness, her loyalty, and unwavering independence. When confronted, Jane demands, \\"'Do you think I can stay and become nothing to you? do you think I am an automaton? - a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup? Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless? you think wrong! - I have as much soul as you - and full as much hart! And if God had gifted me with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you.'\\" Such an exclamation defied the stereotypes of a subdued and quiet lady.Interweaved throughout her novel, Bronte obviously develops the major theme of female independence and strength. However, Bronte also employs several motifs, one being the constant appearance of wings and birds. At the very beginning of the novel, Jane reads Bewick's History of British Birds which wrote of \\"the solitary rocks and promontories by them [the sea-fowl[ only inhabited,\\" symbolizing the independence of birds and the ability to fly away that she wished she had. Then at Thornfield, Jane describes a party of guests as \\"a flock of white plumy birds.\\" Upon seeing the ladies and gentlemen at Thornfield, Jane is even more aware of her dependence of others and the lowly status she has claims to. Still, she admires the freedom the guests have to come and go and indulge in frivolous activities. Even Rochester tells Jane to \\"be still; don't struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is rending its own plumage in its desperation.\\" Each instance, Jane is struggling to find her freedom, her own independence.Jane Eyre is a tantalizing novel deserves to be read. Be prepared for a complex and nuanced plot. Written in true Victorian style, Bronte writes in long, elegant sentences that sometimes takes a few reads to truly understand. The plot she weaves is enrapturing, leaving reader on the edge of his or her seat, just waiting to read what happens next. However, Bronte takes her time developing her plot and ends up writing a three-hundred page book that could have easily fit into one hundred, but perhaps the Victorian readers of her generation had the time to sit down and read longer novels. Don't hesitate to purchase this book, it's a story you won't regret reading!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"In this gripping novel, Charlotte Bronte tells the story of a fiery young governess who finds love in an unlikely place. Through the use of descriptive and flowery language, Bronte successfully writes a prize winning book with extremely well-developed characters, a dramatic plot, and thought-provoking themes. Jane, the protagonist, is a young orphan living with her cold-hearted and widowed aunt, Sarah Reed. She is taken to Lowood School, where, among severe circumstances, she manages to find a friend called Helen Burns. Later, Jane decides to be a governess so she travels to Thornfield to work for the tall, brooding, and menacing Mr. Rochester. This book is considered to be one of the first feminist books because of Jane's unconventional personality and sense of independence. Jane, although physically plain, surprises and wins the heart of both the reader, and Mr. Rochester through her witty dialogue and frankness. Mr. Rochester maintains the reader's interest with his passionate and strong personality that often shows a soft side when it comes to love. It is most entertaining to read their playful and clever back and forth, as well as to see their fondness for each other grow. The characters in this novel are delightfully well-developed. Bronte does a thorough job of giving all characters life, including the minor characters like Mrs. Fairfax and Miss Temple. She uses foils to really differentiate between characters and to emphasize specific traits that are important, for example, Mr. Rochester and St. John are foils, contrasting St. John's \\"handsome Grecian features\\" yet cold personality with Mr. Rochester's unhandsome looks and passionate and emotional personality. The title, even though it may not catch the reader's attention, really reflects how Jane thinks of herself as just plain Jane. So don't be fooled by the simple title and long-winded sentences. Jane Eyre will certainly be a surprising, and delightful read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is the quintessential feminist novel. Jane is faced with and ultimately opposes her traditional role as a woman in the 1800's as she is subordinate to her love interest, Mr. Rochester. Beforehand, Jane endures a tough childhood as an orphan living with her deceased uncle's family at Gateshead. She is sent away to an \\"orphan school\\", Lowood, and eventually works as a governess at Thornfield. That is where she meets Rochester, and soon learns of a dark secret that threatens their budding romance. Later on, Jane rejects the love that she feels for Rochester, and leaves Thornfield. She faces trouble and is rescued by a second love interest, St. John. A multitude of events ensue, and this novel closes with an unorthodox, but fitting end.Jane is not the typical female character, as she is outspoken and quite independent. She does not allow herself to be pushed around, which is evident through the incident in which she physically fights with her cousin, John at Gateshead. Jane is confronted with themes of gender roles, social class, love, etc.Rochester is Jane's superior, and their romantic relationship almost replicates their professional relationship. Since he is of wealthy status, and Jane is not, they aren't on equal ground and she is portrayed as his subordinate. This is evident when Rochester refers to Jane as \\"my little friend\\" among other monikers.St. John is a foil to Rochester in every sense. He is a morally upright individual, who is devoutly religious and appeals to Jane as a cold person overall. This is in stark contrast to Rochester, whom Jane views as warm and has \\"flaming\\" eyes.In my opinion, the plot was excellent, but was a bit drawn-out. Jane's journey is full of riveting twists, but the build-up was a bit long, and the intricate language of the novel left me uninterested at times. However, regarding the major events and Victorian/Gothic elements, the language/rising action was appropriate, just not as appealing from a modern perspective. The ending was unorthodox, although I did somewhat expect it. Nevertheless, Jane's words reassure that in the end, Jane is not a subordinate, but an equal. She states \\"we are precisely suited in character--perfect concord is the result\\" which lets go of all of their societal/gender role burdens, and assures that they were meant for each other because of their match in personality/character. There are a multitude of themes present in this novel that require an approach from a wholly different perspective. For example, one cannot understand the importance of the character Jane Eyre within literary history, without considering the fact that she was the first strong/independent female protagonist. This novel, overall, is timeless and is a suitable example of feminist ideals."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I received the book in a timely matter and book was in great shape and very clean.

I just caution people who love good love stories to stick with it if they find it slow."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"** spoiler alert ** After my extreme disappointment with Shirley, I returned to Jane Eyre, which I first read as a 'tween and from time to time afterwards would dip back into the romantic bits no St. John!) to finally read it again cover-to-cover. In this novel, Bronte writes like a pro, opening the story with a conflict that immediately engages her readers' interest in Jane and quickly follows up with another that firmly cements that affection. When the evil Rev. Brocklehurst asks Jane what she must do to avoid the eternal torture of hell, she replies, \\"I must keep in good health, and not die,\\" and her immortality as a literary character is secured. One strength of this novel is the first-person narration with everything seen through Jane's eyes. Although we know her to be a passionate individual, she is also absolutely trustworthy,and the generous and smart woman she becomes plays no games in telling her tale in simple, straightforward narration. We burn with indignation at Aunt Reed and Rev. Brocklehurst, grieve over Helen, share her growing affection for Sophie and Mrs. Fairfax, and rejoice in her discovery that in Rochester she has at last found someone who is her intellectual and emotional equal, the first true friend since leaving Lowood School. In short, in the first two-thirds of Jane Eyre, Bronte's work is close to a masterpiece. However, her story goes off the rails in the St. John Rivers section, the part of the book that many readers dislike and the section most film adaptions do their best to diminish or eliminate. In earlier readings, Jane's decision to flee Thornfield with a few shillings and a small bundle of clothes made perfect sense, and her subsequent discovery that the Rivers siblings were actually family -- her first cousins -- adequate explanation for her decision to share equally with them the fortune left to Jane by their uncle in Madeira. But on this reading I saw how unnecessary, how unJane-like, her flight actually is. Jane has already learned from her Aunt Reed that her uncle intends to leave her his fortune, and it is that uncle who sends his solicitor to crash her wedding and prevent her bogus marriage to Rochester. The solicitor explains exactly that before leaving Thornfield. Above all else, Jane Eyre is smart and capable, smart enough to recognize that her uncle's solicitor will provide her with necessary support and capable enough to get herself to London to receive it. However, a few hours later, Bronte sends Jane rushing across the moors in a coach heading god knows where, a destination that will be determined by how far her meager money can pay for transport. Is this the young woman who ably advertised for a post when she wanted a new life? Is this the young woman who traveled to her aunt's deathbed and remained long enough to help her hateful cousins settle their affairs following their mother's death? Absolutely not. While Jane's flight makes sense, her decision to flee blindly to parts unknown is ludicrous, given everything else we know about her. And so the results of that flight -- her fortuitous discovery of her cousins and the jousting with priggish St. John over his desire to have her join him in his missionary work as his wife -- are ludicrous as well. No wonder readers recoil from that section of the book. Having written Jane out of character and into a tight corner with Rivers, Bronte comes to her rescue with a hokey gimmick -- the sound of Rochester's voice calling her name across the vast moors that divide them. Jane's dear readers are certainly happy that she has found a loving family and secured an income that provides independence. And they're happy that Rochester has proven himself a man of honor in sacrificing his vision and his hand in attempting to save his mad wife from the burning battlements of Thornfield Hall. So they forgive Bronte the flaws of the St. John Rivers section of the novel, glossing over it as quickly as possible to arrive at Jane's well-deserved happy ending. But while not fatal, the flaws are serious enough to prevent Jane Eyre from being a true masterpiece."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I just finished reading this for the first time.

Jane Eyre is one of many phenomenal books that will cling to your memory long after you have completed them.Now, in full disclosure, I read this, partly because I was never forced to in college; and partially because I wanted to write a piece of bizarro fiction that was centered around Ms. Eyre (one that does not involve zombies or vampires). But I found myself drawn into the novel and captivated by the storytelling. Even as a man, I found myself empathizing with Eyre, feeling the mud as it clung to my clothes in that desperate moment of dangerous hope and determined self-reliance.

So, that night I ran to the store and bought the book. The book was ten times more vivid and wonderfully told than the movie (as was expected). I was delighted to revist the characters that I had briefly been introduced to through the movie. C.B. tells the tale wonderfully through the life of Jane. Her trials become your trials. Her love becomes your love. It was very intense and riveting.

Then being forced to endure the harshness of her employer, Mr. Rochester.I pitied Mr. Rochester because he was &quot;stuck&quot; with a mad woman he locked on the top floor with Mrs. Pool. In a sense, it was sort of like a living death. As long as she remained alive, he could not remarry or have a family. I loved it when Orson Wells played this role because his large, brilliant, black eyes really showed his torment in the film. Joan Fontaine as Jane Eyre was no slouch either. Her blank stare after ten years at the Lowell school was great. I really felt their emotions in the book too, especially after Jane Eyre's friend at Lowell died of pneumonia and when her wedding ceremony was cancelled after discovering Mr. Rochester was already married.The tense part in the book and film was when Mr. Rochester's bed was set ablaze by his wife. I don't know how a man could let his mentally ill wife remain under the same roof with a child and so many lit candles to be knocked over but Mr. Rochster did it. I mean, the man must be as daft as his wife.I thought this book was a thrilling read because both of the main characters over came their problems. Yes there were consequences, but they were temporary. I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I found Jane Eyre to be a delightful read and a book that can be read again and again. It is the story of a young orphan girl who struggles to find her place in society. The story begins with Jane as child living with her aunt and cousins. Jane is a spirited girl and is disliked by all, especially her aunt, who constantly belittles her, despite the fact that Jane's cousins are horrific. Jane's only friend is the maid, who gives her comfort from time to time.Finally it gets to the point where Jane fights back and her aunt chooses to send her to boarding school. Lowood is a place of discipline and seriousness. The girls are educated in harsh conditions. It is here that Jane makes her first friend and learns much from her. After many years at school, Jane decides she wants to work and make money. There are not many options for a woman of her time who desires a career, but she lands a job as a governess for a young, French girl. Jane enjoys teaching and looking after her, but she also longs for something more in life.After being there for some time, Jane finally meets Mr. Rochester, the master of the house, who spends little time there. He is a short, rather ugly man and Jane piques his interest as a girl with intelligence. After numerous encounters, they profess their mutual affection and plan on getting married. Although Jane loves him, she cannot ignore their obvious class difference.On the day of their wedding it is revealed that Rochester is already married to Bertha; a crazy Jamaican woman living on the top floor of the house. Jane is shocked and decides she cannot marry Rochester despite his pleas. She packs up her things and runs away.Jane spends time homeless and starving until strangers take her in. St. John is a missionary who is later revealed as Jane's cousin. The death of Jane's uncle leaves her with a fortune, turning her into a financially independent woman. Despite the fact that he's her cousin, St. John asks Jane to marry him and accompany him to India to do missionary work. What does Jane decide? Read the book and find out!Jane Eyre is novel filled with passion and symbolism. Fire appears time and time again, symbolizing the heat that exists in Jane's life. I found Jane to be a strong and admirable woman, though there are times when her sensibility gets a bit annoying. Rochester is a little odd as well, but together I find them charming. This story is unique because the heroine is a plain, poor girl who triumphs over class barriers, which is why she is so likable. She is not a beauty queen who is swept off into the horizon by prince charming. Altogether, a passionate story of courage and triumph."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre has been hailed by many to be the original romance novel and after reading it, I am inclined to agree.Jane is an abused, forgotten child who is sent away to a boarding school after standing up for herself against her cruel cousins and unjust aunt.

She teaches the child in his care, Adele.Through the story, she and Rochester face many dilemmas in their search for true love. A true love that is right in front of their noses.If you like romance novels or if you just want to rediscover your hope for love, I recommend this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This book is one of my favourite books ever! I must have read it about a thousand times and I'm still not fed up of it. For those of you who are under the impression that this is a boring, dried up dull book, you could not be more wrong. I have never read a book so rich, so passionate and so moving. The love of Jane and Mr.Rochester is wonderfully depicted by Charlotte Bronte into true love's deepest and richest form. Her language is vivid, descriptive and romantic, and the dialogue (especially between the two protagonists)is poetic and eloquent. This is a book for all tastes, and the characters are so well portayed that they come alive in the imagination and stay there. I actually found myself crying towards the end. And Jane, though she appears meek and mild, is actually resolute and fiery and follows her religious principles dutifully to the extent of losing her only happiness. She is, in short, possessed of a strength and fortitude both reamrkable and admirable. As for Mr.Rochester,he is an archetypal Byronic hero: dark,enigmatic,cynical,sardonic and sternly attractive, suffering from some mysterious sorrow which renders him aloof and forbidding and forms the basis for the 'secret of the attic. This book has everything: romance, tragedy, intrigue and humour and is a classic in the true sense of the word."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"In the novel Jane Eyre, Bronte wants the reader to perceive the main character, Jane Eyre, as an independent young woman trying to make her way through life by herself. Jane is even given a line &quot;I do not think, sir you have the right to command me, merely because you are older than I...&quot;(139) to help understand her independent way of thinking. Bronte tries to give and describe Jane through feminist characteristics. Throughout the novel, however, Bronte uses a literary motif of birds. In this motif everytime Jane is compared to a bird it is a bird such as a turtle dove which can be compared as weak and delicate to that of a raven which is how the main male character is described. This novel is an enjoyable one and I would recommend it to anyone who reads only for pleasure purposes. If you try to find a deeper meaning in this novel you may get confused on how the author really wants the reader to portray the main characters."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This book is a classic, loved by many, and may be just the book for you.

The same things you hear about Wuthering Heights (which is a superb read as well...more - flowery, perhaps). I got a copy from my English teacher one day thinking I'd read it that night and give it back to her the next day. Well, it took me almost a year to get around to it, but then it sucked me in. It was a long time ago since a book did that. I, myself, am quite a plain person with a passionate spirit. Jane is a person who knows WHO she is, WHO she wants to be and WHO she can't. That is this struggle. She can give in to her passion, give into her dreams, but then they will slip from her grasp because everything that makes her the most beautiful person you've ever seen on the INSIDE would be tainted; Jane's simple purity and athletic mind would be no more. So: Give in and Regret or Die and Keep Living?I love Mr. Rochester. I see him as the male version of Jane; he can see who people are without looking into their looks to find it. St. John was a handsome man, but what pleasure did Jane take in his features? Perhaps he was prudent, but he was not wise. Anyway! Rochester. He is a brave, valliant man, willing to go all measures to give Jane what he feels himself. In his own words, \\"Little Jane's love would have been my best reward. Without it, my heart is broken.\\"Try and understand this book, and then feel that which our society lacks.One last word from a mouth that runs freely and...with INTELLIGENCE: \\"It is hard work to control the workings of inclination, and turn the bent of nature: but that it may be done, I know from experience. God has given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and when our energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get - when our will strains after a path we may not follow - we need neither starve from inanition, nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to taste - and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if rougher than it.\\" (From 'Jane Eyre')This book is TRULY one of the best."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Charlotte Bront's Jane Eyre is a true and timeless piece of English literature. Bront's story of the life and love of a young woman is definitely a worthwhile read. Although not without its defects, Bront's message of true love and self-discovery come across loud and clear.Jane Eyre is a story about love and its effects on a plain and simple woman. Jane, the narrator as well as the main character, tells the reader of her childhood years spent at an orphanage, her position as governess at Thornfield Hall, and her love for the master of Thornfield Hall, Mr. Edward Rochester. Throughout the novel, the reader recognizes the changes love has created in Jane's character. One remarkable change is the fact that Jane forgives her heartless aunt for past cruelty and selfishness. \\"\`Love me, then, or hate me, as you will,' I said at last, \`you have my full and free forgiveness'\\" (242). Love has matured Jane from a misfit orphan to a woman who has the strength to forgive. This change is just one example of Bront's insight into love and the human psyche. Through Jane, Bront explains how true love matures and strengthens people. Yet Bront does not paint an ideal picture of love, and instead shows Jane's misery and torment. \\"Gentle reader, may you never feel what I then felt! May your eyes never shed such stormy, scalding, heart-wrung tears as poured from mine. May you never appeal to Heaven in prayers so hopeless and so agonized as in that hour left my lips: for never may you, like me, dread to be the instrument of evil to what you wholly love\\" (324). Jane's misery is an important aspect, because it dismisses the myth that love is a fairy tale. Jane, as well as the reader, realizes that to love someone, is to experience agony, joy, and a range of high and low emotions. This roller coaster experience of being in love nurtures Jane's growth and maturity.Bront's characterization and insight into the human mind are beautifully written, but her language tends to be too verbose and detailed. Sometimes, Bront's lines seem to be pure poetry, for example when Jane is gazing on Mr. Rochester. \\"I could not keep their lids under control: they would rise and the iris would fix on him [Mr. Rochester]. I looked, and had an acute pleasure in looking, - a precious, yet poignant pleasure; pure gold, with a steely point of agony: a pleasure like what the thirst-perishing man might feel who knows the well to which he has crept is poisoned, yet stoops and drinks divine draughts nevertheless\\" (176). Yet at other times, Bront repeats herself over and over again, drawing out what has already been said. For example, for more than ten pages, Bront describes Jane's refusal of an unwelcome marriage proposal. A simple \\"no\\" was not sufficient for Bront. The novel could have been shorter if Bront had chosen to edit certain sections of the book. Many of her sentences are run-on and complex. There are well-written pieces of poetry in the novel, but there is also a line between verbose and poetic; Charlotte Bront is hovering above that line. I think for the audience that it was written for - 19th century - the poetics and language are perfectly acceptable. Yet for today's audience that is used to instant gratification, the book might be tedious.My overall opinion of this novel is mixed. I love Bront's underlying message of true love and self-realization. Yet, the language she uses is both poetic and over-the-top. Either people will love it or hate it. Personally, I liked Jane Eyre despite its defects. It is a novel about how love makes you realize who you are and who you want to be; how loving someone is difficult and heart wrenching, but unforgettable and eye opening. Jane Eyre is one classic that I will read over and over again for its universal and timeless messages of true love and self-discovery."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"We read this book last year in my English class and it was one of the best books I've ever read. I loved it's mix of love, mystery, misfortune, blandness, and phychological struggles. There is much to learn from this book in the ways we see Jane grow and learn to love Rochester. We see all the different kinds of people; for example, Helen; the religious one, Jane; the rebel, Bertha; the insane wife who is a foil of Jane and many other suncharacters in this book. It is an absolutely brilliant book and it's worth the time."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is just a great book... full of color and depth. It's story not for society as a whole, but for each unique individual that reads it. The coincidences that many complain about were superb to me, because in everyone's life, especially mine, strange things happen everyday that wouldn't seem &quot;normal&quot; or may appear coincidental. What I think is most prevalent about the story are the internal changes that occur in the lives of Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester; they're the only two characters in the book that are changed and humbled by the experiences that they went through for the sake of love. When first read, Jane and the reader are nearly &quot;tricked&quot; into thinking that this book would be another tale of &quot;true love&quot; triumping over an evil society, crossing the boundaries of wealth and caste. Such a theme is as unoriginal as &quot;love at first sight.&quot; Yet, we should already know from many other books that society will not change for the individual, and the author does a great job in showing that individuals (with the aid of God) can change for each other, something completely different than the other theme. In the end we find that society has nothing to do with internal battles that Jane and Edward faced; the development of their love had little to do with external circumstances. All in all, this book is a must read, not just because of the romance (but that part was very interesting and moving!), but for the passion and the wisdom that the author is able to bestow on the reader."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"You have to read this book.Why?

Not just women who make good eye candy. But really plain and poor and unexceptional women, as well.\\"Jane Eyre\\" also says a heck of a lot about how women -- not all women but many -- most want to be loved.

The characters seem to come alive off the page, especially the heroine, Jane Eyre, who seems to have a very twenty first century frame of mind. While the plot line is fairly hard to believe, the thoughts of the heroine is what makes this piece of work a true literary masterpiece. She deals with the perils facing her with an open mind, and is willing to stand up for her beliefs and morals even in a time when this wasn't acceptable for a woman. She's a true role model for all young girls and women, and a real figure of the ages.I would recommend this book to anyone, but you have to have an appreciation for good, in depth description and old-fashioned style of writing. You also must have patience, because this is a fairly long book with many twists and turns, and there were definite times in this book that I didn't think anything good could come of it!! You must also have faith in the writer, because I was afraid for a while when I was reading that it would end horribly.I have heard many negative things about this story, but I truly don't agree with any of them. Jane Eyre, Edward Rochester, Mr. St. John, they are all fabulously written, almost as though this story was written about actual people instead of fictional. I loved this book and will read it many more times."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Adrienne Zillmann September 12, 2000My Opinion of JaneEyreWritten in a time when women had no rights, and were not allowed to hold any serious jobs, Charlotte Bronte's novel Jane Eyre is a porthole traveling back through history. Charlotte Bronte was a sort of maverick herself, assuming a man's name in order to have her works published. Jane Eyre provides a witty, masterfully written story of a governess trying to overcome the hardships of lower-class life, and her difficult rise to nobility. It's an enjoyable story for all audiences. Bronte's plot renders many twists, provides worthy role models for all ages and genders, and presents a romantic conclusion that is heart-warming enough to make any reader smile. Though she sometimes went off track, Charlotte Bronte eventually leads young Jane along the right path of destiny by using a series of random events to guide her in the right direction. There are two ways of looking at the fluke events that befall Jane throughout the book. Some people might say that Bronte overdoes her use of uncanny coincidences when Jane happens to meet her future employer, Mr. Rochester, on the road, and his horse falls as he is passing Jane. However, the truth is, the world is a small place. Coincidences such as this happen all of the time in every day life, and much of the time, they pass unnoticed. Another such example is when Jane is looking for a job and she happens to stay with St. John and his sisters. She later finds out that they are none other than her very own cousins, and she had thought she had no relatives. This event could be thought of as unrealistic, but many people may enjoy these sly little detours from the plot and Bronte's use of destiny. This quality enhances the book tremendously by making it a far more unique, fascinating, and pleasing book to read. Another positive attribute about Jane Eyre is the happy ending. All too often, things do not turn out the way people want them to in their lives. The novel's joyful solution is a refreshing change to readers who wish their own lives worked out so perfectly. How could the story get any better? Jane, the poor, rejected orphan, finds a man so in love with her that he will forsake his own fortune and reputation to marry one of his own servants. Mr. Rochester, the eccentric, moody man he is, finds a wife so well suited to him, who returns a love so strong, that she marries a blind and crippled husband. The fact that Jane Eyre had a romantic and heart-warming ending will really secure one's opinion on the book. After all, most people do not enjoy books with unhappy or unfinished ends. They leave readers hanging and feeling unsatisfied. Jane Eyre is just the opposite. Its conclusion wraps up the story beautifully and leaves the reader feeling fulfilled. It makes one happy to know that true love does conquer all. Probably the most important virtue of Bronte's whole book is the main character, Jane Eyre. If there had to be only one reason why people should read the book, this would be it. Jane has so many admirable qualities, and her own actions teach the reader many valuable lessons on life and good morals. She provides the perfect role model for readers of any age or sex when she demonstrates such qualities as self-discipline, strength, dignity, humbleness, and faith. She illustrates these traits constantly in the book, but one section that is a particularly good example of her wonderful character is when she leaves Rochester. At this point in the story, Jane has already found out that Rochester is a married man. She knows she can not stay with him because she can not love a married man. That would make her his mistress. She loves him more than words can say, and no matter how painful it is, she decides to sneak away in the middle of the night. By making the choice to abandon her own emotions and do what is morally right, Jane is demonstrating her own self-discipline and strength all at once. Then, when she leaves, taking only what she was wearing, she is retaining her dignity. She wants to show Mr. Rochester that she is strong, and she does not need anything he gave her to lean on or use as a crutch. She is an independent woman who has dignity, but she is also not too proud. She is humble when times demand so. One instance is when she is hungry, and has to go begging for food. It is an embarrassing task to take on, but Jane does it even though she realizes it will affect her own reputation. Lastly, Jane constantly has faith. She not only has religion, but a real faith in herself. When she is sick and living with St. John and his sisters, it is her faith and will to survive that keep her alive. She is definitely a praiseworthy character and an exemplary role model for any reader. As one can see by these bounteous compliments on the book, any reader will enjoy Jane Eyre, and it is earnestly recommended to someone who is looking for a good book to read. It is an enjoyable novel with a good ending, and the book Jane Eyre truly illustrates model human beings that anybody can look up to and learn from."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Before it was fashionable or even acceptable to be an intelligent women in command of herself, Charlotte Bronte created Jane Eyre, a heroine unsurpassed in courage, dignity, wisdom and self-containment. Bronte didn't resort to stereotypes of the day by creating a beautiful but wan heroine with giddy, sensual, flirtatious or fickle allure, but rather a woman who earns the reader's respect with her naive and quiet candor, her wit and constancy. Even her plainness, mediocre physical appearance and lack of skill become endearing as Jane is created to be real.However, though I respected Jane, the tale was so sluggish in the beginning that I almost stopped reading. Most characters were dull or too unlikable, and the storyline, though of interest to me, was blandly written. It was the entrance of the tempermental and ugly Rochester that sparked my attention. The dynamics and chemistry between Jane and Rochester are the best I've experienced between two characters in a novel. Their relationship was far deeper than most romances written in the novels of Jane Austen or Georg Elliot, as Bronte explores the characters' thoughts and feelings more than she does their economic dilemmas.Having read this novel innumerous times, I count it amongst the most satisfying and engaging of the stories I've known. Not only do I collect hardcover copies of it, I also own every movie made from the book (5 to date, I believe). It isn't necessarily a flawless novel, but it is passionate, haunting and stirring in its very imperfection."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre is one of the classics of 19th century English literature. It is not possible to judge the book by to-day's literary standards: books must be judged in their own time and social setting. The language is, at times, tedious, and the plot absurd - with impossible coincidences, but, to English reader of the mid 19th century, these were accepted and demanded. The characters are well drawn and the atmosphere is vivid. Miss Eyre is a strong character who proves that the good and honest will prevail in God's good time. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to gain a better appreciation of the evolution of literature."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I also had to read this book for school, during summer. I can respect the fact that it was a classic but it just was not a book that I enjoyed. It had many unneeded parts and tended to repeat itself. It was especially boring when Jane landed at Moor House. If you are a hopeless romantic then go for it, but I prefer exciting books. The other book I had to read was Lord of the Flies and I liked it much better. So....there^^;"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre may be enjoyed by older adults (with a bigger vocabulary, I should add), but I had to read this sophomore year and absolutely hated it. This book is very hard to read, and I wouldn't recommend it to any young readers who doesn't have a teacher to help explain. Although it may be a classic, it is one tough book!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"There isn't much to say about this book. Other that I had a group assignment a few months ago to read this, and then present it to our fellow peers. Lets see, how can I put this into words? Well, it was pretty self torturing. Page after page was about fifty billion paragraphs of Charlotte Bronte describing a landscape or the \\"confusing\\" emotions that Miss. Eyre was having towards her boss. Although, it must have been tough writing a book which displays a woman of independence and such, Ms. Bronte is a decent writer... the book would have just been more enjoyable if there was splashes of complete randomness.As for myself, I really do not plan on reading this book, ever again. Unless some Iraqi solider is torturing me with an ablazed iron rod and screaming at me to tell him about the great collections of Charlotte Bronte and her infamous book, \\"Jane Eyre\\"."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Pride and Prejudice is a classic novel from the 19th century. It is by far one of the best books I have ever read.The conflict that Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy go through is what makes this book such an exciting love story. I would say that the best chapter of this story is chapter 7 volume 1, where Jane goes to Mr. Bingley's on the horse and gets a cold. This is the part of the story were things start to change. One example of this would be the interest that Mr. Darcy starts to show for Elizabeth. This happens because Jane catches a cold on her way to the Bingley's house and Elizabeth goes to the Bingley's house to take care of her sister. As Darcy spends time with Elizabeth, he starts to show interest in Liz.Another important thing about this book is that Jane Austen uses imagery very well to make us get into the book. I must say that there were times when I was caught up in reading since everything was well described. An example of Austen using imagery is when she describes what kind of people the Bennet's mom and dad are. For example, at the beginning of the story, the writer talks about Mr. Bennet and Mrs. Bennet and how different the two people are. In chapter 1 the author describes Mrs. Bennet as a foolish person and a fussy gossiper. Mr. Bennet is quiet and kept to himself. In chapter 4 we have a very good description of personalities in two different important characters, Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley. Mr. Bingley is cheerful and sociable while Mr. Darcy is clever but less tactful, and unlike Mr. Bingley he finds the people dull; in other words, he criticizes people way too much.I would recommend this book for high school students because it opens your mind to new and real things. It teaches you, mostly girls, to value the liberties that are given to you. I say this because back then women didn't have many choices or liberties to do what they wanted. Back then women had to do what their husband wanted and now women have many liberties."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"because this book deserves it. I first read it in the 9th grade, and it was literally a struggle to the very end. Summoning all my effort, I laboriously read this book with a lack of interest unsurpassed to this very day. It was useful only when I had trouble falling asleep.Each page of this dull, overly dramatic book felt like an eternity. There are pages upon pages of meaningless and increasingly uninteresting rambling. Plain Jane gains no sympathy from me. Apparently, she enjoys suffering, as evidenced by her constantly changing opinions and the way she strives to make her life more difficult when handed easier options. (Ex: When the guy finally admits his love for her, she goes off into the rain, poor and near-death, upon the advising of some voices she hears.)The plot is long and unbelievable. For example, how can you hide a woman in your house for years, a woman who, by the way, screams, throws fits, and sets things on fire? And nobody notices this? The ending is no better -- sappy and contrived, it left me ill.Absolutely hideous, I would not even recommend this to the worst of my enemies. This book fails to become even briefly captivating. It starts off horribly and, impossible as it may seem, only gets worse throughout."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I enjoy classic Victorian era romance , and this by far is the worst book I have ever read. I know that Jane's character was suppose to be \\"Plain Jane\\", but I in no way found her endearing. Instead of feeling sorry for all her misfortunes and lack of love, I found myself detesting her character. The plot drags on forever, when really it could be told better in five minutes. It could be romantic, except that the plot is so boring and outlandish, that it overshadows that element. And the supernatural elements of the novel literally made me laugh out loud. I could go on about why I hate this novel, but I don't want to ruin the story for others."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"After reading Jane Eyre, I was glad to be done with this book. Most women enjoy and appreciate Jane Eyre, but since I am 15 I have a different opinion.Jane Eyre is 641 pages of a woman trying to find herself. Jane, the main character, goes to a charitable school for 1/4 of the book. During school, nothing really happens. Yes, Jane and her classmates are treated poorly, but it didn't hold my attention. The book does pick up until after Jane leaves school.From there Jane meets the love of her life, Mr. Rochester. The only thing about their relationship is Jane is 19 or 20 and Mr. Rochester is almost 40. I felt that I could not relate to these characters because today such an age difference is looked down upon by people. Of course Jane and Mr. Rochester plan to get married, but Jane finds out about Mr. Rochester's deepest darkest secret. THEN SHE RUNS AWAY! What a stupid girl. Jane may have been an independent woman, but big deal; so many women today are independent. Is that why so many people love this book? When Jane runs away, this part of Jane Eyre is so unbelievably boring. Jane meets her cousins, but realizes that she still loves Mr. Rochester. Not much happens except Mr. Rochester is blind. Jane and Mr. Rochester get married and live happily ever after.You might love this book, but as I said before I am only 15 and can not appreciate Jane Eyre, the character and the book. If you are a teenager like me do not read Jane Eyre or even waste your time. Maybe if you are older and found your true love, you might love every minute of this book. I recommend if you are young, read a book that takes place during the present, not the past."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"While sloshing through the almost unreadable text of the verbose Charlotte Bronte, one can imagine why she was never married. Don't get us wrong, it's not that we don't understand the underlying themes and the higher level concepts; they just contain absolutely no relevance whatsoever.

This book should not be a classic, and I do not understand why it is one."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"You've probably heard the expression that a million monkeys typing for a million years eventually will reproduce the works of William Shakespeare. I give \\"Jane Eyre\\" one monkey, ten minutes.While recognizing Bronte's derring-do in writing a novel about a homely 17-year-old governess who rejects a virtuous adonis (St. John Rivers) for her much older and unattractive employer, this is a book I cannot see reading again unless it's the only way to save a terminally ill relative.This book is a slow read. And I mean slow. A snail? Greased lightning. Molasses on a cold day? Quicksilver. Eighth-period study hall in high school on a Friday? Over in a flash. We're talking a slow, boring read here, even without the benefit of a high school English teacher's enthusiasm for ruining literature.The novel chronicles the story of Jane Eyre from her childhood as an orphan up until the birth of her first child. Life was hard for orphans in 19th-century England, particularly when their parents' marriage was considered improper. Fair enough, I suppose: that's why Jane's childhood is so rotten, and she is picked on by the cousins she lives with, misliked and mistreated by her aunt and so on. Unfortunately, Bronte's writing is so dry and lifeless that it's hard to care.It just gets worse from there. The book is written in the first person, with the result that we get to hear every self-pitying thought Jane has (and there are plenty of them), about how plain she is, how her employer Mr. Rochester could never love her, how beautiful her imagined rival in love is, and on and on and on for page after tedious page.My standard joke is \\"This is both good and original. Unfortunately, the parts that are good are not original, and the parts that are original are not good.\\" I will give Charlotte Bronte the benefit of the doubt, and will say that \\"Jane Eyre\\" is thoroughly original. Unlike the works of Shakespeare and a number of other classics of English and world literature, I can't say it is particularly good.Jocko Grinn"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"It seems silly to say that a book can affect you on a profound level. well I definitely believe in this power that a good book has. Jane Eyre is one of them. I cannot say that this was an easy book to read. But it was a book that I was very enriched by reading. Romance is a genre that is looked down on by many \\"sophisticated readers.\\" Perhaps they would look down on Jane Eyre, but would probably get some eyebrows raised at them. Well Jane Eyre is the archetype for the romance novel. After having read thousands of them, I know a romance novel when I see it, and Jane Eyre does qualify. But it is much more than this. It's a story for the person who wonders why the keep trying to do the right thing, and persevering in life, instead of just taking what they want when they want it. If Jane Eyre had been that sort of person, she would not have gotten her happy ending. Instead, Jane walked away from the thing she wanted most in the world. She almost died doing what she felt in her heart was right. Had the story ended there, I probably would have detested this book. But it doesn't. We see Jane continue to grow and act as the phenomenal person that she was. Although often downtrodden, she is no meek mouse. She has a fighting spirit that keeps her going when others would have laid down and died. But despite being a fighter, she is not a user and abuser. It's hard at times for the difference to be clearly delineated. Well there is no question about Jane's level of strength and intregrity. Although it is made clear several times in this novel, that Jane is no beauty, her soul makes her a beautiful character. Beautiful in a more profound way.There are moments when you feel, how can one person suffer so? But taking the journey, you realize that all Jane's suffering had a purpose. It refined her into a woman who could look beneath and love what others could never love or understand. It made her the woman who could love and heal Rochester.At the same time, Rochester was made for Jane Eyre. He had searched his life for a woman like her, and made quite a few mistakes along the way. And out of love, he was able to let her go when he wanted to keep her. But she came back to him, when he needed her most.Rochester is the hero that formed the archetype for many of my favorites: tortured, scarred, dark, enigmatic, all of those things. Best of all, loving little, plain, ordinary Jane with a fundamental intensity that pours out of the pages of this book into my heart as a reader. Despite his lack of perfection, I could not love him more.Ah, how maudlin I sound. I can't help it. This book moved me to tears. Yet I smiled at the same time. I enjoyed the conversations between Rochester and Jane. There was a heat there, a passion. Yet this book is clean enough to read in Sunday school. That is grand romance. The journey so well expressed, that no sex scenes are needed. It's all there.This novel is also inspirational. Not preachy, in my opinion, but for a believer, one can definitely find spiritual messages in this book. About perseverance, about not wearying about doing good. About the profoundness of God's love. It's all there, but in a narrative that expertly showcases it, not preaching it.I feel I am failing to write the review I want to write for this book. The words do fail me. All I can say is that this book will always be a favorite of mine because of the way it touched my heart and challenged me."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"In many ways, \`Jane Eyre' can be seen as an autobiographical novel. Certainly, Charlotte Bronte drew on her experiences as both pupil and teacher in shaping the character of Jane Eyre. The story of Jane Eyre is a triumph of character and spirit over circumstance. Jane herself is depicted as small and plain and with an independent spirit. She believes, fundamentally, in equality and, absolutely, in the healing power of love.The story can be read on a number of different levels: as a triumph of \`good' over \`evil'; as a claim of a woman's independence; and as a love story. I have read it three different times over the past 40 years and have formed different impressions each time. Perhaps on a fourth read I may form another impression altogether different.\`Jane Eyre' is a wonderful mixture of the conventional and the unconventional. Jane is a survivor who uses her strength of character to survive the adversities which form part of her life. Many of the views expressed through the characters had critics arguing about the relative morality of the work. Some of those debates would be viewed with astonishment through our late 20th and early 21st century eyes but in the context of the 19th century it was not accepted that women could be the equal of men.Charlotte Bronte wrote \`Jane Eyre' in 1846, and it was accepted for publication in 1847. Charlotte outlived her younger sisters Emily and Anne and had a number of other novels published: each of her novels is worth reading.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre was authored by the inimitable Charlotte Bronte of the Yorkshire writing Brontes of Haworth Parsonage. The novel was written under the pen name \\"Currer Bell\\" in fears that it might be thought to have been by a woman. Bronte dedicated the book to one of her literary heroes William Makepeace Thackery whom she met on a London trip. Little did Charotte know that Thackery had to deal with a wife gone mad as had Rochester in her novel!Jane Eyre suffers through a miserable childhood. She is raised by a cruel aunt Mrs. Reed after the death of her parents. Jane is sent to the odious Lowood Academy where she lives for eight years from age 10 to 18.At Lowood, Janes befriends the older girl Helen Burns. Helen dies at an early age; Jane remains at Lowood. Miss Eyre eventually becomes a teacher at the school as she has learned French, sewing and social skills.Jane departs Lowood to become the governess of Adele the illegitimate daughter of Mr. Rochester. Rochester is a Byronic figure who has a madwife named Blanche living in the third story of his estate Thornfield. Jane leaves Rochester at the wedding altar when it is discovered he has a living wife. Jane flees to a home of evangelic Christians where she is courted by the future missonary Mr. St.John. He rejects the wealthy Rosamund Oliver for Jane. Jane, however, loves Rochester. In a dramatic ending the little Miss Eyre is reunited with her lover and weds Rochester. Jane comforts Rochester who has become blind and maimed due to the burning down of Thornfield. The fire had been set by his mad wife Blanche who leaped off the roof of the building. Daphne Du Maurier would use a similar ending of her novel \\"Rebecca.\\"The name \\"Jane Eyre\\" can be interpreted in many ways. Jane was the middle name of Charlotte's sister Emily. Eyre may refer to her desire to fly freely in the independent air of personal freedom. Eyre also hints at the fact that Jane is an heiress. Jane also \\"errs\\" in some of her decisions as she makes her pilgrim's progress through northern England. The book is a Cinderella story in which a poor and plain young woman wins her lover. The dialogue is sharp, witty and the scene is populated by interesting rural servants and domestic animals such as the dog Pilot.The book contains elements of Gothic terror, romance and a defense of the rights of women. Bronte is often taught in courses on Feminism. Charlotte Bronte writing in the first person uses a rich language drawing on Biblical, Classical and Shakespearean language and metaphor. Bronte knew how to tell a good story for her life was similar to that of Jane Eyre. Bronte saw many of her sibling die young and lived in genteel poverty as a governess and teacher.Jane Eyre is an immortal classic which will continue to be read and enjoyed by future generations.

One more thing I cried reading this book(add this to my list of books that make me cry: Marley and Me, The Return of the King, and now Jane Eyre)."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"When Charlotte Bronte wrote Jane Eyre in 1847, she was forced by the ideals of the time to publish it under a man's name: Currer Bell. However, the novel's accurate depiction of a woman on a quest of self-discovery and love would correctly identify the author as a woman herself. In it, the title character leaves her childhood school to serve as governess at Thornfield Park, where she falls in love with her master, Mr. Rochester. However, the discovery of his insane wife makes it impossible to be with him, and Jane must leave to gain her own independence before the two can be reunited. This exquisitely written novel is truly a classic, but don't let that be a deterrent: Bronte's style remains consistently readable and lucid throughout. Add this to the effortless relatability of the title character, and we have a completely compelling novel on our hands. Throughout her master work, Bronte uses literary techniques like characterization, appeals to pathos, and theme to make Jane and her story highly relatable to nearly all girls and women.From the outset of the novel, the reader is given a very good idea of Jane and her character. In fact, the main traits mentioned by Bronte in the narrative are what make Jane so immediately relatable to the audience (which, by merit of its basic plot as a 19th century gothic romance, would logically be made of older girls and women of all ages that would find it intriguing). Jane, from the beginning, describes herself as, \\"poor, obscure, plain, and little\\" (272). These descriptors are reinforced throughout the novel as Jane and others describe her in terms of wealth, popularity, looks, and stature; as Jane has very little of all four of these things, she is often looked down upon by herself and others. Very rarely are fictional heroines depicted in such terms; add this to the fact that Jane has a heart of gold and Bronte has given us one of fiction's most relatable characters. Even if the reader is not poor, obscure, plain, or little, they have felt that they were each of these things at least once in their lifetime. Because Jane is so far from the ideal, the reader, as another person very far from the ideal, automatically relates to and invests in the story of Jane Eyre.Charlotte Bronte also makes Jane incredibly relatable though her usage of appeals to pathos. She makes these appeals from the outset of the novel, when Jane is sent from her relation in order to live at Lowood School, a strict institution that treats the students there terribly. Here she feels lonely and suffers lashings for offenses as quizzical as not standing when a teacher enters the room. It is when Jane starts teaching at the school that we get one of the most relatable appeals to pathos. Jane narrates, \\"I desired liberty; for liberty I gasped; for liberty I uttered a prayer; it seemed scattered on the wind faintly blowing. I abandoned it and framed a humbler supplication. For change, stimulus. That petition, too, seemed swept off into vague space.\\" (88). There isn't a person in the world hasn't longed for some sort of freedom for a change in their life only to find it not forthcoming. Jane's desire for something new and the ability to do what she wants rather than what others want her to do is relatable on all levels of life -from a girl's elementary school years to her advanced womanhood.These appeals to pathos are also apparent in regard to Jane's love for her employer, Mr. Rochester: she believes it is unrequited for the first half of the novel and then, when he reveals that he shares her feelings, discovers that he already has a wife, insane though still very much alive. Jane's moral standards make it impossible for them to be together, and so for a large portion of the text Jane has lost her love and her dearest friend. Bronte writes, from Jane's perspective, \\"It shivered in my heart, like a suffering child in a cold cradle: sickness and anguish had seized it; it could not seek Mr. Rochester's arms--it could not derive warmth from his breast. Oh, never more could it turn to him; for faith was blighted--confidence destroyed! Mr. Rochester was not to me what he had been, for he was not what I had thought him\\" (319). Throughout this passage and many others in the text, Bronte creates a sense of loss, specifically of a loved one; this is also an emotion which can be considered relatable on all levels of the board, because every woman or girl has lost a loved one, be it romantic or platonic, and this awareness of commonality between the reader and Bronte's Jane is the obvious result of appeals to pathos made throughout the novel.Finally, the theme of the novel is perhaps what makes it most relatable: Jane Eyre is, essentially, a woman's quest to be loved on her own terms. Only when Rochester's wife has died in a house fire and Jane has achieved her own economic and emotional independence do the two marry and be together. In essence, Jane completely succeeds at her quest. \\"Reader, I married him. A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and the clerk, were alone present\\" (488). In their previous engagement before the discovery of Rochester's wife, he had sought to bedeck her with jewels and expensive fabrics, and he had been proud and arrogant in her love for him. It is different and far more agreeable to Jane now that he spurns the luxuries and arrogance that were once so integral to his happiness. Far more than that, the last chapter focuses on Jane's happiness with her marriage, which is in direct, though welcome opposition to previous chapters, in which her struggles, sacrifices, and hardships are chronicled. Jane, who had been a loveless orphan, now has a husband, children, and familial ties; similarly, each girl or woman who reads this fantastic story wishes for each of these things. Jane's desire to be loved on her own terms is a direct reflection of the readers; the theme Bronte creates from this--a quest to be loved--sustains Jane Eyre's relatability to modern readers.This marvelously crafted novel is truly a classic which remains highly readable in both style and plotline. Additionally, Bronte assured its immortality when she made the main character, Jane Eyre, such a relatable character. Using characterization, appeals to pathos, and theme, Bronte created one of fiction's most relatable characters.

What can I say other than I loved it all? I when I got through half of the book I couldn't believe my luck that I still had 321 pages of adventures left. It was totally different from all the other books I've ever read -- it was shocking, it was romantic, it was haunting, it was disturbing, it was joyful... It was the story of an orphan, and her trials while she's trying to find herself. It had all different emotions and troubles, and Charlotte Bronte really wrote the book well, taking from her own life experiances. There have been sentences in the book that I have never been able to forget because of the energy and passion that the author wrote into them. \\"Jane Eyre\\" can be called a haunting tale about one young woman's conflict between two different worlds. This is certainly a read for everyone."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Though she writes in the Austin era, Charlotte Bront's style is unique, more mysterious (and a little darker) and less predictable than many of Jane Austen's works.I enjoyed this book because it portrays a harsh, plain, conservative, hard-working girl (like me) in a setting and a story so unlike what I live in. Because I identify with Jane on so many levels, her world becomes a sort of fantasy world to me when I read it. I am always disappointed when I reach the end.I don't think I need to explain much more about why I like it. I think it is a very well-written book.

I was very sympathetic towards Jane Eyre from the first- I appreciated how honest and true to life a character she turned out to be, and her less-than-stunning appearance was a breath of fresh air (no pun intended) compared to some of the stereotypical heroines of that time period.What was more surprising to me was that I actually liked Mr. Rochester, because at first I admit my reaction was something like \\"Oh No!, not another Heathcliff!\\" He may have had some kind-of odd quirks, but I thought that he was rather endearing in a way- especially at the very end.Considering that I came into this novel expecting another Wuthering Heights (a book that I despise), I am very happy that I was proven quite wrong.

It is the most overrated book ever.One of the most fundamental things a book has to do is hold the reader's interest, and in this aspect, Jane Eyre fails. To be fair, it is utterly gripping throughout the first ten chapters. After that, the quality of the book falls off sharply. The rapid pace becomes boring repition of having to go through thirty pages of nothing to get to a page or two where something actually happens, then another 30 pages of nothing.It's kind of a shame really, for a book that started out as well as this one to crash and burn the way it does. But it happens, and what we are left with is a dreadfully boring book that continues to have praise heaped on it for reasons I will probably never fathom."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte talks about a young lady, Jane that reminds me of Cinderella. Both of her parents died when she was little, so she was raised by her wealthy Aunt Mrs. Reed. Like Cinderella, Mrs. Reed favors her own children rather than Jane. This book shows how the need for Love can cause so many complications in Jane's life.Mrs. Reed decided to send Jane off to a school named Lowood. This gave Jane a chance to be independent and live her own life. She soon made a good friend named Helen, who always encouraged her when she feels down. When Jane found out that Helen is sick from a disease called consumption, she rushes to see her. Helen soon died in Jane's arms, which made her feel sad because she had just lost a good friend. There was no one there to make Jane feel better anymore. This was the first complication in her life.After a couple years at Lowood, she became one of their teachers. After two years of being a teacher at Lowood, she wanted to experience something new, so she arrives at Thornfield to teach an eight-year-old French girl Adele. Mr. Rochester was the owner of Thornfield. Jane saves Mr. Rochester from a fire caused by a servant and secretly falls in love with Mr. Rochester. When Mr. Rochester brought back a beautiful young woman Blanche to his house, Jane developed a huge tub of jealousy towards her. Jane couldn't stop thinking what would happen with Mr. Rochester and Blanche. Jane was forced to attend a party where Blanche and her mom were there also. They didn't treat her very nicely causing her to leave the party. While watching Mr. Rochester and Blanche together, she thinks they would get married soon. This made Jane think that she should maybe let go of the feelings she had for Mr. Rochester. Her love for Mr. Rochester was the second complication in her life.Jane founds out later on that her Aunt Mrs. Reed suffered a stroke. Jane tries to relieve the hatred her aunt has for her, but she didn't want to and soon died. This made Jane sad because she barely had a chance to talk with her aunt and say good-bye. Jane didn't want things to end how it did with her aunt because it's not a good feeling knowing someone still hates you after they die. This is another complication to her life.Mr. Rochester bumps into Jane in the garden, and they started walking together. Mr. Rochester tells Jane that he is thinking about asking Blanche to marry him. This caused Jane to turn into a jealous woman. She quickly tells him how much she loves him and stunned to find out that Mr. Rochester actually wanted to marry her and not Blanche. She didn't believe his words. Mr. Rochester explained that he only said he wanted to marry Blanche to see what her reaction would be. Jane happily accepts and agrees to marry Mr. Rochester. Mrs. Fairfax doesn't agree with the marriage because she views Mr. Rochester as a proud man and too old for her. Jane was very uncomfortable hearing those words from Mrs. Fairfax. Jane began to have weird dreams of her children dying or crying for help which causes her to be more uncomfortable for she doesn't know what is happening and why she is having such dreams. Despite what Mrs. Fairfax said or the dreams she's been having, she still wanted to marry Mr. Rochester because she loved him very much. They were walking down the aisle ready to be announced husband and wife when someone announced a secret that ruined the whole evening.Will Jane ever find happiness and love or will she be lonely with no one to care for her? Read to find out if this will be the end of Jane and Rochester's love for each other."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane EyreI liked the book. i thought it was neat how the author wrote it as an autobiography. it was pretty interessting.like how the girls were treated in lowood school ws upsetting, and how she meets Mr. Rochester...

She had no confidence and no pride. She would not let people love her and treat her nicely. When Mr. Rochester asks her to marry him and then wanted to take her out and buy her a nice dress and jewlery, she acts so coldly towards him that it makes me sick.

I dunno, perhaps if i was living during that era i would have appreciated the book more, but living in the 90's where you have authors such as atwood there's no competition and you really can't compare novels written before the 20th century to novels written in the 20th century anyway. Like a majority of the classics, the plot is almost always predictable and characters are indeed relatable but hell, boring! charles dickens is probably the most boring writer i've ever come across (no offence to all u dickens fans out there) and jane austen comes pretty close to him,though her books have a longer attention span. And the brontes, they're on the same level. I am not saying that the classics are bad cuz i know that if it weren't for these authors, we'd be nowhere in literature as we are now.

(A complex person, a good man in a bad situation)Seriously, although it is rarely mentioned, I was struck by the Biblical and religious references and overtones of this book. Charlotte Bronte, as a clergyman's daughter, sure knew the Bible. And contrary to popular opinion, religious people understand the trials of temptation, perhaps more than most. That is why Jane's struggles with her desires ring true. Although she suffered, her self-respect remained intact. As a modern woman I respect this character's moral uprightness and her strong sense of self--I wish more modern young (and not so young) women would learn from her example, and thus avoid much heartache and regret\\"Dread remorse when you are tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the poison of life.'--Mr. Rochester"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This is a really interesting book if you are interested in sad, mystery, and love books.

This is a lovely and somewhat autobiographical tale of Jane Eyre, orphaned and raised by self-centered and uncaring relatives until they send her off to school. Eventually she is hired as a governess to a young girl and meets the girl's guardian Mr. Rochester, and of course they fall in love and plan to marry. But, there is a mystery about the house that once it is discovered destroys the wedding plans.A lovely tale, and Bronte has such a wonderful prose that makes you want to slow down and savor it and the story like a fine red wine or chocolate. The version I read is a set with selected works of all the Bronte sisters, so I did not have the distraction of the foot notes to refer to, and I don't feel that I missed much without them.Highly highly recommended, one that should be taken off the shelf and reread every couple of years or so."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Since I had read the book Jane Eyre, I had an urge to see the movie.I was impressed and fascinated by the classic English language, thereforemy choosing of the actors \\" Tomothy Dalton & Zelah Clarke \\".A real enjoyment !!!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Hard to believe that JANE EYRE was written over 150 years ago since women of all ages still fall in love with its hero, Mr. Rochester, today. I know I did when I first read the book in sixth grade and I still find the book incrediably romantic all these years later. The beginning part of the book is reminiscent of Dickens since Jane survives a horrible childhood of mistreatment. And when she meets Mr. Rochester and against all odds he falls in love with her (for her character and intelligence as she is \\"plain and poor\\") the book really gets interesting for most of its fans. Of course there are still many obstacles along the way before Jane can find happiness with her true love.

While it does have the Dickens-esque feel of sometimes seeming to drag on much longer than necessary, in the end everything comes together in a satisfying way.While it's not the type of book to keep you up at night wondering what will happen next, it also isn't one to make you wonder why you are continuing at all.

The character of Jane is so amazing: so quiet and humble and patient, yet at heart so passionate and full of longing! She is small and plain, but has more determination than any other character we meet. She has a pure, beautiful heart and a passionate, tender soul. She is the most amazing character I have ever enountered in all of literature!The book follows Jane Eyre who, despite the stability of her quiet, peaceful life as a governess, is ultimately lonely and longs to experience more of the world. Mr. Rochester is a cynical, haunted man, living a life of sin and debauchery, but whose pure heart yearns for a clean conscience and a chance at happiness. Their love is deep and tender, filling up Jane's lonely life and rejuvenating Mr. Rochester--but true love can never be built on lies. When Jane discovers Mr. Rochester's awful secret, she cannot stay with him. He has lied to her the entire time, loving her completely but selfishly, using her for his own purposes. His feelings are true, but he has to pay for his sins and become upright before God--only then can they be together.

She teaches a young French girl, and gradually falls in love with the master of the house, but the love is that sort of \\"forbidden love.\\" Jane struggles with this love and her low position in life. It's a classic, beautiful romance novel, full of love, and the complications in love. I've read many Victorian romance novels, but this one tops them all. I loved it.

First as a student, and then as a teacher/guverness, but neither is like a dance on roses. Then her skills bring her to a mysterious and quite arrogant Mr.Rochesters house where she becomes the guverness...This book illustrates very well the passionate love from a woman's point of view. No longer is the female character a background character, but becomes independant with feelings, passion, integrety and a strong mind.The book is very realistic, and you can easily identify yourself with the feelings that the main character has. Her devotion for what she loves, and her effort to make the best out of her life.Charlotte Bront, who first published this book under a pseudonym, is probably the most well-known of the Bront sisters who all died very young. Jane Eyre is a brilliant book of a woman who can be a role model for young girls of today. Her determination to make life the best for herself as no one else seems to bother, and her passion for what she loves. One of the first romance novels written. A true classic that I very much enjoyed to read, and I'm certain I will read it many more times. Even my friend, who doesn't like reading very much, totally loved this book.

English teachers may praise it, your girlfriends may gush over Rochester, and others \\"critically acclaim\\" it but I have studied it as a piece of literature as well as an entertaining classic. It is not as fabulous as they say.The protagonist is a quivering (and excuse the term but I am at a lost for another word at the moment) nitwit who yearns to be loved. Jane is an orphan who feels as if she would die if nobody loved her and yes, it sounds simplistic but this is exactly what she says. She comes under the employment of Rochester and becomes a governess to a little girl. Meanwhile, she dreams of flaming beds and hears strange noises from the floor above. The splitting of the oak tree during Jane's engagement to Rochester is just rubbish as a symbol of separation and tragedy. The real tragedy though, is the secret that Rochester keeps and for which, Jane accepts.I am amused by how several people believe that Jane Eyre is a feminist novel. I found Jane to be very comfortable lodged in traditional ideals although she makes an attempt to strike out with her own will. It was a struggle to finish the novel (had to, or I would fail my English exam) and to pretend to my enthusiastic teacher that I loved it. If you want real feminism without archaic English, read Carol Shield's 'Unless'. If you want melodramatic romance with just a hint of literature, read 'Wuthering Heights'. If you think that Jane is a misguided feminist, you certainly have to read Jean Rhy's 'Wide Sargasso Sea' who portrays Rochester's secret as a terrible colonial crime.I can understand that some people love this kind of stuff but there are types of people who hate 'Jane Eyre' - they're usually into contemporary novels, ask for their heroes or heroine to yearn for something more than love and for somebody to love them, and need metaphors that are more subtle that freakin' splittin' oak trees."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Some say that I'm bias in this, but I have to say that I am not one to read romance novel. I'm just not. But I gave this book a shot.A basic plot summary will give you a plain, unattractive young girl living under an oppressive aunt who sends her to a strict Christian school for the orphans. After years of suffrage at the school, Jane becomes a governess for the brooding Mr. Rochester, which she soon finds she has feelings for. But what about that Grace Poole, what is she hiding in the upstairs attack?What seems like a mystery is over run by a prevailing romance between Jane and Mr. Rochester.I won't divulge anymore of the plot. But I will tell you why I initially liked it.Jane Eyre is the best example of the heroine I am most like. She is plain and simple and so am I. I connected well with the character. Quite often, I feel the heroes are too fake.At its best, this is a story about two conflicting societies, the aristocracy and the middle class. Which is done in a rather blunt and humorous way.But what I find enjoyable is the fact that if you take certain dialogs from the book completely out of context, it is quite funny. My friends and I have many a good joke because of it.What I don't like isn't much, but it is where many books fail. The ending collapses the entire book. It felt pushed and corny. I thought it was the most predictable ending.The entire story felt a bit contrive. But not as bad as Wuthering Heights by her sister, which I didn't even finish.The book is pretty easy read.

For instance, besides the romance between Jane and Edward there is also the contrast provided by the relationship between Jane and St. John.Imagine what may happen if Jane accepts the marriage proposal of St. John and goes with him to some foreign land as the wife of a missionary? In answering that question while taking a closer look at the unfeeling St. John, we see an anti-Christian message in the book. Add to this mix the despicable Mr. Brocklehurst, the school manager who is also minister of Brocklebridge Church, and you receive a very negative view of Christianity. JANE EYRE is a love story with an anti-Christian bias - but the theme proclaiming that love can conquer all is still the dominant message of the novel.The above represents only one perspective. The book of course can be read and interpreted from many other vantage points. For me that is its greatest strength and enjoyment."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Definitely Not What I Expected: Jane EyreJane Eyre is a novel set in 1800's England. It is about a young girl, Jane, who wants to escape her horrible life with her aunt and abusive cousins. Her parents died when she was a little girl. She wants to go to school and eventually teach. Jane is a smart girl who loves to read, but is not very fond of her appearance. Jane Eyre tells the tale of a woman's experiences in life, about men, friendship, and hardship. When taking a job as a governess, Jane stumbles upon a love she did not intend, and a mystery she's determined to solve.Although Jane Eyre is not exactly my cup of tea there were some positive points to the book. The character Jane Eyre is a very good role model for young women. She is not some stunningly gorgeous princess in a castle, she's very real in the sense that she has insecurities like everyone else. She may struggle with her appearance, but she is very smart and articulate, and does not rely on men to take care of her. She's very independent and uses her brains, not her looks to get what she wants. Appearance is something almost every adolescent girl has struggled with, despite what time period they've grown up in. Jane Eyre presents a positive message to girls.Unfortunately, the rest of the novel was not quite as inspiring. In general, I found Jane Eyre to be very dull and boring, and far too long. The literature style was very bland. When reading Jane Eyre the voice in my head became monotonous, I was ready to fall asleep! With so much detail when describing the characters or setting, it seems like it takes Charlotte Bronte two or three pages just to describe a chair.Extremely long and boring at times, Jane Eyre captures the time period well, almost too well with the amount of detailed description on every page.

Beginning from childhood, Jane was faced with the choices of life which lay before her. She moved from struggle to struggle with courage and self-determination which gained the reader's respect. Her character is strong and clever in a way that brings her to be a heroic personage in the novel. I liked how Jane obtained a strong-willed personality and how she stuck by her beliefs no matter what.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this slower paced romance from beginning to end and like many other books of its kind, it captivated me with the beloved mixture of romance and challenge. I liked how there was a fair amount of lovey-dovey moments in the book which held your attention, and made you strive for more. It wasn't a constant shower of romance and flirtatious quotes, and this I found, allowed the reader to excite themselves whenever the romance was present.Charlotte Bront used a lot of descriptive imagery throughout the novel ranging from the texture of light to the precise emotions Jane was feeling. This seemed to make it easier on many levels to comprehend exactly what was going on at every point of the novel. Although it had a few sluggish parts, I found was no struggle to read through those select scenes.

Still, having said that, I am happy I read it and thought Charlotte Bronte was an exceptional novelist."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I usually read murder mysteries but ordered the audiobook after viewing the Brontes' sisters biography on television. It's a wonderful book. I can't believe I waited this long to read a book so popular for centuries and I don't know why this wasn't required reading in school.The characters are endearing, the language, beautiful and I think knowing the history of the author makes the book much more enjoyable and realistic.I had read Emily Brontes' Wuthering Heights years ago in my teens and enjoyed it very much but didn't appreciate the history of the author then.Maybe everyone should read or watch the sisters' biography then read the books."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"As I was in the middle of the book, I was so drawn to the characters I felt full. Later there was sadness for awhile. At the end I was full of joy. My feelings were \\"wow - what a wonderful journey.\\" I loved the two main characters, Edward and Jane, their individual natures, their love for each other and how they pursued it. There were interesting and unexpected conversations and events. I enjoyed the way early in their relationship, Edward would pass Jane in the hallway, sometimes scowling and sometimes politely nodding, yet she was not offended because she knew his moods were unrelated to her. The St. John character was odd yet amazing. He loved a girl, but easily gave her up because he believed she wouldn't fit in with his missionary goals and service to God. Instead he asked someone else to marry him whom he did not love but she fit with his vocation. The novelist Thackeray wrote \\"St John is a failure I think but a good failure.\\" Bronte describes St. John as being made of what heroes, conquerors and statesmen are made, but not marrying material. St. John was not a major character in the book, but I mention him as an example of the variety of interesting characters. An idea that continues to intrigue me is \\"fact is stranger than fiction.\\" One reviewer of the book (back in the 1800s) thought one of the characters was too unbelievable and stated \\"such creations as Helen Burns are very beautiful but very untrue.\\" Ms. Bronte responded saying that Helen Burns was a real person and that Ms. Bronte exaggerated nothing about Helen. Sexual language: none. Number of sex scenes: none. Setting: 1800s England. Published 1847. Genre: historical romance."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This is a great book to read! I really love the voice of Jane throughout the whole story, making me really feel that I was reading her journal rather than Charlotte writing fiction. Definitely a must read!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I first read this in high school (oh, gosh...25 years ago!). I remember liking it then, though at the time I think I preferred Emily's Wuthering Heights. But as another reviewer mentioned, classic books really should be re-read from time to time. In some ways I think they're wasted on the young! Now I find Wuthering Heights a good story, though a bit melodramatic. However, reading Jane Eyre again, in my forties, I realize what an unusual book it is. On the surface, it has many of the standard plot devices of Victorian novels: a mistreated orphan, a romantic setting, a brooding romantic interest. But Charlotte Bronte's deft touch lifts this above the ordinary. She uses Jane to cry out against all the injustice she saw in the world. She addresses religious hypocrisy, women's rights, and the mistreatment of children, among other things. And it's a very good read. I find I am staying up late at night because I want to read on, rather than go to bed."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"With this novel Ms. Bronte crafted what is undoubtedly one of the most beautiful works of the English language. One concern I always have with reading classics is to avoid their introductions as they inevitably forego on the minute details of the work (I suppose they assume everyone who's someone has already read it.) As such, I'll avoid disclosing the inner workings of the plot of Jane Eyre -- it's too beautiful to divulge and I hope you'll take up the novel for yourself.Simply put, we see Jane Eyre, the epitome of the term \\"Plain Jane,\\" evolve from mistreated orphan as she ascends the ladder of social status and, as with all bildungsroman novels, plummets to an even further depth than whence she came. We read as our heroine negotiates the complexities of early Victorian womanhood and confronts the haunting past of her mysterious master, all in the quest for conflicting longings for self-satisfaction, independence, and love.If interested, the reader may also enjoy Jean Rhys' 1966 classic novel Wide Sargasso Sea, which traces the story of Jane's symbolic inner woman, the \\"mad\\" Antoinette \\"Bertha\\" Mason."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This is a reprint of the famous Bronte novel that even now after so many years can thrill and captivate the reader.We are introduced to the heroine Jane EYRE on the first page and we soon realise she is a most put upon child, unwanted by Aunt, cruelly treated by her spoilt cousins and mostly ignore by the servants, save for Bessie who perhaps has the best understanding of the sufferings that Jane has to ensure under her Aunt Reed's indifferent care.We follow Jane from her miserable home life in Gateshead to her time spent at a charity school, her friendship with the doomed Helen Burns and her elevation to student teacher, a role that allows her to eventually take up a post as a governess for the child Adele, the possible illegitimate daughter of the enigmatic Mr ROCHESTER who owns the eerie Thornfield Manor.From Jane's first day at the Manor we are treated to a mystery story that slowly grows and grows with each passing day, soon Jane realises that all is not well at the Manor but she is not sure what the problem is, it has something to do with the enigmatic Grace POOLE and the attic where she works, but who cries out at night and why does Mr ROCHESTER almost get burnt to death in his bed in what is obviously not an accident but which he insists is the case.Ms BRONTE'S book is suspenseful and daring, in that she talks about illegitimacy, marriages of class, and the abuse of children in charity schools to name but a few subjects she incorporates into Jane EYRE.This particular edition is excellent because it is a faithful reproduction with no abridgement and is also can be purchased for a pittance, one way of getting the classics on your shelves, I will certainly be going out and buying myself more of these editions and look forward to re-reading Dracula, The Picture of Dorian Grey and Jekyll and Hyde."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"After reading the last words of this novel, the only word that escaped my mouth was WOW! Jane's character is so real. In one way or another, every woman can relate to her passage from the insecurities of childhood to the life defining moments of adulthood.For me, Bronte's main characters Jane and Mr. Rochester mirror the traveler in Robert Frost's Poem \\"The Road Not Taken,\\" as they struggle between raw human desire and moral righteousness. Jane chooses the \\"road less traveled,\\" where as Mr. Rochester takes the well worn path. In both cases, their choice defines the fiber of their spirit."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This story begins with Jane at a young age living with her aunt. Her aunt favors the other children and often scolds Jane for no reason. Soon after Jane attends school at Lowood. She remains there for eight years aand then gets a job as a governess at Thornfield. That is where the real action begins. Bronte uses imagery and symbolism in this work to make it more interesting for the reader. The images used in the book allow someone to vividly see what is going on during the story. Jane is a symbol of independence because she does everything for herself. The overall theme of this story is to let fate run its course because eventually what is supposed to happen will. This novel is a very memorable story. It is a classic love tale that will be good forever. It teaches a wonderful lesson. This book has taught me not to get so worked up about what is happening to me because it will all work out in the end. Overall this is a wonderful story. It is a great book to read when you are unhappy. It will cheer you right up. It has a great story line, and I recommend it to anyone who appreciates classics."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Jane Eyre by Charlotte Bronte is the template for many books that followed. We find Jane Eyre the orphan child soon to be abandoned by her uncaring aunt to a stern stark girls school. Jane has a spirit that does not quake in the face of dangers. She is the model for feminists in years to come.Charlotte Bronte the author of the book was born in 1816 and like Jane had experience as a governess. Jane Eyre was first published in 1847. By reading the book one can experience the harsh times that existed in the era. Young children had little protection from society outside of their family and those without families were at risk. The school, Jane attends is a uncaring and stoic establishment. Even so Jane flourishes because of her strong spirit and desire to learn.After leaving the school Jane bravely sets out to be governess. It is here that she meets Mr. Rochester her silent and mysterious employer. Jane has the ability to see the real spirit of a person and draws for Mr. Rochester with her subtle elfin charms. Throughout the book Jane maintains an integrity of being and an independent spirit. She demands that others, who she cares for respect her as an individual as well as a woman. Jane is a person who doesn't accept the limitations which fate has set forth for her.In many ways this novel was far ahead of its time in recognizing women as individuals who were capable and independent beings. The plot is one that has been used repeatedly in novels yet to come. Any reader of romances or gothic stories should first read this to find the source of the story."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This is, hands down, one of my favorite books. It is not the typical romance story - the heroine is not a gorgeous, delicate, flower and the hero is not a young, virile Hercules. The characters are more realistic, allowing the reader to be more sympathetic. Jane Eyre is described as being the plainest of the plain, but her strength and independence make her a rare individual. She is a dynamic character whose love transforms her in the end.This is book really moved me.

It'll be worth your time!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Charlotte Brontes classic novel has ignited a love of literature, although I admit I first read it for a school assesment 6 months ago, the next 4 times was out of love for every word in the book!!!

I reccomend it to all."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"\\". . .no one ever sleeps here: one would say that if there was a ghost at Thornfield Hall, this would be its haunt.\\" This a quote from Charlotte Bronte's 'Jane Eyre', a marvelous masterpiece set in the 1800s filled with suspense, action, and a pinch of romance. Orphaned when she is a small child, Jane Eyre is left in the clutches of her hateful aunt, Mrs. Reed, and her bullying cousins at Gateshead Hall. So marks the reader's advent into Jane's dreary world. Sent to Lowood School at the of ten, she eagerly expects a genial environment only to be met by a cold, hostile institution plagued by Mr. Brocklehearst, the arrogant headmaster. Despite two high points in her stay at Lowood (she is befriended by Miss Temple, a solicitous music instructor, and a saint-like pupil named Helen Burns), they are brutally taken away from her. Helen tragically dies from typhus, and Miss Temple marries a minister and moves away. Jane's only escape from Lowood is a position as a governess at Thornfield Hall eight years later (when she is eighteen) that she accepts. When she arrives at the manor, she is heartily greeted by the housekeeper, Miss Fairfax. Mr. Edward Rochester, the owner, usually travel abroad and is absent most of the time. Jane's duty is to tutor his foster-child Adele Vareans, an adorable six-year-old French girl. It finally seems as if Jane has discovered a home for herself and is at last distinguished as a bona fide person. However, her tranquility and niche are suddenly threatened when the brooding Mr. Rochester returns home. Odd events occur, such as screams in the night, crazed laughs echoing in the halls, blazing fires, and the presence of an unexpected guest. To worsen matters, Jane finds herself falling in love with her master despite the fact that she suspects he is concealing a secret past of himself from her and others. Exactly what is it and will Rochester ever be romantically interested in &quot;plain&quot; Jane? To unearthen the answers, one has to enter the allure, intrigue, and enigma of Charlotte Bronte's delightful story of the struggles, identity, and emotions of a heroine on a quest for her destiny: Jane Eyre. --P. J. Persad"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"One of the greatest love stories ever told. If you haven't read this novel yet, you don't know what you are missing. The language is beautiful, and the love between Mr. Rochester and Jane will surely make anyone's heart melt. It will rekindle one's belief in true love. Once you read it, you will want to read it again right away! Don't miss actor Timothy Dalton's portrayal of Mr. Rochester in the BBC adaptation! Also, Timothy's performance as Heathcliff in the 1970's Wuthering Heights adaptation is excellent as well!

Little did I know that this novel would capture my attention and hold it steady for three days. The character development was excelent. I felt like I was going through the trials and tribulations with Jane. I wanted to walk up to her and tell her my opinion of what to do. The story winds in ways I didn't think possible. I would be half-way through and wondering what could happen next since there was so much book still left to read. The reading was slightly complicated for me and I would have to stop and ask my parents what this (or that)old english word meant.

One of my favorite novels of any I have ever read."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This book's main plot, Jane's growing love for her student's caretaker, seems almost fluffy. But as the heart of the story unfolds, it plays as an example of the &quot;classes&quot; of her time, and how Mr. Rochester, her love, treated her with equality. The truly talented writer, through actions and descriptions, depicted in this book a simple and plain girl's mistreatment from her aunt and cousins in her childhood and how her past affected her future.

You'd think I'd have learned my lesson by now, but... Anyway, this is a wonderful book. The more I read the Bronte sisters' novels, the more I like them.The eloquence in language throughout this novel doesn't dilute its greatness by hindering the reader of today by having to decipher the meaning of each sentence. The story, though incredible, is also believable because it is told through the eyes of the one who experiences it. The characters are well-rounded, the plot is juicy, and the climax is fabulous. I love how, even though it is told in past tense, it is as though Jane is reliving each moment and her moods inside the narrative correspond to whatever is happening in her life at that time. It makes her seem even more real.It is a long book, but definately worth picking up!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This was a terrible book to try to follow.

Email me your comments."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Alright, I admit that I am a student and was forced to read this book.That said, I still do not understand what would ever bring anyone to consider this work remotely good, much less classic. Ms. Bronte's writing, while properly structured, lacks any ability to move or inspire a reader. Her character-- for there is only one character, the rest are mere background-- is a selfish brat who eternally whines about the unfairness of the world, except of course when that unfairness works in her favor, when she either glories in other's pain or trying to inflict more upon them. ... Bronte strains one's gullibility often throughout the novel, especially in its conclusion where she apparrently runs out of ideas and starts inserting magic and telepathy into an otherwise reality-based novel for the purpose of bringing the characters back together. She clumsily tries to blugeon the reader into the appropriate emotional state by cutting out any scene which is not miserable (including a goodly eight years in which Jane has friends, a good lifestyle, and a promising career-- the author claims they contain \\"no significant interest\\"), and her lack of subtlety has on numerous occasions given me an actual headache.As to the love story- where is it? The plot of the book consists of two things only: a small child growing up to get revenge on all those who she disliked as a child (everyone), and an adolescent sexual fantasy involving breaking a proud spirit and mutilating it at one's pleasure. (\\"Reader, I married him.\\"--of course HE had nothing to do with it.) Oh, yes, and i forgot: hatred of everything and blindness to all that is good. That's three things, i guess. These bleary tales are obviously the product of a small and vicious person, and I sincerely hope that if another Charlotte Bronte comes into being, she becomes a recluce and leaves us normal, relatively happy people alone. (The original did one, it seems, but not the other.)This book, if it has any value at all, is to show the world the darkness of man's nature. If one wishes such a book, read Macbeth or Lord of the Flies, for at least their authors knew how to tell a story.Do not buy this book."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Irony, in small doses, isn't too bad. In fact, it is sometimes enjoyable. But this book takes irony to the next level. If Dickens' Tale of Two Cities was ironic, then it's met it's match. Mrs. DeFarge also being Little Girl with Bad Past is nothing compared to this. Honestly, what are the chances of stuff like this REALLY happening? The guy you want to marry just happens to have a crazy lady harbored upstairs, who happens to be his wife? The people who save you from starvation and death just so happen to be the nearest and dearest relations you have? Give me a break. Every new twist and turn of the 'unexpected' plot made me sick.

That perspective is that this book is one of the most boring, bland, lifetime-ish wastes of paper known to (wo)man. To give an example of what I mean, it takes 3 CHAPTERS to lead up to the failed wedding! The author goes into great detail describing every little minute insignificant meaningless thing that happens (such as a chapter for her to say she didn't want Rochester's gifts)-and it takes her 20 frickin pages to say that she's leaving a guy.

It is a classic love story that features many brilliant twists in the plot. It includes characters that are well developed and realistic, which makes it easy for the reader to relate to them. The book has a wonderful theme about relationships that easily applies to life today.I suggest that people ages 14 through 18 read this book. Younger readers may find it difficult to read because Bronte's writing style is somewhat advanced.I would read this book again, and easily be swept away once more to Jane's life at Thornfield Hall. It's a shame that the author did not write a sequel, because she easily could have continued on and embellished on the latter half of Jane's life to create another terrific and more enchanting story than the first.I greatly enjoyed this novel because it was fast-paced and there were so many shocking coincidences that it almost seemed like a fairy tale.

As it's so long, the class only had to read half of it, but I felt compelled to read the rest at home as I really felt for the character, and I felt like I'd just die if I didn't find out what happens to her! That's what defines any good book: only if the reader is made to feel for the characters can they be interested enough to take in the issues raised in the novel. I usually find that novels that are fun to read, about characters that readers warm to, are generally superficial, whereas novels involving two-dimensional characters contain relevent and worthwhile morals and issues for us to dwell on.

It is a journey beginning with the innocence of a young girl, an orphan, and unfolds to show us the growth of the female protagonist in her search for an identity, helping us to see the world through her eyes.Bronte's style of writing is such, that the confusion and bewilderment young Jane feels is palpable, as is her hunger to be loved and the hurt she feels, on being ill-treated. The novel cannot be called an autobiography, but many of the incidents that go into the making of the novel have been taken from the life of the author. There is also an element of the supernatural, which appealed greatly to the readers of the time but does not invoke the same response today.The book also gives us an insight into the age in which the author wrote. The position of women, in the society or rather the lack of it. The portrayal of Rochester's wife in the attic at Thornfield can be interpreted as the darker side of Jane's personality. The part of her that she suppresses after being locked in the \\"Red Room\\" at the Reed mansion. Mad bertha is that part of Jane that she has to lock away in order to be accepted in a stifling and prudish Victorian society."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Well, I can't call Charlotte Bronte another Marlowe, Shakespeare, or Dickens. But what I will call her is a very close runnerup. Bronte masterfully shows us a young girl's growth in an abusive environment to a mature an admirable woman. The images are deep and convincing. The scene where Jane forgives her abusive aunt is very touching and memorable. Bronte also strikes us with the complex Rochester. Perhaps Bronte's greatest accomplishment is how she makes Jane such a Christ like figure. It is interesting that this novel came out in 1847. It is also possible to wonder if this work inspired Charles Dickens' masterpiece &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1850)."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I have read this book in Hungarian, but I know it is as good in English as in my mother language...

I do NOT think the woman in the attic (Bertha, Rochester's first wife) is a lunatic. I think her actions, although violent, are justified (ripping Jane's veil to shreds- She doesn't want her husband marrying another woman while she is locked in the attic). Though this review appears negative, I really did like the book.

Although many disagree, I think that Jane goes into too much detail about every single thing that goes on in her life. We could understand the story and enjoy the themes of it without reading so many detailed descriptions of unimportant things! Overall, I would recommend this book to people, but I would suggest to skip the things that do not seem important."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I just finished reading &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; for my grade twelve English class. I borrowed the book from my school library. About four chapters into the book, I returned the novel to the library, and went out that night to get my own copy.I cannot express in words how this novel has touched my heart. The musical nor the movie will never ever return the stirring of emotion that I felt for Jane's character while reading it from the creative and romantic mind of Charlotte Bront. I did cry when Jane witnessed the death of her very best friend, Helen Burns, in Lowood School. I felt bitter and angry when Mr. Rochester did not tell Jane about his first wife, but I also felt relieved when Jane and Mr. Rochester rekindled their love to face a new life together.If there is one novel that will ever touch my heart, look at my life as a woman, and respect the heroics that women of past ages have undergone, this is the novel.Jane Eyre: this will be a novel respected for ages to come."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"This book is a wonderful book, but it drags quite a lot. Half of the book is Jane rambling on about Mr. Rochester. This book is very religious (this i don't mind) and Jane rambles on about this later on in the book. Nonetheless, the book was great. It had a many twists and turns. Yet it ticked me off that it all fell into place all of a sudden, for it dragged the conflicts. The book brings up Jane from a young girl of 8 to a woman of 19. This book would bring tears to your eyes. Don't get deceived by the first 150 pages. It is not all dull dull dull. The plot builds up like a snail crawling on grass but then at the top it falls like a roller-coaster. I do praise Charlotte for this work of art. It is as sweet as can be though I am not for romances."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I did not read this novel for school or for a book club; just for my pure enjoyment and did I ever enjoy it! I was a little intimidated by some of the reviews saying it was a 'romance novel' which I can't stand...but after reading it I realize, \\"Yes, it is a romance novel but also a mystery and many other things!\\" I am very surprised that I liked it or even bothered reading it everyday but to tell you the truth it is suspensful and intriguing. There is something about Charollet's writing that captured my imagination and the story line of Jane and Mr. Rochester is enchanting. A great romanitc/mystery/gothic novel for everyone!"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"In the 156 years since its publication, Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre has been a source of controversy - first, over its suitability for and, later, its portrayal of women. When it first emerged in three volumes from the British publishing house of Smith, Elder, and Company under the nom de plume of Currer Bell, it was popular in spite of being deemed unsuitable reading for the Christian woman. Ironically, a century and a half later, it's come under feminist criticism for its allegedly archaic and weak depiction of the Victorian woman.The story itself is familiar to many. The orphaned Jane is left in the care of her mean-spirited aunt who pampers her own selfish children. The aunt can't abide Jane's willful temperament and banishes the child to Lowood, a charity school run by the hypocritical, Bible-thumping Brocklehurst. After disease epidemics for reform, Jane becomes a teacher at Lowood and then a governess for the adopted daughter of the mysterious Mr. Rochester - a man whose many secrets threaten to destroy Jane when she falls in love with him in spite of herself.In large part, the novel is autobiographical. Bronte herself was born in Yorkshire in 1816 and sent to live with an aunt when her mother died. She and her sisters were sent to Cowan Bridge - a strict Methodist charity school where two of Bronte's sisters died (and became the inspiration for Jane's saintly schoolmate, Helen Burns). Bronte became a teacher and then a governess herself, a position she detested.Jane Eyre is a blend of romance, Gothic horror, and a literary form known as Bildungsroman - an internal and external first-person account of coming-of-age. This is the most basic sense in which Jane Eyre is radical - most coming-of-age stories were (and, for that matter, continue to be) told about boys. Jane Eyre's story is not only about a girl, but about a girl who rebels against social conventions on her own principles.Ultimately, the story is about choices and extremes Jane faces and her journey to finding a middle ground that is suitable for her and doesn't compromise her personal integrity.Spiritually, Jane is faced with Brocklehurst - the epitome of the sanctimonious Evangelical movement. She then meets Helen Burns, whose love for God is certainly sincere, but leads to passivity and self-denigration. Later, Jane finds her counsin, St. John, whose religion is neither hypocritical nor meek, but leads to ambition and self-righteousness. Jane navigates the extremes to find her own understanding of love for God, ending her tale with, \\"Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus\\".Jane equally struggles to find her ambiguous place in the structure of Victorian class society. She comes from a monied family to whom she doesn't truly belong, giving her the social carriage and education of the aristocracy. Yet she works in the lower class jobs of teacher and governess reserved for unmarriageable women, where her intellect and her sense of self rebel, as they did for Bronte.But Jane's deepest conflict is between her need for independence and her desire for love. Rochester offers her love at the price of dependence. St. John offers her professional fulfillment at the price of love - a conflict I found meaningful and with which I could deeply identify. The dichotomy remains 156 years laterbetween ambitious, independent women living lives devoid of love versus dutiful wives and mothers living lives devoid of self-awareness and intellectual satisfaction. Even if few women desire these extremes, they continue to be offered and expected and refusing them can be the same source of pain and confusion that Jane experiences.Her love for Rochester is tempting because he can offer her two things, even as a mistress, which she has lacked her whole life - money and a sense of family. Jane realizes that the lack makes her needy and that neediness can never be the basis for an equitable relationship.Rochester is a basically good man, though deeply flawed. He hasn't locked Bertha away which, to a Victorian reader, would have indicated his kindness given the atrocities of the Victorian asylum. He adopts Adele with little reason to believe she's his own child. But Rochester's problems are largely his own doing and Jane is clearly his intellectual and moral superior - another factor unlikely to make for the equitable relationship Jane seeks.But he does tempt her and it's no accident that at the moment of her greatest temptation, Jane sees Bertha Mason - the symbol of Victorian wifehood - locked away to the point of bestial insanity. Is it any wonder Jane flees?The final third of the book - the \\"Whitcross section\\" - feels forced, overlong, and dull despite its importance to the story. In it, Jane finds her family and her inheritance while Rochester gains in humility and moral strength. With these needs fulfilled, Jane and Rochester are finally able to come together as true equals.The book's epilogue, beginning, \\"Reader, I married him\\" has been the source of much debate. Many feel the entire last chapter in which, a decade later, Jane extols the blessings of married life, indicate that Jane has submitted at last to the mundane wifehood expected of her. However, even the first sentence belies this conclusion - Jane is the subject of the sentence, not the object of it. Like everything else in her story, marriage is something she does for herself, not something that simply happens to her. In it, she describes her marriage as \\"free as solitude\\", in which talking and sharing one another's thoughts are their greatest pleasures. Rather than a dismal descent into dailiness, this is Bronte's summary - that women who remain true to their own integrity and give in neither to the temptation of ambition nor that of meek dependence find what they seek - a love shared by two whole people who are able to remain fully themselves."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I have to read this book for English and I can't stand it. I struggle through about twenty pages at a time, and then drop the book in boredom. I think it is interesting that all the girls in my class have absolutely no problem with it. My judgement is not entirely fair because I despise romance novels, but unless you want a book where there is only one exciting scene, and a short one at that, avoid this book!!! If you are assigned this book, however, don't panic...there are always &quot;Cliff's Notes&quot; :)"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"Tis story had a little of everything, romance, mystery, horror, and more. I love this book and could not put it down. I would recommend it to anyone seeking a beautifully romantic and riveting experience."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"In this timeless first-person narrative, Jane Eyre --a small, plain-faced, intelligent and honest English orphan-- recounts her childhood and latter years leading to her marriage to the mysterious Edward Rochester.What make the story fast-paced, fascinating, and ultimately admirable are not the mundane events and incidents that happen to her, but the manner in which she tells them. Within a few pages it becomes obvious that the narrator is a character who is a master of the English language. Her sentence openers are well thought out, well measured, and well balanced--a veritable fountain of wisdom.In addition, Jane owns a terrific imagination, which coupled with her lust for life, will get her to where she wants to go--but only after she experiences hurt, physical abuse, and much suffering.The novel goes through five distinct stages:1. Gateshead. This is the residence of Jane spends of her childhood, and where she experiences the cruelties volleyed at her by her aunt (Mrs. Reed) and cousins.2. Lowood School. In this school she meets the mystic Helen Burns and Maria Temple, whom Jane admires and sees as a role model. In this school she also endures the headmaster's humiliations and gratuitous abuses.3. Thornfield Manor. The manor is owned by Edward Rochester, who is her employer and with whom she falls in love.4. Moor House or Marsh's End. Owned by the Rivers family who happen to be her relatives. Here Jane received a marriage proposal from her passionless clergyman-cousin St John Rivers.5. Ferndean. A second house owned by her beloved Rochester.While we enjoy child characters such as Dickens' David Copperfield, Little Dorritt, and Pip, we admire Jane Eyre much more because she is proud and shows a fighting spirit. She fights back. \\"I resisted all the way: a new thing for me,\\" she tells us as Bessie takes her to be locked in the red-room, following a fight with the brat John Reed.She doesn't just let things happen to her; and the fact that very same spirit gets her in trouble, she also fights extricate herself from her predicaments. Resourceful is the word that fits Jane. I always admire the passage in the novel in which she wants change in her life and how an epiphany comes to her: Advertise! And that single action gets her not only her first employment, but also her first and only love: Mr. Rochester. But little did she know the mystery that engulfed the manor, and much less the source of the hideous laughter: \\"While I paced softly on, the last sound I expected to hear in so still a region, a laugh, struck my ears. It was a curious laugh - distinct, formal, mirthless. I stopped\\"The author, Charlotte Bronte, a magician of the English language will take you back to England as it was in the 1840s, making you experience the highs and lows of life in England during that period.Jane Eyre is true work of literature that will introduce readers of any age to memorable characters and a story that is inexhaustible in its wisdom. Not long ago I was moved by all the attention given to J. K. Rowling and her lovable character Harry Potter. Moved I was but not fascinated as I am every time I re-read Jane Eyre. While J. K. Rowling is an entertainer, Charlotte Bronte is a literary artist.If you like low-brow romances you won't find it here. It is a story of a woman who struggles with a world in which she doesn't quite fit. While the novel may be read as a critique of both gender and social class, it contains a strong feminist stance:Women are supposed to be very calm generally: but women feel just as men feel; they need exercise for their faculties, and a field for their efforts as much as their brothers do; they suffer from too rigid a restraint, too absolute a stagnation, precisely as men would suffer; and it is narrow-minded in their more privileged fellow-creatures to say that they ought to confine themselves to making puddings and knitting stockings, to playing on the piano and embroidering bags.Or,And was Mr. Rochester now ugly in my eyes? No, reader: gratitude and many associates, all pleasurable and genial, made his face the object I best liked to see; his presence in a room was more cheering than the brightest fire.The protagonist and narrator has no amazing qualities, she's a plain girl and it says so, many times in the novel, but she shows some endearing qualities --which I won't mention-- that readers inevitably discover.Ahead of her times, Charlotte Bronte, hints and unveils as much as it was permitted then, erotic tensions, boundless passions, and hateful marriage ironies. These were not qualities encouraged in Victorian women writers, and Jane Eyre was offensive to many a contemporary. That a woman should expose her inner most feelings, was unheard of:I had not intended to love him; the reader knows I had wrought hard to extirpate from my soul the germs of love there detected; and now, at the first renewed view of him, they spontaneously revived, great and strong! He made me love him without looking at me.Jane Eyre is a trans-formative book from which we can all learn. I always say that the depths of human emotions one doesn't find in either in psychology book or philosophical tracts--but only in fiction. \\"Reader, I married him.\\"Read it!The writing techniques I use in this article are all explained in Mary Duffy's writing manual:Sentence Openers"},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I loved the cover to this book.

The novel, dense, surprising and powerful, is illuminated in these remarkable illustrations by Fritz Eichenberg. (You are able to view a sampling of them on this page.)

The passion and surprises are well worth your time."},{"Title":"Jane Eyre (Everyman's Classics)","review":"I think I like this book for the reasons that make some other people hate it. Jane and Mr. Rochester are not the typical protagonists of this kind of story: Mr. Rochester is not the usual Prince Charming, nor is Jane the usual beautiful princess. He is cold, self-centered and doesn't like children; it is difficult to see at first why she loves him. She is poor, plain and unladylike. A quiet rebel, not a fire-spewing one. She wants Mr. Rochester all right, but under her own terms. All this is narrated with unsurpassed intensity of feeling and beautiful language. The passages in which Jane uses her paintings to reveal her love for Mr. Rochester, are simply exquisite, like when she draws herself as the plain governess that she is, comparing herself with her alleged rival, a gorgeous woman of fashion, or when she draws a portrait of Mr. Rochester in order to have before her &quot;the face of a friend.&quot;A few clumsinesses of the plot can be forgiven considering the times in which the novel was written. For example, Jane receiving a big inheritance coming just from nowhere, or Mrs. Rochester being killed all too timely. At Jane's time, the only way a woman of her condition could be independent was to be independently wealthy, and the only way for her to have that kind of money was to inherit it. Also, if she went back to live with Mr. Rochester (as she clearly intends to do), while his first wife was still alive, most probably the novel would have been considered too scandalous for publication.I have read this lovely book I don't know how many times, and I always find it exhilarating and haunting. Being a fan of Jane Eyre doesn't seem to be considered intellectually glamorous these days, but then, I plead guilty to it.
