(For you younger kids who haven't learned about it yet in your History classes, the Al Franken Decade was the 1980s.)This book is probably my favorite of all of Al's books. Besides being hilarious, it's full of a lot of great advice.Oh, the fun I had reading it!"},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"Al Franken is a funny guy, and I've enjoyed him on SNL back in those halcyon days. But-- This book is like a very prolonged standup routine, or one of his valedictorian addresses. It is mildly amusing, but NOT WORTH $$$--I couldn't help but think of all the trees that were chopped down to make the paper for this fluff-piece he admittedlywrote on airplanes and I suppose while in the can. This isone of those books that is fun to thumb through in a bookstore, but it joins the teeming mountain of fluff booksthat litter every bookstore, books that you wonder how theyever got published. It's mildly amusing, BUT NOT WORTHPAYING FOR, BELIEVE ME! I have learned my lessonand you will thank me, too."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"Franken set a high standard when &quot;Rush Limbaugh&quot; came out, but many were expecting a return to excellence with &quot;Why Not Me?&quot;. I may have been disappointed then, but now Franken is back. He shows that not only can he do excellent (and occasionally mediocre) political satire, but he can add humor to the oversaturated advice-book fad that has been around for so long. At least this book will not be quite as politically divisive- I can instead look to the variety and quality of his humor spectrum to be a book I can return to often with pleasure."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"Al Franken's new book is hilarious! I bought it as a gift for someone else but wound up reading it myself. There are many laughs on every page. Funny, funny, funny."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"I picked this book up as a high school senior, noticing the title to be a parody of Dr. Sues' \\"Oh, The Places You Will Go.\\" (A popular gift from parents to their high school grads) Actually, my first thought upon seeing the cover was, \\"Lewis Black wrote a book?\\" Seriously, don't the two look alike? This book is filled with practical advice, wrapped in dry, dark, humor. A great book for your intellectual teen or high school graduate.Al Franken for president 2016!"},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"I really enjoyed the Rush book as well as &quot;Why not me&quot;. There are a few recycled themes here, but all in all, a pretty good book.If you are a Franken fan, don't miss this one."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"To a certain extent, there are far too many books out there in which an author tries to tell us how to get the most out of life. Most of these self-help authors are hardly qualified to give advice as they are written by authors that know nothing about life (at least not life in the real world). Franken has written a parody of all these terrible books.Franken pokes fun at youth, middle age, and old age. His best jokes are related to sex and the woman you will marry versus the woman you want to marry. Perhaps his best jibes are at old age and comparing violent video games to the cultural impact of the Beatles.I enjoyed this book as a fan of Franken's, but would probably not advise reading it unless you are really in tune with his style of humor."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"Al Franken is a very funny man. 'Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot' was an absolutely hilarious tome, and 'Why Not Me' was not far behind. Unfortunately, this new book, while entertaining overall, just doesn't pack in the laughs as much as his prior efforts. There are exceptions: the Chapter Summaries are almost uniformly funnier than the chapters themselves, and the section on Al's commencement speeches is side-splitting. I just hoped for a lot more from this master satirist."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"This is an excellent book, Al Fraken it at it again with this very funny book. I wish it was a little longer than it is, I finished it in 2 days, for $20 I would like a little more to read. The only huge problem was the fact that this book got a little dull at times, but most of it was very funny. I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"This book is fun in the same way as watching someone slip on ice. You laugh for a few seconds as the person flops around and then spend the rest of your time in shared agony.I did have a few hee hee moments, but not the Prozac induced belly laughs as the other reviewers on this page.Amusing yes... hilarious, oh I don't think so."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"Al Franken has written another acerbic and hilarious book that's a must read for all who've grown tired of living in Dr. Phil's America.Every page is a testament to Franken's humor, intelligence and delight in the absurdities of our culture.And whether you thought Rush Limbaugh was indeed a big, fat idiot or a prophet of the modern age (albeit a deaf one), \\"Oh, The Things I Know\\" will simply make you laugh out loud."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"Al Franken has nearly trumped his other great works (Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot, Why Not Me?, and I'm Good Enough, I'm Smart Enough, and Doggone It, People Like Me!) with \\"Oh, the Things I Know.\\" He has retrieved his crown as the greatest living political satirist. Beware: there isn't much of his terrific liberal humor in this book, but this book, like all of his others, kept me laughing. Always taking shots at himself, Franken offers hilarious insight into the quirks of life. I hope that everyone who reads this will read his book. While rather short, \\"Oh, the Things I Know\\" is filled with a wealth of Franken's knowledge."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"I read a few of the reviews for Al Franken's \\"Oh, the Things I Know\\" and found that opinion was all over the place. I loved the book, but would be hesitant to suggest it to friends because not everyone is going to get a kick out of Franken's philosophy, especially his Howard Stern-like comedic honesty. Come on, you just don't talk about some stuff. At least I don't. But when a comedian addresses sensitive issues, I often end up belly-laughing uproariously. I have enjoyed all Franken's books. I must admit, I got the impression that Al didn't put a lot of effort into writing \\"Oh, the Things I Know\\", but I enjoyed the heck out of it anyway. Senator Franken is a comic genius."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"It's a quick read, and you never know if Franken is being serious or not. I read it in about an hour, and there wasn't anything in there that would make me laugh out loud. Franken should stick to writing political satire, where he is much better."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"My favorite Franken book yet - and I loved all the others. Al skewers the advice genre with wit, wisdom, and a profound sense of the absurd. Buy it for someone you love - and would love to see laugh."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"If you can endure Franken's cycle of hilarious writing to crap to writing about how crappy it is before finally getting back to the good stuff, go for it.\\"Oh, the Things I Know\\" takes great pains to steer clear of incindiary comments so that lots and lots of people who don't know a college graduate well enough to get them something they really want will buy this book as a graduation gift.Unfortunately for Franken, he's playing to the right audience - the over 35 buyer of the gift for a college graduate - who will likely flip through a few pages and chuckle before setting it back down. Because the book isn't comforting, uplifting or even really that funny for the market.[...]"},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"I thought this would turn out to be a fairly thin satire of the admittedly hideous Dr. Seuss feel-good book, but I was wrong. After flipping through it in the bookstore and laughing out loud a few times, I realized it was much funnier than that, so I had to buy it. Franken manages to skewer the entire advice-giving industry (and say some very funny things about Rush Limbaugh, that I think even Rush would find amusing) in a very fresh way. It's also, quite obviously, a great gift for recent graduates."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"Love Al Franken. But this book had one real laugh, and that was a retelling of a Buddy Hackett joke. The conceit of the book is that Al Franken is giving advice, or non-advice, to a class of recent graduates. The book is deep in mock-genuiness and irony, which in some circles, passes for humor. \\"OH\\" has Franken posing as an mock-pompous advice giver, providing \\"bons mots\\" that make him appear insensitive, boorish and rude. Some of his jokes were appalling. Of one wealthy grande dame who claimed it was impossible to be too rich or too thin, that she wouldn't think that after she got OVARIAN CANCER! The \\"joke,\\" I know, is that it is absurd for the real Al Franken to say something so horrible and cruel. But I have grown out of the stage of thinking that mock cruelty is funny. Franken used this same mock-irony to deliver lame jokes that were just mean and awful - with or within the ironic lens. I'd just as soon NOT see victims of the blindness and Alzheimer's being ridiculed. And the jokes he makes about detesting his wife made me cringe, for her sake.As an advice book, \\"Oh, the Things I know\\" is intentionally terrible. But as a book of humor, it misses - wide."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"Al Franken is known to possess an extremely dry sense of humor. Therefore it is not surprising that his book is as parched as the man himself. Each chapter is utterly short and sweet. Every time a reader thinks the writer is supplying a real good advice the next sentence jolts the reader back to reality i.e. Al Franken is a comedian. Namedropping is abundance. Name-calling seems to be a norm. This man really knows how to make full use of the freedom of speech in the USA - nothing's wrong with that. But, chapter after chapter of similar ranting kind of tires one out after a while albeit the laugh-out-loud jokes that can be found in certain parts of the book."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"I picked up an autographed copy at Reagan Airport along with More George W. Bushisms; I finished both before my plane had taken off. This book is somewhat meatier than the Bushisms book, and funnier as well, but doesn't compare to Franken's Limbaugh book. The laughs don't come as often, and I can't really recommend it to anyone but a die-hard fan. A much funnier book along the same lines is Ben Stiller and Janeane Garofalo's _Feel This Book_ (the audio version of which is better than the written)."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"Al Franken...you really need to give all the proceeds of this book to your wife...and maybe that will begin to make up for all the fun we're having at her expense! Franken, author of one of my most favorite titled books of all time, \\"Rush Limbaugh Is A Big Fat Idiot\\", scores another winner with this little book.With his sharp wit and conversational style (you can almost hear him speaking these words while you read them), he leads us through the too-often-times hellacious rollercoaster ride of life. He starts with college graduation and goes forward, till the bitter end of life and beyond. It's quite a journey through most of life's misadventures.The title, is done in Dr. Seussian style and that style is repeated throughout the contents. Examples include chapters titled: \\"Oh, you shouldn't skip the introduction\\"; \\"Oh, the drugs you will take\\"; \\"Oh, the orgasms you will fake\\".In the drug chapter, he advises people to use drugs responsibly, and that he would be a hypocrite to say not to use them at all, as he is high on drugs right now \\"prescription drugs, but drugs nonetheless\\". I can believe that one, but I can't believe his statement in \\"Oh pick a religion, any religion\\", that \\"he has absolutely no idea what he will write next\\". Franken knows what he wants to say and how to say it.There's a whole lot of practical advice -- ok, maybe not so practical. Some examples include: every marriage has a \\"stomach-turning\\" phase you need to get yourself through. Or, how about, \\"try to view your stay in a nursing home as merely temporary, because in one way or another, it is\\". There's some advice for men: resist the temptation to cheat on your wife, and try instead to make sex with her reasonably diverting, by thinking about a younger, more attractive woman.Along with his suffering wife, he gets some jabs in at Bill Gates, Kenneth Lay, Ann Quindlen and Maria Shriver to name a few. He shamelessly dedicates his book to that inspiration to us all, (especially to wannabe book-of-the-month club authors such as himself), Oprah.All in all a funny book, almost worthy of five stars. \\"AL\\" (see the drug chapter) would probably want me to conclude this review by saying something like, oh well, if you can't be successful, just be happy. \\"AL\\" Franken does makes us feel happy, despite all of our shortcomings, or perhaps, because of them."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"Horrible.

Al come on, you have such amazing talents, this was not one of them"},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"The title should be &quot;Oh, the things you will read, but shouldn't have.&quot;This book is in the same league as Steve Martin's &quot;Pure Drivel.&quot; There were a few passages that provided some insite into the workings of Al Franken's pysche, however they went away quickly and we were left with stories of his Enron investment's and subsequent need for fund raising activities, such as authoring books.If you love Al, borrow the book. If not, don't bother."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"\\"Oh, the Things I Know!\\", by Al Franken, bears the subtitle: \\"A Guide to Success, Or, Failing That, Happiness.\\" This book is a hilarious parody of the genre of book that offers the reader advice for good living. In the course of the text Franken particularly singles out two contributors to the genre--Anna Quindlen and Maria Shriver--for mockery.Franken covers a wide range of life experiences: sex, drugs, religion, marriage, parenthood, finances, volunteerism, etc. Along the way he pokes fun at many targets: commencement addresses, Oprah's Book Club, the Enron scandal, etc. Both brainy and playfully vulgar, he's not afraid to hit below the belt--or go for the jugular. His prose style is mischievous and engaging, yet drips with sarcasm.The chapters have such amusing titles as \\"Oh, the Weight You Will Gain!\\" and \\"Oh, the People You'll Sue!\\" This book made me laugh out loud several times. In fact, at one point I laughed so hard I nearly fell down and injured myself. And that's probably the best praise one can give to a book like this."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"Not worth the 2 hours it takes to read. It's about as important as an Al Franken spot on Letterman, an entertaining enough interview but well, that's free. This is far inferior to the Ben Stiller/Janeane Garafolo book of a similar vein. Methinks the dullest folks from Franken's generation who now also have kids and too-high budgets may like this drivel. Anyone could write this, it's water-cooler chit chat at it's worst."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"If you really feel the need to read this rather bland work, I'd suggest just borrowing a copy from the library. While Al Franken's previous works are among my favorites in humor, I couldn't even bring myself to finish the second half of this book."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"It takes a dedicated Al Franken fan to enjoy this book. For those of us who merely enjoy (or tolerate) Franken's humor, this book is basically just a slapdown of random, useless thoughts designed only to consume an hour of your reading time and a few of your hard earned $$. Twenty-nine five page chapters give the bookstore thumber ample opportunity to quickly find a snippet of apparent wisdom and interest, which upon reading is swiftly disposed of to make room for the next abbreviated chapter. Several chapters contain nothing but the kind of filler used by a grade-school journal writer to increase his word count (3 pages of areas codes - c'mon, that's 2% of the total book!). Franken can't even use his own jokes, and resurrects Buddy Hackett's. Does that alone tell you what you need to know?For serious and substantial laughs, stick with PJ O'Rourke and Michael Moore."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"After reading Al's book on Rush I was ready to read anything Al Franken wrote. Wow, was that a mistake. Oh the things i know! makes me think Al wrote the book in his sleep. Not only is it not funny, it's not clever either. Al fills his book with bad advice and tries to pass it off as him being humorous. Sure, there's the occasional funny part- the politics chapter- the religion chapter- but overall this Al book is simply dumb and unhumorous. It is a shame Al used his big name to get away with publishing such crap."},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"This book is one of the funniest books I have ever read. Al Franken is hysterical...Every page had me laughing out loud! It is the best spoof on an advice book...as he calls it \\"A cradle to grave guide for the human existance\\". I just finished it this second, and want everyone I know to read it, because I want them to have that wonderful feeling of laughing their way through an entire book. Fabulous!!!!!"},{"Title":"Oh, the Things I Know!","review":"When I reviewed Franken's \\"Why Not Me?\\" I explained that I had read it because I loved \\"Rush Limbaugh is a Big...\\" but \\"Why Not Me?\\" had fallen short of my high expectations. THIS book was even MORE disappointing. The subject matter is worn and the material is not that creative, and sadly, just not that funny. Honestly, I WANTED to laugh- I LIKE Al Franken, but this book just feels forced, the kind of thing that's churned out just to meet a publisher's deadline and get Franken's face back to the front of book racks (Pre- \\"Lies...\\" of course). It's worth reading if you are stuck on an airplane, or an elevator, or something. Otherwise, pick something else by Franken. ANYTHING else by Franken."},{"Title":"The Forgotten People: Cane River's Creoles of Color","review":"Books such as THE FORGOTTEN PEOPLE: CANE RIVER'S CREOLES OF COLOR and BLACK MASTERS: A FREE FAMILY OF COLOR IN THE OLD SOUTH go a long way toward correcting the over-simplified views we have of the gens de couleur (people of color) in American history. A slave (the daughter of two black persons brought to the United States as slaves) woman, Marie Thereze Coincoin develops a long-term relationship with the wealthy Claude Thomas Pierre Metoyer. She eventually becomes free and gains property (including slaves). Once Metoyer and Marie Thereze go their separate ways (or at least end their intimate, if not their business assocation), Marie Thereze continues to add to her property. Her oldest son, the mulatto, (Nicolas) Augustin Metoyer buys property on Brevel Isle and is soon followed by his siblings, their children, and various other free people of color, forming a colony, which includes some of the wealthies people in the very wealthy surrounding community, including, of course, Augustin Metoyer. Many live in very fine mansions, such as Melrose. The colonists live as well off as the wealthiest whites even when economic stagnation sets in. They side with the Confederacy and, after the war, the community begins to crumble.The book also offers us a tantalizing look at the placeage system, which also has its less official counter-parts in places such as Charleston."},{"Title":"The Forgotten People: Cane River's Creoles of Color","review":"I'm responding more to another comment than the book.I notice that cane river creoles are becoming increasingly popular... and some believe they are an accurate representation of all creoles of color across the board, the standards set in that family are not the same set in all families. In proclaiming their own identity... they would discredit anothers. They describe themselves as such an exclusive group... I am not disputing that for them. In many other places too there were similar communitites - but it wasn't always the case... so please take care when you make comments about \\"creoles\\" in general... or at least specify that you are talking about a specific group of people... i.e. the creoles of cane river vs the creoles of lafayette, new orleans, lac charles, new iberia... there are differences."},{"Title":"The Forgotten People: Cane River's Creoles of Color","review":"this book is not a &quot;story&quot; or &quot;novel&quot; at all. this book was intended to be an historical account of a group of people of which, incidentally, i am a part of. the history of my people is not all romance and happily ever after as the reviewer, and even the author, leads one to believe. in doing research of the information gathered and documented about my people, there are several inconsistencies in Mills' book. he even contradicts his own findings when comparing this book to others he's written on the same subject. this book is useful only in that it is the only historical resource we have about the cane river creoles of color, but that, i assure you, will not always be the case."},{"Title":"The Forgotten People: Cane River's Creoles of Color","review":"This brief history of America's &quot;unknown&quot; Southern minority, &quot;People of Color&quot;.

The problem with the book is its title; it sure doesn't shout &quot;read me!&quot;.I was most struck by the character of the author. Louis Wesseling has a gift for honest self-reflection and impartial observation which, when combined with hindsight, make him a compelling writer. Fortunately for his readers he was in a unique position to deploy these considerable attributes. Wesseling ran Shell Oil's operations in Saigon and if ever an economy and a war effort was totally dependent on oil it was South Vietnam's. His description of how Shell operated in these circumstances describes in very real terms how fundamentally economic and military policy are intertwined. His position as chief executive of a company so central to the economic and military well-being of the South also gave him access to everyone who was anyone, and his pithy, sympathetic summations of the major characters of that period are excellent. These are particularly poignant with respect to Graham Martin, the last US Ambassador to South Vietnam.It is the author's character strengths which make this book a far richer reading experience than I had expected (my initial expectations having been set by that woeful title). Whereas I had bought this out of interest in Vietnam and the Vietnam War, I discovered a book with far broader appeal. Wesseling has an uncanny ability to sum up the essence of a situation, scene or even a country in just a few short lines, and this permits him to cover a wide variety of topics with substance -- from running a business in a war zone to how the US oil companies so quickly forsook US interests and allies in order to keep favor with OPEC during the 1973 oil embargo.My strong advice to the book's publisher is to change the title and promote it a bit; it is deserving of a much broader readership!"},{"Title":"Fuelling the War: Revealing an Oil Company's Role in Vietnam","review":"BOOK DEALS IN EXTRAORDINARY FRANK WAY WITH THE OVERRIDING INFLUENCE OF BUSINESS- IN THIS CASE OIL- ON THE OUTCOME OF WAR.

Turning page by page produces striking mind imagery of a war whose life blood involved commercial interests surviving under very extraordinary circumstances. A superb book and as exciting as any mystery-suspense novel. However for me it also answered many of the unasked questions of that time.When Louis Wesseling was appointed to Vietnam I was actually serving on one of Shell's tankers employed on the Singapore to Nha Be run carrying JP4 (Avgas) aircraft fuel. Several UK &amp; Dutch vessels unmentioned in the book also took part on these runs. Rumours of fuel getting through to the communists were rife at the time and we mistakenly thought this would afford a modicom of protection, they are unlikely to attact their own supplies?Of course we appreciated the double wages, the experience and I'm sure the excitement. But in hindsight I shudder to think what if it had all gone badly wrong. An attacked tanker with multiple wounded, where would they be tended? What if we broke down in the Saigon river, where would our assistance come from? Were we really carrying some fuel for the communists?Thank you Louis for writing of your experiences in Vietnam, a life largely unknown to us tanker people until now, even though we were there at the time.I didn't know until now that some of the ships were getting pre-release films! This in itself would have started another war!"},{"Title":"Fuelling the War: Revealing an Oil Company's Role in Vietnam","review":"This is not a military and social history of the war or of the country, but an interesting memoir with the hits and misses of good after-dinner conversation. The book's strengths are in its anecdotes, some of which the author was involved in, and some which he reports having heard. Perhaps the most interesting of the latter is one improbable tale, implicitly attributed to an ARVN soldier, of the NVA hiring ARVN artillery to shell a Khmer Rouge position. The book has several other anecdotes like this involving corruption, black market deals between enemies, go-along-get-along methods, and compromise. The author confesses to rationalizing belief that a general benefit accrued to Southeast Asia in Shell's wittingly and unwittingly fuelling of both sides. Wessling seems to be a charming, intelligent, and practical man. If we cannot enjoy his stories over dinner and drinks, we at least have this book."},{"Title":"Fuelling the War: Revealing an Oil Company's Role in Vietnam","review":"I have read over a thousand books on Vietnam and this ranks in the top five. It is revelatory, a candid memoir of running a major oil company's petroleum assets in a war zone. It tells all: What the home office knew and preferred not knowing, leaving it to their on site managers to handle. Incredibly candid,irrefutable, informative (has one of the finest concise history's of the Vietnamese that really explains them as a people), exciting and even harrowing at points. Just a tremendous eye-witness account of doing business in the middle of a war. The author makes no bones about world class companies trading with enemy in order to protect their facilities and keep supplying the war efforts of the various contending parties. Not since Manchester's THE ARMS OF KRUPP have I read such a knowledgeable and measured history. Talk about page turner."},{"Title":"Citizen and Subject","review":"CONTEXT: Mamdani's starting point is that colonialism caused a profoundly negative impact on African societies, and this impact is evident in the dysfunctional African states of the modern era, wherein governments struggle for legitimacy while civil unrest and low living standards are commonplace.OVERALL: Ultimately Mamdani does not succeed in proving his thesis, and for this 3 stars might be appropriate, but the educational value is so high and the sources so comprehensive that I give 4. The writing style is somewhat dense and occasionally opaque, the volume is a little more than it needs to be to impart the message. The worst of this is the introduction, which may be best to skip. The conclusion is a bit tinged with the short-lived post-Cold War idea that democracy is the answer for everything.CONTENT:Mamdani identifies the \\"bifurcated state\\" as a result of calculated colonial policy to most efficiently rule African colonies. In urban centers, individual liberties were defined and enforced, as in Western civil law. Customary law held sway in the hinterlands, however, and it was the key aspect of Indirect Rule, imported by the British from Asia. It dictated what claims the state had a right to make on individuals. Thus customary law was a means of controlling society, including land, women, animal herds, water, forest, etc. It was disguised as traditional practice because it was administered by the Native Authority - African \\"chiefs\\" acting as colonial agents. In reality it was malleable so as to ensure achieving colonial ends, which were essentially maintaining order, tax revenue, and labor supply.Historically, there were significant institutionalized cultural restraints on the power of chiefs. The colonials liberated the chiefs from these by \\"fusing\\" all administrative power and bequeathing it to the Native Authority positions. As long as the chiefs kept the colonials satisfied, they retained unprecedented coercive power over society that they could exercise for their own agendas. Mamdani terms the result of this arrangement \\"decentralized despotism.\\" His charge is that this structure was so robust as to remain intact even after colonial departure. Mamdani's solution is essentially democracy, though without specifics on how to implement effectively.The main failing is trying to explain all of Africa while actually focusing on South Africa. The colonial experience was very different in various regions and Mamdani is unable to align this fact with his model. His example of Liberia does more to refute his theory than support it. Ethiopia lies completely outside the model, and North Africa is ignored. Authors like Philip Curtin do a better job contrasting regional differences.Mamdani tries to examine Africa in a Petry dish, but it is part of a global dynamic, which Jared Diamond (for one) has more to say about. Mamdani does not acknowledge broad inertias that shape societies outside the particular African colonial impacts. This includes geographical and logistical factors, for example. There is also little acknowledgment of economic factors having much to do with keeping Africa down after independence.There are some fantastic insights in this book, for example, regarding the evolution of a norm of violence in Africa, the inner workings of Indirect Rule, the role of clientelism in Africa's bloodthirsty domestic politics, the vicious cycle of colonial budget desires driving repression of Africans and incurring further costs.This book is not a light read. There is so much of the content that is worthwhile, it just doesn't add up to the grand unifying explanation for Africa that Mamdani wants. Africa is so vast, vibrant, and diverse that it should be no surprise that the pieces don't all fit nicely together. Yet Mamdani's audacious attempt succeeds in another way by making the reader a lot smarter about some important elements of modern Africa, not to mention providing quite an extensive trove of sources for exploration."},{"Title":"Citizen and Subject","review":"Mamdani succeeds in breaking the colonial political system into pieces drawing the distinction between urban direct rule which spoke the language of civil society and civil rights, and rural indirect rule, which spoke of community and culture and describes them as different faces of the bifurcated colonial state.

His indominable spirit and enthusiasm to see and experience what the worldhas to offer is a clarion call to one and all that our world, with all of its' problems,is a wonderous place, filled with fantastic people. Every time I read and re-read it, I want tomake the same journey, and, in reading it, I do!"},{"Title":"Worldwalk","review":"This work has been around for a few years now and is one of those I kept meaning to read, but never seemed to get around to it. Thanks to an Amazon Friend who read my \\"wish list,\\" I received this one on my birthday...Thanks Terry! Anyway, as I suspected, I have missed out on a great read for all of these years.Worldwalk by Steven M. Newman is the true story of a young man, who at the age of 28, left his front door on a small town in Ohio, and walked around the world alone. This was not one of those walks with a gigantic support team or financed by some company or cause. This was a walk undertaken by a guy who wanted to see the world, to meet its people, who lived simply off the charity of others for the most part, and who sincerely wanted to learn. It is actually more of a pilgrimage that a journey. While it is certainly an adventure of the highest sort, it is so much more.To begin with, this is one very lucky young guy. I have been to many of the places he walked, alone, with no support, no guide no special language skills and no special help. I on the other hand, was usually with people, heavily armed people, as I was myself, and I was still fearful many times. There is absolutely no reason that he should not have been killed a dozen times over, either through exposure, accidents or human intervention, i.e. robbery or murder. His journey began in Ohio, on April 1, 1983 where he walked east. He, in his travels passed though Scotland, Ireland, England, France, Spain, several countries in North Africa, Turkey, Greece, some of the Balkans, India, Pakistan, Thailand, Australia and the Western United States. He actually crossed around twenty countries. Steven Newman gives us a first hand account of the country, and more importantly profiles of the hundreds of people he met on his journey.This is a very inspirational book. Newman pretty well proves his beginning belief, that is, that people all over the world are a pretty nice lot, and that despite cultural differences, religious differences, races, creeds, histories, and we are all pretty much the same. Most of us are down right good and a few of us are bad.The author has told of his four year journey through simple prose, almost always upbeat, almost always realistic. I feel the author was a bit nave at times, but perhaps that was an advantage and perhaps that is one of the things that allowed him to complete this spectacular journey. I was quite struck with the author's faith, not only in his God, but in the goodness of mankind...a rare thing these days.I particularly enjoyed the descriptions of the various individuals the writer encountered on his journey, and the record of the conversations he had with these individuals. I also enjoyed his description of the physical challenges he faced on a daily basis. This was truly inspiring.Now this walk took place over twenty years ago and you would think that some, or most, of the material might be a bit dated. Not so! I suppose the one part of the book that did discourage me some what is that not all that much has changes in those twenty years, and if anything, things have gotten a bit worse. Still good people, but, as usual, poor governments. This is a very enjoy able read and I do highly recommend it. It is one of those books that you will hate to put down."},{"Title":"Worldwalk","review":"If you've never been able to travel the world &amp; see how other cultures live, this IS the book to read. I could not put this book down. He puts you there w/ him allowing you to experience his fears and wonders of the strange lands he visits.An unbelievable story of one man's journey into the unknown on Earth. Do not miss your chance to walk our world w/ him. You won't regret it!"},{"Title":"Worldwalk","review":"The only thing more exciting than reading Worldwalk is hearing Steve talk about it in person. He is so genuine and unpretentious that he makes you feel like he would love to have you along on his next adventure. One of the most striking things he tells you is that he took no special medications or had any additional immunizations before he left. In most cases he gratefully partook of the food and drink offered him. His conclusion, that he found the world to be an essentially loving place has stayed with me in the ten years since I first read the book. It is a spiritual journal of the best kind: he shows you his personal growth, he doesn't preach it. Steve is a true hero and should be more widely known and read. I'd love to know wht he's doing today."},{"Title":"Worldwalk","review":"Stephen M. Newman, a 6'2&quot; 28 year old journalist decided to walk around the world with his giant backpack clinger, living only on hospitality, to see if the world is really still a good place. The fact that this is a real story, a real account makes the most impact on me. In the ancient days, people made pilgrimages, holy quests and this is what his story was of, a modern pilgrimage. He comes across as optimistic and faces the world with a sense of humor even though some of the things he sees and the people he encounters are truly horrible. His optimism seems a little forced sometimes, a little overzealous, but maybe that was how he really felt. Anyways, I guess nobody likes a whiner, and who would really want to listen to him whine? During his whole voyage, there were a number of times that he did get lucky, and from his account, a lot of the people he met were friendly and kind and hospitable, and that has a lot to say about the world. So you should read this story, he points out some interesting socialogical standpoints about how people in other countries see Americans, and it makes you feel like being an american is something truly lucky to be. He was very brave, to do what he did. It probably was a lot harder than he made it sound. You can find Steve in the 1988 Guinness book of world records as the first person to walk around the world alone."},{"Title":"Worldwalk","review":"Steven Newman was not a professional writer and he did not pretend to be. But he was on a quest to circle the globe on foot, and part of the deal was that he wanted to record the journey on paper. The most challenging aspect of his plan was that he was not bankrolled. This meant that he had to depend totally upon those he met on the walk to feed and house him. Newman took many months to fulfill his quest and a few detours occurred along the way, but he did circumnavigate the globe. His account is remarkable throughout, and, in spots, downright unique. In my opinion, his achievement leaves individuals like Peter Jenkins far behind in the world of backpacking quests."},{"Title":"Worldwalk","review":"I read this book about 10 years ago, and it has a habit of creeping back into my thoughts on a regular basis. I knew it was something special when I read it back then. What I didn't know then was the profound impact it would have on the way I think of the world and all the humanity it contains.An optimist by nature, I related to Mr. Newman's outlook on the world and found myself reaffirmed through his experiences. It's true that he ran into some pretty bad folks and could have easily been murdered. But, for every one of these experiences, he came into contact with hundreds of good people in every country who only wished him well, and who were indeed essential in providing the sustenance he needed to eventually complete his epic adventure.You will not be able to put this book down once you start it. Read it, and remember it for a lifetime."},{"Title":"Worldwalk","review":"Thanks Steven for sharing a great adventure that I have read several times over the years.

It's especially relevant today and especially for us in the U.S. as we tend to think more in terms of \\"us\\" and \\"them\\" and truly people the world over aren't that different: they all want happiness for themselves and their families.

The author literally walks when possible, uses boats to cross large bodies of water, and whatever means of transportation he can find when he can't actually use his own two feet, around the entire world, the planet. The book gives you a map of his route. Although he does not hit every country, his route takes him through some of the countries that no one would ever dare traverse, especially these days. I myself am an avid traveler, wishing I could travel more, that I had the money and the health, but always having the desire. The author gives his own impressions of other people, and other people's impressions of him both as a person and as an American. The reader gets a real feeling for how those cultures are (or were at the time of the trip) and the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that my own perfectionism does not allow me to give the maximum recommendation to any work.

This autobiography begins with Mr. Washington's childhood where he grew up as a slave, and continues throughout his adult life. Hard work is something that Mr. Washington believed in, and he felt it was essential that all students of the Tuskegee Institute must embrace.One of the things that struck me the most about this story was Mr. Washington's philosophy on how the black man could better his station in life. It wasn't through handouts or welfare, but by believing \\"The individual who can do something that the world wants done will, in the end, make his way regardless of race.\\" The story includes numerous examples of how Tuskegee students would do things (e.g., making bricks, efficiently growing vegetables, etc.) that would bring them respect and recognition in the community.One other thing I really liked was Mr. Washington's belief in teaching students how to be an overall better person. This includes everything from dental hygiene to hard work and it also focused on the moral aspects of being a good person developed through Christian principals."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"The life story of Booker T. Washington was uplifting and inspiring. This shows that a person can arise from the ashes of their life, and make something worthwhile of themselves.

Hard work and perserverance was the only way he could accomplish his goals.Through turbalent times after the Civil War, Booker united the white and black race.

The opinions of an ex-slave on matters of racial relations, education, suffrage, and so forth are certainly worth considering in any study of this period. I loved Booker T. Washington's autobiography for this.But I also enjoy this book because it has character. Mr. Washington gives bits of advice on how to be a good public speaker - as he was a speaker of much renown - and this was quite delightful as I have often been somewhat confused by such matters. Add to this his endearing stories of the white and black races, and you have yourself an extremely worthwhile and enjoyable read."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"Mr. Washington's book is facinating to me as an American history major. I found that learning from a black man what Reconstruction meant to a lot of former slaves was very enlightening. Mr. Washington offers up a point of view that in many cases, slavery served both black and white people well. The lines between slave owners and the slaves were often blurred; not just due to interracial relations, but socially as well.But, this book is not about slavery. Mr. Washington came from nothing and not only lifted himself up from poverty and ignorance, but determined that his life's work would be to assist others in their own efforts at bettering their lives. I found it terribly ironic that the former slaves, and children thereof, thought that their ultimate goal was to no longer do any kind of manual labor. That is what got this country into trouble. White men relying on others to do their manual labor. Mr. Washington's pragmatic approach to teaching black men and women how to care for themselves and learn a practical trade makes a lot of sense to me.The best parts of this book have to do with Mr. Washington's attitude toward life. His observations and attitudes are so positive and broad, that they are not defined by race. I found myself wanting to highlight and underline parts of the book; but the book I was reading was borrowed. Hence I am going to purchase a copy for myself. I do not buy many books; however, this book is one to keep for life. I am sure to refer to Mr. Washington's book in the future; Not just for historical content, but to keep me on track in life."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"...Up From Slavery Booker T. WashingtonUp From Slavery is an autobiography by Booker Taliaferro Washington. Booker T. Washington was a great man who fought his way out of slavery to become an educator, statesman, and political power. He was born near a crossroads post-office called Hale's Ford, in the year 1858 or 1859. He does not remember the exact year, month or date because it was the time of slavery. He lived in a cabin with his mother, his older brother John and his sister Amanda until after the Civil War when they all were declared free. He does not know any of his history beyond his mother, and less beyond his father. For most of his boyhood life he lived in an old broken down cabin containing no windows and no beds. Almost everyday of his life was occupied by some kind of labor. He had no time for himself or sports. On several occasions he went as far as the schoolhouse door with one of the young mistresses to carry her books. The picture of several dozen boys and girls in a classroom engaged in study had always made a big impression on him. He felt that to get into a schoolhouse and study in the way they did would be about the same as being in paradise. After the slaves were freed there were two points that the blacks throughout the south agreed on: That they must change their names and they must leave the old plantation for at least a few days or weeks to feel sure that they were free. After freedom was declared Booker's stepfather sent for his mother and the whole family to come to the Kanawha Valley, in West Virginia. Booker always had an intense longing to learn to read. When he was young he determined that if he accomplished nothing else in life, he would some way get enough education to enable him to read common books and newspapers. He worked in a coal mine to help pay for his education. He overheard a few people talking about Hampton University it struck his interest. He set many of his goals to go there and get a good education. One teacher that influenced Booker T. Washington was Mrs. Ruffner. She encouraged and sympathized with him in all of his efforts to get an education. While working for her he was allowed one hour a day to go to school. While living with her he began to get his first library together. In 1872 he set out to Hampton Institute a school in West Virginia, he didn't know how much it would cost or where it was. His brother helped him out with the money. When he left his mother was very weak and broken in health he hardly expected to see her again, so parting with her was very hard for him. He had to sleep on the streets because the white would not let him stay in the hotel. He had many interactions like this one. He began working for a captain in a seaport unloading crates. Booker gained his entrance to Hampton Institute by cleaning a room for Miss Mary Mackie, the lady principal. Mr S. Griffths Morgan of New Medford, Mass. from 1872-1876 donated his tuition scholarship. Booker graduated from Hampton Institute in 1875. Booker returned to Hampton Institute and started the night school to aid deserving students. In conclusion this book Up From Slavery is a very well written book. It has many details on the life of Booker T. Washington. I recommend it to young kids who enjoy reading about history and how the slaves were freed."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"I think Up from Slavery is a good book, its for all readers who want to learn about black heritage. Booker is a young man eager to learn and have a education. Washington was born in Virgina at a slave hut. Washington attended the school Hampton. In order for him to get in this fine school, he had to sweep and clean the speaking room, one day the superintendent came by with a white glove and ran her finger across every piece of furniture, no dust. The superintendent was so impressed she enrolled him at Hampton, this just lets you know how much he wanted to learn."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"Several years ago I read this book for the first time and was intigued with all the vivid details Booker T. remembers from his childhood.

Other books about the slave condition I would recommend are THE JOURNAL OF LEROY JONES, A FUGITIVE SLAVE, I WAS BORN A SLAVE, and THE DIARY OF A SLAVE GIRL, RUBY JO."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"I feel that I have met an extraordinary man of history after reading &quot;Up From Slavery&quot;. This book is an autobiography by Professor Booker T Washington (1856-1915). He was born into the deplorable condition of genocide which bears the euphemism of &quot;slavery&quot;. He found a way through iron will and determinism to &quot;do a thing that the world wants done&quot; enabling to &quot;make a living for himself and others&quot; through embracing the joy and love of labor. His greatest accomplishment was the founding and building of the Tuskegee Institute of Normal and Industrial Institute from a chicken shack to a school with assets of over $500,000 free from mortgage. He rose to national and international attention as the most influential African-American of his time with his famous speech calling people to &quot;cast down your bucket where you are.&quot; People who accomplish great things are controversial, and Professor Washington was no different. Dr W E B Du Bois in &quot;The Souls of Black Folk&quot; wrote of Professor Washington, &quot;His doctrine has tended to make the whites, North and South, shift the burden of the Negro problem to the Negro's shoulders and stand aside as critical and rather pessimistic spectators; when in fact the burden belongs to the nation, and the hands of none of us are clean if we bend not our energies to righting these great wrongs.&quot; During the Civil Rights struggles of the 1960's Washington's philosophy was called into question by none other than the great Reverend Dr Martin Luther King Jr, who wrote in his book &quot;Why We Can't Wait&quot;, &quot;Be content [Washington] said in effect, with doing well what the times permit you to do at all. However, this path, they soon felt, had too little freedom in its present and too little promise in its future.&quot; These are the issues that continue to develop, and will, I suspect, for some time to come. I was most impressed by the capacity for Professor Washington to forgive. Of all his impressive accomplishments, this is one that spoke to me undeniably of his courage and strength. He forgives the man who sired him, a man worthy of the title &quot;father&quot; only in the strict biological sense. Professor Washington writes, &quot;Whoever he was, I never heard of his taking the least interest in me or providing in any way for my rearing. But I do not find especial fault with him. He was simply another unfortunate victim of the institution which the Nation unhappily had engrafted upon it at that time.&quot; Some contend that his attitudes were politically motivated, yet, I do not see what Professor Washington would stand to gain by forgiving the man who &quot;fathered&quot; him. With unblemished sincerity, he forgave his slave masters, (&quot;man-stealers&quot;, as Frederick Douglass called them). Professor Washington wrote, &quot;I pity from the bottom of my heart any nation or body of people that is so unfortunate as to get entangled in the net of slavery. I have long since ceased to cherish any spirit of bitterness against the southern white people on account of the enslavement of my race.&quot; He genuinely felt that he was far better off than his masters because, &quot;the slave system on our place, in a large measure, took the spirit of self reliance and self-help out of the white people.&quot; Why would he believe this? The epitome of his life's goal was to find and do something which was valued. The very thing his masters could not do. &quot;My old master had many boys and girls, but not one, so far as I know, ever mastered a single trade or special line of productive industry.&quot; Some may, after reading this book, still feel that Professor Washington's attitudes were politically motivated. I cannot accept that idea. I have never known any one nor do I believe it is possible to feign this level of forgiveness. It is my opinion that Professor Booker T Washington is a reflection of a love which is divine. This is one of the reasons I am so impressed with this man, and this book."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"Very interesting perspective on slavery from someone who actually lived through it.

Washington and his march from slavery to one of the foremost men of his time.His views may seem quite antiquated in today's world, given what has happened and not happened in the last 100 years in race relations and it is easy to see how Black leaders of today might be critical of Washington's views and perspectives.But to do so would be to make the all too common mistake of imprinting and transferring today's value system and experiences on a culture and time of long ago. Anyone can look back with 20-20 hindsight and criticize. What matters most is having a plan to move forward from where you are, and Booker T. Washington certainly had that. His is a remarkable story of courage, grace, and iron-willed determination, for himself and for his race.While today's leaders and purists might criticize Washington, it should never be forgotten that he took the first steps and led his race and the entire South in the first steps, no matter how imperfect they may be in hindsight, up and away from slavery.There had to be a Booker T. Washington to bridge the gap between what was and what was to be. He knew his role and peformed it well."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"a good read with much information from the early america era. Booker T. Washington use the brain over violence and suceeded where others failed. excellent read.!!!!"},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"What is most striking about Washington's autobiographical account of his rise from slavery to revered statesman is his lack of resentment toward white culture. Rather than focus on what whites should do to uplift blacks, Washington encouraged blacks to take individual agency over their lives. He believed the best way for blacks to achieve social parity was to become indispensable members of the communities in which they lived. His absolute confidence in black resilience would probably be regarded as naive in today's political discourse. And yet the long list of his (and all black culture's) achievements during this period are unmistakable and nothing short of inspiring.It's a shame this book is on the African American Studies shelf. The lessons from Washington's life apply to all humans, not just blacks. This book would be an excellent addition high school reading lists as a model of the values consonant with personal success."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"I found this to be a most amazing work. In telling the story of going from a child of slavery to the founder and president of the Tuskegee institute, Mr. Washington illustrates for us the life-lessons which can empower any individual or race in our free society today.Namely, look to your neighbor in love, not anger; recognize the nobility in working hard for something rather than expecting charity; be willing to give yourself to a greater cause; believe that people are capable of great things and they will live up to your expectations; recognize the importance of education, not just of the mind, but of the body and soul as well; recognize that any man who provides value to the community in which he lives will be accepted and even welcomed into that community; and above all, trust in God to care for your needs.I highly recommend this book as a testament to the positive result of thinking from a perspective of Love and Abundance rather than Anger and Scarcity. When Mr. Washington's humility is measured against his accomplishments, he becomes in my eyes one of the greatest Americans to have lived."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"Let me start off by saying I'm a 16 year old female...Upon looking through the history section of the store I discovered &quot;Up From Slavery&quot;, the autobiography of Booker T. Washington. I could easily recall reading about him in US history. Interested, I decided to buy it.. Well I ended up staying up all night reading this book.Washington entails his life story of endeavers and prosperity gained. He describes of how he raised himself up from slavery through sacrifices and struggles. With the self-reward of obtaining education he decided to develope the Tuskegee Institution to help further educate his peoples. As well he established a bond between, not only blacks and whites, but southerners and northerners (during post-civil war times). He talks on how as people, one should educate themselves not only in books but in labor as well. In doing so, one will achieve full-on success.&quot;Up from Slavery&quot; enlightened me so much more on Washington and his role in shaping the free life we as americans, live today. I have gained an enormous amount of respect for this intriguingly compelling man. I really do feel a great sensation of pride in our history when I think about Washington and his achievements for this nation. Beautiful."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"This is a very well-written statement of the conservative approach to the quest for Black equality. Written as Booker T. Washington's autobiography, it is important to keep in mind that part of the purpose of this book was to recruit donors to fund the Tuskegee Institute--which meant that Washington needed to emphasize that he was an accomodationist and not in any way a radical. That being said, some of the sentiments expressed in this book seem very over-optimistic in retrospect. For example, Washington says he believes that whites in the South will grant blacks full political rights of their own accord, when blacks are mature enough to deserve them, because people are innately good and will do the right thing. The end of Reconstruction and the advent of Jim Crow laws, along with the intensity of the battle for civil rights, showed him to be mistaken on that point--which is partly why he was eventually eclipsed as a leader by W.E.B. DuBois. Still, this book is a fascinating autobiography and a great statement of the moderate, gradualist approach to attaining equality."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"Everyone should read &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; by Booker T. Washington. Washington was one of the most outstanding people in our history. If he lived today he probably would become President and be one of our greatest Presidents. He had an iron will to achieve his goals in life and to do something to help his people. He started in life in slavery, born to a single mother. Later on he was abused and exploted by his step-father. He overcame tremendous hardships to get an education. He then dedicated his life to helping other African-Americans to improve their lives. He is often criticized for compromising too much with the white establishment. I think however that people need to understand the difficulties of his time and also his way of trying to change people indirectly rather than through direct confrontation. &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; is a great example of this. It is also fun to read. I have a personal reason for liking Washington. In World War II my father was in the Air Corps. For some time the bomber he flew in was protected by the famous Tuskeegee Airmen who were trained at Tuskeegee Institute, founded by Washington. The Tuskeegee Airmen never lost a plane that they escorted. So you see, if it hadn't been for Booker T. Washington I might not be here."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"Over the years, being aware of the great rivalry between Booker T. Washington and W. E. B. Dubois I had grown used to Dubois followers saying Booker T. was an accommodationalist Uncle Tom, and other similar statements. I read Up from Slavery as a teenager, and I didn't get that impression from him at the time, so I usually dismissed people's negativity about him as misunderstanding. Having recently re-read the book, it made a far stronger impression on me as an adult and I feel compelled to give my own opinion, especially since the old \\"accommodationalist Uncle Tom\\" reviews are also on this site.The time period after the slaves were freed was known as Reconstruction. The former slaves were both scared as to what the future held and deeply excited to experience this concept of freedom with the fire and enthusiasm of the Newly Born. For the most part they were very ignorant of their past, of how to establish themselves as a thriving community, how to interact with their white neighbors in a way beneficial to all and how to best use their money and time to grow as individuals. The whites were equally scared as to what the future held (change is often scary) but they were also excited for the former slaves and 100% wished them well. Yes, this was also the time period that formed the KKK, but evil racists were always around and thankfully, then as now, are in the minority.As Booker T. explained, both the owner and the owned had been damaged by the chattel slavery institution. Because the lowest member of society was the slave to whom all menial labor was delegated to, both races saw work/labor as something to be avoided. The whites saw it as something that was beneath them, while the blacks felt they should rise up above it as free men. For them, \\"freedom\\" meant \`I no longer have to work hard.' The blacks felt that if they could get an education they could \\"live by their wits\\" by teaching, being politicians, preaching or any other profession that required thinking for money, so that they would never have to perform physical work/labor with their hands again. They suffered from many misconceptions as to what made a free person successful, such as purchasing a very expensive item that they couldn't afford as a status symbol to show that they've \\"made it\\" even going into severe debt to have it. They felt that intensive study into Latin or Greek languages somehow made them superior to other people and that mastery in these fields also proved that they had \\"made it.\\"Booker T. and Dubois created two models designed to help pull the race forward as a free and successful people.1.) Booker T. Washington's model involved not only a solid education in academics and Qur'anic/Biblical principles (integrity, hard work and patient perseverance) but he also felt that each member of the race should be schooled in industry and the value of Sacred Work/Labor. As opposed to the work they were used to doing as a slave, Sacred Work was the necessary work put forward that not only made an individual indispensable to his community, but it built character, confidence, assurance, dignity and gave the valuable gift of the concept of \\"a job well done.\\" Each individual was to master a trade (or two or three) that was vital to a community's growth and do that trade to the utmost best of his/her ability so that not only would the community be successful and grow but the neighboring communities would also find that community indispensable. This would promote both a brotherly camaraderie between communities as well as help the economy by increasing the competition in free trade. Booker T's model would enable the average man to be a vital asset to his community which would become structurally solid and a vital asset to the nation's other communities. It is designed to build up the entire black community as a whole while allowing for exceptional individuals (like Booker T. Washington) to excel. This was indeed the American Dream model, that through hard work, determination, persistence and education you can achieve success.Booker T felt that because the black and white races went through slavery together, they needed to be healed together. Starting off with nothing, the former slaves needed help in order to get a foot hold onto their future. His model pulls the races together for their mutual benefit; as the black race builds itself up the white race will benefit in the proper symbiotic relationship between two businesses. Yes, Booker T. rightly saw the growing community of former slaves as a developing business and he recognized that no business achieves its ultimate success without the help of other businesses, in this case the southern and northern whites. Just like FedEx and Kinko's or Exxon and Ford work together and thus enhance each other, Booker T. knew that in order to really be successful both races needed to work together (Didn't Up from Slavery function as a business plan for investors, after all?). Of course for the grand scheme of things, for the sake of his race's success why would Booker T. (or any other black person) alienate whites by continuously putting in their faces the evils of slavery and colonialism? In other words, why would a struggling start-up business alienate the banking industry and other investors by pointing out their wrong doings? They would be cutting their own throats. Obviously, if ever there was a time to forgive and forget Reconstruction was that time. And once the ultimate success had been achieved both races would do whatever they needed to ensure the wellbeing of the partner. If some racist bigots burned a cross on Kinko's lawn and threatened to lynch the manager, don't you think FedEx would also be insulted and demand the practice stop?2.) W. E. B. Dubois was actually the spokesman for the blacks who felt that they shouldn't have to work hard anymore, now they should be free to live the way they watched the whites live for two centuries. In the Dubois model, the individual was encouraged to achieve the highest education he was able to. This would guarantee that the \\"Talented Tenth\\" (the small percentage of highly gifted individuals among every people) would attain the mega-success that was the American Dream. Dubois felt that it's the Talented Tenth among every race that furthers the goals of the community as a whole, and that the masses would benefit from a Reaganomics-like trickle down effect. This model, encouraging a work-o-phobic attitude and a individual's pursuit of success did nothing to build the black community but gave the hope that whites would accept the blacks into their communities \\"because we are free like you and we demand to live equally with you because we say so\\" which actually was the attitude that formed the KKK in the first place. Unlike the model of his rival, Dubois did not establish a system that would remove the slave mentality from the people so they would want to work hard in order to elevate themselves. Consequently, the concept of the \\"educated fool\\" was born, with the black academic full of dead languages and abstract principles with absolutely no practical way of using his education to enhance the quality of his character, dignity, morality, integrity or his community as a whole. His community is a raggedy shambles after only a few years of his living in it, because the slave mentality that the Dubois model perpetuates won't permit him even to take pride in slapping on a new coat of paint, mowing the lawn or cleaning up the trash and beer bottles littered in front of his house. Although the Talented Tenth's accomplishments have moved the race forward in very slow increments the average man, with the idea that work is bad and education only benefits a few, is free only to get in trouble or be used up for someone else's dream while he waits for the next minute advancement from the trickle down effect.Obviously W. E. B. Dubois won the debate. Seeing the Dubois model as the easy route to success, they simply labeled Booker T. as an Uncle Tom and waited for their Talented Tenth to do their thing and never gave another thought about the matter. How they felt about Booker T. was summed up by how actor Moses Gunn played him in the movie Ragtime. Does it feel better knowing that at the end of his life, Dubois admitted that Booker T. was right?No. The damage has now been done. People are fond of saying, \\"But we've come so far!\\" But have we? We would've come much farther much sooner if we had embraced Booker T's vision instead of Dubois' work-o-phobic, trickle down vision. They make that statement by pointing to the kind, modern white people that live among us today. But there have always been kind-hearted white people who've honestly wished us success! Look where all the money that helped found Tuskegee and the Hampton Institute came from. Look at the reality of our progress. As a community, after over a century since the Emancipation Proclamation, we have the same mentality we had as newly freed slaves. Instead of a household sharing a single fork and wasting all of their money on an organ that we can't play, now we've replaced the organ with a Cadillac Escalade or a Coach bag or some rims. Our communities are chaotic and scattered with no concept of leaving a legacy for our children. We lack the business savvy to own our own community shops and stores so that corporate predators can take advantage and just take our money out of our communities.Without Booker T's life training fundamentals we still are in need of therapy for the centuries of chattel slavery we've gone through and so are the descendants of our former masters. Just like we have made little progress past the legacy of slavery's inferiority complex so they are still suffering from the superiority complex slavery gave to them. For the whites, they don't see anything wrong with building up vast wealth off of the blood, sweat and tears of others and giving them as little compensation as they can get away with. They honestly don't see anything wrong with playing with the worker's minds to make them feel they are getting a good deal. Because of this, the old wealthy white families who've built their money through slave labor and their peers actually sought how they could continue to take advantage of black slave labor without breaking the new anti-slavery laws. I believe that Up from Slavery is an excellent model as to how the black race can pull itself together into an awesome community, but I also believe that the warped mind suffering under a superiority complex can \\"reverse engineer\\" the book and use it to prevent such a community from forming in the first place.STEP ONEDestroy all existing examples of strong black communitiesSTEP TWOPull out the wealthiest, most productive members of the community leaving the ignorant, defenseless poorSTEP THREEAllow drugs and alcohol to flow freely into the ranks of the poor so that their frustrations and stress will ignite into various crimesSTEP FOURPaint the picture in the popular media (both bluntly and subliminally) that these people are prone to criminal behavior anywaySTEP FIVEWith the public's approval, round them up and fill up the prisons with them. Now they are the property of the State, and can be legally contracted out as slave labor... continuing where we left off.If Dubois' model had not have been adopted, we would have been the ultimate success story, a strong and vibrant community making a major contribution to our nation's prosperity and our own people's legacy. Of course it's not too late to fix it. All we have to do is stop calling Booker T. Washington an \\"accommodating Uncle Tom\\" and get to work."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"&quot;Up from slavery&quot; documents the rise of Booker T. Washington, from a plantation slave to the head of Tuskegee college in Alabama. Along the way his narrative details the squalor and humiliations of his childhood and ends with a number of journalistic adulations regarding his career and speeches. It is a wonderful book, yet curious.Unlike Frederick Douglass, the severe critic of the slaveholding South, Washington's outlook is decidedly postive. He refuses to get into any kind of individual or group bashing, but prefers to dwell on the successes of blacks, improving race relations, and the success of his school- and students. He becomes enamored of his own success on the stump, but such is the case with most ambitious, forward looking individuals. I would have liked a bit more criticism, and fewer excerpts from the newspapers of his time (regarding his speech-making ability.) His repeated refrains about service and merit (being the only true measure of a man), are sound. All in all, this is an upbeat, inspiring story from a man who truly defied the odds, and his winning attitude is sorely needed today."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"&quot;Up From Slavery&quot; brought to light the real deal behind the man Booker T. Washington. Before reading it, I was taught to believe that he accommodated and assimilated himself and the African American race to that of the white race. It has to be made known that Booker T. Washington was born into an era where the slave mentality was not only prominent but socially acceptable. To understand his conservative efforts, you'd have to understand the fact that he achieved everything in life by hard labor. Therefore, in order to promote economic and social equality, he had to promote issues that led to these things. In other words, he felt that the newly freed blacks were not ready to integrate themselves into white society, a society that did not respect their freedom at all. He wanted African Americans to embrace a nationalistic attitude before asking white society to embrace it. If blacks were seen as the uncouf beings that we were thought to be...acceptance would never occur. So, in using every resource available including accommodation, Washington underhandedly promoted social and racial equality for all."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"Booker Washington rose to fame as a great American because of his intense understanding of the American system of government and his ability to stay focused. Booker obviously understood the impact of slavery on his race and that freedom alone was not enough in a country that did not respect that freedom. Booker's ideology coincided with that of Frederick Douglas who would have made the speech at the Atlanta Exposition, but he died earlier that year.Booker's speech was &quot;nationalistic&quot; as he told his listeners to be as seperate as the fingers on the hand and to cast down your buckets where you are. It appears to me that he prefered separation, and individualized education geared towards economic empowerment of the newly freed &quot;negroes&quot;. 90% of all the black people in this country had been slaves and lived below the Mason-Dixon Line. The other 10% were free, yet not free. Tuskegee (Institute) University attests to his abilites as a monument builder. &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; is a story within a story. Booker T. Washinton, according to Louis Harlan was a &quot;wizard&quot;. Even W.E.B. Dubois in his latter years, prior to joining the Communist Party began to agree with many of Washington's philosophies.

Washington was born in slavery, and he describes the first seven years of his life as a slave in enough detail to raise the hairs on your neck. Suddenly emancipated after the Civil War, his life saw no improvement until he finally made his way, broke at times, to the Hampton Institute -- which changed his life.Others have mentioned his work ethic. He had one of the strongest work ethics ever seen in a human being. He graduated from Hampton with flying colors, and was subsequently chosen to found the Tuskegee Institute. On Day One, that amounted to a shanty next to a church.

Certainly it's excellent advice for the American underclass, but suddenly -- with the explosive bubble in college charges -- it's beginning to make sense to a lot of Americans, whether they be black, white, or magenta.

I'm a Southern African American woman who can identify with so much of what was written. Our communities are in need of men of Booker T's caliber.I loved his description of life as a slave and then as a free man...his expositions on the virtues of the tooth brush and bathing...describing what it was like to sleep in a bed with two sheets...how to get along with Southern Whites and further the cause of the Black community.I can see how folks have pegged him as an 'Uncle Tom,' because of the tone taken in the book; almost too forgiving considering what he's been through. Nonetheless, I value his perspective, because in the end one cannot realistically expect to excel among those you bash every chance you get, even if the bashing is well deserved.I appreciate his repetitive statements on work. In this regard, it seems that things might be worse in today's society with modern advances possibly adding to the laziness--poor work ethic--spiteful attitude toward work exhibited by some folks regardless of race. We still have a ways to go. Book sense and manual (I'd add computer/technological) labor can still take us further as a race.Lastly, he spoke out against injustices in a tactful way that built bridges rather than destroyed them.

Booker T. Washington was a great man born into slavery, into abject poverty, on a plantation in Virginia. He never knew his father or even his birthday. Washington was six or seven years old when the War Between the States ended. He lived in a slave cabin with his mother, his older brother John, his younger brother and sister, and an orphan boy. His mother, the cook for the \\"big house\\" was an illiterate as most slaves were, but a strong woman of common sense who cared for her family as best she could. Their cabin was primitive with a dirt floor no windows and poorly protected from the elements.After the war Booker moved with his mother and step father to West Virginia where he was put to work in the salt mines. Determined to get some schooling he did so at night with great difficulty.Washington heard about a school for Negroes in Virginia called Hampton. He set out on foot with 50 cents in his pocket. He eventually reached Hampton and went to school there working his way through as a janitor.Booker T. Washington met race prejudice, poverty, and illiteracy and overcame all of these obstacles.He went on to establish Tuskegee Institute in Alabama for his people. It educated boys and girls not only in academics but in agriculture and useful trades.

Washington was a great American.Washington was born into slavery, freedom came when he was about six years old. As a child, he worked at farming and coal mining, while he sought an education. All of this time he lived in base poverty.After saving what little money he could, he set out from his home in West Virginia, for a black school in Virginia. The school was run by a retired Union Army officer, who recognized Washington's ability.Washington worked his way through school, graduated, and headed home to West Virginia to establish a school for blacks. There wasn't much money in it, but his dream was to help his people escape from ignorance and poverty.When the state of Alabama wanted to establish a school for blacks, the Tuskegee Institute, Washington was chosen to run it. His budget was pitiful, and he started teaching school in a dilapidated shanty and a hen house. His students tolerated these conditions, along with grinding poverty, because that's what it took to receive an education.The school always insisted that all students work while they study. They raised crops and animals, made bricks for sale, and built the various buildings which were needed to hold the school's ever expanding population.Money was always short, and Washington had to spend a lot of his time in the North raising funds. He was a talented speaker, and became famous on that account. He eventually formed relationships with a number of wealthy patrons, who provided funds to run and expand the Tuskegee Institute.By the time the book was written, the Institute had 6000 graduates working across the South, and had trained a large number of teachers to educate southern blacks.This book is valuable, both for the information it holds, and for the fine example of Christian love which Washington models."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"For educational pedagogy, for philanthropical courage, for inspiration and motivation on how to be the best person, read this book.

Washington, is a true classic in African-American literature. Washington opens Chapter 1: \\"A Slave Among Slaves\\" with his vivid recollections as a Negro child growing up in the South: a slave on a plantation in Virginia, a white father he never knew, illiterate and living in horrid conditions. After the emancipation of slaves, Washington's family moves to West Virginia where he labors at the salt furnace and in the coal mines. In his precious few moments of spare time, he learns to read and gains enough confidence to leave everything behind to journey to the Hampton Institute. Later, because of his success at Hampton, he is given the opportunity to start Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. Tuskegee Institute is successful partly due to Washington's extensive travel to the North to solicit funds for the school. The students at Tuskegee, in addition to the day-to-day traditional class work, are expected to learn an industrious trade and to work at mastering that trade. Based on his own life experience, Washington believes that the most prudent way the Negro race will persevere is through this combination of education, hard work and service to others. He believes that the White race will come to appreciate the Negro race only if the Negro people prove their worth to society. Because of his passive stance, many, such as W.E.B. DuBois, et. al., labeled Washington as \\"The Great Accomodator.\\" In other words, accommodating those who were the enslavers instead of advocating for the rights of those who were enslaved. You can get a sense of this in Washington's most notable speech, the address to the Atlanta Cotton States and International Exposition of 1895:\\"The wisest among my race understand that the agitation of questions of social equality is the extremist folly, and that progress in the enjoyment of all the privileges that will come to us must be the result of severe and constant struggle rather than artificial forcing.\\"This speech brought national acclaim to Booker T. Washington and, at the time, placed him in the forefront as one of the leading authorities of his race."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"This is a book that addresses fundimental issues of what it takes to achieve, what it takes to overcome and how valuable the ethics of hard work and education.

Washington's as I have never read about a person in recent history that had as little resentment as he did, and according to him, he would not have been able to do the great work that he did if had spent any time being resentful.

Washington (1856-1915) published this autobiography. Born into slavery, after emancipation, Mr. Washington developed a philosophy that African-Americans needed to sweep away the ignorance that their subservient position had left them with, and earn the respect of the whites through hard work and excellence. In 1881 he founded the Tuskegee Institute to teach African-Americans how to study, how to work hard and intelligently (producing better results than the white businesses of the day), and how to have respect for themselves and others. This is Mr. Washington's story of his youth and his success at Tukegee.This is a fascinating and uplifting book. Though cognizant of the racism that often surrounded him, Mr. Washington never lost his faith in the basic goodness of the people of all colors that he met. The only problem I had with this excellent book was the knowledge I could not shake, that Mr. Washington's faith was not rewarded, and the white community of the day would not give the African-American community respect and fair treatment.That said, though, this is a great and wonderful book, which should rightly be considered an American classic. If you want to read a book that is a window on the America of the late nineteenth century, or if you want an uplifting book about a man of faith and love, then I highly recommend that you get this book!"},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"Booker Taliaferro Washington was perhaps foremost in what he called \\"bringing up the black race\\". He did perhaps more than Malcolm X, Martin Luther King, Jr., and W.E.B. DuBois ever did. Why? Because Washington did it softly, humbly, and quietly. The other black leaders attempted revolution and immediate change - both led to violence. Booker T. Washington's methods led to slow, but sure and sweeping change. He sought reform, not revolution. His life is clearly an example of Christian piety and firm faith in God. These two things also set his work apart as more successful than any other black leader. Perhaps modern black leaders should re-evaluate their philosophies for change based upon this great leader's model."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"I greatly enjoyed this book! I admire Booker T. Washington for his endless pursuit of education. This book is a great inspiration to any student. The only thing that I was disappointed with was the fact that Mr. Washington did not get into his personal or family life. I agree that school can change a person, And I believe that education can greatly shape who a person is, but I don't belive that education is the only thing that molds us. I would have loved to find out as much about Mr. Washington's private life as I learned about his schooling, and his work for schools. Despite all this, I think this book is wonderful. If you know a high school student, or college student, give this book to them as a gift. It is a good read."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"I have read this book over and over. We, certainly the entire world, have been given a resource(s) with Washington along with WEB Dubois. A check and balance regarding African Americans and the &quot;making of America.&quot;In my opinion, one must read DuBois when reading Washington.That's the check and balance.Up ... may reveal that these same attitudes and beliefs are still true of some African Amercans today. However, DuBois' counter better reflects the attitude, I beleive, of the majority of African AMercans. DuBois classic piece of work shows how, though they were physical &quot;slaves&quot; , they were free mentally, and some dared to dream, fight, and speak out even in the face of death. Oh how wonderful to know your history versus having others to tell you their side of your history.So, my response to this classic is to counter it with DuBois. Then, it can be better understood in the period in which it was written.African Americans have so much to be proud of, in spite of .... Still. what a better place this world called America would be if all people were respected and given the kinds of opportunities that America has to offer.What a classic. In countering this classic with DuBois, history definitely shows me that the old saying that all Blacks think alike is certainly nottrue. Not then, not now. Reading Washington alone, is just getting a glimpse of only half the era.Three Negro Classics- which includes DuBois and Up ... should be requried reading for all of education and educators- K-docotorate, law, medicine, etc., period.Now, that's telling the whole story!!!!!"},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"A lot of things have been said and written concerning Booker Taliaferro Washington's book, \\"Up From Slavery\\". Some were hot, and some were cold. But one focus that unites all the varying opinions is that every critic or reviewer agreed that the book is superb. Also, most people acknowledged that Booker T. was a distinguished scholar (despite the overwhelming odds that weighed him down).However, one big fact that most reviewers of this work have consistently overlooked is the circumstances that surrounded both the book and its writer. In order to have an accurate perspective of this book, we must not fail to evaluate what life was like for Booker T. After all, the book in question is his autobiography: written in a country where he was born and nurtured as a slave, before becoming a freeman whose basic human rights were consistently denied.One fact that pops up in this regard is that Mr. Washington was never free in the real sense of the word. The type of freedom a typical Black American enjoys today was an unseen luxury throughout Booker T's life: (1856-1915).In the same period, the life expectancy of an average Black American was less than half of what it is today. This was not because the folks then were all HIV-positive, but simply because any White man could barbecue a Black man right on the street and nothing would happen.That Booker T. chose not to criticize the grievous atrocities that the ubiquitous racists meted on American Negroes is understandable. It was not a matter of choice per se, rather, the swain wanted to stay alive. He understood his environment well, and had a first-class knowledge of how racist America worked. Again, it is only a dummy who wouldn't know that the (first) publisher of \\"Up From Slavery\\" wouldn't have considered the manuscript if it contained anything that will embarrass or infuriate White America. And, Booker T. Washington might be made to pay a ghastly price for authoring an \\"offensive write-up\\". We must not forget that this book was written a century ago: when \\"freedom\\" and \\"justice\\" were very different from what it is today. In those days, many \\"critical\\" Black-oriented manuscripts ended-up in dustbins; and their authors were vilified and hunted down.Today's critics who relax in comfortable armchairs and bellow that this book \\"lacked depth\\" in this way and that way, weren't born as Booker T. was; and I forgive them each time they use that word: 'slavery', in vain. Booker T. died in 1915, and history will always attest that Black Americans continued to struggle for freedom more than fifty years after his death.An old adage has it that: 'A word is enough for the wise'. Thus, I will like to end my comments here. \\"Up From Slavery\\" is a very fine book. It is small: less than 250 pages. Hence, I don't need to review or analyze it with a thousand pages. Mr. Booker T. Washington did his best: given the insurmountable circumstances that surrounded his world."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"This is a must read for anyone interested in early American history."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"The social confines of race are a self-imposed form of slavery, figurative bonds which may be loosed only through the merit of magnanimous work. Much has been discussed in recent years about the topics of racial equality, minority education, and our national history regarding members of the African-American race. It cannot be denied that a great injustice has been served this particular ethnic group, but the future is each citizen's responsibility, black and white alike. Booker T. Washington's reflective memoir, \\"Up From Slavery\\" positively affirms the virtues of equal parts work and study for a mutually successful society, race notwithstanding. As an autobiography chronicling Washington's humble beginnings in Confederate West Virginia among illiterate slaves to Boston society appealing to the socially prominent, \\"Up From Slavery\\" offers a contemporary view on race relations and the human condition. The narrative details Washington's childhood, contrasting the degrees of educational prosperity, domestic sanitation, and religious liberty with the unalienable provisions of slave owners. Washington illuminates the process of ascertaining an education against all odds, laboring in coalmines to afford night school, teaching eager black students, and finally dedicating his life's work to the renowned Tuskegee Institute. Rather tedious in these recollections, the book's plot is unnecessarily laden with exhaustive details and lacks depth in historical perspective. Given the time period in which it was written, there is margin for error in hypothetical suggestions for ethnic culmination, theorizing equal opportunities that did not materialize until seven decades later with desegregation. Individual statements are debatable, such as Washington's idealistic perspective on racial harmony being a non-issue directly after the Civil War, which seems highly unlikely given the past hundred years of civil rights conflict. Explaining the process of rising above local circumstances is the plot's best feature flowing smoothly into a chronological process, specific and concise. It plainly states the South's oppressive environment without delving into racial sympathy, lending remarkable strength. Written with commendable intentions, undue criticism of the white majority is withheld, replaced by cautious optimism and a hopeful spirit. The plot in general follows a logical sequence highlighting one man's endeavors to strive for a better life in impoverished circumstances and his inspiration to freed slaves. Typical of memoirs, the autobiography's focal point is Booker T. Washington's personal account and unique perspective. While other characters are not specifically elaborated, Washington is quick to credit his teachers, mentors, and benefactors in gracious tribute. Their admirable attributes are illuminated in model exemplification, deliberately but briefly identified. Not presenting thoroughly interesting characters for lack of breadth, the reader is focused on Washington himself rather than other outstanding individuals. His personal beliefs are well defined, confided in a trusting tone. Instead of feeling familiar with a cast of literary icons, the reader is acquainted with the author's own integrity and moral fiber. The main character is a sound representation of autobiographical focus, developed, interesting, and personal. In spite of race and social position, hard work employs utmost application in striving to reach full potential and earnest effort begets its own reward. \\"The man who can do something that the world wants done will in the end make his way regardless of race My experience is that there is something in human nature which always makes an individual recognize and reward merit, no matter under what colour of skin merit is found.\\" Washington introduces his commentary on physical labor's role in mental preparation with that solid statement, proven true the world over. People are generally more alike than different, united in faith, hope and love, set to the same toil with the same ultimate goal. \\"Up From Slavery\\" \`s central theme corresponds with reality's unprejudiced outcome of individual prosperity through rigorous application. In a progressive attempt to improve society, citizens are bound not by the iron chains of a ruling majority's tyranny but a communal commitment to self-improvement. Although borders, language and culture differentiate ethnic civilizations, their people endeavor for the same fundamental mores. Education, religion, freedom, and a reasonable level of personal satisfaction are sought by all races. Black and white, Asian and Latin American. Catholic, and Jewish, Buddhist and Baptist. English and Spanish, Mandarin and Ebonics. Beneath any layer of flesh, colored or pale, blood runs red as slavery's symbolic rose. People share their humanity if not their race, undivided for the betterment of our society through collective ability. The continuing popularity of Booker T. Washington's \\"Up From Slavery\\" originally published in 1903 has fostered universal awareness for nearly one person at a time by appealing to the heart, the mind, and the common human soul. When an individual improves his mind, converges the efforts of bodily work and recognizes the plight of fellow human beings, his life is changed. The world glows with the amber of hope for a united future, one person at a time."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"This book has opened my eyes to the socialization of the so called \\"Negro \\".

He was simply another unfortunate victim of the institution which the Nation unhappily had engrafted upon it at that time. - Booker T. Washington's Up From Slavery (Chapter 1)Booker T. Washington gives us all the blueprint for how an African man can succeed in the American system. He must forgive any person in power who wrongs him, his family, and/or his community. In the 21st century the African man must perform more acts than forgiveness. He must: erase the bass from his voice, tighten his lips and the rest of his body to minimize African features, show hatred of African people or an indifference to their suffering. If an African man shows any of the attitudes mentioned or a combination of those attitudes, he will succeed in the current American system.

I was fascinated and inspired by Washington's quiet and humble manner as he describes what it was like to be a slave as a youth. Washington traces his struggle for an education, and his later challenges and trials as an educator. His account of the building and molding of the Tuskeegee Institute is one of the most inspiring stories I have read in years. Washington did not want to have anything handed to him. He wanted to earn every goal he set for himself, and earn them he did. His influence was and continues to be incredible.

Reading this autobiography I'm inspired to teach as much as I've learn to others less fortunate. And I may end up being a career academic like Booker T as well. Having started a career in public speaking before reading this book I feel even more inspired to continue this pursuit because its such an effective tool. Booker T was a master orator from his own accounts. Surely all the invitations received (with no marketing or self-promotion) is a testament to his skill as an orator. Slow but sure progress is made. The language is easy to understand yet the structure is complex because there are lessons to be learnt on many levels. I highly recommend this book to all non-white South African especially those of mixed decent and black people in general. Booker T was what is called in modern South Africa a \\"coloured\\" person.

There are few places in the South now where public sentiment would permit such organizations to exist.'Of course, a hundred years later the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist organizations are alive and well in the U.S.I was surprised to discover that this book - although published in 1901 - employs British (rather than American) spellings for words such as &quot;labour&quot; (labor) and &quot;colour&quot; (color).This is an important document of its time that must be read by anyone with the mildest interest in world history and the human condition that shapes it."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"This book provides a snapshot of the world of the US at one of it's most exciting times. The end of the 19th century was the &quot;Progressive Era&quot; when people came together and formed groups and associations that are still with us today. His metaphor of dipping into the cool clear water in which we are sailing for the human resources to build society is as true today as in 1890. His statement that the most pressing problem in America was for rich and poor to understand how each contributes to the whole and to learn to value each other is also timely.Besides the fascinating historical perspective of the thinking of the time, there is the insight provided by Booker T. Washington himself. His adulation of labor is reminisint of Kahil Gibran in &quot;The Prophet.&quot; The most repeated idea in the book is that any person that adds to the economic well being and comfort of their community will be sought out and cherished and that race has nothing to do with it. Coming from a person who started with so much less (he was a slave) that most of us have today and really practicing what he believed makes him someone that we all can admire. To put it in less academic terms, this is a book about an incredibly beautiful person that made me think deeply about myself and the world I live in."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"Unforgettable!

As a caucasian from the north, I had never heard of the great institution he founded called Tuskegee. If you enjoy biography and memoir, don't miss this one. Black history in America is vital information we all need.Booker T. was born somewhere between 1856 and 1858. He never knew his white father. His mother was a cook for her owners and she had three children. They lived in a tiny shack with a dirt floor until emancipation set them free. Poor and uneducated the little family walked to Malden, West Virginia where they lived with a step father. The rest of the book continues to enthrall as Booker T. overcame unsurmountable obstacles and eventually became a distinguished educator and founder of Tuskegee Institute. Read all about it!

The more I study and learn about him, the more impressed I am with his vision, his integrity, and his drive to improve his people and their lot in life."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"Booker T. Washington had every reason to complain and be resentful. He was born a slave, and although national manumission occurred while he was still a boy, very few opportunities offered themselves to the newly emancipated. He fought against the odds to get an education and while he was away at school, his beloved mother died. His biological father was a slave owner who never expressed any interest in his son's life. When he was asked to be headmaster of the Tuskegee Institute, he found himself faced with empty land in a poverty-stricken area. Married three times, his first two wives died very young. His first spouse left him a single father with a young child, and the second time he faced widowhood he had three small children to raise all by himself.He could certainly have cursed fate and just given up; in stead his autobiography is the work of an unspeakably grateful and patriotic American. Washington could not find enough good things to say about nearly everyone he encountered in life or the country he felt blessed to call his home. He worked very, very hard and success followed all his endeavors. Rather than boast of his many accomplishments, he seemed to feel unworthy of the nationwide respect he earned. He humbly described his friendships with Presidents Grover Cleveland and William McKinley, talked of his constantly sought after speeches throughout the United States and Europe, and detailed his phenomenal money-raising skills that brought the Tuskegee Institute up from a converted hen-house to a campus of over 40 buildings.Throughout all his trials and successes, he constantly advocated forgiveness, humility, and gratitude. Not only did he recommend these three virtues, he lived a life that embodied them. Perhaps that's why a person born with no realistic chance at getting ahead, died one of the most admired and well-known individuals of his day."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"The author was highly instrumental in bringing this process about.

Washington incontestably stands alongside other great Americans. Washington created the Tuskegee Institute to promote the education of his people who had only recently been emancipated from slavery. Much of it was literally built by his hands and those of his charges.In so doing they could take ownership and pride of their creation. Washington raises labor from its inferior status to a place of honor. He blames the institution of slavery for distorting the dignity of labor because it \\"took the spirit of self-reliance and self-help out of the white people. My old master had many boys and girls, but not one, so far as I know, ever mastered a single trade or special line of productive industry.\\" Everything was left to the slaves. As a consequence, the slave owners \\"unconsciously had imbibed the feeling that manual labour was not the proper thing for them. On the other hand, the slaves, in many cases, had mastered some handicraft, and none were ashamed, and few unwilling, to labour.\\"Paul Lawrence Dunbar, one of the great poets of the Harlem Renaissance, expressed some discordant opinions regarding this autobiography of one of America's most influential blacks. His tone is respectful, recognizing that, after all, Booker T. Washington created Tuskegee Institute.Dunbar echoed the resentment felt by blacks who felt betrayed by Washington's accommodating stance with the powerful men of his time. Indeed, there is something of the sell-out in his nave belief that \\"the time will come when the Negro in the South will be accorded all the political rights which his ability, character, and material possessions entitle him to . . . the opportunity to freely exercise such political rights will not come in any large degree through outside or artificial forcing, but will be accorded to the Negro by the Southern white people themselves, and that they will protect him in the exercise of those rights.\\"Fifty years later, it was painfully evident that this had not come to pass, nor would without an organized movement to force the issue.For all the criticism he has received, it should never be forgotten that he walked a precarious tightrope. On the one side he had to be painfully aware of the injustices of his own people. On the other, the need of funding meant that he needed to be far more circumspect in his criticism to promote educational opportunities for his aggrieved students.We have the benefit of hindsight. Cut him some slack. He did far more under the circumstances than a lesser man could."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"Booker T. Washington: once a slave, beat down and told he could do nothing, accomplish nothing; now an example to all men, white and colored, raised above others. Why? Hard work and a desire to do good in this world. He accomplished more than a lot, from getting into a school by sweeping and cleaning a room, to teaching at a night school, to starting Tuskegee, to speaking at huge events at which no black man had ever spoken. He met great men, did great things, built a great community, and loved greatly.He wrote this autobiography about his truly great life. He wrote it simply, giving facts in a very interesting way (one thing that he felt was important while giving speeches). I had a hard time staying interested because I was very busy while reading it and felt like I had to rush to get it done. However, I liked it enough to know that I'll read it again in a less-busy time and really immerse myself in it. There's so much to learn, so much to discover in a life like Washington's. While reading it I couldn't help but be thankful for everything in my life. I was born with many luxuries given to me. Booker T. Washington started out with the clothes on his back and a dirt floor to sleep on. Education was a piece of paradise to him; food was a luxury beyond all comparison. I have always had both of those, in abundance.One word to describe this book would be thankful. Not the word I would normally use to describe a book, but really, it is. Booker T. Washington's thanks resonates throughout the whole story. Even when he was hungry and on the streets - I could almost taste his thanks whenever he'd receive a meal or a warm place to stay.Wonderful.

Great for doing a book report."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"I read this some time ago, combined with The Souls of Black Folk and The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man. Up From Slavery was the warm-up, I guess, since it was the least offensive. Of course one reader's \\"least offensive\\" is another reader's \\"Uncle Tom\\". However one can't fairly judge someone from that era using the criteria from the modern time- a fairly simple principle that is too easily forgotten.With that out of the way, let me say that as a southern kid in the late 60's reading this book I was tremendously inspired. We were hardly that far removed from Jim Crow, at least in years, so I think I was able to grasp a little of the obstacles Washington overcame. Still this is less a story of race than a story of faith, of vision, of the triumph of hard work, and the triumphs both in spite of as well as because of his fellow man.The history in not too debatable, as it is an auto-biography. By definition thus the history of the author, and this becomes one of the strengths of the books- the common sense, no-nonsense love of life thatcauses BTW to continually break through to the other side, and bring the reader with him. By the end of the book I wanted to start a college (as he did) and help my fellow man up from poverty any way I could. To not marvel at his accomplishments and to denigrate him with labels out of time is to do great injustice to the man, his relationship with God, and to his incredible achievements.To sum: it is inspiring and real, and it gives a glimpse into some of the peculiar hardships resulting from the peculiar institution, but the process is almost the polar opposite of the victimhood route of today- from someone who could most justifiably have claimed himself such a victim."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"This book is a must for todays generation and for those who feel in a minority.

My first interest in this book was to understand how the Tuskeege school started because I am one of the privliged americans that can trace the education of my ancestors back to the begining classes of the institute. As I continued to read I began to feel even more pride in the achievments on my grandfather, mother and myself. The only thing that puzzled me was the consitent mentioning of how the southern whites were so helpful in the rise and start of the negro's education. Personally the stories I have heard speak to the oppisdit actions and I am lead to ask the question - if the was such a united feeling amoungsdt the blacks and the whites in the northen and southern states addressing the education of the negro race then where on earth did it start to go wrong? For that answer I will have to continue to research and speak to the elder members of my family because I just can't understand how we went from one united beliefe of education to the fight of our civil rights."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"Booker T.

Washington.Born in a slum, having as his mother, a black slave, as a child, Booker T. Washington became free.His father was a white man, and never recognized or create him.In fact, Booker T. Washington had a bitter childhood.Having a childhood cored in poverty, racism, prejudices, ignorance and hard labor; instead of becaming a neurotic, Booker T. Washington became a leader and teaching example for african-americans of his times.In fact many lessons of this book continuos to be usefull for every time, race or place.If you go to all my reviews that I writen before, just one autobiography that I gave five stars was, \\"World of Yesterday\\" by Stephan Zweig.To be sincere in an autobiography is very, very rare.One problem of this autobiography, is again his lack of sincerity.The author was writing about 100 years ago, and perhaps he couldn't tells us, what he was really thinking.To example, Booker T. never claims that segregation, racism/eugenics is/were by definition, bad.In fact, there's many good claims to some knowed eugenicists/racists at that times.The bitter author's childhood (a nightmare childhood), has very little space in this book.In fact, the sucess of Booker T. in education affairs has, big space in this book.Too much space, I think.If we were in 1906, I'll be giving five stars to this book.Being unsincere and having by today standards, some absurds, this book isn't useless, but we aren't in 1906."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"I read Up From Slavery in an African American Lit class, and was totally applauled by it. Washigton is so complaicent, the man was not even angry with white people for four hundred years of slavery. The debate between Washington and WEB DuBois is famous: Wash. wanted black people to forgive and forget and continue to be the southerners work dogs. DuBois wanted the negro race to embrace higher education and follow in the footsteps of wealthy Americans like Rockefeller and Carnegie. Which plan was better for uplifting a race? It depends upon which direction the country was going at the turn of the century."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"I thought this was supposed to be an autobiography!

Two thirds of the book is telling about the school he opened, briefly mentioning his personal or home life."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"This book is hard to get into at first because Washington, in my opinion, isn't the greatest writer. He writes using many run-on sentences and MANY, MANY commas with phrases that can distract you from the meaning of the sentence (as a rule, notwithstanding, to such an extent, this is to say etc...) he seems to state his observations as if it is a fact. He tells how there were such great relations between blacks &amp; whites throughout the south and blacks held ABSOLUTELY NO resentment towards their slaveowners. I found that hard to believe (how would he know when he was just a slave?) Many of his &quot;facts&quot; didn't seem to agree with history and what I thought slavery and black/white relations were like. He almost seemed ignorant to what was probably happening around him. He goes on to tell about his life and spends at least 1/2 of the book talking about his school in Tuskegee...after a while it gets boring and you want to hear some interesting stories about HIM! I didn't think the book was too great or very informative at all."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"I read this book as a part of a class. In this class we discussed Washington's work as written from the 'trickster' perspective. In this light it was quite interesting to see how he points out hypocrasies indirectly, while apparently stating the opposite. Thus, creating a self-aware hypocrasy within the text itself. I'm not sure that I am yet convinced, however.

So he started a school. That is not interesting or invigorating or special. Why would you want to read about a guy who started his own school? Is that that fascinating or interesting? He didn't escape a slave or anything like that, he was emancipated like everyone else and then went to school like many people did--nothing interesting.

Washington. I could easily recall reading about him in US history. Interested, I decided to buy it.. Well I ended up staying up all night reading this book... Washington entails his life story of endeavers and prosperity gained. He describes of how he raised himself up from slavery through sacrifices and struggles. With the self-reward of obtaining education he decided to develope the Tuskegee Institution to help further educate his peoples. As well he established a bond between, not only blacks and whites, but southerners and northerners (during post-civil war times). He talks on how as people, one should educate themselves not only in books but in labor as well. In doing so, one will achieve full-on success. &quot;Up from Slavery&quot; enlightened me so much more on Washington. I have gained an enormous amount of respect for this intriguingly compelling man.

This is a necessary read for anyone desiring success and especially for those that find success in mediocrity."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"If you feel like you have it bad and life has passed you by.... READ THIS BOOK! I usually avoid biographies and autobiographies because they often seem to boast and be egotistic. Booker T. Washington did not strike me as a selfish individual. His whole life centered around education (life-long learning). Think about what a wonderful world we would have if children (and adults) followed this concept. The majority of people never open a book (non-fiction) after they leave school! I have had a solid determination for the past four or five years, to improve my life through books and tapes, and I feel as though I've found my true calling in life... learning! This book is primarily about raising the black race from being enslaved to an educated and highly skilled race. The author was highly instrumental in bringing this process about. He was educated and completed his schooling at the 'Hampton' school with honors. He then built and directed the 'Tuskegee' school in Alabama, and devoted his whole life to service. While this book was very informative, and is considered a milestone by a true pioneer, it is a little bit monotonous, thus four stars. I would highly recommend it nevertheless. Many of the thoughts, attitudes, and sayings of Booker T. Washington have been used by modern authors and speakers, and will live forever. Our country and the black race are forever in his debt for the legacy he left behind. I certainly feel better about life after reading this book. You will too."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"Alina Stanton Nov.15Up From SlaveryThe author of this book is Booker T. Washington. This book is about Booker T Washington. It's an autobiography of how he grew up as a slave and as a free man. It shows the struggles that a lot of poor slaves had when they were freed from slavery.When Booker was young he lived with his mom on one plantation, his dad lived on another. He lived with his mom, half brother, half sister and step dad. Booker really wanted an education, so he started to teach himself to read. He had an English dictionary that emphasized on the alphabet and he read it all the time. Soon the slaves were freed. Booker started going to a day school once it opened up. He was not able to go to school later on because he had to work in a coal mine with his dad. He made a deal with his dad to work on the coalmines early in the morning till nine then goes to school. When he was a little older he decided to go to a school called Hampton Institute in West Virginia. You can live there and work as well as go to school.While he lived there he had to work hard. He had to make money all the ways he could. He worked as a waitress a maid and a janitor. He met a general by the name of Armstrong. He respected this man a lot because he was very important. Booker felt honored to meet such a wealthy man, he liked the general a lot because he was very kind. General Armstrong gave Booker a personal check, which he had been saving for his own use, to help Tuskegee. That summer after his first year in the institute he had to work to pay off a sixteen-dollar debt. His mother died during the summer, he knew that he would never see her again. He graduated that year and then went to teach at the school that he attended when he was a boy. In 1878 he entered Wayland Seminary in Washington D.C. for a year of study. While he was there he made speeches in West Virginia for General Garfields presidency campaign. He graduated first class in Tuskegee in 1885.In my opinion, this is a descent book. It shows how the poor slaves grew up in a white world and how they struggled. It has a lot of information on Bookers life and how he struggled to make a good living and get a good education. I think Booker T. Washington is a well mannered, honorable man."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"As a 21st century African American, I must take issue with Mr. Washington's statement regarding how in all things social we can be totally seperate and unequal.Even though I can understand the practicality and expediency of making that sort of concession At That Time in history I still must question whether or not a statement such as that is a representation of true liberty and justice for all. In my mind it is not. It wasn't true then and it still isn't true today.Despite the tremendous Economic strides that have been made by people of color globally and particularly in the U.S., thanks in no small part to the efforts of great people like Mr. Washington, the society at large has remained very stratified. Attitudes though much improved have largely remained the same. Statements like the esteemed Mr. Washington's have too often served to dismiss the responsibility of offenders to remedy past wrongs which still have impact in the present day. They also serve to deny true equality of opportunity to all citizens. It also accomodates the offenders far greater than is deserved and does grave injustice to black and white alike. Mr. Washington makes reference himself to how injustices done to the black populace are just as injurious to the white population. Yet he does not view social seperatism as an injustice. With that I must take issue.All that notwithstanding it is an interesting, informative, and enjoyable read. Many of the principles by which he lived are as true today as they were during Reconstruction. However, certain opinions that he expressed could have the effect of limiting economic opportunity by confining Blacks to the ranks of laborers rather than entrepreneurs, managers, and other professionals if too stringently adhered to. These pursuits require concentrated study and effort by themselves.So read it but be sure to place it in the proper context."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"Booker T.

This autobiography is a recounting of his struggle from slavery to freedom and on to getting an education and becoming a teacher and then an educational administrator as well as a \\"Black politician.\\"In American culture, this narrative is cast as the quintessential \\"raise yourself by your boot strap\\" kind of story. In fact when I was in the First Grade, I can remember my First grade teacher, Mrs. Pogue, singing the praises of \\"the Great Booker T. Washington.\\"And while there is a great deal to admire about Mr. Washington, there is also a side that only came to light after hearing the other side of his story. Washington was called an \\"accommodationist,\\" \\"or \\"the great compromiser,\\" which in the context of the times were euphemisms for being an \\"Uncle Tom,\\" or the HNIC. He was good at maneuvering his way around in a racist white culture thinking that he was doing his people a great deal of good when in fact he was being taken advantage of, or when he was in fact consciously \\"selling his people out.\\" By making a \\"virtue, out of personal necessity,\\" Washington always had a good justification for his action and eventually became the prototype of this kind of black politician. Many Black preachers still use the Washington template for handling cross-racial situations. Plus how else were blacks to negotiate the difficult racist political terrain of those difficult times?In the book, for instance, he eschews and discourages blacks from seeking a liberal arts education and from attending college, as being frivolous. He argued for the more practical area of the \\"manual arts,\\" and \\"the trades.\\" While this may have been useful -- even good advice -- in the context of the times, there were others of his contemporaries, such as WEB Dubois, who saw Washington's approach as strictly a formulaic kind of Uncle Tomism. And the embarrassing treatment of him at the 1905 World's Fair, kind of sealed this image of him as a Black Uncle Tom by blacks and a \\"stooge\\" by whites.While the book is a good read, in retrospect, it shows Washington to have been very nave politically, and too trusting of \\"the white man,\\" who it seems never quite saw the world as he did and neither had Washington's, nor the black race's best interests in mind. Maybe it is a bit harsh to judge his action after the fact, but all other black leaders are judged by the same criteria and they come out unblemished, while Washington's accommodationist methods do not seem to have held up well over time nor have they bore any fruit.Three Stars"},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"I feel that Washington's book was very much like he was, and that is two-faced. It may have been true that he needed white support in order to get money for blacks but I feel that he didn't tell the story the way it should have been told.

He wrote the book for the white man to read so that he could get their support and their money.

In other words, those who don't cause trouble. &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; displays this side of Mr. Washington. This book is worth reading because of Booker's determination that allowed him to rise above his former conditions. Yet, one can't help but get the feeling that he is all-to-ready to forget what has happened to him. Booker continues to explain, rather naively, in my opinion, how racism is to soon be erased.

Overall, &quot;Up From Slavery&quot; is a decent book, but occasionally tedious."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"Booker T. Washington wrote a lively narrative of his life that deserves our attention today. The first couple of pages are startling for the nonchalant way he relates that he doesn't know the year of his birth, nor the exact location, nor with certainty who his father was. He does, on the other hand, describe the tiny dimensions to the cabin where he lived and what life was like for the slaves.

What an honor it would have been to meet a man who provided so much to the African American man and woman. He was also willing and often did help southern whites in his community. It's ashame that in America, where education is offered legally, there is a 50% dropout rate among African American high school students.

A previous book I reviewed made me curious about how the black slaves in the south lived before their emancipation. This book satisfied my curiosity. More than saying that, I find it is difficult to review this book. Simply put, Mr. Washington tells you about his life and in so doing tells you about himself and the principles he lived by. I feel there are valuable lessons to be learned here. I'll just take two quotes, \\"...the thing to do, when one feels sure that he has said or done the right thing, and is condemned, is to stand still and keep quiet. If he is right, time will show it.\\" I believe Jesus sent the same message. I heard that the great scientist, Robert J Oppenheimer, became depressed after being condemned as a Communist. If so, I guess he hadn't learned this lesson. The second, \\"Few things help an individual more than to place responsibility upon him, and to let him know that you trust him.\\" This was illustrated over and over again in the book. Other great men have also said this, but if it has been heard by most people, in the workplace and at home, it is ignored so much of the time. This book is inspiring. I wish all young people would read it and heed it; then this would be a better world."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"Up From Slavery is the classic autobiography of Booker T. Washington. Washington gives an interesting, alternative perspective regarding slavery and slave owners. This is what Mr. Washington stated regarding his boyhood owners: \\"My life had its beginnings in the midst of the most miserable, desolate, and discouraging surroundings. This was so, however, not because my owners were especially cruel, for they were not, as compared with many others...........One may get the idea, from what I have said, that there was a bitter feeling toward the white people on the part of my race, because of the fact that most of the white population was away fighting in a war which would result in keeping the Negro in slavery if the South was successful. In the case of the slaves on our place this was not true, and it was not true of any large portion of the slave population in the South where the Negro was treated with anything like decency.\\"Washington is here saying that although many slaves were mistreated by their owners, many were treated relatively well.Not only does Mr. Washington offer an interesting perspective on slavery, he was an early black educator. Washington believed that black people should have no privileges because of their color. He believed that it was the fault of the black man if he did not succeed and it was not because of the white man. He urged the people of his race to work for their living and not depend on others for help. When times were the very hardest for the black people, Washington helped lift them up and get them on their feet. He founded Tuskegee Institute in Tuskegee, Alabama. This school began as a small night-school for black people. Washington build a fine institution for the black race by the sweat of his brow.Booker T. Washington did not view his race as mistreated victims, instead he took a great amount of pride in the black race and wanted others to understand what a privilege it was to be a part of it, as this quote seems to indicate:\\"From any point of view, I had rather be what I am, a member of the Negro race, than be able to claim membership with the most favoured of any other race.....This I have said here, not to call attention to myself as an individual, but to the race to which I am proud to belong.\\"Booker T. Washington's Up From Slavery is an American classic. It is the true life story of a little slave boy who grew up to become one of the finest leaders for his race."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"I had never read anything written by or even about Booker T. Washington before. He is not as religious as MLK, militarist as Malcolm X, and not as extreme as Jesse Jackson, etc...The person who resembles him the most is Nelson Mandela. His book is all about forgiveness and moving forward as one nation instead of many races."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"This is a good view of a man who came from slavery to political prominence. He also grew up in an area where my mother frequently visited in her childhood. It's sad to see how jaded the world has become, since Mr. Washington lived and worked for education. He had such an optimistic view of the possibilities for his race that I can't see today. Maybe if we worked as hard as Mr. Washington in this era, we could make it, too."},{"Title":"Up from slavery: An autobiography","review":"This is a wonderful bit of history that everyone should read. These are the first hand words of a slave turned educated free man in the South. It's absolutely inspirational to see what one man with desire and a positive attitude can accomplish.

The writing style isn't the juiciest or most interesting bit of storytelling, but the story itself is incredible."},{"Title":"Between Shadow & Light","review":"This book is by far one of the best I have ever read. I've never read a novel that has so much creativity and imagination. The writer's perspective of action, emotion drama and romance are mysterious. This story gives twist and turns every page, with normal to abnormal writing. It shows how the writer can think out of the box and then come right back in. L.L. Brunk captures the characters in the story so vivid and on point. The characters express, good and evil as they choose there fait. It is superb how the writer gives personalities to each of the characters. The emotion they portray and action they partake is very well explained. The writer describes the thoughts, actions and emotion of the nameless one. In my conclusion this story is suspenseful every chapter and keeps you on your toes. I hope for another novel very soon."},{"Title":"Between Shadow & Light","review":"The \\"paperback\\" version of this book is full of errors in grammar and even mispelled words.

The Kindle edition (Between Shadow & Light-Expanded & Extended Edition), will save you money, being only a $1.99, and the writing is by far better quality. So do not waste your time on the paperback for this book but do check the story out on your Kindle, and I promise you won't regret the decision."},{"Title":"Between Shadow & Light","review":"I Finally was able to read your book.

For instance, many readers, like myself, have read the entire Alex Cross series. In that series, the action follows a brilliant psychologist-detective. Those books are suspenseful, and usually contain a big twist.'Hide and Seek,' on the other hand, follows the life of Maggie Bradford. The prologue introduces the reader to Maggie as she hides from her husband, who she is forced to kill in self-defense and in defense of her daughter.From there, Maggie rises to stardom as a singer-songwriter and loses a life partner to a heart attack and another husband, an internationally famous soccer star, to a murder. The question is, who killed Will Shepherd, the soccer star?Maggie isn't like Alex Cross. She has no training in police work and has no detective skills. In fact, she has to rely on the actions of others to solve this case. As is usual in a Patterson novel, a couple of great plot twists stand in the way of figuring out just what happened.The majority of the novel is told from Maggie's point of view using a first person narrative style. Occassionally, actually frequently, Patterson switches to a third person narrative to tell the story of Will Shepherd. This can be confusing and disorienting at times, but then again, maybe that was the intent. It does help build the suspense.I recommend this novel because it is a bit of a mystery, but it contains a wonderful narrative of an abused woman that has made a life for herself and overcome all obstacles. No knowledge of any of Patterson's prior work is needed. If you are looking for a good whodunit, you might be frustrated because the real mystery isn't introduced until the final fourth of the book. Its a quick read, and highly enjoyable."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"First off, I LOVE JAMES PATTERSON novels...however as long as 'Hide &amp; Seek' is mixed in, then all bets are off. Patterson has an incredible talent for writing, and one of the best things about his novels are how he can get you involved in the lives of his characters, and how you even develop a liking for the bad guys as well...however in 'Hide &amp; Seek' I just didn't care one whit about ANY character in this novel at ALL. It wasn't because I gave up on the story, either--nope, I read this entire story thinking that beyond the next page it was going to get better like his other brilliant Alex Cross novels. Now let me say one other thing, I DO NOT judge this or ANY other novel by Patterson based upon his previous novels, other than he has written so many great books, I figured even a poor book by Patterson was better than some other author's BEST work...not so here, unfortunately.'Hide &amp; Seek' cannot be compared to ANYTHING else that I had read by Patterson simply because it seemed as though it was written by another person altogether. Maybe I am so much of a fan of Alex Cross that I can't read anything that DOESN'T have him in it...but I discounted that theory because I have many other favorite authors who sometimes stray from their main carry-over characters and it has never presented a problem for me in the past, so I was just stumped here. Well maybe, just MAYBE it was because 'Hide &amp; Seek' was simply not Pattersons best work...? I would like to think otherwise, but I think that this is the ONLY explanation that seems to make any sense to me. For those who liked this novel, not only do I envy you (because I really WANTED to...) I wonder why you actually DID? But in any case, I STILL think that Patterson is one 1st rate author (despite this book).\`"},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"Maggie Bradford is a rich, beautiful, charismatic, famous songwriter and singer. She is a loving mother of two, and is accused of killing not one, but two of her husbands.Yes. You read that right.Maggie Bradford, adored by her fans, killed her first husband in self-defense, and, in 'Hide and Seek', is being accused of killing soccer-star Will Shepherd.After reading 'Roses Are Red' and 'Violets Are Blue', I have to admit that I thought that James Patterson could surprise me no more. The Alex Cross mysteries have twists and suspense that only Patterson could think up, and only Patterson could surprise his readers once more with 'Hide and Seek'. I especially love how Patterson writes as Maggie Bradford in first person. The tone is carefree, and he carries Maggie's voice throughout the whole book beautifully. Maggie's voice seems to be talking to readers, the audience. Will Shepherd, however, is written about in a detached version of first person, with less emotions, feelings, and thoughts mentioned. The book, however, is still filled with emotion and romance. Ending with the trial (with an incredible twist), 'Hide and Seek' is another one of Patterson's eminent books--the kind of book that you start reading and just can't put down, the kind of book you get paper cuts from by being in a hurry to turn to the next page, the kind of book that NO ONE should miss out on."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"Okay, some of the other reviewers are a bit harsh, but this book wasn't THAT bad. Then again, it wasn't that great either. It's not very original or unpredictable, but it gets three stars because yours truly wasn't bored. You can't really give a book a bad review if it wasn't boring or truly horrible. That said, I'll sum it up for those of you who haven't read it:Maggie Bradford is, more or less, an overly dramatic version of Carly Simon--you know--the kind of singer/songwriter they'd put in a Lifetime storyline, and Will Shepherd is an English soccer playing psycho version of one of her former flames...let's pick Warren Beatty. Will's a demonic, lecherous, bad tempered creep with homocidal tendencies who thinks Maggie and her music can save him. In other words, he's so vain he probably thinks her songs are about him. Okay, joke aside, I'm surprised this wasn't turned into a Lifetime movie at some point. Pass, and give me the Women's Murder Club instead."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"I am a huge fan of James Patterson...I am now trying to read some of his earlier books. I picked up Hide and Seek expecting great things - after all, his Alex Cross series is great; I loved 1st to Die; and thought Suzanne's Diary for Nicolas was a brave move into general fiction. Well, I was disappointed!The book is about Maggie Bradford and her past loves. Within several chapters you find out she has 'murdered' several past husbands and lovers. The book flips between her in jail, her past husbands and their background, her past, and what has happened to get her arrested for murder.This book is not written well. It jumps back and forth so much between current day and past as well as various characters that it is hard to keep up with what's going on. The characters are not well developed - they are one dimensional and flat. The story is predictable and boring. I only stuck with the book hoping it would get better - it didn't. Since this is an early James Patterson, perhaps we can chalk this book up to inexperience. Luckily he has learned from his mistakes and is now producing great books....Bottom line, I wouldn't recommend this book to others...unless you want to compare his earlier work to his current masterpieces of mystery/suspense."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"This book was terrible. The plot was like a soap from TV, completely unbelievable. Why waste your time reading this book when there are so many other great ones out there. If you don't want to think when you read this is for you. If you like trashy novels, this is for you. But if you really like to read, try something else or you will be very disapointed."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"Peekaboo! I killed you...or did I? This was the question in James Patterson&#65533;s novel, Hide and Seek. Did Maggie Bradford kill her second husband, Will Shepherd? Even the suspect herself doesn&#65533;t know. The answer isn&#65533;t revealed until the end of the story, which makes for a suspense-filled page-turner. Similar to Patterson&#65533;s other novels, he keeps the audience guessing until the end with surprise twists all throughout that throw off any conclusions the reader may have made.The story starts out with the heroine hiding with her young daughter from her crazed husband, Phillip. As it turns out, Maggie Bradford does kill her first husband, but in self-defense. Then the novel jumps to the present time where Maggie is being held in a prison cell for the supposed murder of her second husband. She wonders, &#65533;Am I a murderer? Did I kill not one, but two of my husbands?&#65533;Suddenly, the reader is taken back to the past. Maggie has becomes an in-demand songwriter for popular singers, and a singer herself. Will Shepherd, an ex-soccer star turned actor, insinuates himself in her life, and soon, they are married. As Maggie narrates from the present about her life with Will, the reader is slowly exposed to the other side of Will. The side not shown to the rest of the world: &#65533;the werewolf.&#65533; Gradually, her story of the past merges with the present time, her trial for the murder of Will Shepherd.Hide and Seek is a skillfully written novel with an exciting plot. Patterson&#65533;s style of excerpts from Maggie in the present-day commenting on the past allows for a unique perspective of the story. His vivid descriptions and colorful vocabulary bring the characters to life. The reader is pulled into the story as if you are watching the action happen. Once you start reading, you won&#65533;t want to put the book down until you are finished. Anyone with a taste for an action-filled thriller will enjoy this novel immensely."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"This is the second James Patterson book I've read and I really liked this one. I couldn't put it down right from the start! I fell in love with Maggie's story and I yearned to know the truth about her 3 dead past lovers.

I'm hooked on Patterson, but I think I liked his Alex Cross character better."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"This has to be one of the most exciting thrillers I have ever read.

Patterson's writing style is so swift and fast-paced that reading his books are like watching action movies, exciting and action-packed. However, this book reads more like a weak Sidney Sheldon book (not to knock Sidney Sheldon, he's cool too), than a James Patterson novel. I would have liked it better if he didn't just skim the trial, and if he had made this story a bit more plausible. I did like the characters, but I think his Alex Cross novels are far more superior. They have good characters and an excellent plot."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"A big fan of Alex Cross but thought I would try a \\"different\\" Patterson storyline....Hide and Seek was a joke to say the least....read like it was written by a very young mind & and a not very bright one at that....almost soap opera style....did you really write this, Mr. Patterson??

I don't think they ever will.Liz Grace Davis (Author of Chocolate Aftertaste and Tangi's Teardrops)"},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"James Patterson's Hide in Seek is a lot different from most of the books I've read by him. It's about a woman, Maggie, who's trying to get past her horrible experiences with physical abuse by her first husband Phillip, whom she had to kill in order to protect herself and her daughter. It's really a story about betrayal, the aftermath of abuse, learning how to pick up the pieces and move on with your life, finding love, and all the pain that comes with that. I think this was a great story, because the emotions in it were real. And the pain and difficulties that Maggie had to go through throughout the entire story, make her a likable character."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"I am a big James Patterson fan and this is the first time I've picked up one of his books and not been immediately riveted from the first chapter.

It almost seems that his publisher gave him 2 days to write it and he met the deadline. I was especially frustrated with his inablility to recognize capabilities of children at varying ages. This was also evident in the aforementioned novels, but was more annoying in &quot;Hide &amp; Seek.&quot; Specifically, no four year old child would have the insight to recognize someone's inability to &quot;be accepting of themselves,&quot; no matter how brilliant the child. Four year old girls very rarely speak like 30 year old women- nor do they think like 30 year old women.This is very unrealistic &amp; I truly wish that Mr. Patterson would keep children out of his novels until he's raised one. Regardless of these discrepancies I have to admit that the book is still readable but not recommendable."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"i loved patterson's along came a spider, but did not like kiss the girls at all . . . this book, hide &amp; seek, i liked . . . suspenseful story that kept my interest to the very end of the book . . . i heard the taped version and found it to be excellent (the narration, in particular); however, i'm sure the written version would be equally interesting."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"This book was very good.

As much as I love Cross and his band of men, I have to admit that James can still write excellent suspense novels without the help of his famous and very goodlooking(!) Alex Cross!This is a story about Maggie Bradford, a famous singer, who is in an abusive marriage - two infact - and how she deals with them. I thought that although this was not quite the fastpaced, action-packed &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot; or &quot;Along Came a Spider&quot; it was still and enjoyable book that left me wanting more. A definate plus on JP's side is the fact that he has such short chapters which makes you want to read more, and before you know it, you are off to get another JP book before you suffer from withdrawal symptoms.If you are looking for a crime novel like &quot;Kiss the Girls&quot; then you will be disappointed but if you are looking for something from James Patterson that is still easy to read and keeps you up all night trying to finish it, then you will love &quot;Hide and Seek&quot;."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"I love James Patterson's books but this one did not live up tohis standards.

Far from the psychological thrillers that he's known for, Hide & Seek is more like a bad daytime soap opera, with a melodramatic protagonist (Maggie) that is so annoying that you almost hope that the murderer gets her...at least that might put her and the reader out of our collective misery."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"Highly recommended, I read Hide &amp; Seek thinking I would be rivited to my chair... not so. The plot was twisting and at times interesting but it left too many of the mystery/thriller details out. I have never read a good mystery/thriller that had so much detailed sexual information. Sex may be on everyone's mind but it did not have to be so exploited. I hate to judge an author by one book, but I certainly would not recommend this book or the author to any age readership."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"This book is kinda the same as Honeymoon but very different.Why do women love to kill there husbands?Well Maggie Bradford help me with the answer.She does it so well.The singer loves her music until everybody found out that she was a murderer with a big scarlet M. Top thriller almost of all.I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"Seems that James Patterson has taken a turn, in this book anyway, towards the likes of Jackie Collins. Filled with Harlequin-esque romantics, and none of his usual suspense-filled storylines."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"Though a devoted fan of James Patterson, I had to force myself through this one. The plot was uncharacteristically thin, and the dialogues contrived -- especially those between Maggie and her daughter (does anybody really talk like that?!?). By far, the most interesting character was Will Shepherd. It seems to me that Patterson may not be able to write women that well, and is better suited to the criminal evolution and plot development that made 'Kiss the Girls', 'Along Came a Spider', and 'Jack &amp; Jill' so phenomenally thrilling. Looking forward to reading 'Cat &amp; Mouse' soon."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"This is my first James Patterson's novel and I am rather impressed, though somehow it's such a cliche, some parts are exagerating at timesand the ending is rather anticlimax ... but overall,this book is still a page-turner with some verytight writing.

I couldn't put it down, and am anxiously awaiting the movie. Hide and Seek was a poor choice after such an incredible book.

Better than average, but not his best. It was okay"},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"This is the first and last book by James Patterson I will ever read.

Kiss the Girls was great and so was Along Came a Spider"},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"In this television society it would appear all we expect out of a novel is a plot line that could be a script from &quot;Murder She Wrote&quot;.

If you get the impulse to spend $5.95 on this one you'd be better saving your money and reaching for your remote control"},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"This book started off very quickly, catching your attention right at the start. And it never lets go. Maggie Branford painfully tells you her story, making you feel for her and her struggle. This book is clearly based around the OJ Simpson affair, with Branford, the heroine, as OJ. The end is completely suprising, and even once the story is over, the book reminds you that anything is possible with a villain like Will Shephard. Overall, a book definitaly worth reading"},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"Patterson again uses twists and turns to keep us riveted, but I wasn't completely satisfied.

Then I thought I'd give Patterson the benefit of the doubt and finish it off, in case he redeemed himself... sadly, I don't think he did.

Throughout the book Maggie is trying to lose the feeling that she is weak and a failure. As life as she knows it changes some of her feelings change. As you read the book you will become more and more into it. The author lets you know only bits and pieces, leaving the rest for you to discover with the characters. This book is for those who like mystery thrillers. For those who don't its not for you. I recommend this book to book lovers and those who just need a book to read."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"I have read the Alex Cross books, and I must admit I liked them, but they were not my favorites and I was hesitant to read his other work. Once I read Jack &amp; Jill, I realized that there was more to Patterson than I'd thought. This book moves FAST. It's so hard to put down because there are no lulls in the action. I more than highly recommend it!!!!"},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"&quot;Hide and Seek&quot; is a fast-moving, exciting, can-put-it-down thriller - I read it in a few hours!

Worth the $5 - you'll pass it along to all your friends."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"&quot;Hide &amp; Seek&quot; had me jumping, the story was excellent. The plot twists kept me in great suspense. Patterson's style of writing his books in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd person, give you, the reader the chance to really be stuck in the book until the last page. If you like the Alex Cross novels, this book if definately one to pick up."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"After reading Kiss The Girls, I am hooked on James Patterson!

I have the DVD's of Kiss The Girls and Along Came a Spider and I had not read any of his books. I am hooked. His short expense filled chapters are wonderful. I encourage everyone to read this author's works, they will not regret it. This book was awesome, I have not been disappointed yet. All 30 are great. I am waiting for Judge and Jury and then I have them all. The Angel series, the Alex Cross and the Women's Club series are just awesome. Get them and read them, you wont be disappointed."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"My first James Patterson book is HIDE AND SEEK and I have been engaged by his writing since. His style of narration is personalized and most affecting. No nuances here, but HIDE AND SEEK is extremely gripping and riveting. It tells of a singer Maggie and his 3 dead lovers, and the intense characterization saves the novel from being banal, especially when Will as the devious and debonair paycho takes centrestage. He is a tortured soul and manipulates people including his brother to satisfy his virulent passions. Murders, deception and the first few chapters on Maggie's abused past is hauntingly chilling.James Patterson writes with speed and cuts to the point with precision. He dissects the character's soul with succinct description. For a fast read, he is definitely one of the best writers around. HIDE AND SEEK is definitely at the zenith of suspense - the read will induce a primal fear that you can't hide from."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"I read this on the strength of Along Came a Spider -well it just goes to show that you cant' always judge a book by its author. This is so poor it is almost as if it has been written by someone else other than the talented writer of Along Came a Spider. The characters are one dimensional and their motivations pure pop corn. There are too many irrelevant passages such as the (unnecessarily extended) account of Will's World Cup game. The plot's thin, the writing is pedestrian.........etc,etc. What worries me is I've got Kiss The Girls on order from Amazon, so I hope its been written by the real James Patterson"},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"I love (almost) every book that he has written! If you are a James Patterson fan, consider this book! I would recommend this."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"I'm probably not as qualified to judge this book as the other reviewers, because I just couldn't bring myself to finish it. This is the first time I have done this with a book that I paid for (a borrowed or stolen book does not seem to carry the same obligation). I enjoyed a James Patterson book a friend gave me, and I purchased several more. Generally, I have greatly enjoyed Mr. Patterson's Alex Cross novels. However, I am willing to bet that if an unknown author had submitted &quot;Hide and Seek&quot;, there would be no chance of publication. I found it to be incredibly boring, and I came to loathe all of the characters by the time I quit reading in complete disgust, 276 pages in. I am guessing that this was an early failure by Mr. Patterson, which was resurrected and published after he became well known.My $.02."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"Hide and Seek was a great book. Maggie Bradford was such a wonderful character, along with Will. It was extremely scary, lots of murders, and an awesome plot. Very descriptive, I could picture everything clearly. I seriously couldn't put it down after I picked it up this summer in Maine, and since then, I've read it 5 times more. I would recomend it to any of my friends. James Patterson is an awesome writer."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"This is solidly one of the worst Patterson books I've come across. The plot is boring and reads like a romance novel in parts and then turns into a murder/suspense novel. By the end of the book, I didn't even CARE what happened to Maggie. I wanted them to give her the chair just so we could get a little excitement in this book. Too bad Gary Soneji is dead from the Alex Cross books - I had the perfect suggestion for his next victim."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"How this book acquired a mainstream publisher is beyond me. It has the realism of a romance novel and the depth of a shortstory in a women's magazine. While the author can write well-crafted sentences, he does not seem to have a clue about characterization or plot. The story is a string of unlikely coincidences that defy belief."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"I read this book only because of the circunstances. And it's just wonderful that the circunstances exist.The story is: I was reading some book summaries, you know, the plot of the book briefly told on the back of the book. And I found this book to have an interesting plot. I started reading it and loved how the author developed the scenarios, the characters and the plot itself. It was like reading a book by Sidney Sheldon. In fact, I've came to the conclusion that some of James Patterson's books are quite similar to Sheldon's. Both of them know how to keep the reader's attention and how to develop an interesting story. Nowadays Patterson is one of my favorite authors, and I think that, after reading that one, he'll become one of your favorites too.Marco Aurelio"},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"LOL! Christ! What in God's name was Patterson thinking? I read this book because I've been trying to check out new authors. I fell in love with John Sandford's \\"Prey\\" novels recently, and on impulse, I picked up Hide and Seek since Patterson is supposed to be so great and I'd heard so much about him.Boy! What a disappointment and what a bad first impression! The book read like one of those Lifetime Movies of the Week. Basically Maggie Bradford is this woman who has had nothing but bad luck with men. Husband #1 Beat her, she kills him in self defense. She later becomes this world class singer . . .even Barbara Streisand pops up in the book to praise her music. She finally finds true love. . .he dies suddenly. While this is going on, we get to find out about the second main character a world class athlete named Will Shephard who just happens to be a psycho. . .and yes, you guessed it, she ends up marrying him. The book is told from two perspectives: 1st Person when the book is focused on Maggie(she's telling you all about her crappy life), and then it switches to 3rd Person whenever the book focuses on Will. I won't go any further I don't want to spoil it for people unfortunate enough to get around to reading this trite, contrived, soap opera novel that is utterly laughable. It's sad when the main character is an abused woman and you just don't care about her. AT ALL.Oh, and Patterson, what's up with the 100 or so 3 page chapters that this book has?"},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"This book has the dubious honor of being the WORST BOOK I'VE EVER READ. And with the variety and amount of books I read that's saying a lot.Poorly written, thinly (and that's generous) developed characters, trite dialog, and was there a plot in there somewhere? I never met a more unlikeable protagonist than Maggie, nor did I care what happened to her or her ex-husbands. And WTF was Baraba Streisand doing in this??? Truly a nightmare of a novel.Note to Mr. Patterson: When you go through the process of writing a book, convincing people to publish it, then ask readers to invest time and money into purchasing and reading it, have a point. On behalf of all the readers who suffered through til the end, I demand our time and money back."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"While looking for a quick and easy poolside summertime read, I picked up *Hide and Seek* at the local library. Having finished the book, I'm now soooo glad I didn't shell out any money for it, as it's one of the shoddiest novels I've read in a while. I gather that when the mood strikes him Patterson can really write, but this book is just plain second rate. The characters are one-dimensional, the writing is so plain and simplistic that a typical fifth grader could easily plow through the book in a few hours, and the story itself is unbelievably dumb. There are some twists and turns in the plot that might provide some interest, but these are so implausible as to likely generate sneering scorn rather than excitement. And what's up with writing books with a hundred or so two or three-page &quot;chapters.&quot; Is this a comment on the contemporary U.S. attention span?It seems that in this book Patterson was aiming squarely at the lowest common denominator, while at the same time hoping, perhaps that *Hide and Seek* would provide an ideal vehicle for one of those tear-jerking made-for-tv films (which now apparently are becoming extinct, thank goodness). If this sounds like your kind of novel, then by all means pick it up and breeze through it."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"I don't know how this thing got published. I don't think I've ever seen a book as poorly written."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"This is a good book to read. It has alot of good parts in it, and it has good character scheme. But the only thing is that some parts in the book shouldn't be in it. So you might have to skip some pages. But it's still a good book. Some parts in it will make you cheer and yell. I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"I really like this J.P. book, mainly because I had only read the A. Cross books. I thought it was different and extremely SCARY. Non-stop thrill a minuet. The main character is sad and yet bold. Pattersons really has an understanding for the softer sided gender. Anyway, I know it was not one of J.P's fave's I had read a interview he gave, yet I would still recommend it, it was suspenseful."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"I like HIDE AND SEEK (For anyone interested, I just dropped a cheese-laden alfredo noodle on my keyboard), but interestingly I despise the characters, their lives, and all of their family. Maggie, the famous gee-whiz supermom singer, is a joke. Will, the Stone Barrington, bigger and better looking than a Backstreet boy soccer star, is an even sicker joke. Paper thin throw-aways. The plot, chock full of cliche and melodrama, strains its way toward the end of the book, ocasionally dragging severly. It is the incidents are the star of this novel. Incident after incident after incident. I read it in one sitting, and guess what? I don't regret it. Patterson turns the right screws at important times and gets away the with the rest of the crap. What a lucky guy! I'll tell you one more thing about Maggie. I was nauseated by her and her children. They actually called themselves JAM. The first initials of Maggie, Jennie, and Allie. How replusive."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"I have read a few of James Patterson's books but his was the first one I listened to on tape. I must say that had I read the book instead of listened to two professional actors read the book to me I might not have liked the story as much. This was not the best Patterson book I have read. Kiss the Girls and Along Came a Spider were very suspenseful stories. I really didn't like When the Wind Blows.Since others have written reviews on the story itself, I will comment on the tape experience, with some reference to the story. What I liked most about the tape was the use of two actors. A female actress read the chapters that came from Maggie Bradford's perspective (the unfortunate superstar) while a male actor reads Will's side (the evil soccer star). As a result, the notion that you are in the character's head is further felt. I have listen to other books where the actor actually takes away from the story. In this case, both actors do a great job.As for the story, I enjoyed this book very much but I do have two complaints. First of all, the Will character is just too much. Does he have to be the greatest soccer player in the world? Couldn't he have an ounce of goodness in him? The story would have been better if Will wasn't so evil. I like a suspense story better if I have just a little compassion for the bad guy. Second, the story was a bit predictable. I certainly didn't predict the whole ending but you have a pretty good idea where the story is going by page 50 (or in my case: cassette one, side one).All in all, I liked Hide and Seek. I liked the Maggie Bradford character. While the suspense level was not up to some of Patterson's other books, it'll keep you up at night."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"I refuse to believe that &quot;HIDE &amp; SEEK&quot; was written by the same guy responsible for creating the Alex Cross novels! Maybe it's that my expecatations are higher for James Patterson -- he is, after all, one of the better American mystery novelists alive. Or maybe it's because I couldn't have cared any less for the characters in &quot;HIDE &amp; SEEK&quot; -- they were about as three dimensional as a piece of paper. Or maybe it's because I felt like this novel was riding on the coattails of the OJ trial. Maybe it's all the above.Had &quot;HIDE &amp; SEEK&quot; been written by any other author, I may not have been so brutal in my review. But I have a feeling that this story had been tucked aside before Patterson became the suspense novelist we all now know, only to be published as a &quot;filler&quot; between Alex Cross novels. The plot, which revolves around a famous singer/songwriter that has been put to trial for the murder of her latest husband (making this her second or third homicide, depending on who you ask), runs pretty thin at times. Even the scenes with Barbara Streisand and Harry Conick were rediculous. At times I felt like I was reading the novel through frosted lenses because the heroine was painted as such a celebrity angel. And I won't even get started on the dialogue.Whatever the case may be, I ask James Patterson never to stop writing about Alex Cross. It's what he does best."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"I bought this book to read on a cross country flight. I had if finished half way through my lay over. It is thought provoking and scary. The words are all easy (a 12 year old could comprehend it). If you don't feel much like thinking and want some TV style entertainment,this is the ticket. It is a story about a woman forced to kill her first husband who abused her, when she finally remarried-she found herself in the same situation again. Does she suffer the beatings and threats to her life? Or does she risk explaining to a judge how she shot two men?"},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"Read &quot;Kiss The Girls&quot; instead...this story is just a long soap opera with a obvious ending..."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"Hide and Seek (The Sisterhood: Rules of the Game, Book 1)Hide & SeekThis is another of James Patterson's books that is a complete disappointment. It reads like it was written by a 16-year old (and perhaps it was). The story line is contrived; the dialogue is just barely passable; the format looks like a TV soap opera script. I keep hoping that I'll run across one of Patterson's books that I can admire - like the Alex Cross series - but mostly I've found that his writing is so sophmoric that it's embarrassing. Like Hide & Seek, sometimes I keep reading just to see if it gets any better or worse - and it never gets any better. There should be a refund on such trivial trash. - Kenn Morris, Los Angeles"},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"I cannot say enough good about this one, and I rarely dish out 5 star ratings. The perspectives of the characters are so well done. The ending is the absolute best, I read the last few pages over and over just to get that creepy feeling along my spine over and over again. EXCELLENT!!!"},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"This book reads like a mediocre Lifetime movie.Maggie Bradford is a rather cliched character that lives a very surrealistic existence. Quite honestly, she is a fairly unsympathetic protagonist.Will Shepherd is a fascinating character that keeps this novel from being a complete waste of time. He's a womanizing, crude, violent, worldwide superstar.While on the World's stage as one of the most well known athletes, he manages to lead a rather turbulent existence that leaves him alienated from the rest of the world. Through bad relationships and a brother he has to blackmail to keep quiet about his dark side, Will is a lost and depressed human being that is incapable of finding peace from within.He looks to Maggie Bradford to save him from his despair, but he finds that she is not the anecdote for what poisons him. It is at this point that Maggie finds history repeating itself for her and her troubled relationships."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"Hide and Seek by James PattersonIf you want a fast, suspenseful, thriller of a read, \\"Hide and Seek\\" is for you. The excitement of this story expands as quickly as you can turn the pages. Just when you take a big breath and sigh in relief, Patterson turns the corner and starts building again, heading for the next curve in the road. You wonder if you will ever escape his maze.After surviving the abusiveness of her first husband, Maggie and her young daughter set out to establish a new life. Maggie is an aspiring songwriter and singer. The hardships and trauma of Maggie's life are revealed through her music, and many people identify with the messages. There is a man, who could never quite shake a childhood experience, who hears her words and does whatever he deems necessary to find a way into her life.Even though there seem to be some unfinished agendas in regard to a few of the characters in \\"Hide and Seek\\", the story prevails as it is.It is good and scary."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"This book was my first introduction to the author. Unfortunately, I never want to be in the same room as one of his books ever again. The first chapter, err, several chapters since the be oh so tiny, try to focus the reader on Maggie's penchant for murdering her husbands. Our fine heroine, Maggie, beaten and hiding under the porch, shoots her husband while he is in the midst of a murderous, drug induced rampage. The police almost charged her with murder since the poor husband obviously left no tell-tail sign of violence other than the house interior smashed and trashed and Maggie having served hospital time due to her injuries. Yes, I can see where the police would initially think \\"Hmm, murder\\". The setup for the second husband is equally poorly conceived.The book was plodding, nonsensical, trite and predictable. It became landfill. The paper deserved to come back as something worthwhile."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"I am an avid James Patterson reader. Prefer his Maximum Ride teen books (yes they are a lot of fun even for a Grandmother) and his Women's Murder Club books of which I have every one and waiting anxiously for the next one.I have only just begun to read the Alex Cross series, they are a little more disturbing than the others, but Morgan Freeman playing Alex Cross in Kiss the Girls just endeared Alex Cross in my heart. When I read those books, I can see Alex (Morgan) and picture how he is solving the crimes."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"Hide & Seek was the first book I ever read by James Patterson and despite some flaws I really liked it. Some other reviews complained of its simple writing style and while that can be annoying I found it refreshing different from what I was accustomed to reading. The novel always had me turning its pages as well and while critiques on the characters are valid I thought they were okay. However, the biggest problem I have with this novel is that everything is jarring. For example the novel mostly seems to be told in flashback perspective from Maggie but instead of Maggie telling us when she met Will we hear from both their perspectives before they actually meet. I was glad that I only paid 25 cents for it though, anything over $7 and I would have felt ripped off."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"this was a gift. after several years of searching & several attempts to purchase this book in large print - receiving regular print editions & having to return them - finally - the large print edition!!!! made for a very happy mother's day."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"I actually kind of liked it of course I haven't read too many of his books. Seems like the two that I have read portray pretty independent women and that is a good thing, right? Especially for Maggie who should probably stay away from men as she seems to have a history of picking out the crazies. Although Patrick was really decent!!! Try it for yourself."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"It seems to me the longer these 'prolific' authors keep pumping out books, the worse they get. Using that for a guideline, this may be the last one for Patterson, because they can't get any worse.I just finished this POS book and the only pleasing thing about it...I got it at a yard sale for 25 cents. Wish I had my quarter back."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"OK, sometimes you pick up a free paperback on the book exchange table because you need a mindless book for the airport. I had read another James Patterson title, \\"Kiss the Girls\\" and although the writing style made me wince, the plot and suspense kept me interested. This one, however, is so bad that you might just read it in disbelief that a publisher could print this nonsense. It is seriously like a high school creative writing assignment. Actually, no, strike that, I don't want to offend any high school students. Middle school? Anyway, it reads really fast and it can be amusing in the way a bad movie is amusing. Just smile and think \\"I can't believe this was published\\" while reading your borrowed copy. Garbage."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"Good reading. Hard to put it down after the first page. Typical Patterson."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"HIDE AND SEEK is another one of those books that I didn't really like. It was somewhat enjoyable, but for me, it left a lot to be desired.This is the story of Maggie Bradford, a famous singer/songwriter. American loves her, her children love her, but all of that is changed when her retired soccer-star husband is murdered and she's the prime suspect. When the fact emerges that she killed her first husband years before, the public suddenly question the self-defense story she is telling.This book revolves around the murder trial and uses flash back type scenes to bring the reader along as the lawyers look back at the life of Maggie Bradford.Many professional reviewers have used the word \\"suspenseful\\" to describe HIDE AND SEEK but I have to disagree. This story does make you think but I didn't find it suspenseful. Ok, maybe in a couple of places (like when Maggie was hiding under the porch and feared for her life) but it did not filtrate throughout the entire book. I found this story line very predictable and was not fooled or even second-guessed my forecasts of \\"who dun it\\". In fact, I figured everything out in the first quarter of the book when Patterson was still laying the groundwork. Not only does Patterson dump all of the answers directly in your lap, he does nothing to cover those answers or muddy the waters.Don't misunderstand this review, the book is well written and James Patterson sets the scenes well. I just found it lacking compared to his other work. HIDE AND SEEK is still better than a lot that is on the market, but I'd pick it up after exhausting everything on your \\"must read\\" list."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"I would reccommend this book to those who are interested in the mystery genre,s it's starting point is very interesting and full of suspence.It begins where maggie is being chased by her husband philip.and in a fight and dispute between each other she kills him in self defence .as time passes she feels full of guilt.but she meets someone new who she thought would be good for her.He was a athlete he played football his name was will. maggie was also a singer her songs were very touching to people that where relating to her music.she was also a good mother I havent gotten to deep in the story but so far what I have read its made me anxious to find out whats on the next page after the other.this is the kind of book that keeps my mind wondering whats going to happend next.This is one of the best books that have cought my eye all semester and so far this is my fifth book so far.im really not a big reader but a book like this really is worth reading.this is my first mystery genre that I have read and I very much did enjoy it."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"Hide and Seek by James PattersonIf you want a fast, suspenseful, thriller of a read, \\"Hide and Seek\\" is for you. The excitement of this story expands as quickly as you can turn the pages. Just when you take a big breath and sigh in relief, Patterson turns the corner and starts building again, heading for the next curve in the road. You wonder if you will ever escape his maze.After surviving the abusiveness of her first husband, Maggie and her young daughter set out to establish a new life. Maggie is an aspiring songwriter and singer. The hardships and trauma of Maggie's life are revealed through her music, and many people identify with the messages. There is a man, who could never quite shake a childhood experience, who hears her words and does whatever he deems necessary to find a way into her life.Even though there seem to be some unfinished agendas in regard to a few of the characters in \\"Hide and Seek\\", the story prevails as it is.It is good and scary."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"Hide and Seek, by James Patterson, is one of the most spine-tingling novels I have ever read. It mixes love affairs and romance with murder and mystery. The story has great suspense from the first to the very last page. There was never a boring piece, not ever a moment to put the book down.The story starts with Maggie Bradford and her then two-year-old daughter, Jennie, who are being chased and hiding in their own home. Phillip, Maggie's first husband, is threatening them with a gun and wants them to \`come out and play.' However, Maggie has something else in mind: another one of Phillip's guns. It then skips to Maggie in prison, some dozen years later, after Phillip and Will's murder, and Patrick's death.Maggie Bradford is a young, single mother who is struggling as a singer/songwriter/pianist. With the charges of Phillip's murder dropped because of self-defense, Maggie is still haunted by Phillip's memory and suspicious and distrustful of other men. Then, along comes Patrick, a widower with a large chain of expensive hotels, and a 20-something son, Peter, who hates his father and Maggie. Patrick and Maggie live a very happy life, respect each other, have a son, Allie, and are engaged. But something terrible happens and Maggie is then faced with more pain, sorrow, and fear. Finally, Maggie meets Will Shepard, a very famous soccer player in England, (\\"The Blond Arrow\\") and can get any woman he wants, especially when it's Maggie Bradford.The story suddenly turns into a backstabbing, heartbreaking, mystery that'll take your breath away. You'll gasp at every turn of the page, and every wild and very unpredictable event. If you want to read a gripping and exhilarating book this year, read Hide and Seek!"},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"The only GREAT James Patterson novel I have read is ALONG CAME A SPIDER. This book I was hoping would equal ALONG CAME A SPIDER in quality, but it failed miserably.It was boring; it was uneven and just plain ridiculous. I have to admit the ending surprised me, but that's the only positive thing I can say about this book.Warning: Very explicit sex passages, including one featuring incest."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"James Patterson seems to have mastered the craft of fairly entertaining,mindless pageturners quite brilliantly.As a matter of fact,in you're in a market for a quick read,that will touch neither your heart,nor your mind,but will surely kill time,this is a book for you.The characters are all too stereotypical and predictable,however the plot does throw in a curveball or two.he writing style is average at best and quite devoid of charm or humor in itself.To sum up,the waters are only ankle deep,but warm enough to enjoy."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"This was the first book by James Patterson that I have read and well, HE HOOKED ME. In the beginning it was a slow book and I felt I should return it to the shelf. But then as the book went on I just could not put it down. The characters were great and the suspense was a killer. I was not extrememly impressed by the book but if this is one of his worst then i can't wait to read his best. ALL AND ALL I ENJOYED READING IT."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"I can't quite put my finger on just one reason why I do not like this novel. Perhaps it's because I read this one right after I read KISS THE GIRLS. Perhaps I was in a bad mood when I read it. Whatever the reason, HIDE &amp; SEEK never redeemed itself in my eyes. The novel is short (my hardcover version is just over 300 pages), but it seemed to take me forever to get to the end. I was very surprised at the mediocrity of the storyline. Maggie Bradford is a survivor of an extremely abusive marriage. She flees with her daughter but not before firing away at the lout she married. Fast forward a few years and Maggie is a successful singer/songwriter on trial once again for the murder of husband #2. Did she do it? Is it coincedence? Is she the victim or the perpetrator?To be honest, I never connected with any of the characters. I truly didn't care who did what to whom and how anyone may or may not have died. The novel has Patterson's trademark short 'n sweet chapters, but I felt it lacked his ability to build suspense and to create interesting characters. I've liked almost everything so far that I've read by Patterson. Every author has his/her clunkers; I hope that this is Patterson's only one."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"This was the last thing I expected from James Patterson. I now understand the &quot;soap opera&quot; references in the review section. It was almost like something Harold Robbins or Howard Fast would have written. If that's what I was looking for, I would chosen one of their books. Were it not for my faith in Mr. Patterson and the easy and speedy readability of the book I would have quit it at any number of places. I will look forward to his other books and hope this is just an anomaly. However I will say that at a mystery writers panel I attended it was James Patterson who said, &quot;if you want reality, go to K-Mart.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"This book was a very quick read and I enjoyed it for the most part but the ending was a bit to much. I think this book is probably one of his worst written but it still kept me entertained and wanting to know the ending."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"I thought this book was well written to include suspence,romance as well as mystery. I can't wait to read another of James Patterson's books."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"This is one of the best James Patterson books I have read!!! Fast paced and holds your interest. I hated to put it down!"},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"Maggie Bradford killed her first husband Phillip, who was voilent. Years later she meets a famous soccer player named Will Sheperd, who seems nice but turns out to be worse than Maggies first husband. Now Maggie is the main suspect of Wills death. I really enjoyed this book, the suspense is breath taking and will have you at the edge of your seat. I think this has an ending almost if not better than Hitchcocks movie \\"Psycho\\". Every second there is a big twist as to whether or not Maggie killed Will. At the trial Maggie says she didn't kill Will, but the jurors wonder, who could have killed Will, and what was the reason. When you read what Will has done to the people he has met, you will question as to who Killed Will. Through out the story I just kept on changing my guess as to who the killer is. Just when you think you know who the killer is \\"guess again\\". The outcome of this mystery will leave you breathless."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"There is always a surprise element in most James Paterson books. If an author like Patterson can entertain and add shock value to this genre of murder-mystery/suspenese he will always be the man in my eyes. I feel James Patterson has a formula of at least getting you interested then \\"BOOM!!!\\" shocks the heck out of you. This is the second novel I read to where the main character isn't a detective, I always thought that Mr Patterson had to have a detective as a main charcter, I guess, this is the second book that proved me wrong. This is a story about the victim Maggie then was twisted to accused killer Maggie, you were like what!! I wasn't sure what the heck she was. At times, I really thought she was the killer, then I kept changing my mind to that was a the victim the whole time. I feel most people that read Patterson's books and give a bad review simple just doesn't get his writing. I feel that James Patterson isn't writing for the greatness of great literature but for the entertainment of suspense."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"I felt like I was reading a Sidney Shelton book. I have to admit it started very Shelton-ish but became Patterson towards the end. The &quot;mystery&quot; was back. This book wasn't as good as the usual Alex Cross series but I enjoyed reading it. The only big complaint I have is it kind of dragged. I thought it was too long for a simple story like this. This book is not the best but not the worst either. I would recommend it if you're truly bored."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"This book was REALLY draggy until the &quot;Trial and Error&quot; section. That was the part when the book turned into true Patterson work. But overall, it was a wonderful read. It was kind of like one of those movies that takes FOREVER to get to the point, but when it finally does, you realize that all those boring parts were necessary to make the movie, or book in this case, what it is..."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"Very disappointing. I became a big fan of James Patterson suspense novels when I first read Kiss the Girls. I have just finished Hide and Seek and I am very disappointed! Could this be the same Patterson who wrote Along came a Spider and Kiss the Girls? First of all, the language is so un-patterson! The main character, Maggie is portrayed as a total bimbo and the plot was totally predictable. Hasn't the woman learned her lesson?Nevertheless, I managed to finish the book because I wanted to find out whether there were more twists and surprises and there were none. Hide and Seek must have been one of Mr. Patterson's earlier works and it could have been written by any C-Grade writers. It does not have the suspense and personal touches that are characteristic of Patterson. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"This Patterson dude CAN write! this was nothing compared to Kiss The Girls though (my favorite) but this book was awesome at times it was &quot;okay&quot; but then u wanted to keep on turning the pages and not put it down"},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"I have liked all books by the author thus far. I was trying for an Alex Cross featured one at the library but got this one. No regrets. Good story here with Maggie always questioning herself as to whether she's a murderess or just a victim of circumstance. Will Sheppards story was equally good. The best was when the two were together. Good side characters with Barry, Norma, Allie and Jennie. Well put together. Only exception being Maggie held in Bedford Hills C.F.(State Prison) before trial instead of Westchester County Jail. All things told, I liked the story and look forward to reading all of Mr. Patterson's work."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"This is by far the Scariest James Patterson Book of all. It is shocking twisted, well written and very frightning. James Patterson has all the burnes cooking with this erotic thriller.A Murder, and another murder. Now a woman is in prison. The only twist they were both self defense. In a way I think this was what Double Jeopardy (movie) was based on, because it is severely twisted."},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"I've read nearly every book James Patterson published. Hide &amp; Seek is just as riviting as any other. The characters are well developed, you find yourself attached to Maggie, really wanting to know more about her. Finding the truth in her past seems to be the last thing on your mind while reading. The only complaint I have is that I feel that he ended the book a few times. Once you feel comfortable it the ending another bone was thrown in to late. James Patterson is truly one of the best writers that just keet you coming back wanting more!"},{"Title":"Hide & Seek","review":"Although I read the whole book, for no reason other than loyalty to one of my favourite authors, I have to say that James Patterson lost the plot in this book! I still can't quite work out the point of it. The story was immensely boring and I didn't care about the characters, any of them! Maggie irritated the hell out of me and her daughter was equally as irritating. If you are about to delve into the world of James Patterson don't start with this book - it's not a very good first impression of Mr Patterson's writing talent."},{"Title":"The Eco-Spasm Report","review":"Al Toffler is a genius, and Eco-Spasm is an ingenious presentation of economic concepts presented in such a way that anyone can understand them. It is a very short book (fewer than 200 pages). It is also a powerfully thought provoking treatise on the economics of politics, or, is it the politics of economics?What's most important, Toffler tells us the history of post-World War I economies, the economics of the Great Depression, gives a true-life example of inflation raging in the 1000s of percents, and demonstrates how the economic situation in Germany at that time gave rise to Adolph Hitler and the nazi party. It is truly illuminating.In addition, Toffler raises very real issues that apply to the economics of today and presents some very interesting ideas for what the future might hold, including the disintegration of the United States as an economic power.If you never read another economics book in your life, read this one.If you never read another history book in your life, read this one.If you never read a book about the future in your life, read this one.I read this book years ago when I was getting an MBA. It blew me away then, and it still has the power to do so, especially in light of economic concerns and conditions of today.This book belongs on the shelf of every thinking person who thinks he knows and understands politics and/or economics, or who wants to know about and understand the issues of economics and how they influence the politics of the day.It's out of print, but there are copies in good condition. Don't worry. Even if you could get a new one, you'd read it so many times, it would look pretty used pretty fast anyway."},{"Title":"Principles of Naval Weapons Systems (Fundamentals of Naval Science)","review":"The sections presenting the basic physics that parameterize detection and weapons operation give the reader a very good introduction to the principles of operation for various general weapons systems, as well as the capabilities and limitations of a general weapons system.However, the weapons systems actually described are if not actually obsolete, obsolescent. This is especially true with regard to the C4I and ECM/ESM, EO, and detection systems. There is no mention of stealth, GPS, Aegis, or JTIDS. SAR and MTI sytems should have more emphasis, as does the section on digital computers.In short, this is a good introduction to basic physical principles that systems operate under, but an increasingly dated explanation as to the way systems operate and a very dated description of operating systems. This is a good idea for a book, but needs a thorough rewrite at this point (April 1, 2000)."},{"Title":"Wait Until Spring, Bandini","review":"&quot;Wait Until Spring, Bandini,&quot; by John Fante, is a novel about an Italian-American family living in Colorado. The story focuses on Arturo Bandini, a teenager who is the eldest of the family's three sons. His father, Svevo, is a bricklayer and an immigrant to the United States. Very Americanized, Arturo loves baseball and is tormented inside over his family's poverty.Fante richly develops the relationships among the members of this often dysfunctional family. He also vividly evokes the experience of raising a family in poverty. Particularly interesting is Fante's portrayal of Roman Catholicism within the life of the Bandini family; religion is shown to be a very ambiguous force. There are some dark, even cruel episodes as the family's story unfolds.As much as I enjoyed &quot;Wait,&quot; I did not find it in the end to be as satisfying as the other Fante novels which I have read (&quot;1933 Was a Bad Year&quot; and &quot;Full of Life&quot;). Still, it's a powerful family story that is graced by Fante's excellent prose style."},{"Title":"Wait Until Spring, Bandini","review":"Wait Until Spring, Bandini is a masterfully crafted novel by an amazingly underapreciated author. John Fante's name is like a password, those who know it cannot deny their bookishness. His writing is powerful and touching in its simplicity as he tells the tale of Aurturo Bandini, the son of Italian immigrants living in Colorodo. There are no wars, explosions, or black holes in this book. Its a tiny little story about one winter in a boy's life. Its power is in the realization that it provokes, the realization that growing up is something we all had to go through, that we've all made mistakes, and we're all human."},{"Title":"Wait Until Spring, Bandini","review":"It is rare that call any writer an artist, but with John Fante I feel no compunction whatsoever with using the word artist. While this work was his first and as such lacks the maturity, refinement and strength of voice that his later works possess, this particular book holds something that the others do not. That is the quintessential American experience. By that I mean the experience of being an immigrant trying to own their Americaness.While the writing in this book shows sporadic flashes of brilliance, the message is more important than the words in this book. In a lot of ways this is the American story. It is the story of a poor Italian kid growing up in a world that doesn't want to accept him. This work has a powerful duality working inside of the characters. You have the proud but poor Italian father full of Machismo, and then you have the second generation immigrant who is just not quite American enough for his peers. The main character deals with the plight of poverty and alienation along with trying to fulfill traditional roles at home.Fante becomes a great American writer. This isn't one of his masterpieces, but this is still an important work because it gives readers a glimpse into a uniquely American experience. The strength of this work lies in its ability to relate a world and experience that all Americans (except for Native Americans) have experienced at one point or another, and that is the immigrant experience. Fante does an amazing job giving readers a glimpse into that world."},{"Title":"Wait Until Spring, Bandini","review":"A poignant book, wonderfully written. In my opinion, this was his first and best novel. Even better than &quot;Ask the dust&quot;, regarded as his masterpiece... A brilliant beginning for such a writer!"},{"Title":"Wait Until Spring, Bandini","review":"...and I read a lot of books...in my opinion Fante beats the pain of Dostoevski being as simple in words as Bukowski...&quot;Wait until Spring, Bandini&quot; is probably the best although one of the simplest books I read in my life...I think Fante deserves the Nobel post-mortum...Hamsun and Marquez got it, why not Fante?"},{"Title":"Wait Until Spring, Bandini","review":"The beginning of the Bandini Saga will wrench your heart. You find yourself, with the characters, trapped in this frustratingly inexpressible human condition. Fante manages, a triumphant champion, to articulate the unbelievable, ungraspable circumstance called life. John's a writer's writer, and a heavyweight at that."},{"Title":"Wait Until Spring, Bandini","review":"Apparently this is Fante's first published book, but not the first book he wrote.This was the second book by Fante that I read, the first being Ask the Dust. Wait Until Spring, Bandini, is a much different type of book than Ask the Dust. I bought it on Amazon expecting another book of adventures of a struggling writer, a bachelor, and ended up plunged into a very regional (Boulder, CO) very ethnic (Eyetalian), very Catholic novel.All in all, it was a decent book, not earth-shaking, but charming. At times I felt hatred for Arturo's father and pity for poor Arturo. I don't know to what extent the books by Fante are autobiographical, but Wait Until Spring, Bandini certainly paints a pretty bleak portrait of the character's childhood. Growing up, an outsider, a little-man, wiser than his years.At times the Italian connection grew annoying for me. \\"Rosa, I love you, Rosa. Rosa, you're my girl, Rosa.\\" I can imagine the Godfather talking this way, hard to imagine the little Italian boy.I would particularly recommend the book to anyone living in Boulder, CO. It would be interesting to contrast the story with whatever it is like in modern days."},{"Title":"Wait Until Spring, Bandini","review":"This book is great. Fante not only shows the plight of poor immigrants, but how children deal with growing up... poor or otherwise. I love how he writes from the perspective of a adolescent but makes it art. All this without sounding too high-toned to make you think that this is the smartest kid in the history of the world.This is a great book and I would read it before Ask the Dust. John Fante is a wonderful writer who paints lush pictures with simple sentences."},{"Title":"Wait Until Spring, Bandini","review":"This book is great.

I didnt get the same feeling of desperation and despair as in the other novel. I was feeling Fante as being a tragic writer and this family story has some moments but I canno say that i recommend this book that much."},{"Title":"Wait Until Spring, Bandini","review":"'Wait Until Spring, Bandini' is a kind of book that deserves a place among others that have a main target in vision: to tell a story of memories of a hard and impoverished youth with some touches of bittersweat evocations, like the first love for a special girl, recollections of Christmas time and little family pleasures. Arturo Bandini is a teenager in the years of Depression, of Italian lineage, making his first contacts with the world around him, in a continuous progression to maturity. In this angle, the book has some points of contact with J.D. Salinger 'The Catcher's in the Rye' although Fante has a more strong style of writing - strong, not better - that made him almost a 'beatnik' author like Bukowski. Fante know his office and the book has some excellent moments: the description of the relationship between Svevo Bandini (Arturo's father) and Miss Hildegarde, mainly when this relationship is caught by the eyes of young Arturo; Arturo's delusions toward his first and platonic love, Rosa Pinelli and some other moments, captured with intensity and poignant touches. But the book is far from a masterpiece and sometimes develops a restrained and peasant pace,sometimes even redundant and unimpressive. Anyway, this one is a good first point to know John Fante and his work, almost all of them centered in the figure of Arturo Bandini, again the main characther of 'Ask the Dust' and 'Dream on Bunker Hill'."},{"Title":"Wait Until Spring, Bandini","review":"In John Fante's book, &quot;Wait Until Spring, Bandini&quot; the reader is introduced to a millieu of poverty with which, few of us in America are truly familiar. Here is a family, a proud Italian American unit, that is hard working, religious, and proud of their heritage and themselves. Yet, they live with a day to day level of impovershment that is striking to most people in today's American society. It is difficult for one to imagine harder times in their own personal life, than what Fante has depicted in this work.In addition, Fante develops the interactions of his charcters with a true expertise, that allows the reader to quickly read his book and still get all the value and meaning contained therein. Fante's characters are believable and realistic. The manner in which they represent their positions is only too reminiscent of almost all family life in America. The lessons that he imparts are truly inspirational and timely for those who have been through some hard times and difficult life situations.While Fante deals with a serious marital transgression, he does so with great aplomb. His ability to portray the inner perspective of his characters from all sides of the issue is fabulous. And, in the end, even the transgressor sees himself with pride and honor, in the face of victimization by one who can easily manipulate him for her own self-indulgence.Fante's book is a truly wonderful piece of work. It is a great life lesson for all who may take the time to read it. I would highly recommend it to anyone who wishes to be more in touch with the world around them, and with the way in which the world can change, in only a few minutes.

The father I enjoyed, the son not so much. Early in the story the writing is done in a way that can be frustrating in its repetition, but at the same time artistic in its desciptive style of prose. In describing Bandini's heckling enemy of a house and his \\"black bear of a stove,\\" the author is at his best.In sticking with reading \\"Wait Until Spring, Bandini,\\" which I did consider putting down half way through, I felt slightly rewarded with the total book.

Otherwise, it was the sort of prose that, while it may have been novel for its time, is now quite hackneyed (the whole first chapter was atrocious, by the way!). The same could be said for the general storyline, too.Most of the novel concentrates on the minutiae of (a) being poor, (b) being Italian, and (c) being Catholic, and after awhile the discussions of venial versus mortal sins, and of the class standings of Italians in Denver in the Depression, and of how they only get to eat meat once a fortnight -- well, it gets to be a bit much after about 15 pages or so.

We follow David as he learns, with Ted's and Sophia's help and humor, how to move from Victimhood to the role of a responsible Creator in his own life. It's a profound discovery, revealed in compelling layers that will keep readers turning pages as they recognize the signs of the DDT (the Dreaded Drama Triangle, TED*'s nemesis) having crept into their own lives.Readers made squirmy by acronyms and diagrams will need to exercise a little patience here. You'll be presented with FISBe, the dynamics of the DDT and, of course, TED, The Empowerment Dynamic. But they're delivered in a user-friendly package that features playful illustrations by Obadinah (see www.obadinah.com). Instead of encountering the author's transformational models in dry charts and mind maps, readers walk with David, Ted, and Sophia along the beach as now and then Ted stops to draw in the sand with a stick or a seashell. We're treated to glimpses of David's journal as he takes notes on all the great new stuff he's learning.It's no surprise that coaches, business leaders, teachers, public servants, and even prison officials have taken a shine to this book. Its message of hope resonates with disparate groups because everyone is susceptible to the go-nowhere outlook of victimhood.The slightly tweaked 2nd edition, to be released this Fall, includes a new Preface by the author as well as a helpful synopsis of The Empowerment Dynamic that follows the sequence of the fable.Business folks, counselors, clergy, those who work in healthcare -- readers of all shapes, sizes, and inclinations -- will find in The Power of TED* a helpful guide to taking hold of life's difficulties and turning them around."},{"Title":"The Power of TED* (*The Empowerment Dynamic)","review":"Empowerment -- is there a word that has been more over used and less informative in recent memory? (Oh well, probably. But you take my point.)David Emerald's book redeems the word by presenting an elegant, intelligent alternative to the well known \\"Drama Triangle.\\" Emerald does not minimize the challenges of shifting from the victim/persecutor/rescuer roles to the creator/challenger/coach roles of TED*; however, for those with the maturity to identify and wrestle with the obstacles along the way, TED* offers a way out.I'll be giving this book to my clients for a long time to come."},{"Title":"The Power of TED* (*The Empowerment Dynamic)","review":"\\"The Power of TED\\" is about the transformation of \\"victims\\" into \\"creators.\\" The \\"victim orientation,\\" as David Emerald points out, is a fundamental aspect of unreflective human experience, and it has probably been with us since we came down from the trees. If you have ever wondered, when confronting life's challenges and disappointments, \\"Why is THIS happening to me?\\" then you are already familiar with the victim orientation. The book starts with a scenario that raises this very question. And as you read on you will understand how it is that the way most of us think about our problems assures that our victimhood will be repeated, over and over again.What David Emerald gives us is a new way of thinking about our lives and our relationships that can truly liberate us from victimhood and open up the possibility that we might be creators of, rather than victims of, our relationships or circumstances. I can testify to the power of \\"The Power of TED.\\" Within three days of reading this book I was able to apply its distinctions and its insights to my own personal and business relationships, with benevolent and tangible results.Though it is written as a fable, it has the feel of genuine self-disclosure by the author and thus has a \\"reality effect\\" that amplifies the credibility of the learnings it seeks to convey. The fable doesn't distract from the message it is designed to deliver, as some out there do. This isn't just a cute story with a few good insights and catch-phrases; it contains a highly practical and actionable means to improve all of your relationships, and to take greater control over the circumstances of your life.Maybe you have already overcome your own \\"victimhood\\" and don't need to read this book for your own personal benefit. Even so, if you're in the business of helping others to lead creative and empowered lives, you will find the book full of useful distinctions, examples, insights, and great aphorisms. Of course, if you do find yourself feeling at times like a victim, or if some of your relationships are giving you high blood pressure or ulcers, then you should probably get a copy of this book and read it as soon as you can."},{"Title":"The Power of TED* (*The Empowerment Dynamic)","review":"This book revealed \\"victim\\" vocabulary in many aspects of life. Who doesn't feel as if there isn't enough time? While my clients don't think of themselves as victims, we all occasionally forget who's creating our life. The awareness of the voice of \\"victim\\" is tremendously helpful! And the way TED explains the creator role helps anyone move back into the driver's seat. It comes easier every day!

At her suggestion, I bought this book and realized right away that it was exactly what I needed in my life to clarify and support a way of thinking and acting that I had been working on for awhile. Let's just say that without the timing of the simple wisdom in this book, through an engaging story, I might be under the covers right now cowering and paralyzed in the midst of a particularly challenging time (filled with opportunities, as I see it now!) in my life. An attitude ajustment this book definitely is - if you take the challenge, find the mentors/coaches in your life (including yourself), and be creative with what your heart's desire is.I am presently using the Power of TED as a resource for a yoga based stress relief series for women who have experienced domestic violence. The book will be a gift from me, and the author, David Emerald, - at our cost - at the end of this series.

If you have even a moderately sophisticated understanding of relationship dynamics and intersubjectivity, you will find this book well below your level."},{"Title":"What the Truth Tastes Like","review":"Martha Silano's &quot;What the Truth Tastes Like&quot; is an extraordinary book of poems! Her wit, evocative use of language, depth of feeling, and sharp intelligence shine through. The poems bring to life a sensibility that appears steeped in everyday life yet also connects with broader, universal themes. I am amazed by her range and her ability to convey in few words, a moment, a look, a memory. This book is truly a delight."},{"Title":"What the Truth Tastes Like","review":"If WHAT THE TRUTH TASTES LIKE included nothing but the poem, &quot;What I Meant to Say Before I Said 'So Long,'&quot; if would be reason enough to buy this sumptuous first book by Martha Silano. In &quot;What I Meant to Say. . . &quot; Silano creates a world as delicate, dangerous, and gleaming as a spider's web, and it brings me to tears. Luckily for us, however, this poem is not alone. Silano lays out a full feast of wonderful verses in a collection that is deliciously unpeggable. She cinematically unfolds an unexpected tragedy, as witnessed by a group of birdwatchers, in &quot;At the Shorebird Festival: Grays Harbor, Washington.&quot; She takes on the persona of an angry horse in the stark, edgy &quot;They're Prohibited by City Ordinance.&quot; And in &quot;Men of the Stone Age Had No Use for Fractions,&quot; she celebrates abundance--with a wink. And such a wink, for Silano, is not unusual. These poems are laced with humor; sometimes subtle, sometimes sly, sometimes silly. In &quot;The Sausage Parade&quot; she serves up past boyfriends with plenty of spice. In &quot;Just Don't Write Any Poems About Niagara Falls,&quot; she brings the art of curse-laying to new and hilarious heights. And she responds the way some of us only dream of in &quot;To the Woman Who, When I Went to Heat My Pizza in the Office Microwave, Asked Me, 'Who Are You?'&quot; Not every poem, however, properly shows off Silano's humor and compassion, her enormous appreciation of nature (especially birds) or her knack for telling a tale. &quot;Shrimp Arithmetic&quot; despite its intriguing title, is inaccessible to me after repeated readings. &quot;Notes from the Committee Investigating the Abolishment of Um&quot; doesn't quite live up to the fun of its premise. And while she generally uses her lists of names, objects, and titles to wonderful effect in poems such as &quot;In Praise of Body Hair,&quot; &quot;The Man Who Slept in My Bed,&quot; the whimsical &quot;In That Other Universe&quot; and the outrageously imaginative &quot;For a Friend Who Sends Me a Flyer on the Art of Ear Candling and News Her Book has Arrived,&quot; she pushes her listmaking to excess, without enough heart, in &quot;A Trip to the Yellow Pages: Ba, Be, and So Forth.&quot; But who's perfect? WHAT THE TRUTH TASTES LIKE is a rich and triumphant first offering, with many a poem to savor."},{"Title":"What the Truth Tastes Like","review":"I loved this book! The poems in What the Truth Tastes Like, Martha Silano's first collection, are smart, funny, and personal, above all displaying a deep love of language in a search for meaning and connection.The poems here are about birth, death, and the relationships ended or sustained in between, about childhood and identity. They describe the doings of people in the wild and the backyard: the tide after a man drowns &quot;erases every footprint, and where he lay a flock of whimbrels alights&quot;; the cosmos explained by dad, &quot;post-cookout star-gazer&quot;; the showers of sparks loved by those who &quot;live in the shadow of live volcanoes, the chance we'll awake to at least a dusting of ash.&quot;Inner worlds are explored here engagingly as well. Contemplating ear candling, for example, the speaker follows the flame through the &quot;bony labyrinth&quot; wondering about the contents it will loosen and extrude: &quot;your mother the harbinger's honey the belt goes around your waist ... blue side down? ... Could you have it skip the refusals, the let's just be friends?&quot; Recounting the history of sausages, the poet illuminates not only her own heritage but that of a string of exes through descriptions of their sausages of choice.&quot;Bring me everything and don't peel it,&quot; insists the speaker in the final section of the book. When we &quot;want to know if it's worth springing for a valentine tub or a boat ride to Cave of the Winds and the trilobite wall,&quot; Silano will be &quot;the one [we] turn to for advice.&quot;"},{"Title":"What the Truth Tastes Like","review":"There are so many things to recommend this book of poetry, I don't know where to begin...perhaps just with a list of glowing adjectives. Ms. Silano's poetry is funky, thoughtful, funny, sensual, faintly animist, gently gastronomic, tender, incredibly observant...one could go on and on. I think what I like the most though is the range -- very honest poems about childhood that aren't like the bruised childhood poems we've all read 1,000 times before, then a poem about sausage, then about the Yellow pages, then shorebirds. The author has a way of bringing to your attention things that you never thought about before (What is a &quot;shebang&quot; exactly?) and making you happily run to the dictionary (but not not *too* often) to check out new words such as &quot;pubigerous.&quot; Thoughtful, original, and smart without being pretentious. Languid but energizing. Enjoy!"},{"Title":"What the Truth Tastes Like","review":"From the first poem ('The Man Who Slept in My Bed'), Silano sings: Merry, zaftig a cappella, a little hoarse with remembering; body-miked for our benefit and to hear herself. She turns up the volume of our world's detail--flowers populate, food predominates, birds know things, human bodies raise, embrace or betray us.Scenes are lit, the cast grows, a chamber group then an orchestra swells, stills. Silano's poems have a wistful attention: Like generations of soprano Carmens backstage, at intermission, who listen backward to how they've sung, sneaking bites of what the truth tastes like and 'its chorizo-ful wisdom,' 'the sausage parade,' anything to get it right the next act. They enter on cue and blow us away with talent, the emotion, the ingredients, the genera, the common."},{"Title":"What the Truth Tastes Like","review":"All first books should be as good as this one. In this book, we enter into a world of food, relationships and truth. The poet surprises us with sausage parades, spiders the size of ears and a trip through the yellow pages. Martha Silano's word and sound play keeps this book an enjoyable read for anyone who loves language.I would highly recommend it to poetry lovers or anyone who loves language."},{"Title":"What the Truth Tastes Like","review":"I love this poem!Especially the words this poet used!

Here's an example of the information contained in the book. My wonderful beagle-mix puppy is pretty rambunctious and I was hoping to find information on the specific training needs of beagles.

This book had no depth and offered no real information about the care, breeding and history of this unique breed. Instead of focusing on beagles, the owner describes a beagle mix. I admit I was a little dismayed that the book did not focus exclusively on the pure beagle. People who own pure beagles or folks who are considering becoming owners of beagles would find more information in any of a number of books on the subject or by traveling on the internet.

The pictures and stories are amazing!"},{"Title":"Immigrant Kids","review":"This wonderful non-fiction book will be a hit with students at the 4th-6th grade level. The real life pictures of immigrant children in the neighborhoods of New York during the late 1800's and early 1900's that appear on almost every page of the book should hold the interest of even the most reluctant readers. However, while the reading itself is not too difficult for most 4th-6th grade students, much of the vocabulary explaining the era of that time will be unfamiliar to them so covering this book as a read-aloud may be most beneficial. Immigrant Kids provides a wonderful way to introduce students to immigration in the past and show how it has changed over time. It lends itself well to a discussion in history class on the various cultures that became part of the giant \\"mixing pot\\" we now call our country. Because this book is set in New York it can further be used to teach about the city of New York and its early beginnings. Possibly the one thing that will interest students the most about this book is that it is written from the perspective of children like themselves. Overall the historical content of this book is very well defined and accurate and the photograph driven text provides readers with a very non-threatening approach to information books. It is a must read in any 4th-6th grade history curriculum and can work as a wonderful addition to a reading curriculum when used in accompaniment with other books both fictional and factual dealing with the topic of immigration."},{"Title":"Immigrant Kids","review":"The life of an immigrant child was harsh.

This is an over-sized book, profusely illustrated with contemporary photographs. Sometimes the photograph will take up more page space than the text and many times a whole page is devoted to the photograph. The text concentrates on 1890s-1900s immigration, coming into Ellis Island and living in New York City. The children are the focus and each chapter takes a look at a specific aspect of their live work, play, school. The book is peppered here and there will actual quotes from people who were once the children this book speaks of.The photographs are wonderful and the book can be enjoyed simply by looking through the pictures and reading the captions. It is the photos that make this book. Unfortunately, we were not very impressed with the text. It had no cohesiveness, told no one's story, just randomly gave out information, which was interesting per se, but neither of us had any connection with the author's style of imparting that information. Rather a disappointment from a book authored by Russell Freedman.

Their exposure to the significance of mass immigration to the growth of the United States is so limited that they have no real understanding of the critical role that it played in the development of the country.Using images and text, Freedman explains the immigrant experience to the young person, describing their life aboard a crowded ship, passing through immigration at Ellis Island to most likely live in a crowded tenement in a large city. Their life was very hard, most adults worked for wages that were not high enough to support their family, so children were put to work as soon as they were able. No child was supposed to work before the age of fourteen, but that was a law regularly flouted by families desperate to make ends meet.Written at a level that young people can relate to, this book will help them to understand the valuable and positive role that immigration has played in making the United States a great country."},{"Title":"Clues at the Carnival (Scooby-Doo!

The story starts in the 1830s in London, England. Oliver is kind and friendly and he is also an orphan. Other characters in the story are Fagin, Jack Dawkins, Bill Sikes, Nancy, Rose Maylie, Monks, Agnes, Mrs. Mann, and Mr. Bumble. The only thing Oliver wants is a family. His problem is that his real parents are dead. Also nobody wants to be his parents. The solution to the problem is when Oliver finds out that Monks is Oliver's half brother and Rose is his aunt. After Mr. Brownlow and Mrs. Bedwin take Oliver as their own, his problem is solved. At the end Oliver meets Fagin in his cell for Oliver's father's will. After that Oliver leaves the prison. Outside a crowd gathers around a scaffold to see Fagin be hanged.I would recommend this book to kids above 3rd grade. I would not recommend this book to kids below 3rd grade because of the violent parts in this book. I liked this book because it showed what it was like in London at that time.

Then, when Oliver finds out what they're doing to him, he runs away. Then, the police catch him and he reports the other kids for stealing but the police blame him. The man that owns the shop had seen the other kids steal but not Oliver. Then Oliver gets out of jail and Mr. Brownlow sees him and takes care of him. After, when he gets better, Mr. Brownlow sends him to do a favor for him but he doesn't return. Bill Sikes finds him and he takes him back to Fagin. Fagin puts him in a room and starts to beat on him for running away. After, Nancy comes in and says that she is going to help him. There is a secret about Oliver's true identity- you have to read the book to find out.I recommend this book to other kids because it has a lot of detail and the author is describing parts of London and how the people acted in London. Also, I liked this book because how realistic the author describes places in London. Another thing is that how things can happen in the world that a person can make kids thieves. There is a CD to hear and also a movie you can watch and see how cruel people were in London."},{"Title":"Read and Listen Books: Oliver Twist (Read & Listen Books)","review":"Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens is a novel about an orphan named Oliver. The setting is inside London. Oliver needs a home. However, it's not easy to find a home because robbers want to use or steal him. Monks wants to make Oliver a thief. Fagin wants to use him to steal the things he wants. Oliver gets a home with two people: Mr. Brownlow and Mrs. Bedwin.I liked this book a little because of some happy parts. I don't like the sad parts. I recommend this book to people who can handle it. People who can handle the violence in this book should read this book. The photos were helpful to me because they told a lot of information to me."},{"Title":"Insight Meditation: A Step-By-Step Course on How to Meditate","review":"Thank you Sharon Salzburg and Joseph Goldstein for this compilation oflessons, Q & A's and pithy quotes which are bound in a beautifully laid outspiral notebook for individual or class use. With clear concepts and instruction, this bookis an excellent gift for anyone learning to meditate or deepening an established practice.It is amazing that for 20 dollars one could receive such a detailed and grounded understanding from these seasoned teachers."},{"Title":"Insight Meditation: A Step-By-Step Course on How to Meditate","review":"I gave the CD several tries just in case it was my mood or mental state but nope, this woman's tone of voice is condescending. There were times that I actually opened my eyes and looked down at which ever body part she was referring to because her tone of voice made me think I was doing it wrong. In order for a guided meditation to be effective for me, the speaker must have a calm, soothing voice and an even tone. This woman would say something like \\"just let it go\\" and the vision I would get would be her standing over me trying to pry and yank \\"it\\" out of my hands. I want to visualize \\"it\\" floating quietly away. Because I didn't care for the CD I merely flipped thru the book. It all comes in a nice box with pockets for the CD and some little study cards."},{"Title":"Insight Meditation: A Step-By-Step Course on How to Meditate","review":"i was very pleased with this book and have read many books on this subject, i actually wish i would have read this first!!!"},{"Title":"Insight Meditation: A Step-By-Step Course on How to Meditate","review":"Insight meditation provides a very clear and rich method for learning how to meditate.It becomes clear as well that meditation doesn't need to belong to a specific religion; although several religions are quoted in the book, it goes beyond; hence this course becomes practicable for everyone who seeks inner peace and freedom."},{"Title":"Insight Meditation: A Step-By-Step Course on How to Meditate","review":"Couldn't put it down. It is a sturdy book with CDs and cards with to remind you of the teachings, etc. All in a sturdy gift-box. Love it, and it would make a great gift. Nice quality and clearly explains meditation for the layman using language appropriate to the teachings but not out of my reach as a beginner.

Within this excellent package you will receive an excellent Step Buy Step 124 page Guide, that has to be one of the best-published books on Meditation. The book is excellent for both beginners and advanced. Also in this package one gets two spoken Meditation and breathing exercises cds, as well as a pack of 12 cards, which I laminated and placed them on my refrigerator.Just to get a quick pick at how excellent this package is, the cards are. The Four Noble Truths. The Six Wholesome and Unwholesome Roots of the Mind. The Noble Eightfold Path. The Five Handrances. The Three Kinds of Sufferings. The Four Brahma Viharas. The Eight Vicissitudes. The Six Sense Doors and Three Feeling Tones. The Four Metta Phrases. The Six Stages of Metta. The Seven Points of Posture, and The Five Precepts. The Set could have done well without the cards, but they are excellent to keep in handy, in a place where you can read them frequently.The two cds are spoken and very relaxing. You here Sharon Salzburg's calming voice as she guides you through breathing exercises, and meditations.I have a few books on Meditation, and to be honest, The book in this package, Insight Meditation, has to be my utmost favorite. I love this set, and I recommend it to all that want to relieve stress from their lives, or want to connect with the divine within. Highly Recommended."},{"Title":"Insight Meditation: A Step-By-Step Course on How to Meditate","review":"There are many things I liked about this guided meditation series. I particularly liked the way the walking meditation was presented. I haven't heard this explained very well on other audio resources, so this was a value add for me.While I think the whole overall presentation is good and worth owning, especially at the price it is being offered, I do think there are a few shortcomings. For example, while the authors are well versed in their topic, they don't necessarily have the greatest voices for this type of recording. That may sound superficial, but this does make a difference for many people. Some of the volume control at different points in the recording were a bit jarring to me as well.If you are new to Insight Meditation, you will find this a useful guide. If you are looking for a bit more depth, then consider reading Breath by Breath by Rosenberg. This helps flesh out some of the detail of what is presented in this series.I gave this a four rather than a five larely because of the icing and not the cake. In other words, I think they could have presented their material better. However, this is solid and I think you can buy it with confidence for an introduction to meditation."},{"Title":"Insight Meditation: A Step-By-Step Course on How to Meditate","review":"This package of supplies is rich with aid for those struggling in practice. Do you have a long ride in for work in the morning? Toss in one of these CD's provided here for us; you'll find direct relief from whatever emotional hindrances you may be experiencing at the moment. Not by turning away, but by embracing the feeling into our entire scope of vision. The meditation cards Oshuniyi mentioned, are a wonderful way to further your practice. They laminated them onto their refrigerator. I took a card or two to work with me daily for a few months. When I had a rough day or stressful moments, I would simply glance over the cards and be instantly reminded of how wonderful everything potentially is.The workbook supplied for you here is beyond price, synonymous with the CD's really. Joseph Goldstein and Sharon Salzberg have both been longtime standing Vipassana meditation teachers, both with all-embracing training in various traditions of the Buddhist path. While you use these CD's to really get in touch with the truth of your life, the workbook is a nice way to affirm what you are finding in your meditation. To nudge you in the right direction a bit. The cards can also be used to place on your home altar, to remind you of certain truths when the thinking mind wavers. What an all around great box filled with insight here."},{"Title":"Insight Meditation: A Step-By-Step Course on How to Meditate","review":"You really gotta have a practice you follow to begin to get liberated. Sharon Salzberg and Joseph Goldstein are terrific guides to help you along this path of liberation. This Meditation Kit is a great way to start. Heck, even experienced meditators would get a lot out of it. Insight (Vipassana) Meditation is elegant in it's simplicity, yet remarkably adaptable to whatever spiritual tradition you follow. And, Sharon Salzberg has a complete guide here, with an excellent workbook and very helpful CD's. Of course, it is Buddhist in it's language and approach yet it's very understandable. One word of caution, though. Once you begin to practice using this guide you will end up spending more money............ you will go out and buy a few more books by Sharon Salzberg because you will like her that much!"},{"Title":"Insight Meditation: A Step-By-Step Course on How to Meditate","review":"I have really enjoyed this journey so far. I have not finished the book yet but the teachings reitorate much of what I have learned in other forums recently. I love that in the first meditation on the CD, Sharon tells us that getting distracted and coming back IS the practice. We have all struggled with the wandering mind during meditation and I like that she tells us it's OK...This book has struck a chord with me in many ways. Lesson one talks of being \\"disconnected\\" with the world having been \\"lost in the shadow of our conditioning.\\" How often do we feel like we are just going through the motions or living in a dream instead of actually experiencing life and feeling awake? I also like that they encourage all people to meditate- although it derives from Asia; Christians, Atheists, and Wiccans can get just as much out of this as Buddhists and Hindus.Stop judging others, stop judging ourselves, just experience the moment and connect with it, be a part of it."},{"Title":"Insight Meditation: A Step-By-Step Course on How to Meditate","review":"This kit, a book, 2 CDs and 3 \\"reminder cards\\" is almost perfect for someone who wants to learn or try meditating. I have bought this for at least 5 different people as a gift. Those who use it have had major changes in their lives from learning meditation. I teach a small meditation class and recommend this to all people who attend. Beginners and experienced alike. I have bought 100 or more \\"self help\\" books, programs, tapes, CDs, etc. This is the most effective of them all and incredibly inexpensive. This has been my experience."},{"Title":"Insight Meditation: A Step-By-Step Course on How to Meditate","review":"If you've always wanted/intended to start your own meditation practice, I would recommend this set. The workbook and CD combine as a tool that will be helpful to beginners and intermediate &quot;meditators&quot; alike.

However I found it a bit ironic that some of the Buddhist teachings are around moderation and even in the preface of this book it uses some very strict wording around your lifestyle, postures that you HAVE to do, etc. etc.Personally, I like the techniques but I wasn't a fan of the \\"you have to do this exactly this way\\" parts."},{"Title":"Insight Meditation: A Step-By-Step Course on How to Meditate","review":"From the first day I have enjoyed this gift.

So many aspects of the practice were brought toghether cohesively by the book and other aids. I am sure I will use this as a referance many times! The cards are wonderful reminders when the memory slips a little. Explanations of The Four Noble Truths, the Eightfold Path, etc. are easily understood as an introduction to Buddhist thought and move one to further study."},{"Title":"Insight Meditation: A Step-By-Step Course on How to Meditate","review":"I liked the packaging very much. the book was somewhat helpful, but not as informative as I had expected. The meditations were pretty much relaxation exercises, although helpful. All in all, a pretty nice package, but a bit dissapointing."},{"Title":"Insight Meditation: A Step-By-Step Course on How to Meditate","review":"This is a clear and well written guide to Insight Meditation practice. I was surprised as rather than presenting the same directions so many other books give, this book will lead you into deeper aspects of the Practice. It is not only a book for the beginner. The cards and the meditations on CD round out this offering beautifully. The book is printed on glossy stock, a rarety in this cost reduction age where so many keepable books are printed on something akin to newspaper with the same yellowing qualities.This is an offering worth having."},{"Title":"Insight Meditation: A Step-By-Step Course on How to Meditate","review":"Insight Meditation is a decent no-hype introduction to one style of meditation.It would be a good starting point for those who are curious about the practice and benefits of meditation, although there are other good primers out there, including perhaps the granddaddy of them all,How to Meditate: A Guide to Self-Discoveryby Lawrence Leshan.The book very well written, and down to earth, especially those sections authored by Sharon Salzberg. I also think she moderates the exercises on the accompanying cds, and most should find her voice pleasant enough.Though this shouldn't be the deciding factor, the whole product is very nicely packaged for $20 - everything comes in a sturdy storage box and the book is spiral (metal) bound, so it lays flat."},{"Title":"Insight Meditation: A Step-By-Step Course on How to Meditate","review":"The easy to follow directions and information. Very insightful, although this is my first attempt into meditation. I would highly recommend this to anyone considering meditation."},{"Title":"Insight Meditation: A Step-By-Step Course on How to Meditate","review":"I was skeptical of this system, but carefully read the reviews, and decided to give it a shot.I'm glad I did.My wife had purchased a meditation product from Sylvan Learning, and it got me started, but I felt it was limited,and very basic, so I went online and found this.Once it arrived, I was excited to try it out, and we have been using it daily since it arrived, about a week ago.Our lives have been turned upside down in ways I never expected at this late stage of my life, and our stress levels have been over the top, with no relief in sight, for the past few years.When trying the Sylvan meditation, I realized there could be something here for me, but it seemed too simplistic and limited.Well, I'm happy to report the Insight Meditation program is working wonders for me!I use it once or twice a day, some days, I will do 2 sessions, back to back, and I am enjoying a peace and calm like I have not had in years, perhaps ever. I am still on the first meditation, Breath Meditation, and see no reason to rush on to the next one yet. It's very difficult to just focus on one thing, my mind goes incessantly, but the cd is excellent at guiding me through, and bringing me back to the focal point.I am sleeping well, whereas for the the past few years, I would be awake for hours each night, and to sleep through the night was an extremely rare occurrence.Now, already, it's the norm.I highly recommend this system to anyone interested in learning to meditate, and finding some inner peace in this crazy world.Back to add to this review, date 7/14/2011.I stopped using the meditation for some months, and found myself becoming filled with anxiety again.A little background, I have just lost an excellent business I had spent 30 years building, and it's all been lost. No retirement, no job, back to square one.Using this meditation is the only thing that has helped me find some peace within my daily nightmare.I've lost the first CD, so I'm back to order another, since it's been so helpful, and I feel the need to go back to the basics.The book was not something I have been able to get into, but the CD's are well worth the investment.As I said, I have just ordered them again, just so I can use the first one, which I misplaced.It will probably show up the week after I get my new one. LOLI hope this helps you as much as it does me. It's not for everyone, my wife tried it with me in the beginning, but she did not care for it, so she dropped it, but I continued on and found what I need."},{"Title":"Insight Meditation: A Step-By-Step Course on How to Meditate","review":"This beginner's guide is the most enjoyable I have read. The guided meditations are a big hit with my meditation group and the authors have a clear method of explaining a difficult subject in western terms. The material is nicely packaged, with great thought into the type of binding, CD storage and card storage. Thank you to the authors."},{"Title":"Insight Meditation: A Step-By-Step Course on How to Meditate","review":"The Book is an excellent material for those newbies that is interested to Meditation, regarding with the Insight Meditation procedure that is being introduced, I find it not usual compared to the ones thought with the Theravada Style of Vipassana-Bhavana were the starting meditation should be in Standing, then Walking, then Sitting Meditation. However it is a great resource for learning the foundations for Meditations and building the knowledge and some Pitfalls to avoid for a learning student. A great quality material for the Book and its complimented Audio CD, your money's worth."},{"Title":"Insight Meditation: A Step-By-Step Course on How to Meditate","review":"If you're new to meditation and are looking for some guidance, this set may be just the thing for you.What was especially helpful about this set:**the comprehensive materials. You get a book, explaining each meditation section, as well as background information about meditation. The CD has several meditation practices on it, and you are encouraged to journal your feelings after each meditation.**the variety of meditations. Everything from breathing, to walking to vipassana meditations are covered.**Sharon's matter-of-factness about meditation realities. She reassures you that it's very common for your mind to wander during practice.What really missed the mark with this set:**Both Sharon Salzberg and Joseph Goldstein have very grating, very unpleasant sounding voices. These voices really detract from the meditation experience. It's hard to ignore them! Meditation is supposed to help you relax and free your mind. A soothing, calming voice is a critical part of the process. While I really appreciate what Sharon and Joseph have created here, they should have used someone with a better voice to guide the meditations.The annoying voices is why I rated this 4 stars instead of 5 stars. That being said, I do recommend this product as a good introduction to meditation."},{"Title":"Insight Meditation: A Step-By-Step Course on How to Meditate","review":"I started by using a couple of the meditations. I find them soothing; my husband says that when I do one after a stressful day at work, he can see that it calms me down right off. Some time after starting the meditations I began reading the book. I have been through it once and am partway through a second reading. I find it inspiring and can easily imagine continuing this process of re-reading for some time to come as part of my spiritual journey. My favorite meditations are the breath meditation, the walking meditation, and the metta meditation. I did the body sensations one once when I was tense and it was quite helpful. The one on hindrances doesn't seem very helpful as one is probably only experiencing one hindrance at a time, while the meditation walks you through all of them. I have been recommending this book and tapes to friends as it has been so useful to me. I also love Sharon Salzberg's book A Heart as Wide as the World."},{"Title":"Insight Meditation: A Step-By-Step Course on How to Meditate","review":"The book and cd's were great. I used this to kick-off my learning about insight meditation. The book is a great introduction, and the cd's helped me to get the feel for meditation. I sometimes hung up a card to remind me to be mindful of particular things during the day. Every now and then I will use a meditation on the cds when I want help focusing on something specific in my meditation. I highly recommend this to someone who is wanting to start meditating."},{"Title":"Insight Meditation: A Step-By-Step Course on How to Meditate","review":"I have not finished this \\"course\\" yet, but so far I like it quite a bit.Already having learned to meditate on the breath some of this was \\"old hat\\" for me, but even so, there is info here I did not have and it is well written and worthwhile as a review and as another perspective.The cards that come with it, to me, were a waste of paper. They could have just put the info at the back of the book. It seems like some kind of \\"marketing ploy\\" to create a \\"package\\".However, the cd's are good, and do help one to practice meditation. Even for me it gave me some new techniques and new ideas about meditation.Overall, this is an excellent intro to \\"insight meditation\\" and I recommend it!"},{"Title":"Insight Meditation: A Step-By-Step Course on How to Meditate","review":"Have been meditating for about four decades. \\"Insight Meditation: A Step-By-Step Course on How to Meditate\\" is refreshing and most informative.

Also, excellent price."},{"Title":"Insight Meditation: A Step-By-Step Course on How to Meditate","review":"I thought I knew how to meditate, but I was so wrong. This step by step course is fantastic! I went into this hoping it would work, and actually had a few false starts because I wasn't reading it as \\"seriously\\" as I should have. I put it aside for a little while, finally carefully read it and took their advice every step of the way, started to sit daily, and carefully pondered my responses to every exercise. It is wonderful! I just finished ordering one for my mother who says that she sees a big difference in me since I started meditating seriously. If you want to learn to meditate, this is the perfect starter course."},{"Title":"Insight Meditation: A Step-By-Step Course on How to Meditate","review":"This package with book, cards, and CD is an excellent down-to-earth introduction to the practice of meditation. It is the best I have found yet. I particularly like the first meditation lesson on the CD. The package is also a good introduction to the most basic teachings of buddhism about ethics (no dogmas here!)."},{"Title":"Access Your Brain's Joy Center: The Free Soul Method","review":"First of all, this is not just another self-help book.In the first 40 pages, the author uses very simple, straight-forward instructions to teach you how to stimulate the pleasure and mood-elevating responses (through the Septum Pellucidum) in your brain easily, naturally, and AT WILL. Out of 214 pages, those first 40 pages alone earn the book 5 stars! In fact, he specifically wrote the book so that you could just read those 40 pages, containing the deceptively simple instructions, and walk away with an incredible new ability for life! That's the good part.Here's the not so good part - after those first 40 pages, the book seems to lose it's focus and wander aimlessly all over the field of self-help and new age fluff. The author seems intent on describing how to apply the technique to every conceivable ailment known to humanity. Unfortunately, he never stays on any one topic long enough to really discuss anything in depth, including the technique itself.So, for me personally, the value of the book dropped dramatically just after the first chapter. On the bright side, knowing what I know now, I would have happily paid five times the price for that one chapter alone.I just think this book and it's author, missed an opportunity to discuss in laymen's terms, the hard science and biofeedback theory behind the actual technique itself. After all, there's more than enough new-age self-help methods going around, but this one is actually rooted in physiology. It's a chance to appeal to a larger audience through simple scientific fact.Regardless, my advice is whether you're an avid new ager, an agnostic explorer, or even a hard core skeptic, find a copy of this book, read to page 40, and just follow the simple instructions. Because this isn't about believing in a new age self-help method, it's about feeling an ability that you already have, but may not be aware of - the ability to trigger your brain's reward system and feel really, REALLY GOOD, INSTANTLY, AT WILL!This is not the kind of thing you read about and then never get around to using in real life. Once you learn how to do it, it simply feels so good, you'll probably find yourself doing it all the time, without even thinking about it. All those other benefits, like pain reduction and mood-enhancement just seem to happen as a by-product. The amazing thing is, triggering this effect just becomes a habit, because the more you do it the better it feels and the better it feels, the more you'll find yourself doing it!And if that's not self-help, I don't know what is."},{"Title":"Access Your Brain's Joy Center: The Free Soul Method","review":"Excellent book, the author is clear and gives practical examples and exercises. By learning the techniques in the book you can achieve a lot in your life. The techiques guide you step by step in learning how to improve areas of your life. How can you use a couple of simple techniques to conquer fear, worry, hurt, and stress. Reduce the stress level in your life by using techniques that take just minutes to accomplish, without the use of drugs. (It can't get more natural than this). Reduce the inner stress in your life, stop smoking easily, loose weight, increase the happiness in your life. I tried some of the techniques while at the dentist and it helped tremendously. I recommend it for everyone. Mr. Sanders has the scientific knowledge and backs it up with pilot studies from the University of Northern Arizona. This is a great book if you want to learn how to de-stress easily, and improve all areas of your life."},{"Title":"Access Your Brain's Joy Center: The Free Soul Method","review":"I have read a slew of this type of book and I really got a lot out of this one. The exercises are clear, concise and the visualizations are not too complicated. I enjoyed the relaxed teaching style and anecdotes. Like Nathaniel Friedland, Pete Sanders is an author that is a pretty basic guy who taught himself to open up to his psychic centers. I very much admire his work and just bought the correspondence course! Looks like fun!Buy this, it is a great book and very well worth the price."},{"Title":"Access Your Brain's Joy Center: The Free Soul Method","review":"If you are an MIT graduate I'm sure this is an easy read. I am not and for me it was very hard to get into. I went to a seminar by the Author, Pete Sanders, and got some of information that way, which made it much easier for me to absorb. I lent the book to a friend indefinitely.

I invented a financial agent system in 1999 that was subsequently purchased by America On-Line. The structure of agent interactions of that commercially implemented system is exactly as shown in figure 1.1 of the book.The only thing that has changed since that system was built, and since this book was published, is the rise of Web Services. The book details an implementation architecture called IMPACT for deploying agents. I think we would find that Web Services would be the appropriate implementation technology today."},{"Title":"Selections from Plato","review":"I bought this book because a book called Selections from Plato linked to it.

(As an aside, it was quite clear when Professor Rist presented this Aquinas Lecture, that some of the philosophers in his audience definitely did not agree with it.) But agree or not, in clear and concise language, that is as easily understood by lay persons as by academics, Rist makes the case that moral philosophy cannot be inoculated from God, as our modern society consistently attempts to do, because God is the necessary and indispensable foundation for ethics and morality. But perhaps more unnerving still, Professor Rist lays the blame for the origination of &quot;profane ethics&quot; squarely upon the sholders of &quot;a group of theistic, indeed Christian, philosophers who act as though it makes no great difference in ethics whether God exists at all.&quot; This unapologetic &quot;apologia&quot; moves quickly through history, starting with St. Augustine and eventually honing in on a point Kant made, that theoretical reason [is] essentially impotent, and certainly has nothing to contribute to ethics.&quot; Yet Rist moves beyond Kant's practical reasoning, the &quot;root&quot; of our modern theories, to assert that in the moral debates of this world, we must have the courage and willingness to not compromise with the truth about ethics. Thus he concludes, &quot;Stubbornness in itself is no virtue; knowing what cannot be compromised in a hostile environment certainly is.&quot;"},{"Title":"Financial Privacy & Electronic Commerce: Who's In My Business","review":"It is about time that the issues of privacy are being thoroughly addressed in this country.

This book is impossible to read; Hobbes' style of writing is ridiculously long winded and very difficult to understand. While I understand and appreciate that this book is one of the fundamental books of modern society, I can't like it because it is so hard to read. Locke I understand, Machiavelli I understand, but Hobbes is tough. I'm no genius, but I'm no idiot either, and I don't think reading one book should consume months of my life.

However, as with other books such as Plato's Republic, we are ultimately dealing with undercrediting human beings for their complexity. It seems that Hobbes is only able to see humans capable of being evil, brutish, and short, while not considering many, many, many other qualities a human can take on. I cannot blame Hobbes for being appaled at the sight of the war he fought, but this is only one face of human kind- a violent expression of the will to power if you will. Besides, if humans are so corrupt what guarantees that the people under the supreme ruler will not ultimately destroy the ruler with their brutishness? Above all, if all men are evil brutish and short how is it ever possible to find a ruler that may take over the people?I cannot however discredit Hobbes for his influence on the more correct philosphers, such as Nietzsche (remember the Ubermensch?) and fortification against anarchists. We could have, however, done with out his obvious influence on nihilism, though it is not his fault forbeing misread.A note on the edition: as always I was satisfied with the quality of Penguin Classics in introducing the text and the annotations. I give the edition 5 stars; but the content of Hobbes's philosphy deserved just 1."},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"Ok..So you want to live without any god?Read this Book Plus Schopenhauer Plus Nietzsche.Your life will be much better !.This book is absolute Classic.Easy Read(not dificult as Kant which is good).10\\\\10"},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"Christian rigidity and stodginess and &quot;the letter of the law must be obeyed&quot; at its finest. An excellent exposition on the logical consequences of deeply distrusting human beings.To be more specific: Hobbes' key assumption, that humans in a state of nature are uncontrolled brutes, is not only contradicted by all sorts of anthropological evidence; it's a projection that we Westerners like to place over aboriginal peoples in order to justify colonizing them.Read Camus' THE PLAGUE instead, where Tarrou refers to a Hobbesian bureaucrat as &quot;Public Enemy Number One.&quot;"},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"As with most greatly intelligent writers, this is a dull read.

There is little consistency and the same word is spelled differently throughout the book. It started out as hard to read, but I was able to breeze through the different spelling after only a few chapters.The book itself was very interesting. Hobbes was arguing for a strong central government and he used history, tradition, logic and the Bible to argue his points. He was obvious a clear thinker and his arguments made sense.

The reader, however, must update Hobbes' basic argument by including non-state actors, such as transnational religious groups, drug gangs, etc."},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"First off, this is a review of Richard Tuck's Cambridge Text edition of Hobbes' Leviathan. This is one of several excellent editions of this powerful and disturbing work. I can also recommend the Hackett edition.Hobbes is on the short list of philosophers that every person should try to read. This is so for several reasons. He is a superb and witty writer who is capable of expressing his thought in unforgettable phrases and with ruthless logic and consistency. The result is a book that had enormous influence on political thought, on epistemology, on diplomatic thinking and on legal theory. You can trace his influence on Grotius, on Locke, on legal positivism and analytical philosophy among others.And the best part is that in spite of all that cultural impact to read him closely and with attention to his moment in our history is to still feel some of the shock of his effect on his contemporaries.Over his lifetime, Hobbes observed Europe and his own England tear themselves apart. This was the Europe suffering from the effects of The Thirty Years War and England plummeting into revolution and regicide.Hobbes, who started out a great classicist, looked around at his contemporaries and took solace in Thucydides. He developed a theory of a humanity that required strict control to overcome its inherit individualistic rapacity. Hobbes, who was a excellent student of the sciences, read Descartes and Galileo's physics and developed a materialist philosophy that based everything on matter and motion. Even God was material. If He wasn't then He wasn't at all. Hobbes was an excellent mathematician who used geometry and Galileo's work to develop his own methodology for philosophy. Hobbes had seen what religious and political faction could do and developed a theory of absolute sovereignty that gave that sovereign (whether king or Parliament) full control of the public expression of religious observance, of political thought and of justice. He put this all together in a coherent and consistent theory of the state- one of the first. Along the way, Hobbes attempted to purge the language of the obfuscations of Aristotle, the Schoolmen and of all talk of spirits and spiritualism.All that in just the first half. The second half of the book is basically submitting the Bible to a rational pruning and cutting in such a way that he can claim that Scripture backs up the reasoning he used to justify his political philosophy. It can be read as one of the opening salvos of Deism, of a subversive and surreptitious atheism or of just good clean fun for you rational humanists out there. I see you out there.Leviathan is a heady and challenging book, at once frustrating and fascinating. It is far too grounded in a faulty physics (Descartes) yet is worth the read just for the way he defines terms and teases out the implications of those definitions. There are some people who we read (like Plato, Nietzsche, the Buddha or Machiavelli) just to get them inside your head. I have found that there are times in my personal life that I needed help from the Buddha or the Stoa or even Machiavelli. Sometimes in my corporate life, I have needed help from Nietzsche (that usually didn't go very well) or Hobbes or the Nichomachean Ethics. Life is tricky that way.The Cambridge edition comes with an excellent introduction, a glossary for most of the historical and Biblical characters who are mentioned and a good bibliography. But like I said earlier, there are many good editions of Leviathan. Read, read, read, my friends."},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan was the first modern political theorem written in the English language. Poetry, essays, plays and a few academic analyses on Politics existed before that, but it was Hobbes who fathered modern political thought in all its rational and logical stipulation. It was Hobbes who questioned and fought the traditional notions of political understanding; nobody prior to Hobbes had ever cross-examined the foundations of a Monarchic structure within society and the genesis of government. In the introduction itself, Hobbes asserts his assumption that an organized state of life is a choice, just as chaos is a choice as well. He makes it clear in the start that nature predisposes everyone with certain rights and a prerequisite set of laws. Every man has a right to defend his life with all his ability and the law that nature imposes on every being is to live a life of peace and to treat others as one would like to be treated. He states that for self-preservation, man must bind himself in contract with other men to give up our birthrights to be protected by a collectively elected sovereign power. This sovereign power must have unconditional authority in every single aspect of life; there is no entity that boasts more strength or questions the elected sovereign power; everything else besides the sovereign is reigned by the sovereign.According to Hobbes, the nature of man is motivated by his passions, and there is no greater and intense passion than fear. Fear triumphs over all other emotions and man's primal fear is of losing his life by force, which can even make him take irrational decisions. It is this logical prognosis of his that made him believe that whatever can go wrong, will go wrong, unless man follows the law of nature; to live in peace and preserve his life in unison with his fellow citizens. His cynicism for human nature is established when he states that the state of nature is \\"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short\\". He says the only way to overcome the innate fear of death and the knowledge of the nature of human nature is to bind oneself in contract with the State so that everyone can be protected and life can go on without the pre-dominant instinctual fears that corrupt men into malice. Hobbes' approach to all his findings is very mechanical and stems from deductive reasoning. And as no arguments and understanding prior to him existed in the field of his discourse, a majority of his conclusions are axiomatic in definition. Because he wants his audience to think with the same rationality that he commands, Hobbes explains in microscopic detail the machinations of human civilization, beginning with an acute explanation of Man and his senses. He geometrically divides and disassembles our understanding of ourselves and then chauffeurs us to a perspective change that is required to comprehend all Hobbesian deduction.While the twenty first century's modern man might question Hobbes' reasoning behind granting all power to the \\"State\\", one must have an understanding of the epistemology of the Hobbesian thought that stemmed from an elongated suffering due to prolonged war, which arose due to the weakness in the Government that commanded during his youth. Thus, to evade the chaos of civil disagreement, Hobbes yields his logic and grants all existing power and importance to one sole entity. He grants power to the sovereign to literally do anything without any repercussions and also grants it an authority higher than that of God. All this is done because the sovereign is the selected representative of the whole population of his state, making this sole source of power also a theoretical manifestation of the state. This concept of the all-powerful state, an entity that embodies the constituency of all its citizens, officials and the sovereign power collectively is called the Leviathan; A form of a living and breathing beast that nothing in this world can oppose. Hobbes states that the existence of such a state is imperative to subdue all its' subjects in obedience, because fear is the only emotion a human being will submit to unconditionally, especially whence it is from a behemoth to the likes of a Leviathan.Hobbes' diction and grammatology is an arduous passage to cross, but the ideas and theories he is postulating required him to twist his words in his times' verbatim. One must always acknowledge the colloquial dialect of the English language Hobbes' time nurtured him with. He creates layers of ideas upon layers of laws that are meant to take the reader to precise conclusions. The purpose of his loquacity is to reach at one sole conclusion only, and that is what makes Leviathan a timeless study of logic.It is quiet evident that even after five centuries of radical polarization in the perception of government and politics, Leviathan still stands like the name of the entity it bears. It was this book that inspired almost all political theoreticians for many centuries to come. Students and admirers of both liberal and conservative political thought will benefit from reading Leviathan."},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"Leviathan is, of course, a classic so I won't waste words on its merits.

I'd prefer a more scholarly edition with an introduction decent footnotes as, I suspect, would the average reader."},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"I'll preface this review by saying that I've only read Books I-II of Leviathan (about half), but as a close friend recently told me, \\"That may be a new record.\\" Although the title refers to the ideal leader of state, it could easily be attributed to the book itself; it's a truly exhaustive, and exhausting, development of Hobbes' theory of political government, and it took me more than 2 months to sort through the first 400-odd pages.Besides its girth, the first thing that I would say usually dissuades readers from Hobbes' masterwork is the fact that many of its theories on government have been discarded over the last 300 years. He was not a fan of representative democracy - he held a largely pessimistic view on collective human nature - and viewed absolute rule under one centralized authority as the only form of government capable of controlling large groups of people with conflicting goals and opinions.That said, what kept me reading the first two books was how rigorously and completely he develops his theories of government from very basic anatomic principles and universal truths. It goes something like this:In Book I, entitled \\"Of Man,\\" Hobbes uses the scientific principles of his time to show how the human body operates in the world, gaining knowledge and competing with other human bodies for supremacy; this is, in the parlance of Locke, Rousseau, Hume and other 16th and 17th Century philosophers, the State of Nature, which in Hobbes words makes every human life \\"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short.\\"(I suspect that Hobbes, while using biblical references and terminology, was a closet atheist, as his view of human nature and survival was Darwinist well before Darwin. I've found at least one religious zealot in my book inventory who agrees with me, a missionary named Paul Hutchinson who wrote a book called \\"The New Leviathan\\" directly after WWII comparing the communist governments of Russia and China the ideal all-powerful state power Hobbes set forth in Leviathan. Of course, Hutchinson doesn't mind playing both sides of the coin, also referring to the fascist regimes of Mussolini and Hitler in Hobbesian terms in one chapter entitled \\"The Worship of the \`Mortal God'.\\")It's interesting and ironic that Hobbes in Book I derides educators and philosophers such as Aristotle, Cicero, and St. Thomas of Aquinas for your use of metaphors, which are to his empirical understanding not absolute and thus not reliable (\\"For words are wise mens counters, they do but reckon by them: but they are the mony of fooles\\" - Chapter 4), since Book II of Leviathan, \\"Of Commonwealth,\\" relies entirely upon the metaphor of government functioning as a human body. To his mind, every functional nation of the world is in the state of nature (in other words, the state of war) with every other nation. This, to his mind, is why nations are formed - [CUT] to protect the citizens, i.e., the parts of the body, from harm by other nations, i.e., political bodies.The only way Hobbes saw to do this - and this is where Hobbes has aged worst - was through enforced dictatorial rule, as the only way to keep people from breaking civil and natural laws was through fear of retribution (to be fair, Hobbes wrote Leviathan while in exile during one of England's bloodiest civil wars, so his primary political motive was ending internal conflict). I think the reason this opinion is universally decried is that most ideologies from either end of the political spectrum have something not to like - free-market advocates see the competition Hobbes wanted to eliminate as the ideal ruling power; his centralized oligarchical rule is exactly what liberal constitutionalists created social contracts against; religious fundamentalists are continually up in arms when the government conflicts with their own tenets.Jane Jacobs in the introduction to The Death and Life of Great American Cities rails against urban planners of the time she wrote it (it was first published in 1961) as \\"earnest and learned men, dealing with complex phenomena they do not understand at all and trying to make do with a pseudoscience.\\" I probably wouldn't use such strong language about Hobbes' political philosophy, but the principle is similar - Hobbes may have gotten it all wrong, but he got it wrong better than most of us have gotten it right."},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"The Leviathan is one of the most important books ever written on political and solcial philosophy and it explains what the first duty of government is: to maintain stability and avoid anarchy.The USA is the world's largest democracy. Yet, a natural disaster in New Orleans is sufficient to create anarchy. Reading Hobbes one can very clearly and simply understand that government is the only guarantee to avoid this anarchy. This is why one of the world's most stable country, Switzerland, has such a large public administration. As you can see, the Leviathan can lead to many conclusions of what happens in today's world and help us understand it better.The Leviathan is a challenging read, which you can read on the surface, but also read in a substantial detail. Hobbes is an author that uses a very simple English (for his time), but says a lot more than he seems to say. Obviously, the English is not very accessible for everybody and can take some time to read fully. However, it is definately worth reading this book properly, as it will allow you to derive a lot of conclusions and help your understanding of current affairs as well as your studies of economic and social sciences.The introduction to this book is very good, although some of the conclusions drawn there could be argued. On the whole this is an excellent book, especially to all those interested in the matter."},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"This huge work is the foundation of classical liberalism; it is the basis for Locke, for Smith, and all economic neo-liberalists all the way up to the current period. Written during the English Reformation, Hobbes was confronted with the problem of absolute individualism; he begins this work of political theory with a demolishment of objective truth swift enough to impress any post-modernist. He then proceeds to demonstrate the logical conclusion of man in a state of nature, and compels the modern world to enter into his social contract, or Leviathan out of necessity and fear. It is tempting to write off Hobbes as a cynic, but who can deny that much of what motivates individuals in the modern world is simply a fear to maintain survival and acceptance. It is the driving force of modern societies in terms of economic competition, and inter-national conflicts. Hobbes was a thinker of true depth and insight, though his ideas are so commonly ingrained in modern society that it is difficult to see why they were revolutionary when they were composed."},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"Being a free Kindle edition there is no introduction and no notes - but you do get the full text. The only difference from the original is that there are fewer capitals and italics. Hobbes used them for emphasis very much more than a modern writer would, and their pruning in this edition makes the text easier to read.Modern political philosophy begins with Hobbes. Before Hobbes, writers for centuries had accepted the divine right of kings or did not think much about the origins of government. Hobbes provides reasons as to how and why men come together to form government. He starts with the assumption that the organized state is a choice. The alternative is the \\"state of nature\\", where there is both a \\"right\\" of nature and \\"laws\\" of nature. Hobbes uses these terms in a very individual way. The \\"right\\" of nature is \\"the Liberty each man hath, to use his own power...for the preservation of his own Life\\". The \\"laws\\" of nature dictate that each person should seek to live with others in peace, and should only retain the right to as much liberty as he is willing to permit others. These \\"laws\\" are found by reason, and are utilitarian rather than moral. Hobbes is simply saying that if men think about their situation, reason tells them that giving up their natural rights in exchange for others doing likewise is the best means of self-preservation, even though actually doing it is contrary to human nature.On human nature Hobbes is cynical. Reason suggests advantages stem from co-operation, but unless men are constrained by an external authority this is outweighed by instinct. Men are fundamentally competitive and selfish. They are also roughly equal in ability so no one person can impose his will on others, and the most one can hope for is to protect oneself from others. Life in the state of nature is \\"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.\\" Men are therefore driven to create government via a pact with others to give up their natural rights to a sovereign authority, which may be either an individual or an oligarchy (Hobbes prefers the former). Hobbes uses the concept of a \\"social contract\\". It is not an historical event but a logical device to describe the ongoing basis of consent to government. Hobbes' view of human nature is such that he allocates absolute power to the sovereign. Limited government, he believed, is unworkable for men are too prone to division and selfishness, and \\"a kingdom divided against itself cannot stand.\\" Influenced by the divisive years preceding the English Civil War, Hobbes grants the sovereign the power of censorship, including the ability to prevent discussion of religion because such discussion leads to conflict. Anybody seeking to preach a new religion should be treated as a criminal.Had Hobbes been writing a century later then religion would almost certainly have played no part in his writings. He himself was not a religious man. His concern with religion stemmed from its role in the conflict leading to the English Civil War, a period during which he lived.Is there an ultimate right of rebellion against the absolute ruler? The answer is to be found in the nature of the social contract. Men give up their natural right to self-preservation to a sovereign in order to to better achieve it. If a situation arises where the sovereign cannot ensure that safety then society is dissolved. Can any action by the sovereign be challenged? Yes, if a man is conscripted into military service (an obvious threat to life) in circumstances where the survival of the state is not threatened. If the survival of the state is threatened then so are the lives of its citizens, and in these circumstances the sovereign can impose conscription. Hobbes adds that even in this case a citizen should have the right to replace himself with a volunteer if one is available.\\"Leviathan\\" is not an easy book, not helped by the fact that the English is that of a man born just 24 years after Shakespeare. However, it is an important work that makes a good study companion to Locke's \\"Second Treatise\\", which argues for limited government."},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"What you first need to know is that the word \\"Authoritative\\" used in this edition refers to the fact that it utilizes several different manuscript versions to capture what Hobbes meant to convey. However, what is not mentioned is that this is an abridged version of the text. Much of parts III & IV are omitted. Which is a bit disappointing.I gave this 5 stars because Hobbes himself deserves 5 stars for his provocative ideas. If you're familiar & comfortable with Shakespeare's language, you won't be put off by the cavalier spelling & grammar rules of Hobbes' era. This is not to say that Hobbes writes in blank verse (haha), but that the language is a bit arcane & takes some acclimatization.Footnotes were, for the most part good - in the body of the text, foreign phrases were translated for those woefully ignorant (like me) of Latin & ancient Greek. However, in the post-ceding criticisms, this very positive practice was discontinued. As in, whole footnotes in Latin & German were not translated. So, get your browsers set to Babelfish, baby.The accompanying criticisms are a mixed bag - some worth reading, some, not so much. They help elucidate some points - which is great for a casual reader like myself. Others just serve to annoy.Eitherway, if you're looking for a definitive edition of the Leviathan, don't look here because you will miss about 1/3 of the actual text which Hobbes wrote down. If you want to skip the parts about theology & much of that which was tied into the Christian Commonwealth, then this is your edition."},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"I finished reading Leviathan a couple months ago, but cringed every time I thought about writing a review. The book is large at over 700 pages and covers so much ground, a review would have to be a book in itself to do it justice. Due to Leviathan's philosophical content and somewhat antiquated language, it's very slow going. Each page needs time to digest.So I'm not going to bother writing a real review. I will just say that Leviathan is a 5-star classic and worth your time, if you can deal with reading political philosophy. Hobbes divides the work into four major sections:Of Man, in which he discusses human nature and why civilized people prefer peace to war. Here Hobbes establishes the primary reason that people form a government to rule over them: to safeguard them from enemies, both external and internal.Of Common-wealth, in which Hobbes first talks about the several forms of government and the pros and cons of each. He then explains the rights that a government has over its people; according to Hobbes, the government can do pretty much anything it wants to. Finally he goes into the things that tend to weaken or dissolve a government.Of a Christian Common-wealth, the longest section, in which Hobbes accepts the Bible as the word of God and quotes from it numerous time to bolster his position in support of a powerful government.Of the Kingdome of Darknesse, the shortest and strangest section, in which Hobbes veers away from the topic of government and instead focuses on religious practices and beliefs of the day that he deems improper and inconsistent with the Bible.It took me months to read this, but I came away with great respect for Hobbes and a better understanding of politics. I can't say that I agree with everything I read, but I think the majority of his arguments are sound and convincing.Five stars, no doubt in my mind. But it's a dive into the deep end, so you'll probably only finish it if you really appreciate and enjoy philosophical discussion!"},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"Hobbes' sole claim to fame these days is the out-of-context quotation from him that life is &quot;nasty, brutish, and short.&quot; The full quotation from chapter 13, section 9 which inveighs against the state of war, in concluding the statement on man's condition in such a state, is &quot;and the life of man, solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.&quot;-Beats me why &quot;solitary&quot; and &quot;poor&quot; are left out of the popular quotation-The point is, this is the condition Hobbes wanted to AVOID, not to justify! He had just lived through the bloodfest known as the English Civil War in which many of his friends were horribly slaughtered because of their religious beliefs. His whole point in writing this book was to advance arguments that one should not go to war over differences in religion. His controversial alternative is absolute obedience to the state and secular authorities. This alternative combined with the quote, noted above, so maddeningly and frequently taken out of context, have given Hobbes and his work the undeserved reputation as, well, curmudgeonly. One might ask what sort of book you might write if you had just witnessed the horrific slaughter and loss of esteemed friends that Hobbes had. You would probably write a book urging peace at any price even if it meant undue subjugation to the state at times. This is exactly what Hobbes did.-Hobbes belongs to that majestic, good-natured and unflappable tradition of brilliant English heretical political and religious writers including, among others, David Hume (well, Scottish too) and Bertrand Russell who seemed merely humored by the ecclesiastics calling down hell-fire upon them and similar dire threats from men in power. Scholars are STILL trying to debunk the work of these prominent men, among others more obscure, with little success it must be said.- Yes, the prose can be rough-going at times. But if you want an argument against war, specifically war over religion. This is the masterpiece to set your nose to. Once you've finished, it's hard not to smile when you think of Hobbes and his essential decency amidst the turbulent times in which he lived."},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"Like most books, Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan is divided into chapters. But it is also divided into four \\"Parts.\\" The Prometheus edition (not to be confused with the Penguin edition) includes only the first two parts, though they sell it as if it were the entire book instead of only the first half. Any other edition would be better than this.If you want a good edition, you could go with the Hackett edition, edited by Edwin Curley, modernized and with the important variants (translated into English, of course) from the Latin edition of the Leviathan published during Hobbes' lifetime. A good edition that is not modernized is the Cambridge edition edited by Richard Tuck. (Having an editor does NOT necessarily mean that the text has been reduced; they often serve to rid the text of previous publishing typographical errors.) Which of these you should get will depend upon two things: Whether you are interested in the variants from the Latin edition, and whether you are comfortable reading something written in the 1600's. For most people, probably the modernized Hackett edition would be best, as many people have difficulty with 17th century English. But if you want Hobbes' exact words, I recommend the Cambridge edition. Whenever buying classic texts, which edition you buy can be extremely important, as the dreadful Prometheus edition demonstrates."},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"Leviathan is one of the first books written after philosophy begun to detach itself from the Catholic inspired medieval thinking, also marking the beginning of the influence philosophy received from the scientific thinking, a point not suficiently y explored by Thomas Hobbes but which one we can get with the benefit of hindsight.Leviathan is an old Fenician word for a mythical crocodile, quoted in some verses of the biblical Book of Job, an taken by Thomas Hobbes as meaning the representation of a powerfull governor totally devoted to do his most to the benefit of the Commonwealth. In Hobbes mind the most efficient form of government was monarchy, but he takes a lot of time to analyse also Democracy and Aristocracy. One has to keep in mind that the time the book was written was one of internal revolt, a civil intestine strife in England, and the objective of Hobbes was to lay the foundations for human actions conducive to an equilibrium within the state, ending war.His book can be also be taken as one where many important aspects of Right and Laws are aprehended, from the perspective of a deeply religious anglican man, that tried his best to separate, in his words, the Kingdoms of men (where civil laws are imperative) from the Kingdom of God (Naturall Right). He does extensive analysis of God's Laws and its importance to the balance in the relationship between men.The edition is a very good one, with a good introduction and is a copy of the text as written in the 17th century, exhibiting an archaic English sometimes difficult to understand. Also, some quotations in Greek and in Latin are not translated, despite all the effort the author makes to turn them inteligible to the reader.The book could be understood as antipodal to Machiavellian's The Prince, because power is not taken here as something good in itself, but only as a means of carrying the security and hapinnes the kingdom subjects deserve."},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"While I enjoyed the text itself very much, I cannot recommend this particular copy of it. I read parts of it for a class, and wanted to read more on my own, but I simply could not make it through 736 small pages of miniscule print without getting frustrated (as well as getting a headache). Further, the margins are practically nonexistent, making it a poor copy to buy for anyone who likes to take notes in the book. Additionally, the binding is quite weak.I would encourage any interested parties to continue pursuing the 'Leviathan,' as it is a very rich text indeed, but I would recommend finding a different copy."},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"To understand Hobbes' LEVIATHAN, the reader must first focus on 'fear.' His contemporaries were terrified of chaos and anarchy and would move heaven and earth to preserve the continuity of the state. Nowhere does he mention the word 'fear' but his real, if underlying purpose becomes clear enough as the reader plows through his dense tract that has as its purported goal to explain the origin of political institutions and to define their powers and proper limits. Hobbes sets up this thesis by first insisting that all of men's ideas originate from sense impressions, which take their cue from the external universe infringing on these sense organs. This emphasis on sense impression led Hobbes next to consider how the external universe manages this neat trick. Motion, according to Hobbes, is the key. Motion naturally leads man, for good or ill, to impact on other men. This impacting may be beneficial, as in man agreeing to help one another respect their respective rights, or it may be harmful, as in man being in a state or war. It was this fear that humanity might start to question the wisdom of the ruling nobility that caused Hobbes to write the longest defense of the royal right of kings ever written. Hobbes cleverly compared man to a wind-up clock: 'That great Leviathan is but an artificial man with an artificial soul.' As the reader follows this geometric logic, he is pressured to accept Hobbes' true premise: that it is better for the common man to put up with the occasional despot than to risk what he terms the horror of 'that condition which is called Warre, and such a warre as is of every man, against every man.'Even if that regime becomes so thuggish that its citizens wish to break it, Hobbes says 'No way.' If these citizens do break this covenant, then Hobbes warns that their lives will be 'solitary, nasty, brutish, and short.' Clearly Hobbes was a man of his times, one who was a paid shill of the crowned heads of Europe. Such a man today we would label as a fearful toady who desperately needs to maintain his own precarious hold on power. So why is LEVIATHAN still read today? Perhaps Hobbes points out the road that humanity might have once chosen to travel. We, like Robert Frost, have thankfully chosen the other less travelled by."},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"Tommy Hobbes was Francis Bacon's favorite secretary, and it shows in the math-like precision with which he attempts to build a model of human political interaction -- one that justifies the need for a strong state to hold human &quot;appetites&quot; in check. Hobbes' argument reads like a geometrical proof, which goes something like:We take it as a given that people, like Galilean celestial bodies, are in perpetual motion, moved by appetites for power. The power of a person is his or her present means to obtain some future good. Every person's power resists and hinders the effects of other people's power. Thus, if all people are created equal in a hypothetical state of nature, then:1. From equality proceeds mutual fear.2. From mutual fear proceeds warfare.3. In such warfare, nothing is unjust.4. But reason suggests a better way to self-preservation (to peace): the right and laws of nature.5. The right of nature is the liberty we have to use our power for self-preservation.6. The 1st law of nature is that we ought to strive for peace, but when we cannot obtain it then it's war.7. The 2nd law of nature is that in the interests of peace we will lay down our natural right to give us as much liberty as we would allow others to have against us (the golden rule).8. This mutual laying down of our natural right is a social contract.9. There must be a coercive power (the commonwealth) to enforce this contract.10. The commonwealth is ruled by a sovereign who embodies the will of the people and is granted certain inalienable rights to enforce the social contract.In short, those who fear authority (anarchists, libertarians, etc.) will revile Hobbes, because of power's potential for abuse, but Hobbes would argue that a true Leviathan could never abuse its subjects because it is actually made up of those same subjects (in other words, a roundabout defense of liberal democracy)."},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"While most readers pay a great deal of attention to Hobbes' political theory in this work, they fail to realize that the early half contains some of the most ground breaking and revolutionizing treatment of philosophy ever written. In a philosophical atmosphere dominated by Cartesian metaphysics and epistemology, Hobbes' emphasis on the way we use language, rather than &quot;clear and distinct ideas&quot; is simply mind blowing. Hobbes, like Descartes, was interested in laying some &quot;extra-scientific&quot; foundation for the new sciences of Newton and Gallileo. Whereas Descartes seems to have found such a foundation in his relation to God, Hobbes saw it in language. In this sense, it anticipated &quot;The Elimination of Metaphysics through the Logical Analysis of Language&quot; by 4 long centuries. Hobbes' fascinating account of what constitutes &quot;truth&quot; and answers to traditional philosophical problems that apply his theories on language are astounding. While Hobbes' political theory is wrought with the very ambiguities he sought to destroy in philosophical and scientific discourse (e.g. what concretely constitutes the &quot;leviathan&quot; and the &quot;soveriegn&quot;), the ties between language and political theory stayed unexamined for a number of decades, if not centuries.

Control of religion is not among the ten rights but Hobbes later argues that the sovereign must seek to restrain discussion of religion because it leads to conflict. Anybody seeking to preach a new religion should be treated as a criminal. Had Hobbes lived a century later religion would have played little or no part in his thinking because he was not himself a religious man, and he was concerned with religion only because because it played a major role in politics in his lifetime.Are there circumstances in which people are justified in breaking the law, and is there an ultimate right of rebellion? The answer is to be found in the nature of the social contract. Men give up their natural rights to self-preservation to a sovereign to better achieve them. If a situation arises where the sovereign cannot ensure that self-preservation then society is dissolved. On civil disobedience Hobbes says that a criminal going to his execution has the \\"right\\" to resist. He is not, however, saying he has a \\"moral\\" right, only that it is proper for him to seek to assert his \\"natural\\" right, adding that the sovereign should indeed execute him. As for whether men have the right to resist conscription, Hobbes seems at first sight ambiguous because he declares that a man's right to protect his own life extends to refusing to die in military service if conscripted. However, further reading shows that the sovereign has the right to require people to risk their life if the existence of that state is threatened. On the other hand men should have the right to put a volunteer in their place (if one is available) and the sovereign does not have the right to demand that I lay down my life if the existence of the state is not threatened.\\"Leviathan\\" is not an easy book, not helped by the fact that the English is that of a man born just 24 years after Shakespeare. However, it is an important work that makes a good study companion to Locke's \\"Second Treatise\\", which argues for limited government.

Without cooperation, there would be no such thing as society (and so no social sciences, philosophy, history, etc.). Hobbes was the first political theorist to tackle this question.While Hobbes is long-winded in parts, and his spelling and grammar not consistent with modern standards, this book is still worth reading. Alfred North Whitehead quipped that the entire history of western political philosophy consists of footnotes to Plato. I respectfully differ, as I believe Plato is now studied purely for historical interest (nobody takes seriously his ideal of a 3 class society led by philosopher kings). Hobbes, however, is the root from which all subsequent western political philosophy has sprung. Locke's Treatises were a direct response to Hobbes, and helped solidify the social contract tradition. Nowadays, nearly all western political theorists either accept social contract theory, or at least have to discuss it in-depth in order to show why they reject it.Hobbes examines the fundamental issue of \\"how do humans manage to get along peacefully?\\" In an age of terrorism, serial killers and vicious divorce battles, it's still a good question. Obviously humans do get along together most of the time, but that doesn't make it obvious why or how we do.You don't have to accept Hobbes's ideas to get a lot out of this book. His stark contrast in describing the alternatives available to humans is unparalleled. While evolutionary theory has gone a long way toward scientifically explaining some types of cooperation, it still hasn't fully explained how strangers in a large society manage to cooperate when, in strictly rational terms, it would be advantageous to screw each other over. So if Hobbes didn't satisfactorily answer the question either, he at least made a very compelling argument."},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"I have serious issues getting past the misspellings and the psychotic notions of Hobbes (or the translator's doing as far as spelling is concern). It is most nonsensical in the 1st part of the book and the religiousity is driving me crazy as I force myself to continue reading ... and to think I have to write an essay on this book. Yipes!"},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"It normally takes me 2 weeks to finish a book considering that life must be lived. For whatever reason, \\"Leviathan\\" took me nearly 2 months. I think I can attribute it mostly to the fact that what I expected to read was not what I did read. I expected \\"Leviathan\\" to be a secular treatise on government. Instead, \\"Leviathan\\" read as a Christian indicting the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church. Not that I have an issue with that, but I order my reading list in a special way and my mood was set on government not religion at the time.I have no authority or scholarship in regards to philosophy. I am simply an enthusiast. I had general knowledge of Thomas Hobbes prior to reading this book. Many scholars claim that Hobbes was a secular absolutist, materialist, agnostic, or perhaps an atheist. If they were reading \\"Leviathan\\" to gather this information, I do believe there would be a significant amount of proof to say otherwise.Leviathan is Hobbes' \\"Utopia.\\" It is indeed absolutist, but it is voluntary absolutism, and in no way secular. He refers to it as his Christian-Commonwealth numerous times. His knowledge and application of scripture is impeccable. I take no offense to Hobbes' vision, being an Anarcho-Capitalist-Voluntaryist-Minarchist-leaning Libertarian, because Hobbes' vision is voluntary for the most part. He is by no means a one-worlder. He believes that there should be multiple common-wealths and that they should form according to each common-wealths' desires. Enter his disdain for the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church. He makes some incredible and withstanding accusations against the Church and its desire for world domination.Leviathan is a Christian-Commonwealth in which the people contract their governing to a King. A King who is chosen by them voluntarily. He makes some compelling arguments as to why there should be a monarch as opposed to a legislature. He believes a monarch would care for the people like his own and the legislature would simply sell the people out for self-aggrandizement. History has shown that tyranny is capable by any means of government though, especially by monarchy. He seems a bit dichotomous in his beliefs. On one hand, he believes that man can not be left too much liberty because man is always trying to supplant his neighbor for his own gain. On the other hand, his Christian-Commonwealth would essentially require that every man be a Christian and even the monarch be a Christian. Yet, if everyone lived by Christian ideals, namely the Golden Rule, then there would be no need for government or monarchs at all, hence full liberty which he finds to be dangerous.I was disappointed that two major issues of Leviathan were not discussed. First, sure the initial generation may voluntarily contract their rights to a monarch, but what about their children? Their children would now live under the authority of an individual with whom they never consented. Secondly, what about non-Christians? The monarch is a Christian. He would be the leader over both the State and the Church. In fact, according to Hobbes the State is the Church. What would be expected of or provided to non-Christians in a Christian State?I've definitely read worst than Hobbes. I've definitely read better than Hobbes. I give him proper respect for his writing style. It was incredibly unique and entertaining. As an ex-Catholic, I thoroughly enjoyed his connecting the Roman Catholic Church to the Heathen cults of the former empire. (My apologies to any Catholics reading this, I'm not trying to be incendiary, but honest). I did feel there was much lacking in respect to Leviathan, my whole purpose for reading. If you're looking for arguments against the Catholic Church (which could be used even today) then this would be a great read. If you're looking for a philosopher's vision of utopia and the machinations of government, this will probably bore you to tears."},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"this book came quickly to my place and the book was great quality as well"},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"First a word about the edition that I read. It was the Oxford World's Classics paperback. It claims to have modernized the spelling. I don't know about you, but as far as I am concerned doth, hath, belongeth is not modern. It wouldn't have been very hard for them to change it to does, has and belongs. Many people complain about the way it was written, making it hard to read. I found that if you read the difficult parts aloud, as if you were giving a lecture, they are easier to understand the first time through. Definitely not for speed-readers.Hobbes was a remarkable man. He published Leviathan when he was in his early 60's. For someone of his age he was very much in tune with the science of his day. One can only speculate that if he were to have been born 400 years later, with modern science at hand, he would have been considered the greatest philosopher of all time.The first part of his book, \\"Of Man\\" goes about providing definitions of what must be virtually all of humankinds various behaviours and emotions. He also goes on to define what is basic human nature. It is here, without the benefit of modern science, where his philosophy, indeed the cornerstone of his philosophy, gets off on the wrong foot. Thanks to modern archaeology we know that humans are not solitary creatures by nature, but social animals.In the second part of his book \\"Of Commonwealth\\" he spells out why we form commonwealths, and how a commonwealth should run. Again he is very thorough in looking at all aspects of a government and what it needs to do. He defines the power of the sovereign, the making of laws, the consequences of breaking these laws, and where the sovereign gets authority to carry out the consequences. I felt that he gave the sovereign far too much power, and he is there, it would seem, for life. The people only make covenants between themselves that this person or peoples are to be sovereign. Once a sovereign is declared, there is no covenant, or constitution, between the people and the sovereign; the sovereign is given Carte Blanche powers. One must remember that this book was written while Hobbes was in \\"exile\\" in Paris during the English civil war and the subsequent government of Cromwell. And while he is careful to call the sovereign \\"a person or assembly of people\\" it is quite obvious that he prefers the singular.The third part of the book \\"Of a Christian Commonwealth\\" was for a large part just skimmed over by me. Some people suggest that Hobbes, because of some of the things he says in the first half of the book, was really an atheist. They say that he wrote this to fool the church to thinking otherwise of him. After skimming through this part I feel that Hobbes was more likely a reformer, someone who definitely believed in God but didn't agree with the way the church and the Pope were behaving back then. I myself am an atheist and cannot imagine writing so copiously on a subject that I do not believe in, never mind doing all of the Biblical research that Hobbes must have.The fourth part, and the conclusion really don't have much to say. He is busy blasting the Pope, the Catholic Church and Aristotle.All in all some good philosophical points. His definitions of free will and spirit I think should be more widely taught. The fact that this edition could have been modernized a bit more, as well as the last half of the book being pretty useless today, leads me to give it three stars."},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"OK, first off, skip the ENTIRE BEGINNING SECTION of this book - it is perfectly pointless today. In it, Hobbes is basically trying to do away with the concept of an immortal soul, thereby creating an atheistic society that cares nothing for religious matters. Hobbes is NOT known for his Philosophy of Mind.What everyone remembers about Leviathan is Hobbes' terse, cynical, and on-the-money observation that life is \\"nasty, brutish, and short.\\" Of course, what he means by this is life in the State of Nature. In order to try to make life a little better, man comes together to form societies.So far, so good. What most people take exception to is the kind of Social Contract that Hobbes endorses. Hobbes says that a society should come together to form a Social Contract in which everyone is OBEY THE SOVEREIGN UNCONDITIONALLY NO MATTER WHAT. Here's the kicker, the sovereign or king himself exists OUTSIDE OF THE SOCIAL CONTRACT AND IS NOT BOUND BY IT. In other words, the sovereign can do whatever he likes and the people must obey his commands no matter how cruel or ridiculous.Now, Hobbes was really trying to be more reasonable than he sounds. He lived at a time when England had spent years torn apart by constant war. He was also a self-professed coward: \\"Fear and I were born twins.\\" Basically, what he wanted was an end to war at all costs. For him, that meant obeying a STRONG RULER - in his case, Oliver Cromwell. The second section is addressed to the people trying to make them understand why this is in their best interests.The last section is addressed to the sovereign himself. Yes, he says, you can be a tyrant and do anything you want, BUT that will only cause you more trouble than it's worth. I have some advice for you to follow. Hobbes then goes on to RECOMMEND ways in which the sovereign could be a good ruler.In the end, Hobbes thought he was being an eminently practical man. To him, the \\"natural rights theorists\\" would just be talking nonsense."},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"This book of Thomas Hobbes is surely a groundbreaking innovation in philosophy, especially political philosophy. It presents a comprehensive worldview based on mechanistic principles, and constructs a coherent theory on governance. Though I do not agree with his conclusion, the premises and arguments he uses is very useful and can give us tools and guidance for our own philosophical and political discourse. Only thing that prevents me from giving the book a higher rating is that Hobbes' language is extremely dry and boring, something characteristic of British philosophy. I found the same problem in reading John Locke and John Stuart Mill (who were both liberals and opposed to the ideas of Hobbes), the two philosophers of similar era to whom I have much admiration. It is hard to imagine that in a country that produced Shakespeare and Dickens must use such dreary language in philosophizing.

However, even Machiavelli was able to use more reader-friendly language."},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"good read for anyone who likes the odd stuff in the world i like weird things and this is good read about this things i read a book that had this in it and decieced to but one myself to read more i like it"},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"It was very fast and FREE, the book was send automatically to my kindle!

If you like thick political philosophy, you may enjoy this though. Unlike most political works, you should not feel compelled to agree with everything Hobbes states, as it is quite a difficult sell. But he is very enjoyable, unless of coarse you are an eternal optimist or true-blue believer in democracy.Although vilified by most for his extreme view of an all powerful head of state governing over the cruel and devilish populace, Hobbes creates a senerio that I think most would agree with in some way or form. People, left to their own devices, will inherently murder and steal from each other to the point that civilized life becomes unbearable. It's quite a world picture that Hobbes presents, and quite fascinating as well. The idea I believe Hobbes asks each person to explore is fundamental--what is the true nature of the individual? His answer in short is chilling--the individual is not to be trusted! While we can ask that education and high moral fiber dictate the peoples actions, do we really want to rely on the goodness of our neighbors, or do we want to keep a steady eye on them while holding fast to our sword?While I find it hard to believe any person would call themselves a die-hard Hobbesian, I think most people will find themselves answering in agreement to much that he has to say. After all, even many of the founding fathers feared the impulses of the masses and sought refuge in a powerful central government to keep the monsters at bay. Here's a tip: keep short notes while you read. Don't get caught up in all the details, and you'll enjoy this book."},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"Three essential hallmarks of the Hobbesian system are important: the war of each against all, the role of human rationality in ending this; the use of knowledge/science as a basis for societal engineering. His view of the state of nature--that time before government and the state existed--is unsurprising when one understands that he was born in the year of the erstwhile invasion by the Spanish Armada (1588) and lived through civil turmoil and revolution in England throughout his life.Hobbes begins with a view of human life that would be inconceivable to the Greeks--life in a state of nature, the time before government, laws, and the state existed. In this state, humans are equal. In terms of physical prowess, of course, some are stronger than others. However, the weakest, through guile, can still kill the strongest. In that sense, there is equality. Without the power of government to keep people in check, though, we find quarrels routinely breaking out. The motives are threefold: self-gain, safety, and reputation (or glory). The result is horrible, and here follows perhaps the single most well known statement penned by Hobbes: \\"Hereby it is manifest, that during the time men live without a common Power to keep them all in awe, they are in a condition which is called Warre; and such a warre, as is of every man, against every man. . . .In such condition, there is no place for Industry; because the fruit thereof is uncertain; and consequently no Culture of the Earth; no navigation, nor use of the commodities that may be imported by Sea; no commodious Building; no Instruments of moving, and removing such things as require much force; no Knowledge of the face of the Earth; no account of Time; no Arts; no Letters; no Society; and which is worst of all, continual feare, and danger of violent death; And the life of man, solitary, poore, nasty, brutish, and short.\\"However, the fear and terror of the state of nature can be escaped. Humans are, after all, according to Hobbes, capable of reason. Individual reason leads people to realize that they must do something to escape \\". . .Feare of Death; Desire of such things as are necessary to commodious living; and a Hope by their Industry to obtain them.\\" Furthermore, human reason allows individuals to understand laws of nature. This is defined by Hobbes as \\". . .a Precept, or general Rule, found out by Reason, by which a man is forbidden to do, that, which is destructive of his life, or taketh away the means of preserving the same.\\" To preserve life, and the fruits of industry that might be gained by peace, human reason lets people realize that only by giving up some of their freedoms, liberties, rights in order to establish a system that will end perpetual war of each against all. The mechanism for this is the \\"social contract,\\" by which people in the state of nature covenant with one another to form a powerful government, so powerful that it can suppress individuals' efforts to seek self-advantage as under the state of nature. A \\"Leviathan\\" is needed.However, if the state ceases to protect people's lives, the contract can be voided; revolution is an acceptable option for the citizenry then. However, the price is terrible, for with the dissolution of the state, people are plunged back into the nightmare of the state of nature. They would have to re-enact a contract to escape the ravages of the perpetual war.Key points in Hobbes: the focus is on the individual rather than society, hence this is an individualistic system; human reason is considered to be central to attaining peace and harmony; humans can perceive the essence of natural laws through the powers of their reason; by contracting with one another, the people can control their destinies and produce an environment which they find more commodious for living fruitfully. An important early work in the development of Modern thinking and liberal political thought. A must read work for those interested in Western political philosophy."},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"Thomas Hobbes (1588 - 1679) was born in England, a country that endured great political turmoil during his life. Having lived through that, Hobbes' main aim was to inquire into the basis of order. The question he asked himself was \\"What kind of political authority will prevent the return of chaos?\\". And the answer to that question is in this book, \\"Leviathan\\" (1651).The Levianthan is the personification of total power, an authority without limits, created by men who realise that absolute power given to a powerfull ruler (or to an assembly) is their only way out of the dangers of the state of nature. The name that the author chose for his monarch is quite telling: the Leviathan is a sea monster that appears in the Bible and symbolizes power. This kind of monarch seems like an extreme solution for the problem of anarchy, but it is the only one that Hobbes found. Without the Leviathan, life is 'solitary, nasty, brutish, and short.'Of course, this book includes many more things than those I have already mentioned. For instance, it explains quite well Hobbes opinion regarding human nature (man is naturally a wolf to men), the state of nature (perpetual war of all against all), the origin of political institutions and the relationship between reason and force (pacts without swords are merely words), among other things.On the whole, I think this book is a classic of Political Philosophy, and I recommend it as such. Despite that, I think a word of caution is in order, so you will be prepared for what you will find when you tackle \\"Leviathan\\". Truth to be told, sometimes Hobbes' prose is too dry, and in some chapters you will need to plod through some rather arid pages. Moreover, this book isn't written in modern English, what makes it more difficult to understand. Those are the reasons why I give this book four stars instead of five...Notwithstanding that, I believe that \\"Leviathan\\" is well-worth the effort of reading it, simply because it has some interesting concepts that you should be aware of, even if you don't agree with them. The only way to discuss in a level play field with someone who has totally different ideas is to understand his arguments thoroughly, even if his position seems completely strange to you. I invite you to do that with Hobbes, reading \\"Leviathan\\".Belen Alcat"},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"Hobbes' Leviathan is a great work of literature and political philosophy, but unless you need it in its original, seventeenth century dialect, the edition published by Great Books in Philosophy series by Prometheus Books is not recommended.

In fact, the only way to know that is to read the footnote in the Table of Contents, or the preface.It happens that, in my view, the Leviathan can use the abridging, and it is very possibly that you think so too. But readers should be told that before they buy. So I am telling you.I'm a bit disappointed with the secondary materials, too, but not quite disappointed enough to grouse about it too much. Still, it seems like the editors could have made up for all those lost pages in the main text to get more ambitious in the secondary materials.I still give it four stars because I like the abridged version."},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"For those who dislike the archaic spelling in Hobbes, this edition with modernized text and spelling is the one for them. The opening sentence suffices to show the difference. The following is the original text:\\"Concerning the Thoughts of man, I will consider them first Singly, and afterwards in Trayne, or dependence upon one another.\\" (With Singly and Trayne in italics)The modernized text in this edition is:\\"Concerning the thoughts of man, I will consider them first singly, and afterwards in train, or dependence upon one another.\\" (No italics)There is a decent introduction by Gaskin, a bibliography, an index and explanatory notes, and this edition is very competitively priced.As a student at Oxford I chose an optional paper \\"Political theory from Hobbes\\". It was \\"from Hobbes\\" because modern political philosophy begins with him. Before Hobbes, writers for centuries had accepted the divine right of kings or did not consider the origins of government. In Hobbes we find concepts that became standard in political thought: human nature, state of nature, social contract, absolute and limited government, civil disobedience, censorship, etc.Hobbes supposes that organized society is a choice. The alternative is the \\"state of nature\\" with both a \\"right of nature\\" and \\"laws of nature\\", but Hobbes uses the terms in an idiosyncratic way. The \\"right of nature\\" is \\"the liberty each man has, to use his own power...for the preservation of his own life\\" and doing anything that is necessary to achieve this. In addition there are a number of \\"laws of nature\\". The first dictates that each person should seek to live with others in peace, and the second is that each person should only retain the right to as much liberty as he is willing to permit others. These (and other laws that follow from them) are found by reason and are utilitarian rather than prudential. Morality does not enter into it. Hobbes is simply saying that if men think about their situation, reason tells them that giving up their natural rights in exchange for others doing the same is the best means of self-preservation, even though this is contrary to human nature.On human nature Hobbes is cynical. Men have the power of reason that suggests possible advantages of co-operation but this is outweighed by instinct. Men are competitive and selfish. They are also roughly equal in ability, so no one person or group can impose his will on others. Life in the state of nature is \\"solitary, poor, nasty, brutish and short.\\" Hence men are driven to create government via a pact in which all give up their natural rights to a sovereign authority, which may be either an individual or an oligarchy (Hobbes prefers the former). Hobbes uses the concept of a \\"social contract\\". It is not an historical event but a logical device to describe the ongoing basis of consent to government. Very importantly, Hobbes assigns absolute power to the sovereign. Limited government is unworkable, for men are too quarrelsome and selfish and \\"a kingdom divided against itself cannot stand.\\" Hobbes was influenced by the divisive years preceding the English Civil War in which he lived. Among the ten rights Hobbes awards the sovereign the sixth is the power of censorship of opinions he deems harmful to the state. Control of religion is not among the ten rights but Hobbes later argues that the sovereign must seek to restrain discussion of religion because it is a source of conflict. As for anybody seeking to preach a new religion, he should be treated as a criminal. Hobbes was not a religious man but he could not avoid discussing the role of religion in the age in which he lived.Are there circumstances in which people are justified in breaking the law, and is there an ultimate right of rebellion? The answer is to be found in the nature of the social contract. Men consent to an absolute ruler in order to better secure self-preservation. If a situation arises where the sovereign fails to achieve that then society is dissolved. On civil disobedience Hobbes observes that a criminal going to his execution retains his natural right to resist, but he is not saying it is a \\"moral\\" right, and in fact the sovereign is right to execute him. On conscription, Hobbes seems at first sight ambiguous because he declares that a man's natural right to protect his own life extends to refusing to die in military service if conscripted. However, further reading shows that the sovereign has the right to require people to risk their life if the existence of the state is threatened. On the other hand men should have the right to put a volunteer in their place (if one is available) and the sovereign does not have the right to demand the sacrifice of my life if the existence of the state is not threatened.\\"Leviathan\\" is not an easy book, not helped by the fact that the English is that of a man born just 24 years after Shakespeare. However, it is an important work that makes a good study companion to Locke's \\"Second Treatise\\", which argues for limited government. Those who prefer the original to this modernized text have many choices, including the Macpherson edition."},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"Hobbes's Leviathan is of course a major and essential work of modern Western political philosophy. But it comes in many different editions, which have different strengths and weaknesses (and which omit or include the full text and other relevant works).It is not at all helpful that Amazon lumps the reviews of these different editions together. From this amalgam, you cannot determine which is the best edition for you. I agree with Greg Taylor that the best unabridged paperback editions are published by Cambridge U Press and Hackett. For me, Norton Critical editions contains a good abridged text with excellent supplementary readings. For rich scholars, Oxford U Press has just published the definitive critical edition, edited by Noel Malcolm. There are many other editions -- examine them carefully. (Among other things, some modernize spelling, others don't.)"},{"Title":"Hobbes's Leviathan","review":"Hobbes' thesis that the natural state of man is chaos and war is the primary justification he provides for an all encompassing authority to be placed unalterably in the hands of the Sovereign, or Leviathan. What he neglects to address is the absolutely corrupting influence such power has on the all too human Kings, Queens, and legislative bodies which hold such power over their fellow creatures.There is a saying that if men were were angels we would not need government, or if that angels administered man's government then we would not need to worry as to constraining them. But neither of these delusions can be ever be achieved by fallible man, no matter how much certain individuals may otherwise hope. You cannot legislate morality and you cannot make men charitable by forcing them to give. And much to the annoyance of Plato, no amount of education or cultural refinement can immunize man to the ever present threats of avarice, arrogance, and blind ambition. There must be checks on this power if men are to retain their hard-fought liberty and if the ultimate power of the government is to maintain its rightful abode with the People.As we in America have learned, there is a concept of government much more attuned to the particulars of human nature than the false bravado of Leviathan. It is limited government, where every individual choose for himself what he thinks is best, to the degree that he does not infringe on the natural rights of his fellows. Freedom of oppression from the government is our nation's calling card, and it has empowered and enriched man to a degree never before imagined. It seems that man's natural state, when guaranteed certain inalienable rights, was far flung indeed from an interminable warfare on his neighbors.So, Hobbes had a lot to learn but perhaps not the opportunity to do so. However, I did enjoy and learn much from him in his thorough and unbiased defense of his monarchical position using the Scriptures. He has an immense mastery of them, and cuts through some of the more confusing points of contention between the Anglican and Roman Catholic churches. He even goes so far as to address the varying degrees of heaven, the existence (or not) of an everlasting Hell, and Baptism for the Dead. It provided me with an excellent base from which to further understand the faith of the early American colonists and the churches they established in the lead-up to the American Revolution.Still, this is one of the more difficult books on this subject I've yet to slog through and so be warned that you may want to start with some lighter tomes on this subject."},{"Title":"Creation revealed in six days: The evidence of Scripture confirmed by archaeology","review":"This book contains a little-known proposal on how to reconcile the narrative of Genesis 1 with geological evidence that suggests that the earth is millions of years old. There have been several different attempts at reconciliation, such as the Young Earth theory, the Day-Age and the Gap Theory.Gerald Schroederhas the ingenious theory that creation occurred in six days within the relativistic framework of the things being created, which equates to billions of years for an earth observer. Wiseman's theory is different to all of these - he argues that God revealed the story of creation to man in six literal days.Wiseman's thesis argument rests on the hypothesis that the \\"generations\\" statements in Genesis refer to what come before rather than (as traditionally interpreted) headings for what come after. This is sometimes called the Wiseman hypothesis. Thus, Genesis 2:4 (\\"These are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created,in the day that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens\\") refers to the whole narrative from 1:1 to 2:3. Furthermore, Wiseman argues that generations means \\"written account\\" or \\"histories\\" and concludes that God's revelation of creation to man took six (literal) days.This is an attractive theory precisely because it allows for a literal interpretation of the word \\"day\\", while at the same time accepting geological and other scientific evidence for an old earth. It is ultimately unconvincing in its argument about the word \\"generations\\" - how, for example, could Genesis 36:1 be referring to Genesis 35? Yet it does remind us that there are avenues of interpretation that we have hitherto overlooked, and ways of reconciling apparent contradictions that are still undiscovered.The book is quite pleasant to read, although his arguments are not always clear. He does pay careful attention to the text, and that gives value to the book regardless of whether or not one agrees with his argument.Wiseman was an Air Commodore in the Royal Air Force who became interested in biblical archaeology through his service in the Middle East."},{"Title":"Method for zither (G.

The \\"Toddler's Perspective\\" sections give a typical scenario seen through the eyes of a toddler with their limited language and logic. This was, for me, the most helpful and unique part of the book and it really did help me have more patience with my son.

My biggest complaint about this book is the extensive, seemingly random use of italics. Sometimes half a sentence, sometimes a full sentence, sometimes an entire paragraph will be italicized and it really interferes with the flow of the narrative. (Kind of like reading a book that has already been highlighted). But I would recommend this book for anyone interested in adopting from Vietnam and/or adopting a child with cleft lip/palate."},{"Title":"Bringing Our Angel Home","review":"This was a wonderful book.

The ending was powerfully bittersweet and interwoven elements of three genres (fantasy, science fiction and visionary) makes for a thought provoking book. Highly recommended. This book is literally my favorite young adult novel."},{"Title":"Enchantress From The Stars","review":"This book is a seamless mixture of science fiction and fantasy, beautifully crafted, with a story suitable for young readers but containing cultural themes that will intrigue readers of all ages.The story is told from three viewpoints representing three cultures at different stages of technological development. Elana, our main protagonist, is a half-trained anthropologist from a very advanced star-faring civilization. Georyn is a poor woodcutter's son from a primitive society, who quite naturally views Elana as an \\"enchantress\\" in possession of \\"magic\\". Our third viewpoint character is Jarel, a doctor serving with an aggressive and colonialist stellar empire that is much less advanced than Elana's people but plenty strong enough to oppress Georyn's.You will be astonished how smoothly the author mixes all the pieces together. From Georyn's perspective he is a traditional fantasy hero, a normal boy who accepts the guidance of a mysterious wizard so he can learn to fight the dragons and demons which threaten his land. His viewpoint is told in a suitably fairy-tale tone. Elana and Jarel are living the exact same events, of course, but each sees a completely different side to the story.There is a real depth here. The conflicts and differences between the three cultures are a constant backdrop, but in the end none of the three cultures are wholly good or wholly evil. Courage and excellence can arise in any culture, and the author was intentionally silent about which of these cultures represents us.Strongly recommended!"},{"Title":"Enchantress From The Stars","review":"Enchantress from the Stars proves one of the very best books of the genre. Combining mythic fantasy-like events with science fiction, Sylvia Engdahl weaves an incredible story that involves the reader on every level. The characters are fascinating, multifaceted, and engaging, and the events seize the reader and whirl them along on a desperate \\"What happens next??\\" ride.Best of all is the subtle theme the story provides, giving the reader a sense of hope and betterment of human civilization. This book expands the mind in ways previously never considered, and is a great read for anyone who picks it up."},{"Title":"Enchantress From The Stars","review":"This is a really amazing book, which, though it started out kind of slow, quickly picked up and was quite interesting. I'd say that Enchantress from the Stars is three parts science fiction, one part fantasy. It centers around three people on the planet Andrecia. One is Elana, a member of a very advanced interstellar civilization. She is on a mission to the \\"primitive\\" Andrecia to save it from a \\"Youngling\\" attack. Then there's Apprentice Medical Officer Jarel, a Youngling, who starts to have doubts about whether what his people are doing is right. And Georyn, the son of an Andrecian woodcutter. He only knows that there is a dragon on the other side of the Enchanted Forest, and he must defeat it. He believes that Elana is an enchantress from the stars who has come test him. That is sort of the fantasy element.The style of the book is really interesting. Jarel and Elana's sections are obviously science fiction, and are told in a science fiction style. But Georyn believes in magic, and his chapters are told in a style similar to an old fantasy tale.*You can read all of my reviews at my book blog, novareviews.blogspot.com*"},{"Title":"Enchantress From The Stars","review":"As a child I read Sylvia Engdahl's \\"Heritage of the Star\\" (published as \\"The Star Shall Abide\\" in the USA). This was one of my most memorable reads ever, and earlier this year I was glad to find her sequels to the books and to read them through. I also discovered this nook which received some awards and was republished in 2001.Having read the other books earlier this year, it was quite clear that this story exists in the same world as the others. It is in no way a sequel to \\"Heritage of the Star\\", but the galactic anthropological service is a key theme in the last book of that trilogy. The themes and ideas are all very similar.The idea of a clash of civilisations at different stages of development is an intelligent and interesting one, and this book explores those themes well. The author explicitly states that the book is not allegorical for our times, but readers will see similarities with the story of \\"avatar\\" and thus with the clash of civilisations when Europeans came to the Americas (particularly the USA).There are a few problems with this book though in my opinion. One is that having so recently read the other trilogy by this author, I was surprised and perhaps a little disappointed that it did not have more originality in setting. Add to this the galactic federation, and the multiple humanoid looking races, and this is a story that appears to be a product of the Star Trek age in which it was conceived. But that does not really detract from the ideas conveyed or the quality of the story."},{"Title":"Enchantress From The Stars","review":"Although originally published in 1970, Enchantress from the Stars has a surprisingly modern feel to it. Aside for the book cover, it would fit right in with today's books. Enchantress from the Stars is a unique mix of science fiction meets fantasy. Engdahl seamlessly combines a technologically advanced alien race with a world set in a medieval era while creating a story that is timeless and appealing to all ages.A destructive alien race called the Imperials have settled on the planet of Andrecia to exploit it's resources and displace it's less advanced people. This isn't the first time this race has invaded other planets and their actions have attracted the attention of another alien race even more advanced than they are. To stop the Imperials, a team of agents from this advanced race is sent to Andrecia to reverse the Imperials' invasion without harm to all sides. Only the team cannot stop the Imperials themselves, they have to work with the natives to stop save Andrecia. The book alternates perspectives giving you an understanding of all sides; Andrecian, Imperial, and the team of Agents.The main character and primary narrator is Elana, a current student at the Academy learning about Youngling planets. She naively stows away on a spaceship to be apart of her father's mission to save the planet of Andrecia. Her lack of training is a problem and against the rules but the team has to make the mission work with Elana. Along with her father and her boyfriend, Evrick, the team works together to find a native or natives suited for the job of stopping the Imperials.Georwyn, Terwyn, and their brothers are young native men walking through the enchanted forest on a mission to slay the dragon (which is actually an Imperial machine that mines the planet's resources). They seek the reward that the King offers in return for slaying the dragon. While hunting the dragon, they encounter an old man with magical abilities and an enchantress who offers advice in slaying the dragon. Of all the brothers, Georwyn proves himself to be wise beyond his years and well suited for the challenge of slaying the dragon.Jeral is a medic for the Imperials and after his coworkers kill and imprison natives, he starts to second guess his mission. He's been told that the natives of Andrecia are not really human and therefore their actions to take over the planet are justified. As the mission goes on, he sees more in more that the people of this planet are human and he no longer wants anything to do with the mission.Enchantress from the Stars is a well written, original, and heartwarming story. In addition, the audiobook narrator told this story beautifully. It's even a won a few awards. With that said, I have to say that I didn't love it but also I didn't hate it. It isn't a book that pulls you in and never lets you go but more so an enjoyable read that you can easily put down and pick up again later. Overall, I really to do recommend others give Enchantress from the Stars a try.Engdahl went on to write a second book featuring Elana called The Far Side of Evil, which takes places on a completely different planet and has a completely different feel."},{"Title":"Enchantress From The Stars","review":"I almost was almost deterred from reading this book after reading one of the reviews claiming Elana to be immoral and needing sense whacked into her. But since I already had the audiobook on my Ipod I decided to listen to it anyways. Though out the book I kept guarding myself from the moment when Elana would betray her fianc&eacute;. To me that never happened. The \\"ridiculousness\\" another reader is frustrated by is Elana's willingness to share honestly (in her narrative to her cousin) her thoughts, insecurities, and frustrations -- while the other characters' emotional weaknesses are more hidden from our view. All humans have emotional weaknesses, and the author showed us Alana's so we could see her as human -- rather than as the \\"supernatural enchantress\\" the native Andrecians believed her to be. She does not have condescending pity for her fianc&eacute;. The story and her father give her very little contact with her fianc&eacute;. She does come to develop a deep friendship/love for a native Adrecian man that she is required to spend a lot of time alone with teaching. But they never touch until a chaste farewell embrace when she departs. From the story it seems that Elana's engagement to Everek was arranged when she was younger. Elana continues to love her fianc&eacute; throughout the story and never once lets herself or the Adrecian Georyn think they would be physically intimate, have continued correspondence, or contact of any kind following the completion of the mission. Essentially, her father permits, and in ways fosters, Elana and Georyn's friendship because love is a much more powerful emotional stimulus than fear.What I most enjoyed about the book is how it makes you wonder where we Earthlings are in our cultural development and what our potential as a society and as individuals may be. It was fun to think about the fairytales we grow up with and imagining about how they could have been based on interstellar contact. But most of all it was fascinating to ponder the religious symbols that my personal faith clings to and wonder how very little I must know compared to greater intelligences I believe do oversee us and who have and still are working to help us become like them."},{"Title":"Enchantress From The Stars","review":"This book is a surprising gem.The one line review that I've been passing on to friends is \\"This is what Ursula K.

I am definitely not a sci-fi freak, but this book is so much more than that. The lessons it teaches are invaluable, and the story is so wonderfully told, it made me rush to find the sequel!"},{"Title":"Enchantress From The Stars","review":"Having read Sylvia Engdahl's excellent novel, The Far Side of Evil, several years ago, I approached this book with a positive outlook that it would be just as thought-provoking and well told. I wasn't disappointed, though this novel is indeed different in tone.The Enchantress of the title is Elana, whose exact age is never given but can be assumed to be in her late teens or early twenties. Elana, looking for adventure and real life experience, stows away on board a starship that is sent to Andrecia, a medieval planet that is currently being colonized by a more advanced society. Once her presence is known, her father and boyfriend decide that Elana can indeed help with the plan to oust the invaders, which will allow Andrecia to continue to develop at its own pace. Elana becomes the \\"Enchantress\\"; she befriends two locals who are off to fight the \\"Dragon\\" (a massive rock-chewing machine), and helps them by awakening their own skills so that their quest will be successful. In the process, Elana finds herself falling for the local known as Georgyn, and in her inexperience, putting them both in grave danger.This book moves seamlessly between points of view, which gives it a much more universal feel than had we only known Elana's side of the story. When Georyn's voice takes over, the story almost becomes a fairy tale; indeed, that is how he sees Elana and the invaders who have come to his world. Elana is, of course, young and inexperienced but desperate to do the right thing; and Jarel is the lone voice of the invaders, unsure of his world's plans but unable to do anything to stop them.I enjoyed this novel but did feel that at times it was a bit on the fantastic side. I felt the plans Elana's father made to dupe the invaders weren't necessarily believable, but I was able to keep in mind that this is indeed a fantasy. Elana could be infuriating in her lack of knowledge and her headstrong ways, and her poor boyfriend Evrek is relegated to the background while Elana forges ahead with a relationship with Georyn. Overall, however, this is a well-written novel and Engdahl has a gift for telling a tale that will pull you in from the first pages. Over thirty years since its debut, this thought-provoking novel holds up well and is just as relevant today. Recommended for lovers of fantasy."},{"Title":"Enchantress From The Stars","review":"When Elana's mission gets put in jeopardy she faces a lifetime of torture and imprisonment. Will she be able to save herself and the mission? Elana, the Enchantress, and her father were agents of the Federations Anthropological Center and it was their assignment to stop the Imperials from taking over the planet Andrecia. They led Georyn, a woodcutter's son, to believe that a stone was the source of his new magical powers; however, the truth was that they had taught him telekinesis and he wasn't even aware of it. Georyn was supposed to use his \\"magic\\" to defeat the dragon (a mechanical weapon used the Imperials). Elana and Georyn were on their way to the Imperials camp when natives captured them. The natives took them to the Imperials camp where they were locked in barracks. The Imperials planned to send them to a research center to be studied. Elana persuaded one of the guards, Jarel, to help them and he let Georyn out of his cell when no one was paying attention. When it appeared that the dragon was going to defeat Georyn, Elana decided to sacrifice herself to try to end the whole ordeal. As she ran and laid in front of the dragon, a flood of courage surged through Georyn. He used his magic powers to save her, stop the dragon, and scare away the Imperials. Georyn went to the king to announce that the dragon had been killed and to get his reward. He decided to explore the rest of the planet he lived on while he had the chance. Elana left Andrecia after accomplishing her goal and traveled back to her own planet. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone and everyone who enjoys reading a great book.This book is written with loads of details. Georyn was the youngest of four sons born to a poor woodcutter, who lived on the planet Andrecia. Elana was a young woman in the First Phase of her training to be an agent. Jarel was an Imperial medic who was determined to prove that his civilization was not right in trying to colonize Andrecia.Even though this is a science fiction book some of the things in it are realistic to our own world. The cool, green, peaceful planet, Andrecia is the third planet of a medium sized yellow sun. The Federation tried to prevent weaker nations from being taken over by stronger nations. Some types of people tend to be better at some things than others.This book will stretch the reader's imagination. The Imperials used a huge machine that resembled a dragon to clear an area on Andrecia for the colony they were planning to establish. Georyn was taught telekinesis on a subconscious level, therefore he didn't even know about it. The Federation was an organization meant to save weak planets from the more powerful ones trying to colonize.I recommend this book to everyone. It is a great read. It is very imaginative but some of the elements of the book seem somewhat realistic. Even if you are not a big fan of science fiction books this is a story that everyone should read.~V.

When I was a young teenager I discovered an old copy of &quot;Enchantress From the Stars&quot; on a bookshelf in our house and devoured it within a few hours. I have since read it several times and just finished it again last week. I find it one of the finest, most well crafted, intriguing books I have read, and it occupies a place of honor on the shelves that house &quot;my favorite books.&quot; I love Science Fiction as well as Fantasy, and this book combines both of them in a fascinating, compelling way that makes the reader not want to put it down till it is done, and come back to it again later like an old friend. Ms. Engdahl intertwined the three viewpoints/cultures of Elana, Georyn, and Jarel in a highly talented, fascinating way that I have never come across in any other book. The plot is very original, exciting, and thought-provoking.Now that I am married and have a baby of my own, I am very excited to share this book with my own children and husband. I wish I knew why it isn't more widely circulated/well-known, and I think it should still be in print. Hats off to Ms. Engdahl. I hope she has great success with her work and I think it would be wonderful to see another book about Elana (the only other one I know about is &quot;The Far Side of Evil&quot;)."},{"Title":"Enchantress From The Stars","review":"This is an interesting book. I like the three different voices she uses to narrate the three different worlds, and the way the most advanced world, being the most self-aware, is done in first person.Interesting questions are raised and about truth, right/wrong, etc. I do not agree with everything the author seems to believe, but this book would be a good springboard for discussion of questions like, \\"What is truth?\\" and \\"What/who is God?\\" and \\"Is there anything beyond what we can see and study with traditional science?\\"There are a lot of other interesting questions that can be pondered that the book raises but does not answer. For instance, was Alana's father exploiting her young heart and propensity to fall in love in order to save the world of Andrecia and, if so, is that a morally defensible thing?Not the absolute best book I have ever read, but worth reading, and probably worth reading more than once."},{"Title":"Enchantress From The Stars","review":"I read this many years ago as a young teenager and am pleased that it has returned for a new generation. A young girl finds that her wits, her psionic powers, and the courage of a young peasent turned warrior are all that stands between a primitive world and destruction."},{"Title":"Enchantress From The Stars","review":"I was expecting to read some kind of Star Wars but I was surprised. Begin with the idea based from the much-talked-about alien, Ms. Engdahl turned it into a concept that what if the ancient things, such as magic, dragon, wizards, witch, beyond our capability to understand, was things from another planet, another world, with civilization higher than ours?This book really made me think and even helped me in someway to add to my understanding about human, life and alien. A deep thoughtful science fiction story about human civilization evolution."},{"Title":"Enchantress From The Stars","review":"A beautifully rendered novel with high intelligence, captivating character, and cosmic soul. In many ways, Sylvia Engdahl's writings are the logical successors to Heinlein's derring-do tales of gifted individuals making a difference in human exploration of other worlds. But Engdahl's pace is more leisurely, reflective, and the tapestry she weaves may well outlast Heinlein's. Here, she introduces Elana, with a very special mission.... (For further exploits of Elana, and a crucially important argument for the necessity of space exploration right now, see Engdahl's The Far Side of Evil...)Although Elana is young, this is a novel for adults of all ages."},{"Title":"Enchantress From The Stars","review":"Only a very few people are capable of combining science fiction and fantasy, and even fewer can make it something that captures you as this book does.The book starts off with a young woman on a planetary anthropological mission, on a world called Andrecia. Andrecia is medieval and primitive, and in no way capable of handling the knowledge that advanced, spacefaring societies exist beyond their world.But the heroine, Elana, soon becomes involved in a plot concerning the potential invasion of Andrecia. But it is near-impossible for her to save the Andrecians, superstitious and magic-believers, from an invasion.Nearby is also a medical guy, Jarel, who feels remorse at the intentions of the Exploration Corps. They do not consider the population of Andrecia to be sentient and worthy of their notice, and promise to bring destruction down on Andrecia. There is also the son of an Andrecian woodcutter named Georyn, who identifies Elana as the Enchantress of the Stars. He believes that she has come for the purpose of testing him, if he can defeat a fearsome dragon in the forests.This clash of the sophisticated and the simple is well-drawn and almost saddening at times. Georyn's faith in Elana's &quot;magic&quot; is truly touching, without making him appear ignorant or dumb. Elana is an excellent, intelligent heroine who captures your sympathy and does not let go. Her struggles with integrity and truth do not transcend the reader, but are ones that you feel as much as she does.Too often in books there is a clash between magic and science, but in this particular book there is no clash. Perhaps that is partly due to the writing style -- half the magic seems to be in the otherworldly descriptions, interspersed with more grounded prose in the right places. (And Engdahl definitely knows how to write a beginning that will suck you in) Though some things like &quot;Imperial Corps&quot; and &quot;Federation&quot; imply a pseudo-Star-Trekkian space opera, this is none of the kind. This is a thoughtful work, filled with intelligent questions that will stimulate as it entertains.This goes on the shelf beside Tolkien and the Riddlemaster trilogy."},{"Title":"Enchantress From The Stars","review":"Science fiction and fantasy rarely interact well with one another. A story that begins by uttering factual possibilities (as science fiction does) will not fare well in the face of fantastical elements. And then you read a miraculous story like, \\"Enchantress From the Stars\\" and it all goes higgledy-piddledy out the window. Sylvia Louise Engdahl's 1970 classic isn't just well written. It is also a deeply moving work that seeks to answer questions we may have about our own innate morality and future prospects.In this story we meet our heroine Alana. Alana spells out clearly the three phases of humanity. In the first phase, people are superstitious and primitive. In the second, they are scientific and logical. In the third (and this is the phase to which Alana belongs) people remember the spiritual side to life and enter onto an entirely different plane from that of their forebears. Those planets and people in the universe who have advanced to the third phase have joined together to save those in the first phase from those in the second. In this particular story, Alana joins both her father and her lover on a planet not too different from that of Earth. Their goal is to save the planet's fledgling civilization from a group of colonizers from another planet. To do so, Alana must enlist the help of a man living in an age of chivalry and a man living in an age of science. As these three worlds intersect, the book thoroughly examines where it is humanity is heading and what we have to look forward to. In short, it is a book about faith.How easy it would have been for author Engdahl to screw up while writing this. She could have made it too long (and it's not a quick read at that). The pace could have dragged. The characters (and jumps between different people's perspectives) could have rung false. Instead, the book is nearly perfect. Alana has sworn an oath to protect the secret of her advanced world's existence from the people she interacts with. At the same time, however, she wonders if it is proper to question the oath's policy. When she asks her father this question he responds as such:\\"We are sworn to carry out Federation policy, yes, just as a policeman is bound to uphold the law; but that doesn't mean we suspend our own ethical judgement\\".So Engdahl smoothly works in questions of ethics vs. morality as well. The book goes far beyond the normal sci-fi/fantasy literature it has been so unfortunately paired with. Rather, it is a deeply moving and deeply felt story that reaches for the Big Questions and, on top of that, is an enjoyable read. It is probably the most enjoyable philosophical book written for young adults that I have ever had the pleasure to read. A nearly forgotten, marvelous, wonderful book."},{"Title":"Enchantress From The Stars","review":"What do you do when you get a glowing recommendation for an obscure book by an unprolific author you've never heard of? Well, if you're like me, you react skeptically, yet with fascination. So I jumped at the chance to get &quot;Enchantress from the Stars&quot;, knowing it was rare. It's one thing to read a book *knowing* it will be good and it turns out so. It's something more special to go into a book with no expectations and to be totally blown away by it. That was what happened to me when reading this book. The lines of science fiction and fantasy blur here thanks to some very clever storytelling. It all takes place on the planet of Andrecia, the natives of which are analogous to those of Mediaeval Europe. Their planet is being invaded by a scientifically-oriented spacefaring culture. A small number of field agents from a culture further advanced than either of the aforementioned (and posessing psychic and telekinetic powers) arrives with intent to get the invaders to leave the planet to the natives. They go about this by telling a young native man named Georyn and his brother that they are sorcerers and that they will endow them with special powers that will make the invaders leave. The story goes beyond the standard &quot;good vs. evil&quot; plotlines in such stories, and posesses a refreshing sense of humanity that reminds me slightly of Ursula Le Guin. To say this is an excellent book doesn't begin to describe its majesty and emotional power."},{"Title":"Enchantress From The Stars","review":"In her novel Enchantress from the Stars, Sylvia Louise Engdahl combines science fiction and fantasy to weave together an intricate plot and tell an entertaining and interesting story. The time in which this story takes place is not clear. When the book begins, it seems as if Engdahl is writing of the future. As the story progresses, it seems as if she is writing of the past. In the end of the book, the two times intertwine so that it seems as if time does not exist at all.The plot is set on the planet of Andrecia, home to a poverty-stricken, primitive society in which the people live in small rural villages and are governed by a monarchy. In one of the poor Andrecian villages, at the edge of the dreaded Enchanted Forest, lives a woodcutter with his four sons, all of whom dream of better, brighter futures. While the three eldest brothers wish for power, gold, and treasure, the youngest, Georyn, wants only wisdom equal to that of his King. Thus, when word travels to them that the person who slays the dragon inhabiting the Enchanted Forest will receive from the King whatever reward he desires, all four brothers are eager to set out at once. However, the dragon is actually a giant machine, or rockchewer, built by a far more technologically-advanced society, the Imperials. The Imperials, who are planning to take over the planet, have created the rockchewer to clear the land so they can build a colony. As the Andrecians appear one by one to &Ograve;slay the dragon,&Oacute; they are paralyzed by the Imperials stun-guns, making them defenseless captives.Another society of people, even more advanced than the Imperials, is determined to stop them from taking over the planet. Elana and Evrek, two teenagers, and Elanas father journey to Andrecia to help the native Andrecians revolt against the Imperials and scare them off the planet. Elanas people have the unique ability to move objects with their minds and to communicate telepathically. As a result, Georyn and his brothers believe Elana to be an Enchantress. Through many tests and a developing friendship, she teaches Georyn how to control the movement of objects and prepares him for his face-off with the dragon.\\"Enchantress From the Stars\\" is an engrossing book that keeps the reader on their toes from the very first chapter. Weaving together two different genres allows Engdahl to interest readers of all kinds. \\"Enchantress\\" is not only a story about dragons and spaceships, it is also about testing the true strength of love.

This is a very captivating story full of excitement and adventure, but also full of so much more. I found this book to be loaded with very deep meaning about life, humanity, and faith. The author was definitely trying to convey some interesting ideas about humanity and society, and I found those ideas to be fascinating and full of some important truths. This book opened my mind and really got me thinking about a lot of things.This book will grab you right from the beginning, but I did find it to get just a little confusing in some places towards the end.

That being said, I could not entirely enjoy the story because I had a problem with the heroine. I know this probably says more about me than her but...The heroine, as thoughtful and insightful as she is, is a bit of a hypocrite. She \\"suffers\\" enormously with guilt about even the smallest of lies she is forced to tell her \\"poor primitive\\" lover.On the other hand she only feels a twinge of condescending pity for her fianc&eacute; whom she has been more-or-less betraying by concealing her \\"forbidden love\\" for the \\"primitive\\" for most the book.And when it comes to lying to her father and sneaking around behind his back; forget about it! She doesn't even hesitate a second and even takes a certain pleasure in it, even when, inevitably, her \\"disobedience\\" endangers entire civilizations.There are only four main characters in this book. The heroine, her male father, her male fianc&eacute;, and her male lover. I found myself many times wishing she had a mother, sister, or best friend to whack her upside the head and tell her to stop acting so ridiculous.The one woman who COULD and WOULD have set her straight was killed as the book opened. (Actually there WAS one other female in the book; a practically-unconscious sacrifice victim being \\"delivered to the dragon.\\")Anyway enough about my problems.

I am now reading it to my 6th grade and 4th grade daughters. Once we got past the first chapter, they fell in love with it. It combines fantasy and science fiction by applying a twist of Clark's Law (&quot;Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.&quot;) while delving into the question of &quot;What sorts of goals are worthy of commitment and sacrifice?&quot; It is enjoyable on several levels. I would recommend some caution for children under age 10 as some of the concepts are sophisticated and things such as death and severe poverty are included."},{"Title":"Enchantress From The Stars","review":"Thanks goodness this marvelous novel is back in print. I was a real bookworm as a child, devouring hundreds of books, but this one stuck with me. I had searched for it ever since my own children were old enough to read, and thoroughly enjoyed re-reading it as an adult.Who, ultimately, saved Andrecia from being conquered by the Imperials? Elana, her father, and Evrek, with their superior civilization? Georyn, with his amazing ability to use the power of the charm? Jarel, with his courageous decision to aid Elana and Georyn? Certainly, all these characters played a part.But, some higher force in the universe brought them all together. Some higher force arranged that Elana and Georgyn would fall in love, and that Jarel would both question his empire's conquest and have opportunity to meet and aid Elana. We are left to decide for ourselves just what that higher force could be. Coincidence is not an option.In the climactic scene of this novel, love truly conquers all to the astonishment of everyone present. Every character acts according to a plan, and every plan goes awry, yet the outcome is better than any of them could have imagined. They are all left humbled by a magic beyond their expectations. And, the reader is left enchanted by Engdahl's provacative science fiction-fairy tale."},{"Title":"Enchantress From The Stars","review":"This is surely one of the most rewarding stories I have ever read. On the surface it is an adventure tale about a would-be hero who sets out to slay a dragon and an almost-anthropologist who drops in from beyond the stars to help him. The interrelationships between three cultures at varying levels of advancement, are overlaid with the transcending relationships between individual people. At the same time it is a thoughtful essay on being human: on fear and courage and love. Most importantly, though, it is an affirmation of taith: faith in individuals and faith in the progressive improvements in societies. Dont worry. Somehow the theory and phillosophy NEVER overpower, or even hinder the plot or its people. These things are all mingled into a vibrant story.My father first read this book to me when I was very young and I loved it. I have come back to it many times, each time finding something new. I don't know whether I treasure it more for the quiet reassurance about belief in human destiny,"},{"Title":"Enchantress From The Stars","review":"When I picked up Enchantress From the Stars, I expected it to be a kind of old-fashioned fantasy book. The reason I picked it up was that it was a Newbery Honor winner. I was tired of old-fashioned fantasies.This wasn't tiring. In fact, it's one of my favorite books.It's about Elana - she isn't supposed to be on Andrecia, but she's on there. She's from a highly developed planet where they aren't supposed to show themselves to not yet developed planets. Andrecia is another planet, which is kind of like our past, when people believed in dragons and such, being invaded by a more developed society. Anyway, Elana pretends to be an Enchantress, her father Starwatcher, and Evrek an evil spirit. It changes views from Elana to Georyn to Jarel. I didn't quite agree with the ideas and was enraged when I found Elana and Georyn's relationship was simply being \\"used,\\" but it's still my favorite book. It's a science-fantasy viewpoint of legends and enchantresses."},{"Title":"Enchantress From The Stars","review":"Elana is part of a highly advanced society, but they keep themselves secret to all societies below them- at whatever cost.

Elana ends up working with her father and the boy she is to marry, as she helps try to perserve the planet with a native's help. What is science to Elana is \\"magic\\" to the people of this planet.

I am sixteen and just finished reading this book a few days ago. It is about four people from an advanced Federation, who travel to an inhabited \\"Youngling\\" planet that is being colonized by a different Youngling culture. The Federation hopes to frighten the invaders away without letting either culture know that their race is less advanced than another is. If a race learns that they have more advanced neighbors, they could lose faith in their own progress and wouldn't develop normally, depriving the universe of a unique race that might someday discover something that previous races had missed. There is a \\"My Teacher is an Alien\\" series of books by Bruce Coville that I enjoyed many aspects of, but in those books the more advanced races of the universe were contemplating destroying Earth because it was still fighting itself 3,000 years after all other known species had stopped fighting themselves. I like Sylvia Endgahl's take on humanities evolution better; unfair actions are a natural part of a culture's growth. A race may go through growing pains just as a person does. It is painful to know that so many innocent people have been hurt when unique cultures, unused to each other, first meet and subsequently try to adapt. People tend to be more thoughtful and considerate as they gain experience and become more aware of feelings. The Federation could easily have destroyed either or both cultures, but instead chose a few people to try to ease the cultures through some painful growing stages. They recognized that once a race is influenced too much or gone, you can never know what it might have accomplished."},{"Title":"Enchantress From The Stars","review":"This is a must read.

Turned out, my hunch was completely right! This isn't really the type of book you rave about (however I may rave--as that is what I do with books )it's more the variety that leaves you thinking and makes a lasting impression.The characters were well thought through. And though I felt Elana (main character) acted a little young for her age, by the end I could see clearly how she'd matured to view life in a better way. Georyn came through as the slightly wide-eyed innocent he was meant to be. And the interactions between them felt utterly natural.Characters: 5 StarsAnd what a wonder-full/mysterious plot! An interesting mix between Sci-Fi and Fantasy that Sylvia Engdahl pulled off marvelously! It was a cohesive story that represented a section in Elana's life. And I recognized that this was only a very small portion of something much bigger. The fate of a world did rest on her shoulders, but it was refreshing to read a story about growing better and fighting for what is right, even in the little things.Plot: 5 StarsSwitching between first-person POW with Elana and a classic rendition of Georyn's side of things, it was quite enjoyable to discover how they each viewed different phenomena--such as the giant machine that Georyn sees as a horrendous, fire-breathing dragon.

I'd never hear of it, or Sylvia Lousie Engdahl before, but it was an intriguing looking science fiction/fantasy, and even though I don't have much time for casual reading these days, I decided to try it.I'm so glad I did.Enchantress From the Stars is the story of three people from three civilizations at various points of development: Elana, from a futuristic society, part of an order that helps protect \\"Youngling\\" societies, as they call the cultures and civilizations far elow their level of development. Jarel, a medic for an Imperial colony that has come to take over the planet Andrecia for the Empire, even if it means neutralizing its \\"less than human\\" population, and Georyn, a native Andrecian, facing a danger that he knows only as \\"the Dragon\\".The book takes the point of view of each of these characters at various points, switching points of view and styles smoothly and easily, drawing the reader further into the minds of the three main characters. The story is engaging and compelling; Elana's development, and her team's struggle to protect Andrecia without violating thier version of something akin to Star Trek's Prime Directive pulls the reader in and doesn't let go, and Georyn's intelligence and yearnings for something greater make him a character you'll never forget.Enchantress From the Stars is a wonderful books that combines the best qualities of wonder of both science fiction and fantasy. You'll never forget it, or its characters; thier story, their coming of age, their insights, will hold your mind for a long, long time after you close the book."},{"Title":"Enchantress From The Stars","review":"Ms. Engdahl has a unique talent for presenting sympathetic characters who deal with life-changing ordeals and must make hard ethical choices.

If it was the publisher's decision to end the series, they are missing the boat."},{"Title":"Enchantress From The Stars","review":"I'm delighted to see how many others have been moved by this very special book! I was a 12 year-old sixth grader in 1977 when this exciting story and its wonderful heroine initiated me into several paradigm shifts.Elana is both girl and woman, and her integrity, intelligence and courage inspired me. She was the first literary heroine I truly took to my heart and cherished as a role model. She lived in a world previously unimaginable to me (this was my first science fiction book), but her challenges and the way she faced them were immediate and real. Like Noren, the central character of Engdahl's \\"Children of the Star\\" trilogy, she wrestles with issues of truth, integrity, courage, love, and responsibility, because she cares so very deeply about them.This was my first clue that science fiction could be about something besides ray guns and bug-eyed-monsters. Three cultures meet in this story, and the consequences of that impact held my attention and fired my imagination long after the last page. I'd always dreamed of adventures beyond the lovely but small town in which I was growing up. This book raised my eyes to the stars.Finally, \\"Enchantress\\" taught me that the way a person perceives life and truth are inexorably bound up with their life experiences and references. Three people from different worlds meet in this book, and each has a completely different understanding of what's going on. From then on, I knew that my own perspective was necessarily limited, and I could never assume that another person automatically shared my understanding.In the year 2001, I'm 36 years old, with a Masters Degree and a personal library of over 1000 volumes, and Elana and Georyn are still among my favorite characters of all time. \\"Enchantress from the Stars\\" stands among the few dozen on two special shelves of books that are set apart from the rest as being especially precious. When my now 5 year old daughter turns 12, I'm going to give her this book as a special gift.Do yourself a favor: get it for yourself. And think seriously about getting it for a young woman of your acquaintance. Elana is an exceptional heroine and role model. And it's a great story."},{"Title":"Enchantress From The Stars","review":"A friend of mine recomended this book to me, and since he is a sci-fi buff, I expected little. How wrong I was. Three worlds, all on different levels, colide on the small, earth-like planet of Andrecia. Elana, the main character, is from the highest ranking of the three. When she arrives on Andrecia, she doesn't expect much. But, like me, she is proved wrong. Sylvia Engdahl writes a dramatic play of characters all on different levels, but very much the same."},{"Title":"Enchantress From The Stars","review":"Elana is a member of an advanced interstellar civilization that studies and protects unadvanced \\"Youngling\\" civilizations. When space-faring Younglings called Imperials invade a medieval Youngling planet called Andrecia, Elana becomes involved in an attempt to rescue Andrecia--without endangering either culture, or revealing her own. Enchantress of the Stars is an ambitious book, but not always a successful one. There are three civiliazations, three points of view, two narrative styles, a wide-ranging plot and setting all couched within a framing narration, and with so much going on no one aspect is fully realized. Take for example the characters: Elana and her love interest Georgyn are admirable, realistically faulted, promising characters, but Elana's narration deadens her own character development by burdening it with excessive explanation; the interaction between these characters is satisfyingly complex--except for the crucial romantic element, which develops too easily and early, and shoulders too many plot points. These aspects are well-intended and the groundwork for their success is laid out in elements such as Elana's naivety and intelligence, Georyn's keen emotional insight, and the unique POVs which accompany each character, but they never quite come to life. This failure makes for an emotionally stunted novel--which is particularly regrettable in young adult literature.The plot has similar lofty goals and rocky execution. Its ambition and scope is what I loved best in the book, and it makes for a young adult novel that, rather than talking down to its audience, challenges them with difficult concepts of societal and personal maturation. The carefully constructed triple narrative also makes for some strong parallelism and clever plot developments, the sort of which would be unlikely in a traditionally narrated book. But the triple narrative also makes for unfortunate repetition, the plot's tension is destroyed by the framing narration, and in between the lovely parallels and plot points are some pinprick plot holes. Why, for example, do the Imperials consider colonized natives effectively nonhuman if they study--of all things!--their psychology, which is virtually identical to the Imperials's own? Because it makes for a convenient plot point later on, of course--but while such plot holes don't render things entirely improbable, they are enough to make the plot feel more like machination than natural progression, weakening its erstwhile strengths. I nitpick, of course, but that's just my point: I went through Enchantress from the Stars constantly distracted by nitpicking; I was never absorbed by characters or motivated by plot enough to overlook the various weaknesses. It's a laudably ambitious book, intriguing for its premise alone, and at times comes rewardingly close to its goals, but more often than not it made me wish, instead, that I were reading the book that it could have been. I recommend it only moderately, mostly on the basis of what it tries to be."},{"Title":"See No Evil: A Guide to Protecting Our Children from Media Violence","review":"What an extraordinary book.

The authors devote the first part of the book to a series of techniques for converting 5\\" squares into checkerboard blocks, half-square triangle blocks, quarter-square triangle blocks, and \\"picket fences\\" as efficiently as possible. These directions are very complete and well explained. They also suggest buying a little extra fabric each time you shop, and ctting off a five-inch strip right away. Plus they give great instructions on how to hold a 5-inch square swap, including how to keep track of everybody's contributions.Then, in the second part, they give directions for a series of quilts from very easy to a little more complicated (though none of them are actually difficult). Even the easiest quilts are surprisingly complex-looking, and all of them are designed to be made in three sizes. The color scheme of most of the quilts shown is medium-to-dark traditional prints on cream, but there is no reason not to choose a completely different scheme. (I am thinking about oversize splashy prints on a black-and-white background for one of the simpler quilts, for example, or bright plaids on batik.) Now all I have to do is start cutting..."},{"Title":"Nickel Quilts","review":"This is a wonderful book. I bought it because I had previously bought a stash of 5\\" squares and thought this would give me some ideas for using them. The ideas in this book go well beyond that, though. By simply cutting your scraps into 5\\" squares, or cutting a couple of 5\\" squares when you use fabric for another purpose, you can develop a stash that can be easily used for these beautiful, easy quilts. I recently made a wall quilt from one of the patterns, and could not believe how easy it was. Not only that, but the technique for creating four-patch units produced perfectly matched seams, something I've had trouble with as a new quilter. As some of the other reviewers have mentioned, changing the color schemes used in the book gives an entirely different look for the quilts. The other thing I loved is the opportunity for easy creativity. By rotating some of the blocks, use of color, and designing my own border using their patchwork units, I made my quilt look entirely different from the example in the book (which was beautiful in itself). I can't wait to play around more with the ideas...I'm going to try making miniature quilts using these techniques...and using EQ5 (quilt design software) to play around with the different looks you can create by rotating the blocks. This book will keep me occupied for a long time...12/5/2003: It's now over a year later and I am still making quilts from this book (along with others). Just completed one that I'm very happy with...it looks almost nothing like the example in the book that prompted the idea. My least favorite part of quilting is cutting out the pieces, and this book's techniques take a lot of the tedium out of that, leaving more time to play around with the design. I have other more beautiful books but have made more quilts out of this one than any other."},{"Title":"Nickel Quilts","review":"I love the techniques taught in this book.

While the pattern worked wonderfully, she said it was to be made by a beginner. Completely ridiculous. Each block took about an hour, and I am an experienced quilter. There are 29 squares in each block, you sew, then cut, then sew again, that's not a beginner level quilt. And the amount of fabric to cut for each square was also wrong. I have yards of cut fabric I didn't need. And I didn't check until I started my blocks, which was my own fault, but I looked at other patterns in here, and it was the same. Check on her sizes too. I have a king sized bed, and made her \\"double\\" quilt. It goes right to the floor. Lastly, it's really written only for you if you have five inch blocks. I really had to think hard how to make the cuts from fat quarters I had in any kind of sensible way. I think just a little section on how to do that would have helped the book a lot.That said, I love the quilt. It's just the book was more a guide than I would have hoped."},{"Title":"Nickel Quilts","review":"It seems to be a great quilt book, with excellent instructions....I have not actually used it for a project yet, but I've read through it several times and it has given me lots of ideas....M Reid"},{"Title":"Nickel Quilts","review":"I have a lot of quilting books that I have acquired over the years and this book looks like a good addition.

So I bought my own copy. . .Although the photos show most quilts in a very scrappy layout, many can be done with only a few color choices to change the contrast or focus of the design - I also appreciate the yardage lists for multiple sizes - when I want to sew I don't want to waste time with math!! There are diamonds, stars, and stripes - -something for every taste, with complete diagrams and instructions. Each quilt is rated for skill level, so you won't be overwhelmed or stuck in the middle, wondering \\"now what?\\"Most of the patterns have a very \\"traditional\\" or classic look - if you're into more modern design this would not be the right book for you."},{"Title":"Nickel Quilts","review":"I purchased this book and its follow-up,More Nickel Quilts, after doing months of research looking to add the best possible books on patchworking scraps to my library that I could find.

The major plus is that with minor changes, the quilts don't have to be all about squares. The book has some really creative patterns.My complaint is minor and simple - in many cases, the squares immediately get chopped into 2.5 inch strips. The quilts could just as easily be made from jelly rolls, only the instructions don't cover this. Example, the materials list may be for x pairs of 5 inch squares - when 2 jelly roll strips would work.Super minor as complaints go - especially since the title of the book is Nickel Quilts (as in quilts from 5 in squares). I guess I am just greedy. LOL"},{"Title":"Nickel Quilts","review":"This is my second Nickel Quilt book. I'm delighted with the patterns. They are easy to follow and fairly quick to make. Several patterns offer a great way to use up scraps from your stash and some are more \\"matched\\". There is something for everyone in here. An advanced quilter might be bored with it however as there are not many challenges with folds, y seams or curves. Overall I really enjoy owning this book."},{"Title":"Nickel Quilts","review":"Easy to follow instructions and great use for scraps left over from other quilts.

Must be in all home of lovers of Art Deco and sculpture."},{"Title":"The world of Swope","review":"Like most voracious readers, I have read innumerable biographies. Years ago, they were chronological accounts in which almost every part of the subject's life was treated with equal gravity: biographer as stenographer. The more modern biography starts with the greatest moment in the person's life, then goes back to the beginning and tells the story in chronological order. Biographer as storyteller. There are, of course, hatchet jobs, which concentrate only on the bad a person has done, and hagiographies, which make the subject out to be a saint. Some, however, are in a class by themselves. William Manchester's Churchill (which, due to his ill-health will never be finished). McCullough's Truman. Caro's Johnson. And Kahn's Swope.Never in my five decades as a reader have I read a biography as clever and well-written as E.J. Kahn's 1965 biography of Herbert Bayard Swope, \\"The World of Swope.\\" I read it at the recommendation of a former Associated Press news librarian. Swope was probably the single most important editor of The World, which was, in turn, one of the most important New York newspapers, from its founding by Pulitzer to its death by strangulation at the hands of his heirs in 1931. Swope's life was complicated and fascinating, and Kahn renders it's aspects with care, anecdote and tub-thumpingly good writing. What fascinated me was the clear use of the \\"writer's guiding intelligence.\\" The early years of Swope's life are dealt with in a page or two, the three decades of his life as a journalist are explored in loving detail and the three decades of his life after he left The World are dealt with crisply and concisely. Not a word of it felt obligatory or misplaced. I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The world of Swope","review":"I love biographies of almost any kind and I am particularly partial to journalists, the 1920s & 1930s era and the Algonquin Group - as Herbert Bayard Swope covers all that ground, any book on him should have been a sure thing. Sadly, I found this book jumbled, over packed, and in dire need of editing.It's not the lack of information, it's the over-abundance that seems blasted at you in rapid fire, with little pause, organization or reflection that it begins to feel exhausting and after 500 or so pages, I am still left unsure what I read and why and who he is, only glad that the marathon is finished, although I admit to doing something I rarely do and that is at around page 250 I began skimming - if the first sentence of a paragraph seemed uninteresting than I skipped it and moved to the next paragraph.If you are like me a fan of the Algonquin group and want to read more about Swope's famous parties with these characters, go to approximately page 300 and you'll find about 30-50 pages of them but that's it.Who is Swope and why was he famous? Well in the end it seems nebulous, besides his famous parties, he was valued highly for his insight, thoughts and connections in political and financial institutions, his first half of his career was in newspapers and the second half was behind the scenes. He wielded power but not in an obvious way. He lived life very large with joy and ostentation, he knew everyone and was known for his speaking ability. But like many of that era who were also famous and influential at the turn of the last century, he is forgotten similar to R.H. Davis, H.L. Mencken etc.Two bits, one is that he and John Barrymore were roommates before they were successful and the other is that the famous wild parties at Swope's Long Island mansion are said to be largely the inspiration for F. Scott Fitzgerald's Great Gatsby."},{"Title":"Sound Synthesis and Sampling, Second Edition (Music Technology)","review":"I need to jump in a correct a few faulty opinions surrounding this book. This is not \\"Synthesizers for Dummies\\" or anything like it. It's a book on electronic sound synthesis and the science behind it. You'll find diagrams, graphs, some easy math, and some technical terms. An understanding of the physics of sound helps. Basically, you'll find what you would expect to see in a text book, which is what this is. If you want to fool around with some presets on your synth without getting into designing your own sounds, this is not what you're looking for.However, if you're looking to get into sound design or you want to tap the real power of your synthesizer, this is a great resource. The first edition came before computer synthesis hit the mainstream, so the focus is on hardware synthesizers, but that is not to say that you can't apply all the lessons in here to computer synthesis. I've built a number of the examples in PureData (the open source Max/MSP) and I regularly have students draw from the diagrams in my Intro to Sound Synthesis class.I've found that while this book wasn't made exclusively for computer sound synthesis in the way that Curtis Roads' excellent Computer Music Tutorial is, students are far less intimidated by this. The writing style is (contrary to what Altoidboy would have you believe) not overly dry and jargon is not really a problem. I mean, if you consider \\"low frequency oscillator\\" to be jargon, then I guess this book is full of it. However, that's like reading a medical text book and then complaining that words like \\"spinal cord\\" and \\"frontal lobe\\" are jargon. My students have never complained.Obviously, your main choice is going to be between this an the Computer Music Tutorial. Both are excellent and comprehensive, and both have different strengths. If you're primarily concerned with hardware synthesizers or you want something accessible, I'd go with \\"Sound Synthesis and Sampling\\". If you're leaning more towards computer sound synthesis, the CMT is probably better. Other differences include much more coverage of experimental techniques and newer developments such as granular synthesis in the CMT. \\"Sound Synthesis and Sampling\\" is much stronger in the classic synthesis techniques (additive, subtractive, AM, FM, etc.).Again to counter Altoidboy's review, there's is a wealth of practical content here. It's not as simple as following step-by-step instructions (now move the button marked \\"VCO\\" to the number 5), but this is ultimately a much better way to learn. Rather than blindly following directions that you don't understand, Russ shows you why things do what they do. Then, you can apply this knowledge to any synthesizer, not just the one used as an example.This book is a classic and one that I would recommend to anyone interested in sound synthesis. Don't be scared off by negative reviews - just understand that this is a serious book with serious info."},{"Title":"Sound Synthesis and Sampling, Second Edition (Music Technology)","review":"I like this book 'bout being very concise and detailed about the various synthesis processes, but a bit more mathemtics could get some of my curiosities fulfilled. The theory is excellent and understanding the different synthesis types is a breeze; the flowcharts are intuitive and diagrams are detailed. I love the presentation of each topic, and the humour of the author while reading it. A great starting point for music technology enthusiasts but no advice on programming synths or using advanced software like reaktor, so it could be more expansive on some perfomance and programming areas. Overall great reading value."},{"Title":"Sound Synthesis and Sampling, Second Edition (Music Technology)","review":"If you have interest in finding out exactly what's happening with the sound as you twiddle those knobs, this book is an excellent choice.

It is 100% theory and history of synthesis, written in a typical pedantic British style of writing (sorry, Brits) with 0% actual practical content. It's a mix of a bit of synthesis history with a bit of acoustics describing how these things make sound. But it seems to miss the point, and one could learn more just by playing a synthesiser for an hour than learning this book from cover to cover. If you're investingating this book with an eye towards learning how to program synths or better understand them, I think you'll be disappointed. It spends a lot of time discussing the pioneers (DX7, etc.) but doesn't even mention some of the most important synths of the day (Waldorf, Virus) and there's only a brief mention of softwaresynths (Reaktor, Reason) and none of softsamplers (Unity, Giga, etc.)) I think this book misses the mark; it fills your head with facts and figures but doesn't give you much that's actually useful.

This opens her up to sniffy comments by academics who think no history can be written unless it done in the dullest way possible.In spite of the fact Ms. Picard did voluminous research and adequately footnoted and indexed her book, she still came in for some sniping. In my mind, it is most unfair for she has produced an entertaining, interesting, breezy account of times during the reign of George III. (1740-1770)Though Ms. Picard is clearly no fan of the revered Dr. Johnson and has a very poor opinion of biographer James Boswell, they do weave in and out of the text. She divides the book into three sections, The Poor, The Middling Sort, and The Rich. She gives us what they wore, ate, with what they entertained themselves, and how they lived with great immediacy. You will wonder how anyone survived to grow up in filthy, smelly, incurious London. Most surprising to me was the Gin Wars and how pervasive this cheap form of alcohol was among the poor. It had a huge effect on a great portion of the populace for an extended period of time. The ladies' three-foot high hairdos forced them to sit on the floor of coaches when traveling to balls. I couldn't help but wonder if they just slid out the door when they reached their destinations.\\"Dr. Johnson's London\\" is a lively read with interesting details. Ms. Picard does a good job of getting us into the sensibilities of 18th century London. Recommended."},{"Title":"Dr. Johnson's London: Coffee-Houses and Climbing Boys, Medicine, Toothpaste and Gin, Poverty and Press-Gangs, Freakshows and Female Education","review":"This book is for those who want something more than the obvious. Liza Picard's strength is that she does not attempt to be an historian. She states her limitations and then proceeds to examine the things that are of interest to her in the period.I enjoyed the fact that the author is present in the text. It adds to the book and reminds the reader that this is one person's description of the life and times of London mid-1700s.The chapter and section headings are clear and precise allowing the reader to dip into areas of particular interest. Picard brings the period to life with her own style which is rarely boring and never pedantic."},{"Title":"Dr. Johnson's London: Coffee-Houses and Climbing Boys, Medicine, Toothpaste and Gin, Poverty and Press-Gangs, Freakshows and Female Education","review":"I enjoyed this book very much, which has been criticized as &quot;history lite&quot; by an earlier reviewer. The reviewer is correct that this is not the book for serious scholars of the period. Then again, many potential readers -- myself included -- are not scholars or academics and will find Picard's vignettes of daily life in Georgian London to be a satisfying read. I believe that anyone who has enjoyed such recent popular histories as Alison Weir's Plantagenet/Tudor series and biographies such as Amanda Foreman's Duchess of Devonshire and Stella Tillyard's Aristocrats will find this book enjoyable as well."},{"Title":"Dr. Johnson's London: Coffee-Houses and Climbing Boys, Medicine, Toothpaste and Gin, Poverty and Press-Gangs, Freakshows and Female Education","review":"Anyone expecting a good story will be disappointed by this book, because it is not a traditional narrative history. Instead, it's something equally as interesting but in a different way. Picard has dug into diaries, letters, archives, and publications of the day to unearth a treasure of miscellaneous but really very basic information about daily life in Johnson's London: what fine silk cost, what tradesmen were paid, how homes were decorated, and the like. The bare bones of the London economy and the personal economies of the aristocracy, the middle class, and the working poor are laid out here. The information is fascinating, and it is indispensable for anyone who reads and enjoys the literature and history of the period, because it fills in so many gaps. All of those who admire Patrick O'Brien's wonderful grasp of the minutiae of life, as demonstrated so superbly in his Aubrey-Maturin series, will immediately appreciate what a matchless resource this book is. It is not a book to read again and again--it is a book to read once and then refer to, often and with pleasure."},{"Title":"Dr. Johnson's London: Coffee-Houses and Climbing Boys, Medicine, Toothpaste and Gin, Poverty and Press-Gangs, Freakshows and Female Education","review":"Picard covers an era of British social history, the 1700s, that has received relatively little attention. The book is divided into four parts: The first part covers London's infrastructure, and the other three parts cover the three major socioeconomic categories: poor, \\"middling,\\" and rich, although the rich get rather little page space. There are over 50 illustrations.This book is reminiscent of an encyclopedia: For each heading there is a description of one-to-five paragraphs, making this an easy book to jump around in as the spirit moves you. A less charitable description would be to say that the style is disjointed. The amount of detail is impressive, and the reader is given a thorough introduction to daily life of that era. The author often launches into remarks that are intended to be humorous. I imagine this was done so the book would not be dry reading, but her comments often seem gratuitous or disruptive to the flow of the material. There is very little here specifically about Samuel Johnson; this is a book about his era, not about him.I preferred a very similar book, \\"1700: Scenes from London Life\\" by Maureen Waller. Waller's book covers the identical material (50 years earlier) and has a more cohesive style of writing."},{"Title":"Dr. Johnson's London: Coffee-Houses and Climbing Boys, Medicine, Toothpaste and Gin, Poverty and Press-Gangs, Freakshows and Female Education","review":"This book looks deep beneath the surface of London society during the Age of Enlightment and describes in minute detail what life was really like for one and all, from the lowest street urchin to the royal family. The daily struggle for existence by London's residents is covered -- all those unsavory things you probably didn't learn in history class. Overflowing cespits, Orphans apprentenced into professions where an early death from industrial pollutants was a near certainty, bakeries that regularly adulterated their bread with caulk, these are just a few of the many examples found on these pages. No detail is overlooked: What they wore, what they did for fun, the cost of living, the cost of dying, the capricious justice system under which a significant number of lawbreakers managed to avoid punishment, even for murder, while an unlucky few were hanged for crimes that today would draw only a small fine.I highly recommend Dr. Johnson's London to anyone who is looking for an in-depth look at Georgian London."},{"Title":"Dr. Johnson's London: Coffee-Houses and Climbing Boys, Medicine, Toothpaste and Gin, Poverty and Press-Gangs, Freakshows and Female Education","review":"I stumbled on Liza Picard's books quite by chance. After looking at the publishing date in some of the books it is apparent some of them have been around for several years. I am now recommending them to anyone and everyone and I am so glad I stumbled across the first one I read on a rainy afternoon, lonely and far away from home. I have now read them all.As soon as you start to read the book it becomes apparent that the author is passionate about her subject and wants the reader to enjoy the reading experience as much as she has in the writing of it. Liza Picard presents an enthralling picture of how life in London was really lived. The book is about the period from 1740 to 1770 when many great men walked the streets of London, among them Hogarth, Fielding and Dr Johnson. Names that are well known in history, but the author puts meat on the bones and brings these people to life for the enjoyment of the reader.Liza Picard was born in 1927. She read law and qualified as a barrister but did not practice. Quite where she gleaned all this information from I am not sure. That it was a labour of love is obvious to anyone who reads her books and I for one am grateful."},{"Title":"Dr. Johnson's London: Coffee-Houses and Climbing Boys, Medicine, Toothpaste and Gin, Poverty and Press-Gangs, Freakshows and Female Education","review":"Dr. Johnson's London is a remarkable compilation of facts about 18th century London including its oddities and reforms that led to modern London. The book is a series of small paragraphs each describing some aspect of London life, infrastructure, scandals, etc. in the 18th century. The book is organized into categories, each covering some aspect of the great city.While I found the book entertaining, the lack of any narrative makes it impossible to read straight through and can only be taken in small doses. Essentially, this is a bathroom book for history buffs."},{"Title":"Dr. Johnson's London: Coffee-Houses and Climbing Boys, Medicine, Toothpaste and Gin, Poverty and Press-Gangs, Freakshows and Female Education","review":"I've yet to read a Liza Picard book that I haven't completely enjoyed.

I'm almost done with it and I am finding the information very interesting.I've always wanted to know what London was like back in the pre-Victorian days and this book attempts to do just that.Since the excerpts were taken from actual written documentations (eg: Dr. Johnson's diaries,etc.)---in other words, a person that was actually there. Liza Picard was merely the person that compiled all the information for this book.Therefore, I'm reading this book by keeping this fact in mind.The language expressed in this book may sound \\"old fashioned\\" because most of the excerpts were written by a pre-Victorian Era person, and also that person lived in London. Thus, there is a difference between reading a book written today in modern English, as opposed to the written English style of a century ago. (I actually enjoyed reading the written \\"old fashioned\\" English excerpts).There are not alot of photos in this book, so if you are looking for a picture book ,then this book may not be of your liking.Instead, this book is categorized into various chapters regarding pre-Victorian London (ie:such as the political occurences of the times, or for example the medical view points of a century ago, etc...). Each chapter discusses the aspects of \\"old\\" London, as seen through the eyes of the people that were there at that time."},{"Title":"Dr. Johnson's London: Coffee-Houses and Climbing Boys, Medicine, Toothpaste and Gin, Poverty and Press-Gangs, Freakshows and Female Education","review":"New to Liza Picard's writing I so enjoyed this very readable historian I ordered the rest of her titles.

She tries to present herself as &quot;right there,&quot; and it is especially annoying when she interpolates herself into direct quotations with her square-bracketed commentaries [my italics, that sort of thing]. There is an apparent lack of scholarly rigor, too: the reader gets tired of seeing &quot;apparently&quot; and &quot;supposedly&quot; and &quot;I can imagine&quot; and all that sort of thing.

Though long, there is less to it than first meets the eye. This is history-lite and as such would probably have found limited favour with Dr Johnson himself. Ms Picard has used some interesting material from medical sources of the day but her reliance on The Gentleman's Magazine as a source shows in the notes at the end of the book.

I found it extremely frustrating.The other immediate and annoying aspect is that, as other reviewers have correctly noted, Ms. Parks is no Johnsonian.

Believed dead, she has made a life for the two of them in safety, even finding love. Then, her best friend vanishes, much as she did, but likely with more deadly results. Kate knows in her heart that her evil husband has struck again. She ought to be relieved when he's arrested for not only her friend's murder, but her own. Yet, the lie behind the charge drives her to risk losing it all to step forward and clear him. Instantly, Kate finds her life and her child's in the same jeopardy from which she ran once. Now, her only hope of surviving, or more importantly to her, seeing her son survive is that the one who loves her can reach her in time.*** Texas readers will be struck by the similarities between Hidden and the infamous John Hill case (Blood and Money, Prescription: Murder), but readers everywhere will be able to enjoy it. Though Kate's romance is not a prepossessive factor in the plot, it is critical to the story. Her actions may strike some as illogical, but her strength of character is commendable. The main weak spot to this book is there are times that the narrative has a jarringly graphic quality that effectively conveys revulsion. ***Reviewed by Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."},{"Title":"Hidden","review":"I read the back of this book, and thought, \\"what a cool idea for a book\\". Then started trying to actually read the book, and the execution just didn't live up to the idea. I got through about a third of the novel and then just returned it to the library.

But when Kate/Tricia's best friend disappears and her estranged husband is charged with murder, she knows she has to return to save him, not that she loves him any more - her heart is with the firefighter - but she cannot let a man go to prison for killing her when she is alive. I like this author and I liked this story until the very end when Kate/Tricia suddenly sends her brain out to lunch and behaves with incredible stupidity, when she seems to become a victim once again. It sort of ruined the story for me at that point.

Scott McCall, the paramedic who took her in has agreed not to delve into her past, as have the other people she has met and befriended. With a young son to protect, Tricia must be careful in everything she says and does.What Tricia can't tell Scott is that she's really Kate Whitehead, acclaimed fashion designer and missing wife of Senator Thomas Whitehead. Backed into an ugly corner due to her husband's abusive ways, she ran.Now her carefully crafted lie is falling apart. Her best friend, Leah, has disappeared, and Thomas is accused of murdering not only Leah, but a pregnant Kate. Tricia, a.k.a. Kate, must face not only the choice of telling the truth, but also growing feelings for Scott, who has his own secrets.In this multi-layered novel of love and suspense, Tara Taylor Quinn asks the question, \\"What if an abuser holds so much power that the victim can't get help?\\" Kate did what she felt necessary for her safety and that of her unborn child. Beyond that, many aspects of the story were difficult to believe.With all of the funds available to Kate, a reader may question why she made certain choices, including the choice to go to a bar to find someone to take her in. This does not speak well of her common sense. Nor do many of the other decisions she makes throughout the novel. As a mother, I found one of Kate's decisions absolutely terrifying. The reasons given did not outweigh the danger she put her son into-not with the options available, especially with her level of wealth. Other factors diminish the believability of the overall plot, as well.Overall, Quinn writes in a technically enjoyable manner. Unfortunately, the characters' actions and certain plot elements just don't carry the story, and it becomes a less than satisfying read.-Reviewed by Christina Wantz Fixemer05-07-2006"},{"Title":"Hidden","review":"Hidden is a great novel because of the authors ability to make Tricia Campbell a realistic character. Quinn seems to do this through her use of two story lines. The first is of a wealthy woman who has to escape her abusive husband and the second is the woman in a lifestyle that is common compared to how most American's live. She isn't completely wealthy and, in fact, tends to make her own belongings. She is able to hold a strong, romantic relationship with a paramedic and she has a roof above her head. In \\"Hidden\\", Tricia Campbell is the narrator which gives a psychological view of the stories events. This makes the story more intense for the reader. This is enhanced by the imagery that Quinn uses. Even if it is sometimes too intense, Quinn does have the ability to take the reader to the scene of the crime including the accident in which Scott McCall's life changed and the events leading up to Tricia Campbell's freedom from her husband.The problem with this story is that it went into intense descrptions about the sexual abuse that Tricia Campbell's husband gave her which could have been expressed in a less intense and more efficient manor. The events could have been to another character instead of the reader being taken to the crime."},{"Title":"Hidden","review":"I enjoyed this book very much, I have only read 2 of her books and I am looking forward to reading more."},{"Title":"Hidden","review":"Two years ago Kate Whitehead accompanied by her infant son, fled from her abusive husband powerful Senator Thomas Whitehead.

Chapter 1, &quot;One Nation, Divisible,&quot; sets up the slavery issue, from the establishment of the Mason-Dixon line to the Compromise of 1850, ending with a gallery of the noted abolitionists of the day. Chapter 2, &quot;The Avenging Angel,&quot; focuses on the life and legacy of John Brown.

Chapter 5, &quot;The Guns Have Spoken,&quot; relates the actual attack that started the Civil War.In many regards this first volume by William C. Davis and the Editors of Time-Life Books is the most disappointing one in the series, simply because it necessarily glosses over the events leading to Fort Sumter. Trying to deal with Lincoln in a single chapter seems quite inadequate to the task, but then it is probably safe to assume the Civil War buffs reading these books know plenty on that particular subject.

Rudd chronicles education up to that time, with particular emphasis on the 1930s. Rudd is both scholar and reporter. He quotes from many sources and personalities. There's a long index and many footnotes.I've been reading a lot of books about education published in the 1950's, all good, but I have to say this may be the best of the lot, especially for someone who has never heard of John Dewey or John Kilpatrick, and wants to know the whole story about what the heck went wrong.Along the way, Rudd gives you many wonderful quotations. In 1957, Harold Macmillan, British Prime Minister, said, \\"There is no difference between Socialism and Communism except this: Socialism is soft, Communism is hard; Socialism is pink, Communism is red. Socialism gets you down bit by bit by a kind of anesthetic process. It might be called mercy-killing. Communism just knocks you in the head.\\"Bending The Twig exposes and explains the anesthetic propaganda used by the various far-left educators. It's so depressing. These extremists regarded Socialism as the goal; education was only a means. My own summation is that almost everything said by the National Education Association, Teachers College, John Dewey, George Counts and the rest of this gang is happy horse manure.These people wanted so desperately to be in charge of the society. They were willing to destroy one of humanity's great achievements in order to insert their squalid little schemes, schemes which usually have tragic consequences, as in Russia, Italy, China, Germany and so on, wherever you have extremely centralized authority. Everything in the American tradition was designed to restrict centralized authority. But these loons at Teachers College, etc. devoted their careers to using the schools to undermine that tradition and that freedom. Such is the sad story this book tells.Rudd makes a distinction between the \\"soft progressives\\" such as John Dewey and the \\"hard progressives,\\" such as Counts and Harold Rugg. Here's another way of summing up the whole panorama. Before 1920, we produced our own loons. These people were, in effect, European socialists (most of them studied there) and they were happily undermining American education before Lenin and Stalin completed the revolution in Russia. After 1920, agents of influence, spies, and Alger-Hiss-type agents were infiltrating the society at every level. The Communists installed Alger Hiss as Roosevelt\`s right-hand man. Wouldn't it be reasonable to conclude the Communists dictated leaders throughout the Education Establishment as well? All the activities that Rudd describes in this book, the typical American viewed as a kind of liberal craziness. Fair enough. But it's perhaps more helpful to understand them as psychological warfare waged by the Russians with great skill and exuberance.Our top educators did, and are still doing, things to pubic education that are the intellectual equivalent of using children in unannnounced drug experiments.Books by Bestor, Flesch, Rudd and many others slowed the success of progressive education. By 1960 the name was in disrepute. But the ideas merely went underground and came back in more subtle forms (Constructivism, Cooperative Learning, and many others). Now, all the glorious nonsense may be resurfacing as Common Core Standards, yet another try at letting experts make fancy promises while ensuring that kids graduate from high school not knowing very much."},{"Title":"Bending the twig;: The revolution in education and its effect on our children","review":"I can't add anything beyond the other review, I would just like to state this is one of the most important & best books I have ever read."},{"Title":"Join the Excellers League: A Complete Course on Microsoft Excel (Visual Training series)","review":"My company use to pay for Excel training classes, until I bought this CD.Now we just give the CD to new employees and they watch it on their own.If an employee has any questions about Excel they just pop in the CD.I really like the questions throughout the course, that test the employee's progress."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Let me first say that there is much to love here. Truly! The first fifty or so pages felt interminable, but once past that point the book becomes a veritable page turner.Eliot crafts a fascinating, first-rate historical fiction plot based in Florence, Italy, from the death of Lorenzo de' Medici (in 1492), through the time of Savonarola's influence, and culminating in an epilogue placed in 1509. In the midst of this tumultuous social situation is placed our heroine, Romola. The daughter of a scholar, Romola herself is very well educated for a woman of her time. This novel follows Romola through six complex post-de'Medici years of Florentine politics, further inflamed by the preachings of Savonarola, a Dominican friar. As the plot swells in complexity, the gentle woman transitions from being her father's daughter, to her husband's wife, to a woman meeting life head on with a dignity of her own merit. Possessed of a fast moving, labyrinthine plot, this novel, despite its length of just over 600 pages, keeps up a taut pace until the very end.As might be expected in a novel named after a character, this one, despite the enticing plot, is very rooted in its performers. Romola is a central figure, but by no means the only one. Eliot pulls some of her players direct from the history books and some from her imagination, but each and every one of them feels so genuine that it is difficult to know which really lived and breathed and which only ever lived within her pages. This is the type of book that has you googling purely imaginative personages-because they are portrayed with such authenticity.Florence of the late fifteenth century is very well depicted: the pageantry of her holidays (including a fantastic description of Savonarola's Bonfire of the Vanities); the dress, habits, and occupations of her various classes; and the architectural details of her stone edifices. As you wander the streets with the novel's inhabitants you are drawn into her neighborhoods, with their chaos, aromas, and idiosyncrasies.So why a relatively low three star rating? Because the prose is so dense that it left me wallowing somewhere between philosophy text and nineteenth century history tome. For some reason, I had to work exceptionally hard to remain focused on reading the words themselves and concentrate with that little bit of extra grey matter to wrap my mind around what exactly was being expressed. Was it worth it? Well, yes, as my clear admiration for the book's merits shows; however, I can not say that I \\"really liked\\" (four stars) or \\"loved\\" (five stars) a book which required so much effort. So, three stars, a simple \\"liked\\" verdict, it is for this work. This is definitely not a book for someone unused to literature of the Victorian era, as, in my opinion, this novel is some of the least accessible writing from that time frame."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"In my opinion, this is a must-read for anyone who has ever been to Florence. I read it while there for three months on a study abroad program and loved it. If I had never been there or had no knowledge of the history of the city, the novel wouldn't have been as interesting. It is hard to believe that it was written in the 19th century and not during the renaissance as an eye witness account. Elliot's knowledege of Florentine history and her use of real historical characters in the text is amazing. The story starts off very slow at first but then sucks you in. It seems to keep getting more and more dramatic and then concludes with a very satisfying ending."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"&#34;Romola&#34; is a good novel by a great and supremely intelligent novelist. The Renaissance Italy background is fascinating. Though not Eliot's greatest novel - that would be &#34;Middlemarch&#34; - &#34;Romola&#34; is extremely rewarding."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Romola was engrossing and, of course, very well-written. I'm even inspired to find out more about a historical period that's not really one of my favorites."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Romola was published in \\"The Cornhill\\" magazine in 14 parts from July 1862 to August 1863. It is George Eliot's foray into the realm of historical fiction made popular by the earlier novels of Sir Walter Scott. Eliot is a great English novelists known for such classics as Adam Bede; The Mill on the Floss; Felix Holt; Middlemarch (her masterpiece), Scenes of Clerical Life and Daniel Deronda. Romala is the only novel she wrote not set in the British Isles. It is her least popular and known work though she considered it her favorite. The book is lengthy and intricate in its recounting of the life of the title heroine Romola in fifteenth century Florence. The major players are:Romola Bardi: She is the idealistic daughter of a blind scholar Bardo de Bardi. She falls in love with the young and amoral Tito Melema a Greek who has arrived in Florence. Tito is the assistant to Bardo in the latter's classical studies. Tito sells the precious classical library of Bardo. Tito's selfish character is revealed to Romola who leaves Florence for a short time in utter despair. Savanarola persuades her to return to the city.Tito also betrays Bernado del Nero one of five men executed by the government. Bernado is the godfather of Romola and dies before her eyes in a gruesome beheading. Romola learns that Tito was instrumental in the arrest and death of del Nero. Romola becomes a supporter of Savanrola as she ministers to the poor. She also learns of his adultery.Tito Melema: Handsome husband of Romola who has a second family with the poor girl Tess. (she has two children by Tito). Tito is a schemer and adulterer who is ambitious for fame and fortune. He has stolen money and abandoned to slavery his stepfather Baldassarri. Baldassarri tracks down Tito with murder in his heart. Baldassari reveals the deep and sinful past of Tito to Romola.I do not agree that the characters in this novel are flat. Villains like Tito and Baldassarri are well drawn as is Romala. Eliot was the first great psychological novelist in English influencing such writers as Henry James.Savanorola is the real life religious reformer who seeks to clean up decadent Florence. He is famous for the bonfire of vanities in which Florentines threw away many luxury items in an effort to become more faithful to God. The reformer was burned at the stake in 1498.The City of Florence is a character during these turbulent times. Pietro de Medic the ruler of Florence has died and the French army under Charles VIII has become an occupying power. The League of Venice declares war on the French and Florentines. Hunger and plague run rampant through the streets of Florence on the Arno River. The political machinations are hard to follow. Machiavelli the real life author of \\"The Prince\\": appears in the book.The novel concludes with the death of Savanarola and Tito. Romola has taken Tessa and her two children under her wing. Romola, like George Eliot, is a kind woman who learns the secret to life is helping others as a good samaritan. She has emerged from her personal tragedies to become a wonderful woman. The Penguin edition contains a definition of many Italian words and phrases used in Romola, textual emendations made to the manuscript and an incisive and helpful introduction. Penguins are the best paperbacks for classics!George Eliot and her lover George Henry Lewes did a great deal of on site research in Florence; read deeply in the politics of the Renaissance era and put that knowledge to work in Romola. The book is a classic which tells a fascinating story. Like all of George Eliot's works it is a gem in the literary crown of the author. Romola is hard reading but the story is compellinig and it is worth your time and effort."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Romola is constantly called Eliot's weakest novel, with even serious critics reluctant to praise it. However, it was seen in the 19th century as Eliot's masterpiece. Some of the blame for the novel going out of fashion must rest with F.R. Leavis who said that &quot;few will want to read Romola a second time, and few can ever have got through it once without some groans.&quot; If Leavis, viewed as one of the great literary minds, thinks this, then more average readers like us are bound to be put off.True, the start of Romola is bogged down in detail, but it is introduced by a wonderful, stirring and majestic 'Proem' which sees the Angel of the Dawn sweeping across the Earth and loftily states how humanity is the same now as it was when Romola is set. After this, the notes are best ignored - consult them separately, and concentrate on getting into the book. It is a stirring and sometimes hard read, and moves one with awe at what Eliot has created - you really feel you are experiencing Florence in the 15th century. There is one scene that stands out for me - the haunting and almost surreal episode where Romola drifts by boat to an apparent coastal haven. Images of peace and life are reversed disturbingly.So ignore Leavis and the dissenters. If you've read another Eliot, you'll like it. If you haven't, maybe start with something else, but come back, for it's a rewarding read"},{"Title":"Romola","review":"George Eliot spent two years preparing &quot;Romola&quot;, and the result is a rich, densely detailed &quot;Tale of the Renaissance&quot;. Never a facile writer, here she is concerned with one of the most intellectually challenging (not to mention politically complicated) periods in history; and she paints the panoply and power struggles as a background for the personal tragedy which is the novel's crux. While not an &quot;easy read&quot; in the Sir Walter Scott sense, &quot;Romola&quot; presents in sumptous detail the banquets, the festivities, and the famous bonfire of vanities that one associates with late 15th Century Florence.But from a purely literary viewpoint, the most important thing about the book is its delineation of Tito Melema, the young man who in the opening chapters is the story's hero, but slowly, irrevocably becomes its villain. Neither Sir Walter nor Charles Dickens has psychological insight (in the modern sense) as sharp as George Eliot's, and this study of a fictional character's downfall is one of the most stunning depictions of corruption in English literature. That he is the husband of the heroine, a sensitive, finely sensual woman, makes the tragedy all the more poignant. Scenes involving historical characters (including Savonarola and Machiavelli) tend to be a little stiff in costume movie style. Oh, and because the story takes place in the 1490's, one must imagine the Piazza della Signoria without Michelangelo and Cellini. This must really have frustrated a connoisseur like George Eliot."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Given the majority of Eliot readers begin with Middlemarch, I found myself in the unique position of not only beginning with Romola, but also on a subject that I find most interesting. That of Renaissance Italy. Beginning at the death of the great Lorenzo di Medici in '92 I read this great novel twice. Once quickly as any other Twenty-First century paperback; the second, slowly, with more respect for the intellectual scope within the pages.After the first attempt I was mildly disappointed. I came away with no true sense of the whole that is fifteenth century Florence and a bewilderment at the inconsistent central characterisation of Tito Melema and his golden-haired wife, Romola. The supporting actors were brilliant, from Fra Girolama's fantatical Catholicism to Bratti's salesmanship. But I was left disappointed, believing in the superficality of Tito, the maddening naivety of Tessa, and the almost puritanical martyrdom of Romola.So I re-read it. Slowly.It is now extremely clear why this great work of english literature is, as Eliot herself puts it, a \\"book of mine which I more thoroughly feel that I swear by every sentence as having been written with my best blood\\".Each scene is mesmerically depicted, the infintesimal attention to details and Eliot's total control of her subject matter shines through.Renaissance Florence wasn't so well depicted by its contemporaries.From Tito's waking at the Loggia de' Cerchi to his final fall at the Ponte Vecchio his character moves through a full range as you would expect from a man in his early twenties. His child-like mesmerism coupled with his Greek tutorage gives rise to a cherubic man whom Florence loves. His fatal flaw is his desire for love and a single terrible lie he gives that, like Murphy's Law, evolves into a a stigma that alters his very persona. What is all the more damaging is that you truly believe he is unaware of the pain he causes. He is truly egocentric, in an almost blameless way. For Romola, you cold argue the opposite. Indeed she is potentially more culpable. Her fierce intellectualism is offset by a descent into a world of religious supersition, a world where religion is used as a political tool. Throughout she has the knowledge of where her actions will take her and a terrible sense of duty and restrains her. From the beginning, with the story we hear so often of Tito's escape from drowning, to his final near drowning at the hands of the mob, to his strangulation by his father there is a certain bitter justice until all that he leaves is his proud and world-scarred wife Romola and the innocence that he preserved with Tessa. Tito's move from innocent 'hero' to startled villain is an excerise in human failings. Yet it is not a sufficient single human tragedy, as Eliot says, \\"Florence was busy with greater affairs, and the preparation of a deeper tragedy\\".In many respects \`Romola' is Eliot's King Lear. The parallels are many, including Baldessare's depiction. There is no Edgar, nor Edmund but the Fool is here in many guises. In taking one of Shakespeare's finest themes, Eliot has given true life to fifteenth century Florence and it is, perhaps, best encapsulated by Romola's final statement to Tessa's son, Lillo:\\"There was a man to whom I was very near... who made almost everyone fond of him, for he ws young, and clever, and beautiful...I believe, when I first knew him, he never thought of anything cruel or base. But because he tried to slip away from everything that was unpleasant, and cared for nothing else so much as his own safety, he came at last to commit some of the basest deeds - such as make men infamous.\\"So, Eliot's \`Romola'. Read it, delight in it because it truly is, as the author can rightly claim, one of the finest works in english literature."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Yes, it bristles with Glossaries and Appendices and Notes like so much barbed wire. (And if you actually read the Penguin editor's introduction, it's a sure thing you'll never read the novel: she makes it sound like about as much fun as chewing rocks.) But don't let all that deter you. You may have some rough going at the beginning, mostly because Latin and Greek scholarship is so important to the plot. Use the notes and they'll enhance your enjoyment of the story, but ignore them and you're still in for a thrilling tale gorgeously told. Tito Melema is one of the great characters in fiction, and he's someone we all know: a thoroughly despicable human being who has no idea he's anything but a nice guy. Eliot has wrought a dreamy and hair-raising hybrid of fiction and history, infused with her own astonishing insight and complicated sympathy and delivered in her matchless prose. I loved this book."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Romola was a difficult book to read. If I did not happen to be on a business trip that left me long hours on seemingly endless international flights, I doubt if I would have had the perseverance to stick with it. In writing this book, Eliot spent six months in exhaustive research on fifteenth century Florence, and she is going to give it all to you whether you like it or not. This made it difficult to enjoy because I was constantly going to the back of the book get the translation of Italian and Latin phrases, reference to obscure historical characters, and other minutia which would only be clear to someone with a doctorate in Italian history. I was frustrated by this throughout the book. Having said that, the book is worth the wade! As always Eliot's writing is a pure joy to read. Some of her description is so beautiful that I have to step back in wonder that someone can create narrative so rich and inviting. Her characters are complex, intriguing and well developed. First, Tito was the most original antihero I have run across in years: a man who avoids unpleasantness and discomfort to the point that he betrays anyone he has ever loved while intending only to take the easy way in all his dealings. Romola is a women deeply learned, but raised only by her aging father and the classics, is unprepared for what the fates have brought her: love, duplicity, and purpose. And lastly, Savonarola, Tito's opposite: a religious visionary who strives to lead Florence to a new order, and is willing to give up church, state---anything but his place in the order, to see his prophecy fulfilled. This is Eliot's favorite book. I can see why."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Funny how Eliot's least-loved novel today was the author's personal favorite and her best seller during her lifetime. How did it slide into relative obscurity? Partly because Eliot's acknowleged forte is her depiction of rural life in Victorian England, whereas this novel is set in a large Italian city (Florence) during the Renasaissance. Also, the novel does bog down a bit in its own scholarliness, as nearly every reviewer has mentioned. Still, the innumerable references to prominent Florentines can be glossed over without losing much. As for the urban setting, Eliot's Florence is every bit as vivid as Dickens' London, or Dostoevsky's St. Petersburg. And, of course, every page is filled with Eliot's trademark wisdom.For anyone who cares about great books, all seven of Eliot's novels are absolutely mandatory. So, by all means start with \\"Adam Bede\\" or \\"Middlemarch\\", but don't neglect \\"Romola.\\"A word about the Konneman edition: I love the compact format (It fits easily into a briefcase or purse), the lovely cover art and the high-quality cloth binding. Be advised, however, that it is loaded with typos, some of them hilarious. It's still a good buy, however."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"When one starts reading a Victorian novelist, one prepares before hand to face a certain amount of wooden, heavy-handed moralizing, as every great narrative of the epoch is fraught with the opposition between the calls of pleasure and the calls of duty, between seeking for one's private advantage and sticking to one's role, with the writer making the latter to win overwhelming. This novel is no different, in that it's the dutiful Romola that has the upper hand over her nice and debauched husband Tito Melena in the end. However, the novel being set in late Renaissance Italy- a country with which George Eliot had an enduring love affair - it captures the atmosphere of the time and place in such a beautiful way that this enormous, throughly reserched historical novel has such a flowing, luxurious style that takes an almost liquid quality, like a fresh, transparent scream flowing along a summer Mediterranean landscape. Also, in the person of Savonarola, Eliot menaged to introduce the figure of the idealist turned evil through his attachment to his call. In short: a gorgeous novel. Loved it!"},{"Title":"Romola","review":"I loved this book! Set in fifteenth century Florence, Romola explores the deep recesses of the soul. Renaissance Italy with its political/religious conflicts, intellectual, pursuits, artistry and pageantry are all beautifully protrayed throughout Eliot's magnificent love story. Deceit, greed and selfishness are artfully displayed against the purity of a nobel soul which knows no compromise. Romola, the book's main character is a study in virtue, while Tito her husband has but the veneer of goodness. Tito falls forever because of one lie. This is a book to read slowly and savor."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"A book with unforgettable characters - in Tito who demonstrates the degeneration of the soul in the pursuit of money and an ideal character in Romola who personifies duty. This book characterizes George Eliot's concept of truth. Truth according to her is not only what is real, but also, what should be. Another character who fascinates is Savonarola - we see him as a human being, with strengths and weaknesses. And Eliot teaches us to be like Romola - to appreciate the good in a human being instead of damming him completely. Along with true to life characters, ideal characters,historical characters, also a superb depiction of rennaisance Italy. Whatever critics say about 'Romola' being the least readable of all Eliot's books, it remains her most idealistic work which makes one feel deeply, and want to emulate the good. Hence, a great classic which is enjoyable and which sets you thinking about your own inadequacies."},{"Title":"Romola","review":"Romola is a dense, compelling historical novel by the master of English fiction, George Eliot. Although this book is a bit slow going at first, the true-to-life characters and the towering themes make the reader's efforts more than worthwhile. Like the great film &quot;Kiss of the Spider Woman,&quot; this novel deals with love, betrayal, parenthood, revenge, greed, spirituality, religion, and deceit, in ways that seem remarkably modern. I read it three times!"},{"Title":"Techniques of differential topology in relativity (Regional conference series in applied mathematics)","review":"First published in 1972, it is remarkable that this book is still in print, and this fact attests to the current interest in singularity theorems in general relativity. The author of course is well-known for his contributions in this area, and he has written these series of lectures primarily for the mathematician whose speciality is differential topology, and who is curious about its applications to general relativity. The author thinks in pictures in this book, and so it is well-suited for the physicist reader also. Detailed proofs are omitted for the singularity theorems, but references are given. Much work and discussion has taken place since this book was published, but it can still serve as an introduction to modern developments.Section 1 sets the mathematical definitions and conventions used in the later sections. Spacetime is defined as a real, four-dimensional connected smooth Hausdorff manifold on which is defined a global smooth nondegenerate Lorentzian metric. In addition, it is assumed that spacetime is time-orientable, which is not too big a restriction since as the author remarks, one can always find a time-orientable twofold covering of spacetime. Jacobi fields are introduced also, with the goal of eventually using them to study maximal geodesics. Known to physicists as the equation of geodesic deviation, the author derives the Jacobi equation, the solutions of which form an 8-dimensional vector space of Jacobi fields.In section 2, the author gives definitions that allow one to discuss causality and time ordering for curves on spacetime. Special types of non-smooth curves, called trips, which (piecewise) are future-oriented timelike geodesics, are used to define a chronological ordering of points on spacetime. Causal trips are more restrictive, in that the curves are causal geodesics. The chronological ordering is shown to imply causal ordering, and both orderings are shown to be transitive. This allows the partitioning of spacetime into chronological future and past, and causal future and past. The topological properties of these sets are studied, and conditions are given in terms of null geodesics and timelike curves for causal and chronological ordering.The next section considers the properties of future and past sets. A future (past) set is one that is equal to the chronological future (past) of some set in spacetime. In addition, subsets of spacetime that do not contain any points that are chronologically related, called achronal sets, and subsets that are boundaries are considered. It is shown that spacetime can be written as the disjoint union of an achronal boundary, and a unique past and future set. It is also shown that achronal boundaries are fairly well-behaved objects: they are 3-dimensional topological manifolds.In order to rule out &quot;pathological&quot; spacetimes that contain closed trips or closed causal trips, the author studies global causality conditions in section 4. Thus the author defines a spacetime to be future (past)-distinguishing if for any two distinct points, their chronological future (past) sets are unequal. He then defines a spacetime to be strongly causal if every point in it has arbitrarily small causally convex neighborhoods (causally convex meaning that it does not intersect a trip in a disconnected set). The author offers examples to show that local violations of causal convexity can be avoided, and so violations of strong causality at a point are due to the global structure of the spacetime. He shows that a spacetime which is strongly causal at a point must be future and past distinguishing at the point. The converse is not true, and the author gives a counterexample. The Alexandrov topology for spacetime is defined in this section also. Given two points in spacetime, a basis for the open sets for this topology is given by the intersection of the chronological future set of one point with the chronological past set of the other. The author shows that spacetime is strongly causal iff the Alexandrov topology equals the manifold topology iff the Alexandrov topology is Hausdorff. Defining a vicious point to be one through which passes a closed trip, and concentrating attention on the set of all vicious points, the author gives five conditions for strong causality to fail at a point, these conditions involving the boundary of the set of vicious points. He concludes the section by showing that if spacetime is compact, it must contain a closed trip.Motivated by the notion of an initial value set from physicial considerations, the author defines in the next section domains of dependence for achronal subsets of spacetime, along with the future, past, or total Cauchy horizon for closed achronal subsets. These are related to the familiar Cauchy hypersurfaces from the theory of partial differential equations. It is proven that spacetime is globally hyperbolic iff a Cauchy hypersurface exists for it.The space of causal curves is defined in the next section, on which is defined the C0-topology. It is shown to be compact under certain conditions. The study of geodesics as curves of maximal length is taken up in section 7. This entails matters of a more purely differential geometric point of view. The important inequality involving the Ricci curvature and an element of volume (or area) on a hypersurface. The author discusses briefly the importance of this inequality in the singularity theorems.The last section is (unfortunately) very brief, wherein the author discusses the applications of the preceeding sections in singularity theorems. Referring to S. Hawking for the full proof, he gives a general argument and discusses the conditions as to when spacetime will have a past-endless geodesic in M which has a finite length. He defines a future-trapped set as one where the &quot;future horizon&quot; of the set, defined as the difference between its causal and chronological future, is compact. He then outlines a proof of the result that no spacetime can have the property that it contain no closed trips, have endless causal geodesics containing a pair of conjugate points, and contain a future-trapped set."},{"Title":"Rundown","review":"I enjoyed the beginning of the book and was intrigued by Jennifer's staged crime. She seems to gain the attention she wanted but guilt soon consumes her. Most of the book after that seems to drag on. Several supporting characters offer sympathy to Jennifer, but not much happens to let us get to know these people very well. I agree with Horn Book's review that the characters are too sketchily drawn to care much about them or their motivations. I was hoping for a more emotionally charged novel but it seems to go flat in the middle and gets annoying at the end. What should have been an emotionally suspenseful ending just didn't tug at my emotions. I give Rundown three stars for it's strong beginning and interesting conflict, but it it got tired quickly. Needs Wheaties."},{"Title":"Rundown","review":"The writer is really out of touch with what it means to be a girl. Many unimaginative writers fall in the trap of using rape as a plot device because they can't imagine anything more dramatic happening in a girl's life. In this case, it's a false rape. I can't think of anything less creative nor less realistic. It's ironic that the cover depicts a healthy, strong, &amp; athletic girl when the book depicts girls as needy, weak, &amp; selfish."},{"Title":"Rundown","review":"There were times when I really loved this book, and there were other where it was just too boring. Rundown is an ok book with a great premise behind it. If more if it appealed to me, I'd rate it higher. Also, the ending was terrible. Its still something that doesn't set right with me. It makes no sense.This one had the chance to be amazing...but it just didn't work out."},{"Title":"Rundown","review":"This is one of the most poorly written books I have ever read. The language is simply awful! Meaningless similes, a barrage of pointless details, downright lame analogies, and a web of subplots that are never fully (or even partially) developed. One of the first rules of writing is to create a believable character, and I had a hard time believing that Jennifer would do anything but sulk and get in slapping matches with her equally 2-dimensional sister. She seemed incapable of having any emotion deeper than &quot;feeling like a rhino.&quot; The ending is completely unsupported by the rest of the book, and just comes off as nowhere else to go. I thought the premise was fantastic--a fresh approach to the subject of rape in a generation where one word from a disgruntled kid is enough to wreck someone's life forever, but as a previous reviewer said, it runs out of steam before it even has a chance to take off."},{"Title":"Rundown","review":"The beginning of this book was very well written in my opinion, as were the descriptions used throughout the story. However, I wasn't impressed with the character development throughout the story. The end was abrupt, and really turned me off. I probably would try reading some of the author's other books, but I just didn't care for this one."},{"Title":"Rundown","review":"The concept of this book was interesting, and the beginning of it had potential, but towards the middle and definitely the end were disappointing.

Nothing more need be said."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"I think this is a good book for fans of Vonnegut, but first-time readers of his works may find it too esoteric. Bluebeard has a good story but makes liberal use of the common Vonnegut time lapse (with the main charcter's story shifting between his past and present as he writes his memoirs). In a nutshell, the protagonist, Rabo, is a contemporary artist of great skill, yet lacking in soul and expression. He chronicles his unfortunate life as an apprentice of a renowned painter, son of an ethnic armenian, soldier, and failed husband. There is also a loose connection to the burgeoning art scene of NYC in the 20th century. Unlike the author's other novels, there is no science fiction involved in this one.Overall the book pops pithy observations on American culture and highlights the need for love and acceptance to be truly creative. As Rabo comes to terms with his misteps, we learn about the great mystery of life, i.e. there is no mystery; a very Vonnegut conclusion. Recommended for fans. For those who want to get into Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. start with Slaughterhouse Five or Player Piano."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"This really is one of the best Vonnegut books I have read. I loved the simplistic story and straightforward plot, much easier to understand than Vonnegut's other books and the characters are more like real people making them much easier to relate to than a soldier who travels through time used in one of his other books for example. Mr. Vonnegut even has some realistic romance in this story, which makes it quite refreshing. Most of his other books portray romance as a human folly that always ends in tragedy (I can see his point but it's best to enjoy nice things while they last). I would highly recomend this book for anyone who loves Vonnegut or anyone who has hope for the human condition."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"I am a fan of Vonnegut. This novel brought wonderful feelings of happiness, connection, desire to participate, be included into the circle of friendship, fragile and pure world of poor bohemian artists. I thing this book is the best book that he wrote. BLUEBEARD is a ready, well-defined movie scenario or a play for the theater. The characters touched my heart. I love them all, especially, Rabo. In short, when I feel down or sad I take Vonnegut's BLUEBEARD and read it. My spirit rises from sadness to the joyful non-reality of Rabo's clear, captivating world of humanity and art of living."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's works tend to be better in idea than execution; &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot;, for example, derails several good ideas due to stylistic overload. This, I realize, is what makes Vonnegut's works so popular across a wide demographic -- the ideas, oftentimes incredibly profound, are always buried under style and his patented humor. &quot;Bluebeard&quot;, his best novel by a very long stretch, is also his most stylistically straightforward work. The story details the events in the life of Rabo Karabekien from son of immigrants to recognized artist to &quot;failure&quot;. The story itself is generally interesting and always approachable but the ongoing commentary that Vonnegut makes regarding perspectives on creativity and its processes is what makes &quot;Bluebeard&quot; such a rewarding experience. This is the kind of book that alters perceptions of what would be otherwise banal experiences - watching a bad movie, for example. Vonnegut never gets too clever with the material because, I believe, he realized the material really speaks well for itself. Or perhaps it doesn't really matter. In any event, this is Vonnegut's most satisfying novel in every way a novel may be satisfying."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"Did you think Kurt Vonnegut would write about the saving power of love?

It is my absolute favorite Vonnegut novel. I like to read it when I find my interest in writing waning, not because it contains passages to instruct the frustrated writer (although it does, it does), but because it gives me hope that one day I too will find that soul that so far, for so long, has eluded my writing.

Do I have talent? Who really knows? Who really cares?Here he answers, while telling the life story of abstract expressionist Rabo Karabekian: An artist must try to both define and uplift humanity. Start with whatever God gives, then never stop learning or trying, even after public failure. Somebody out there recognizes art when it bites them on the butt, and, finally, the artist cares. That's what he or she does.Yes, the world will put a dollar value on it, call the creator a genius, a fraud or a clown.

His story is definitely fascinating and so is his potato barn.The book reads fairly fast, so saying I was a bit bored in the middle isn't that fair, because most books and movies have its boring parts. Good news is the boring parts goes by fairly fast.Wouldn't recommend this as a first Vonnegut read, but it's definitely a must read for Vonnegut fans.

Although 'Bluebeard' is not one of his most immediatly interesting books, it is definantly one of his more satisfying. Unlike 'Breakfast of Champions', 'Siren's of Titan', and 'Slaughterhouse Five', 'Bluebeard', works more on character development, rather than using speratic Sci Fi stories from the likes of Kilgore Trout to convey Vonnegut's often hilarious mindset.This time around Vonnegut uses an autiobiographical setting, much like 'Mother Night', to delve into the human condition. Although 'Mother Night' seems to be more satisfying, in whole, 'Bluebeard' is a much more impressive outing. As you can tell, I've read most of his works.

Bluebeard is deffinatly in the same ranks with Cat's cradle and Breakfast of Champions"},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"The novel Bluebeard by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. is a fictional autobiography, written by an old, fictional painter who was a close friend of Jackson Pollock. Through its autobiographical style and expansive subject matter, this novel tells the story of an old man's memories and regrets against the backdrop of American history and the Abstract Expressionist art movement.The novel is standard Vonnegut, full of absurdity and wackiness, delivered in a relaxed and amused tone. This novel is intended for those interested in detached reminiscences, as the novel is fractured into pieces of the life of its main character, Rabo Karabekian, an Armenian illustrator. It details his adventures from childhood through World War II and his postwar involvement in a burgeoning art movement. Through the whimsical style and subject matter ranging from young adult novels to Italian architecture, Vonnegut creates a novel that becomes satisfying as the reader grows accustomed to Rabo's constant failures and waits for him to finally succeed.Bluebeard is a minor novel in the Kurt Vonnegut's oeuvre. The character of Rabo Karabekian is taken from his previous novel, The Breakfast of Champions, in which Karabekian is a minor character, with a wildly different demeanor than in Bluebeard.Among Vonnegut's less recognized novels, however, it stands out, mainly because of Karabekian's attitude about life and the way in which he, a painter, uses words to describe the events of his life. From the author of Cat's Cradle and Slaughterhouse-Five, among others, Bluebeard is not as remarkable an achievement as it otherwise might be. However, taken on its own, the standards of excellence are quite different, as Vonnegut puts his own spin on new material, which is Abstract Expressionism.The novel jumps around quite often, so it is difficult to establish the plot progression; in fact, whole decades of Rabo's life are barely touched upon. As Rabo says, his autobiography \\"turns out to be a diary of this past troubled summer, too\\" (1). It is a compilation of memories, loosely strung together through the narrative of his life. The basic events include Rabo's early life in \\"San Ignacio, California\\" (1), where his father is an Armenian immigrant cobbler; it continues during his apprenticeship to \\"one of the most popular American artists in history\\" (252), Dan Gregory, during the 1930s. After leaving Gregory, he serves in World War II in \\"a platoon of Army Engineers, curiously enough artists of one sort or another\\" (1) and, after returning home, gets involved in \\"the postwar movie\\" (223) by marrying his nurse and having two children. He then becomes a painter along with his friend, Terry Kitchen, and befriends Jackson Pollock and the other adherents to Abstract Expressionism. While he tells the reader the events of his life, he also recounts the events of the summer during which he writes his autobiography, when novelist Circe Berman comes to stay and tries to find out the secret that Rabo has hidden in the potato barn where he once worked.The novel is exceedingly well-written, which is understandable since it is from late in Vonnegut's career, after he had thirty years to perfect his craft. A number of elements contribute to the high quality of writing in Bluebeard, including the use of style, structure, and themes.Vonnegut's style heightens the feeling of reality found in Blueheard, by his use of literary tools such as like flashbacks, foreshadowing, and the \\"trivial footnote[s]\\" (153) interspersed throughout the narrative. As the timeline of Rabo's life unfolds, it almost feels like a sequence of real events, because it is packed with details, from Dan Gregory's cook who \\"was a hermaphrodite\\" (153) to \\"Kim Bum Suk\\" (227), the South Korean author of the fictional book Private Art Treasures of Tuscany. Rabo's character is developed through his narration until the reader feels as if he or she can almost see the mansion where he is working.Typical of Vonnegut, the structure skips between past and present, incorporating incidental anecdotes. Unlike other similar novels like Slaughterhouse-Five and Deadeye Dick, however, a full narrative is developed parallel to the autobiography. It really is a \\"diary\\" (1), and Rabo jokes that \\"perhaps [he] should have scattered milestones along the route this book has taken\\" (212). With frequent \\"bulletin[s] from the present\\" (257), he details how Circe Berman is forcing herself into his life and controlling his actions, and how the novelist Paul Slazinger, who lives in the mansion, is ruining his own life. The events of that summer are mixed in with the events of Rabo's whole life, and the reader gets a feeling of the circumstances under which he is writing this autobiography. The present becomes as important as the past, as Rabo ties up the loose ends of his life.The themes explored in Bluebeard range from the connections between war and gender to those between art and suicide. War, one of Vonnegut's favorite topics, is explored in depth when Rabo, like Vonnegut himself, ends up as a prisoner of war in Dresden, Germany. Like the protagonist of Slaughterhouse-Five, he emerges into postwar Germany, where all the prisoners are released. His old friend, the Countess Portomaggiore, believes that war is a useless creation of men. Her lover, Dan Gregory, however, fights for the Italian army in World War II, and believes that \\"no woman could succeed in the arts or sciences or politics or industry\\" (152). Being the autobiography of an artist, it also explores the purposes of art, and Rabo believes that, as in Abstract Expressionism, paintings should be \\"about nothing but themselves\\" (254).Through his exploration of these ideas, Vonnegut makes Bluebeard more than just a \\"hoax autobiography,\\" it becomes a comment on his life and the state of the world, as seen through the eyes of a man who believes he is a \\"floparroo\\" (258), and as such, it is a worthwhile read."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"Bluebeard harbors two themes: good old-fashioned appreciation of the USA and the human spirit's longing to achieve something great in life. The cowboy boot symbolizes one character's achievement, the secret in the potato barn represents the hero's.Rabo Karbekian (from BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS) is an aging artist writing his autobiography. He recounts his parents' stories -- their immigration from Armenia. His mother adaptated to life in America, his father didn't.Vonnegut moves his story skillfully between past and present. Karabekian's work -- his paintings -- have disintegrated into dust of the floors of galleries and private collections worldwide (did A. Wyeth's work inspire this story?) but he now owns the largest collection \\"of abstract expressions paintings still in private hands.\\" A widower, he has adopted two friends, a has-been novelist and Circe, a widow he finds on the beach. Circe inspires him to write his autobiography and it is to her that he reveals the secret in the potato barn (which, in his mind likens him to the Bluebeard of fairy tale fame).The reader will enjoy this book on several political and philosophical levels in addition to enjoying a fine story. It is tender yet sometimes loveless, a blending of wisdom and insanity.Vonnegut's writing is of the Hemingway/Dick-and-Jane style -- short, sharp and exasperating. He writes like someone who has no appreciation for the English language and wants to use as little of it as possible. That's stylish today, but vexing to someone who likes to read. I find his author intrusion distracting and annoying but his characters enchant, his wit amuses and his observations stimulate. BLUEBEARD's wit, substance and style are pure Vonnegut."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"I enjoyed Bluebeard and it is one of my favorite Vunnegut books. Rabo K goes through life as an abstract artist, yet his greatest work ends up being a realistic painting of an image from his time in the war. This paining ends up transforming his life, bringing him to a happy period in life that he had so longed for in his other persuits. Any Vonnegut fan should read this book."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"From the author's footnote: \\"May I say, too, that much of what I put in this book was inspired by the grotesque prices paid for works of art during the past century. Tremendous concentration of paper wealth have made it possible for a few persons or institutions to endow certain sorts of human playfulness with inappropriate and hence distressing seriousness. I think not only of the mudpies of art, but of children's games as well--running, jumping, catching, throwing. Or dancing. Or singing songs.\\"I like that aspect of Vonnegut's personality. That contempt for the religioso self-congratulatoriness of artsy-fartsy types. Unfortunately, Vonnegut is contradictory on the subject and has spent just as much time engaging in just the sort of artsy-farty self-congratulation that drives me up the goddam wall. And that's one good reason for hating BLUEBEARD: all the characters are artsy-fartsy types. Terry Kitchen says: \\"Something's just got to be worth doing! And painting is one of the few things I haven't tried.\\"It's Terry Kitchen who delivers the only decent joke in the whole book. Rabo tells Terry about Rabo's 3 hours of ideal lovemaking with Marilee, and how contentedly adrift in the cosmos those 3 hours made Rabo feel.Terry replies: \\"You were experiencing a non-epiphany ... A concept of my own invention ... The trouble with God isn't that He so seldom makes Himself known to us. The trouble with God is exactly the opposite. He's holding you and me and everybody else by the scruff of the neck practically constantly ... Contendedly adrift in the cosmos, were you? That is a perfect description of a non-epiphany, that rarest of moments, when God Almighty lets go of the scruff of your neck and lets you be human for a little while.\\"Rabo: \\"Terry Kitchen said that the only moments he ever experienced as non-epiphanies, when God left him alone, were those following sex and the 2 times he took heroin.\\""},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"I am a lukewarm Vonnegut fan. There are some of his books I enjoy (though there has never been one that I've &quot;loved&quot;) and some that bore me to death. This one was OK for the 1st half. Though a bit tedious, it had it's moments. But after some time I became bored and couldn't bring myself to trudge through to the end. The characters were very annoying (especially the female one) and pretentious and I couldn't relate to all the angst and incessant belly-aching.To sum it up: A big bore."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"I have read a few of Vonnegut's works, and I always enjoy his musings and satire. This was no exception. The characters with weird names still come across as people you have met and known; like the woman who asks &#34;how did your parents die&#34; as an introductory offering. The insanity of popular fads is also a recurring theme. His phrasing and terse prose make his images stay in my mind for a long time. I am looking forward to reading more of his work."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"Bluebeard is an odd little novel. Published in 1988, this marks one of Vonnegut's final published novels. It is among the better novels in my opinion. Especially for the rich and interesting characterization. It bears much in common with his earlier style, especially a bit like Cat's Cradle meets Sirens of Titan meets God Bless You Mr. Rosewater, with the wry sense of humor throughout.In the novel, Rabo Karabekian is an Armenian whose family fled after the Turkish massacres and was swindled into relocating in a town in California, where there were no other Armenian refugees. His story is told from the present, in 1988, through a series of flashbacks. In fact the whole novel is written as a biography of Rabo Karabekian though with many diary like entries from the present.Without giving too much away, we see art as the heart of the story. Rabo tells his story about meeting an iconic illustrator, Dan Gregory, himself an Armenian immigrant. He eventually turns his back on illustration and starts painting in the abstract expressionist style. He alludes to being acquainted with Pollack and Rothko, but the one painter that is involved in the story is the fictitious Terry Kitchen. And a wonderfully loony character he is!In the present, Rabo's house is infiltrated with two guests, a friend Paul Slazinger, a writer who seems to just live there. Then a female writer moves herself in and creates all kinds of havoc with Rabo, his staff, and his friend. Yes singular. Circe Berman does add a bit of craziness into Rabo's life, but he almost seems to welcome her meddling. Their interaction, and that with Paul, are the pillars that hold this novel up high.There is also the mystery of what's in the potato barn. I won't spoil it, but in the end it's quite interesting, yet not overly crazy. I half expected a flying saucer! But the novel does have a glorious ending, I mean what else can we expect of Vonnegut? The message isn't as sadly and blackly comic as Mother Night, but the following sentence from the novel sums it up (I'm paraphrasing the line from the book since I just returned it to the library):\\"What's worse? A writer who can't write because of government and police censorship? Or a writer who can write but has nothing to say?\\"Vonnegut has something to say in this novel, and it is the perceptive reader that will learn from the messages in this novel and take them to heart."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"Kurt Vonnegut wrote so many books that sometimes a real gem gets lost in the shuffle. \\"Bluebeard\\" is just such a novel. I don't know many people who have read it, and that is simply a shame! It is a unique text (it varies greatly from the so called \\"Vonnegut style\\") and is a pretty conventional narrative that deals with many of the standard Vonnegut themes in a more easily accessible manner.The novel is the autobiography of an artist who has become a footnote in the history of Abstract Expressionism and the mid twentieth century art movement in the United States. He is a wealthy inhabitant of the Hamptons, the child of Armenian immigrants, and a man waiting for death. His name is Rabo Karabekian. He also has a secret locked under tight security in his potato barn. Those are all the plot points you are going to get from me.With this rather simple premise, we are given an exploration of the usual Vonnegut fare: God (and man's connection to him) war (especially WW II) man's inhumanity to man, friendship, the accidental nature of life and love, and the power of that divine in all of us...the soul. No one can bring these disparate elements together in a manner more interesting than Kurt Vonnegut, and \\"Bluebeard' does so in a very pleasing and rather un-ironic (for Vonnegut) way.\\"Bluebeard' is written as a sort of diary, from the first person perspective of the novel's protagonist, Rabo Karabekian, and is told in the conventional linear format, with flashbacks seemingly every other paragraph. For Mr. Vonnegut, that is linear! The text has its up and downs, and the reader experiences the highs and lows of Rabo's life. There are no \\"spectacular\\" moments that pop up in the book, just life moments, some good and some bad. The book builds to a climax that is the most uplifting and life affirming that I have come across, so far, in the Vonnegut oeuvre and I was stunned and pleased by it. It was unexpected, tidy, and very appropriate.Life is good and ill mixed together, but that does not mean that we are not supposed to enjoy it, or be dismissive of its importance. Rather, we are to be as Rabo says, \\"A Lazarus\\". We all need from time to time to be woken from the dead dreary depression of life. Vonnegut seems to be saying that if we hang on to that hope, and practice it when we can then that is enough and we should be content. I think he might just be right."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"and didnt write such boring stories about an over-romanticized view of love and bravery, then what you would have is kurt vonnegut. bluebeard is one of my favorite vonnegut books up there with sires of titan, slaughterhouse five and breakfast of champions."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"A failed Armenian artist tells his story to us through a first-person narrative. Punctuation is used sparingly, paragraphs exist as bite-size insights (their tethering to any time epoch the author prefers), and dialog can only be identified by context - the author discarding the inverted comma along with the establishment of the linear narrative.This is all fine and, as far as I can tell, usually suits the slapstick nature of Vonnegut's protagonists - protagonists who blur the line between the pro- and the an- prefixed animals of traditional fiction. In Bluebeard, our narrator is victim and provocateur, king and pauper, both winner and loser. Vonnegut explores this duality with a fair amount of detail; we are bombarded with a cast of wives, children, friends, and so on. In essence, Bluebeard is about people - not places, not war, and not even art.This then raises the question: are Vonnegut's characters worth the read, are they interesting enough? I would argue that yes, they are, but not as much as they might have been. Rabo\`s (our Armenian's) nationality seems more or less impervious, and I can't help noticing that his ethnicity is only labelled upon him, (as it is rarely identifiable in his actions). What would an Armenian do in this or that situation? I feel like I still don't know, but it can't be what an American would do, and this is what the book tends to describe, doesn't it?Characters swirl about Rabo like paint on a canvas, never coming too close. These people are either passing him on the way up or (more typically), downwards. One character stays by him though, sticking her nose in and out of the autobiography itself with a prominence that approaches annoyance. The climax too, seems given away too easily and too early; and worse, we are asked to discount the relentless self-defeatism in a freak exhibit of soul, soul, soul (as the author calls it).It's a difficult book to criticize though because it makes no promises that it cannot provide, it stays true to its own language and the auto-biographer of the novel is about as tough as they come. Armenia, I salute you."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"Bluebeard, the novel by Kurt Vonnegut, is an autobiography of Rabo Karabekian, a fictional American Abstract Expressionist Artist of Armenian descent, written in dairy format during the last year of his life, at the urgings of his houseguest Circe Berman. While Karobekian named the novel after the classical French story called Bluebeard, the stories are only loosely intertwined to each other.Vonnegut's Karabekian is primarily influenced by a post-World War II artistic movement called American Abstract Expressionism. Jackson Pollack is the most famous artist of that genre, although Mark Rothko and Willem de Koonig are also well-known. The artist Arshile Gorky intersects the story in two different places: he is an abstract expressionist who escaped the chaos surrounding World War One and the disintegration of the Ottoman Empire in his native Armenia.The genocide committed by the Turkish Army against Armenians in the early 20th century have resurrected themselves as how topics in the news today. Turkey has been trying to join the European Union, while French president Nicolas Sarkozy has been opposed to Turkey's ascension to the EU. Recently, the French Parliament approved legislation making it a crime to deny or publicly downplay genocidal crimes, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.The subject has traditionally been a touchy one in Turkey, where it is a crime to affirm the genocide on the grounds that it is an insult to Turkey. Turkey acknowledges that atrocities were committed against the Armenians, but claim that the incidents were not systematic genocide. More than 20 countries, including France and Canada, have officially recognized the events as genocide. While American Presidents Ronald Reagan and Barack Obama have personally called the incidents genocide, the country has not - for political reasons and quid pro quos.The way Karabekian discusses the incidents - as part of his family's history - ensures that Bluebeard is one book that you won't want to take with you on a flight to Istanbul. You might tell yourself to hide the novel once you catch a whiff of the Turkish authorities, but the story is so good that it is tough to put down. There is one big secret that you just HAVE to find out - and that is the mystery of the contents of the potato barn. Like the classical French story, the potato barn is the one room that is off-limits to the women in Karabekina's life. They might just find out that the commercial artist can actually paint with his soul.Bluebeard is a good story, but maybe one of the central themes in the story - painting without soul - is autobiographical. The mid-to-late 1980s were a tough time for Kurt Vonnegut, personally and professionally. While this story was enjoyable it doesn't have the impact of his works from the sixties and early 1970s."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"Dazzlingly crafted; multi-layered narratives; dark humor; not-so-dark humor; poignant reminder of the foibles of our particular species; a hell of a book!"},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"I used to be a big Vonnegut fan back in high school and college. Loved his novels and would consume them one after another. As the years have passed, though, I've only been able to reread one of his books. That is Bluebeard. It's his most accessible novel because it actually tells a coherent story. It has far less of the cutesy gimmicks which plague his earlier works. While Billy Pilgrim getting unstuck in time seemed clever to me 30 years ago when I read Slaughterhouse Five, it doesn't wear well. Bluebeard avoids that trap and that is why as a story, it continues to hold up. I still find the end devastating, even after all multiple readings. Is the book for everybody? Absolutely not. Probably isn't even for every Vonnegut fan. But Bluebeard is a fascinating culmination of the anti-war themes that infuse all of Vonnegut's work. I view it as his defining masterpiece."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"I'm completely biased, but I love this book. I love Vonnegut's writing style, and delivery. His books are timeless and parallel our own realities. I suggest him to anyone, especially those looking to determine their reading interests."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"I think that after \\"Breakfast of Champions\\", that Vonnegut had done all he could do in the medium of literary fiction and had peaked out as a writer. I regard the later novels as increasingly weak with \\"Hocus Pocus\\" being a particular disappointment. However, \\"Bluebeard\\" while more conventional in style, contains all his great strengths as a story teller, a creator of characters and ultimately at touching the reader's heart. A late triumph in a stellar literary career: \\"Bluebeard\\". Sometimes I think that Vonnegut has gone out of style in the American literary landscape but I predict that one day his best novels, short stories and essays will return to the center of our literary and cultural consciousness.For a great Canadian novel in the Vonnegut tradition, read \\"Life of Pi\\" by Yann Martel."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"I've read lots of Vonnegut and frankly I thought this was one of his lesser works. Boy, was I wrong. Here we have Vonnegut at his most focused on a long time, tearing off page after page that will make you laugh and stop and think at the same time. The story is basically the autobiography of an obscure artist character in Breakfast of Champions, but here he turns Rabo into someone you might think is real, so does his humor and pain cascade off the page. He bounces back and forth between his past and his present at his mansion where he just wants to be left alone, in the great Vonnegut tradition (and he doesn't need time travel this time out), comparing and contrasting the worst moments of his life with the best and trying to figure out what it all means. To me, this is one of Vonnegut's most human novels, his sense of satire and wit are still apparent and sharp but the entire story isn't devoted to Vonnegut making some barbed point about us and society as a whole, it's there but there's more time put into having get to know Rabo has someone who might live down the street from us. I devoured this book and found myself satisified, even the long anticipated secret of what lies in the potato barn was well worth the suspense (and it really is), this is the most fun I've had with a Vonnegut book in long time. Probably one of his more obscure works, it deserves to be read along with his other classics. It may not reach those peaks but it comes darn close."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"Rabo Karabekian was first introduced in &quot;Breakfast of Champions&quot;, a minor character in a surreal story. Here he gets the full treatment, and comes off as another one of those great curmudgeon characters. Only in the hands of Vonnegut, he becomes much more. He is crotchety, bitter, cynical, and several steps from senility. But he still has a wonderful memory for his past, and Vonnegut creates for him a fictional autobiography that's fascinating and endearing. And a laugh riot.Rabo has one eye. Rabo was an artist of astounding technical talent, yet helped form the Abstract Expressionist movement (along with his friends the fictional Terry Kitchen and the very real Jackson Pollock). Rabo has seen the best talents of his generation succumb to suicide and self-destruction, yet he is still kicking and screaming at 71. Rabo (guided by Vonnegut) is in the process of pouring his life onto the page, with the encouragement of a mysterious woman who has moved into his home.Vonnegut's greatest accomplishment in the book is the building up of the surprise ending (What the heck is in the barn?) to the point where something astounding should happen, and then drawing up a scene where something astounding happens. It all lives up to the hype, which is a tough thing to do. But I never doubted my man Kurt for a second. He is one of my favourite writers -- for his pointed humour and his deceptively simple prose -- and this is one of his best books. He has managed to create a commentary on the history of war, art, Europe, America, and literature in the twentieth century, by gently leading the reader through a guided tour of one man's life."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"5 stars for the Vonnegut book. 1 star for the Kindle edition.This Kindle book is absolutely loaded with typos from poorly scanned and edited OCR. They must have had an unpaid intern take care of it. It goes to show me just how little the publishers care about ebooks, and how they'd like to slow demand for what they think they can't get insane profits from. It wouldn't surprise me if they purposely do a horrible job with every ebook just to get people running back to their precious overpriced paperbacks and hardcovers.Examples of typos:\\"Tor what?\\"He, cheat and steal\\"J already have,\\" she said.Talk about realism]--The author wrote \\"realism!\\" in italics so the OCR thinks an italics exclamation point is a bracket. Nobody changed it. How could they miss this stuff? It's not just misspellings but also lack of commas, quotation marks, and so on. It wouldn't be so bad if they weren't on every couple of pages. The first few are no problem, nobody's perfect.

In all honesty, the book did lose something partway through, and right up until the end I would have rated it only about a 3-1/2. But the ending of this book (as with Mother Night and other Vonnegut novels) was worth the entire book. The secret in the potato barn was incredible; it was everything I'd thought it would be, and more.A superb book, definitely worth reading. It also made me realize (since this was one of the first Vonnegut books I'd read) how interconnected his books really are; Rabo dates back to &quot;Breakfast of Champions,&quot; where the reader is almost compelled to dislike him. However, during the course of this book, not only did I end up liking Rabo, I found myself cheering for him, and even understanding him. A must-read for any Vonnegut fan, and even for those who don't have a Vonnegut fetish like I do. Brilliant."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"I don't normally write reviews for books that I've read, but on this one I couldn't remain silent. As good as Slaughterhouse Five was, Bluebeard shows a more mature, well-refined Vonnegut at the top of his game. This is a story that could be considered rags-to-riches on one level, and the supreme failure on another of a famous artist's life. The sarcastic wit and humor so prevelant in Slaugterhouse Five is present here too, but is used in a much more forgiving and less taunting fashion, as if Vonnegut has become more tolerant of his own idiosyncracies late in life. The book is a kinder, gentler Vonnegut with enourmous depth.Without giving away the story, the &quot;big secret at the end of the book&quot; lives up to its billing; in so many books, the &quot;big ending&quot; falls flat. Not so in this case. I was floored, moved, elated, and generaly in awe of the genius of the idea. It made me realize that the helter-skelter events in the main character's life had been anything but; Vonnegut had written every event in the main character's life like Mozart placing every note it its correct place. This may be the most human book I've ever read; it is teaching the reader about life without being preachy, witty without being annoyingly sarcastic and thoughtful about the state of human existence and how we all interact. Most of all, it makes the reader really think about what he or she ultimately does with his life. This book is a must-read."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"Being a college English major, it's tough to find time to read books for fun. Well, I imagine that's a problem with just about any major, but I have firsthand experience with English majors. Anyhow, when I do get that rare few days that I can fit in some personal reading, I look for something that I can finish in a short amount of time, but that'll still be fullfilling, something that won't make me go, &quot;WHAT WAS I THINKING!?&quot; Anyhow, one particular author that fits this particular niche in my reading curriculum is Kurt Vonnegut.I read &quot;Bluebeard&quot; in 3 days and as much as I try to avoid cliches, I cannot deny the appropriateness of the following phrase:I COULD NOT PUT THIS BOOK DOWN!Ok, I said it, there. It was funny, heartwarming, sad in places, and it welled up a plethora of emotion in me as I read. The novel didn't quite have the social commentary of some of Vonnegut's other works; this should not dismay any Vonnegut nuts. The author spends some time looking at how the ideas of nationality and &quot;roots&quot; manifest, especially in the contrast between the protagonist, Rabo Karabekian (an Armenian Abstract-Expressionist painter) and Dan Gregory (also Armenian, but Americanized his original last name, Gregorian, and a painter/illustrator of a more realistic school). Dan Gregory is Karabekian's tutor and we hear about him in flashbacks, when Karabekian recalls his past to Circe Berman, the vivacious and interesting widow who invades Karabekian's life. Circe Berman's role in the novel is an immensely enjoyable one and as I read I went through ups and downs, practically screaming at her through the pages things like &quot;What gives you the right!?!&quot; But she grew on me as the pages went by and I slowly saw that there was more to her than meets the eye (ahhh! cliche #2!!).Take my word: wrapped in this novel is a fantastic story with an incredible ending preceded by page after page of memorable scenes starring one of the greatest fictional Abstract Expressionist painters in history, Rabo Karabekian, and his most interesting life and his most interesting houseguests."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"After having read several of Vonnegut's works, I would recommend starting with Bluebeard. Though it is absolutely representative of Vonnegut's style, it doesn't include some of the off-the-wall practices in his more famous books (Slaughterhouse Five, Breakfast of Champions) that may throw a first-timer. Bluebeard reads well as a complete story and reveals a great deal of Vonnegut's soul. It will not disappoint."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"While Breakfast of Champions remains my all time favorite, Bluebeard ranks a close second. The story is a witty and poignant autobiography of Rabo Karabekian, a WWII vet and artist friend of Abstract Expressionists like Jackson Pollock. In a way that it seems only Vonnegut can, sad, depressing characters are interwoven with a satirical wit that produces a cunning commentary on American culture. Like most Vonnegut books, whenever I attempt to convey the plot to a friend (who is unaware of his writing style) they say something like, \\"oh - that sounds so depressing!\\" Yet, Vonnegut writes with a trenchant wit that digs below just the character's emotions, to the culture and influences that create such actions.The most intriguing aspect of the plot is Vonnegut's satire on various art movements, as well as the art market. Rabo was initially trained by a horribly haughty painter who painted in a realist style. Upon returning home after WWII, Rabo rejected his tutor's style and became friends with Jackson Pollock and Terry Kitchen (who I had never heard of before, but googled and found that he was a fluxus artist-?). His actions caused his marriage to disintegrate and his two sons to disown him.Similar to his personal life, his paintings, made out of Sateen Dura Luxe, also disintegrate and fall apart, thus destroying his artistic career. His paintings were solid layers of the Dura Luxe on canvas, with small pieces of tape added. While his career and personal life were in shambles, Rabo ended up a very wealthy man. In return for money, his artist friends gave him many of their paintings (which they considered worthless at the time). His enormous collection of Abstract Expressionist paintings was the largest in the world. At the time he is writing his autobiography, Rabo is an old man living alone in a big, empty house in Long Island. While he has given up painting, he has one big secret locked in the potatoe barn behind his house.What makes the Abstract Expressionist works so famous and revered? While Rabo's abstract work, which he clearly has no attachment to, is shown in museums and art history classes, he admits that his most beloved painting will be adored only by the laymen and \\"common people.\\" Created in a realistic style he says - \\"It isnt a painting at all! It's a tourist attraction! It's a World's Fair! It's a Disneyland!\\" Bluebeard satirizes this adoration of \\"famous\\" works, forcing you to question and ponder the various definitions of art, and how one work becomes more famous than another.I absolutely loved when Rabo would talk about his \\"meat\\" vesus his soul. \\"My soul didn't know what kind of picture to paint, but my meat sure did.\\""},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"That's the best way I can describe this book: simply beautiful. The story is very funny, sad, yet touching. And of course, you're dying to know what's in the potato barn. That revelation is one of the nicest surprises that a book has ever given me and is what really left me with a lasting impression. It's surprising that Vonnegut could write something so heartfelt compared to his other books, but I guess that just shows what a great author he is. For all the fun he pokes at modern society, Vonnegut actually provides some hope for a change in this book."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"From the first sentence to the last, I couldn't put this book down. The writing is clever and funny. I can't recommend this book enough. It's very different from many of Vonnegut's other novels, like Slaughterhouse 5.

The flow of the book is magnificent, and the story in it is so human that one can alsmost empathize with Rabo though he is a fictional character.

Rabo is inspired to begin this work after an encounter with a bright, vibrant woman, Circe Berman, a writer of bright, vibrant novels for young adults, who doesn't believe in saying &quot;hello&quot; and instead greets him with the question &quot;how did your parents die?&quot;These quirky moments of conversation and life color the whole novel. But the novel is not all humor and lightness; Circe's question demonstrates the bitter-sweet nature of much of the novel. Much of that which gives the novel its humanity are the moments of despair and sad revelation. But the revelations are not that of destiny controlling aliens, or the author giving free-will to his creations, a strength of the book, and over-all the book is positive.Like Rabo, Vonnegut departs from the genre that he's known for, but both end up creating masterpieces that touch the soul and open room for wonder in Vonnegut's world."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"Kurt Vonnegut-for writing glib, memorable characters to take part in your puppet shows. An aging Abstract Expressionist is trying to enjoy his last years in obscurity when a woman suddenly befriends him and more or less forces him to think about his past and write his autobiography. As the demanding guest makes him dig deeper into his unhappy life, he remembers his intrinsic worth that half a century of war and art had blurred. Few writers are any good at making you feel for their characters. Bluebeard is a fine example of Vonnegut's mastery. Certainly one of the best I've read from him."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"Another great book by KV. His style for this one is supposed to be an older gentleman writing an autobiography, but KV waltzes off that track fairly early, and you lose that feel.

Usually he just drops you with minimal closure, but in Bluebeard, he at least gives you something memorable to walk away with first."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"Not a lot hype surrounding this book, but it really is a gem.

Estranged from many old friends and family, he attempts to catalog these in an autobiographical work. He meets a new, energetic woman-friend, who gives him a new perspective on life.

Approach middle age with care (or humor, or narcotics, or. . .) Vonnegut seems to be warning throughout this book. It is the age where you will find your friends wrapped with their automobiles around trees, or slashed up with their own knives, or shot through with their own guns. It is the age where, if your friends are spared death, you may look into their eyes and realize that \\"nobody is at home\\". It is the age at which this story's main character, Rabo, says he has already played Lazarus twice.What a warning; what a story--another immensely satisfying book from Vonnegut, full of his wit and wisdom.

However, while I usually find his stories full of real characters who are in unreal situations (Time Quake, Galapagos, etc.) Bluebeard is full of real characters in a very real setting. It is a character story through and through, and is refreshingly Earth-bound. If you like Vonnegut but dislike his tendencies towards sci-fi, you'll love this book. If you love the sci-fi edge, well... you'll probably still like this book."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"Vonnegut's sem-autobiography, based on the interesting life of Rabo Karabekian, an Armenian-American, war veteran, abstract expressionalist painted, who after the death of his 2nd wife to cancer, became a morose recluse in his house in the Hamptons. He's decaying one day at a time, until an eccentric young woman named Circe Berman invades his privacy, bullies him into writing his autobiography, and revitalizes him with a new approach to life. It has many uncanny similarities to Vonnegut's life, such as the experiences in Dresden, Germany, being married twice, and being unconventional and unique in their respective art forms (writing and painting in this case).The journey begins with Rabo's parents escaping the Armenian Holocaust, then leads to his apprenticeship to Dan Gregory, a prominent Norman Rockwell-type painter who treats him like a peasant, and who is infatuated and enchanted by Hitler's philosophy, and the dictatorship in Europe circa World War 2. It also shows his affair with Gregory's girlfriend, Marilee Kemp, and their betrayal to Dan Gregory by going to the Museum of Modern Art and by making love to each other. It also shows his introduction to abstract-expressionism, and being in the same ilk as gorundbreaking and innovative painters, such as Jackson Pollock and Terry Rothko, both died due to self-destructive behavior.This is a book you have to follow carefully in order to understand, since Vonnegut likes to switch back and forth to different time periods and zeitgeists in the course of this book. But it is essential reading, and certainly one of the most memorable books I have ever read in my entire life."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"I read Breakfast of Champions first, and I have to say that I find this work much more subdued and 'unengaging' in a way -- not for lack of philosophy, but because KV seems to be holding back his personality a bit. Maybe it's the device of him telling the whole story as Rabo writing an autobiography, but it feels like we are not getting Rabo but just a rather muted Kurt. The book is still brimming with things to consider and excellent peeks at the human experience, but you can't help but notice that the sparkle is a wee bit damp here, although still a sparkle."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"Kurt Vonnegut's body of work contains some of the most humane books i have ever read. Books that strive to teach everyone to act with an uncommon decency and to possess a soul of true wit. Often, however, his characters are overwhelmed by the allegories that vonnegut makes of their lives. Not so with 'Bluebeard,' a novel seemingly possessed with humanity.Yes there are the wonderful lessons that we have come to expect from our buddy Kurt, but here we have a group of people who for once seem to grasp their lives in a way that makes them jump above the considerable intellectual content of the novel in which they are living.i think this may be due to the fact that most Vonnegut novels chronicle some poor souls world falling down in a slow earthquake of time, Bluebeard shows a man living a life that builds in complexity towards a powerful climax of wisdom, of heart. Rabo Karabekian finds a way to bring his soul to the world. Rather than being a typical vonnegut hero going to hell on a road paved with his own good intentions, Rabo takes the various hells of his life and finds a way to turn them all into little jewels.A sobering but ultimately marvelous gift to the world"},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"This book was a wonderful satirical look into how foolish and trivial people can really be- Zen Master T"},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"What the Hell is Rabo Karabekian, abstract expressionist, WWII wizard of camouflage, victim of Sateen Dura-lux, hiding in his potato barn?

Wonderfully funny and heartbreakingly tragic throughout. Just a great read."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"Here is the story of Rabo, a World War Two veteran. He is also a previously well known abstract painter, who is now known in those circles for the humorous twist his past paintings have taken. He is a very lonely, aging man, who has lost a lot of things over the years. This is the story of how he manages to come to terms with his life, and find some sort of peace, through an unlikely source... a young woman who he is at once appalled by and also fascinated with.Veterans play a significant role in the story, as in other Vonnegut books. Rabo has a secret, related to his past, which he has hidden in a locked barn on his property. He has sworn not to allow it to be revealed until his death. When it is finally revealed to the reader, it is stunningly beautiful. It is the perfect culmination of Rabo's search for meaning in a confusing life. The moment is so perfectly told that it would be enough to recommend the book for it alone. But there is much more along the way. Humor, sadness and complexity are found in the straightforward story. It does not move along at an even pace. There were some dull moments for me, and not everything worked as well as some of the best passages did. But I suspect it was nothing more than personal taste at work there. On the whole, it is very likely that if you enjoy Vonnegut, but have not read this, you will be grateful when you do."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"I'm an avid book reader and will read nearly everything (although there are exceptions of course). We had to read this for my college Lit class and I wasn't bothered by it, since I'd heard wonderful things about Vonnegut. I picked it up and was enthralled. It was touching, vivid, funny, serious, dark, and just amazing. This book actually touched me and I LOVED reading it and talking about it. There were so many stories within the story and each one of them was hopeful and/or just sad but they never were pointless, well not to me anyway. The ending was the best as you find out what's in the barn and it blew my mind because I didn't expect it and it the surprise almost brought me to tears which is really kind of dorky, but hey, to each their own.

Damn good!"},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"Having now read all of Vonnegut's novels, I would say this is at least as good as any of them. I am an avid fan of all his works, and feel the loss of this great writer. His satire and laconic wit are unexcelled. Fortunately, this kind of material is no longer censored. Bluebeard sticks a to realism, as compared to sci-fi elements of Galapagos, Sirens of Titan, etc. There may be intended irony in this, as Bluebead involves the contrasting art styles of super-realism and abstractionism."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"I think it's pretty hard to go wrong when choosing a Vonnegut novel.

Yet, oddly enough, I fall into neither category. In general, I count myself as a fan but not one so fanatically devoted as to find no fault in anything the man ever wrote. Aside from the luminous \\"Slughterhouse-5\\" I consider \\"Bluebeard\\" to be his most fully sustained work. There is a weird kind of alchemy in these pages that make the total far greater than the sum of its parts. As a disclosure, I'll confess to not having yet read \\"Cat's Cradle\\" but I aim to remedy that situation very soon."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"Someone I know said \\"Bluebeard\\" was the Vonnegut YOU (and by YOU he meant everyone) didn't like. He couldn't have been more wrong. A lot of people say a book really spoke to them, mostly so they can sound smart, but this is one of those rare occasions where I can truly say this book spoke to me. Though it was written over twenty years ago it felt like it was written for me right this moment. (I've mentioned before in other reviews how important timing is in these things. See \\"On the Road\\" and \\"A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius.\\")Bluebeard is the story of Rabo Karabekian and it follows the nonlinear storytelling found in other Vonnegut novels like his classic \\"Slaughterhouse Five.\\" Starting in the present of 1987, Rabo is an old man on Long Island who lives alone in a mansion after his wife died. A younger widow named Circe Berman (who writes controversial young adult books under the handle Polly Madison) appears on Rabo's private beach one day and soon takes up residence in Rabo's house. She convinces him to write his autobiography.His autobiography begins in California in the late \`20s. The son of Turkish Armenians who fled the slaughter of their village, Rabo trains to be a cobbler like his father but discovers he has a talent for drawing. His mother convinces him to write to a famous Russian Armenian named Dan Gregory who's become a famous artist known for his realistic illustrations. (His popularity at that time make him kind of similar to Norman Rockwell, except he's a jerk. Maybe Rockwell was a jerk too. I have no idea.) Gregory's wife Marilee takes notice of Rabo's talent and eventually brings him to Gregory's home in New York. Rabo rides out the Depression under Gregory's mean-spirited teachings, falling in love with Marilee and \\"Modern Art\\" (Picasso and his ilk) at the same time.In time Rabo becomes a lesser-known member of the modern art movement in the \`40s and \`50s, hanging out with Jackson Pollack and Terry Kitchen and other well-known people who invariably commit suicide. Worse yet, many of Rabo's paintings are destroyed by a very shoddy product so that he seems doomed to be completely forgotten. That is except for a very special item in his former studio, a potato barn on the grounds of his mansion.For me, as something approximating an artist of the written word, much of Rabo's problems were similar to ones I've faced. I'm certain many artists whether they work with a canvas or clay or marble or paper or words or what have you have felt the frustration and despair at the world failing to take notice of our \\"gift.\\" But the lesson for any artistic type I gleaned from Rabo's story follows the adage of \\"Do what you love.\\" Or the more accurate way to put it might be to say, \\"Do what you care about for the people you care about.\\"That said, I think this is a great book to read if you're an artist of any sort. If you're not, then you'll probably still be entertained by Vonnegut's witty prose, but you won't get as much out of the reading. You're probably the YOU the person I knew was thinking about.That is all."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"If Kurt Vonnegut takes on War in \\"Slaughter-House Five\\" and Greed in \\"God Bless you, Mr. Rosewater\\", the incomparable author tackles a less conspicuous vice in \\"Bluebeard\\"---Modern Art.The story's hero, a mildly talented Armenian illustrator named Rabo Karabekian, happens to run with the biggest names in modern art before modern art gets big. In exchange for loans, the fledgling artists give Rabo paintings that all skyrocket in value once the troubled artists inevitably kill themselves.Part flashback, part real-time, \\"Bluebeard\\" runs through Rabo's various loves, picking up the recurring Vonnegut theme of first marriages' (much like his own) failing. There's also a strong, very accurate undercurrent of Armenian culture (I should know; my brother-in-law's as Armenian as they get). But behind it all lies the question of art...how to recognize it and how to ignore it. Vonnegut has some beautifully lucid passages that answer the question and are, in poetic irony, lustrous art in and of themselves.As always, there are what must be Vonnegut's own pet ideas masquerading as the raving lunatic's. His washed-up novelist Paul Slezinger's Theory of Revolutions is one such concoction. In Slezinger's theory, every revolution must have three specialists. 1. The genius who stands alone at the top as the fertilizing mind. 2. The \\"highly intelligent citizen in good standing in the community who understands and admires the genius and testifies the genius is not mad.\\" And 3. \\"The Explainer\\", who explains everything to the ignorant masses' satisfaction.\\"Bluebeard\\" might not be Vonnegut's finest, but it certainly fulfills everything the Vonnegut fan might expect: Disarming insights on sadness and death, scathing cultural indictments, a major cultural grail dismembered, and all of it done with an almost jarring lightness of touch.As Rabo's father concludes: \\"If anybody has discovered what life is all about, it is too late. I am no longer interested.\\""},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"A fairly interesting and entertaining story about a \\"modern artist\\".

At some point in his life, he stops painting because he comes to believe that he lacks talent or vision or something. But he continues to collect abstract paintings and ends up holding a quite expensive collection which he has hanging on the walls all over his house.This is not Vonnegut's best book (that would be Cat's Cradle, in my opinion) but it's quite good. Like much of Vonnegut's writing, it's entertaining as well as thoughtful, and you find yourself moving along through the book quite quickly, not feeling burdened the way you often can with a book.

Often, his tribulations are stumbled upon while insights into humanity often come from the women in his life (Circe Berman, Marilee, his mother). Along the ride, his intent to be a painter himself is a disaster (he used Sateen dura-luxe, which eventually rolled up and peeled off his canvases) while he inadvertently makes fortunes as a widower and as a collector. Rabo establishes friendships with many struggling poor artists of New York. In exchange for money that he lends them, he takes their presumably worthless abstract expressionist paintings. Rabo is married several times, has an ongoing love affair with Marilee and his home is invaded by Circe Berman. Through these relationships, Rabo learns a lot about love and life.Vonnegut re-encapsulates several of his favorite themes: absurdity of war, America's prevalent loneliness, how the rich become rich. However, an interesting theme specific to Bluebeard is the discussion about art. What is art? Circe Berman stays on the best seller's list by generating volumes of teen novels while Paul Salinger lives a suicidal and depressed existence trying to create introspective critiques of humanity. Dan Gregory makes paintings equivalent to being a \\"taxidermist\\" where his subjects look more real on his canvas than in real life, while the abstract expressionists make unintelligible topics. Paul Salinger and the abstract expressionists look down on the others, but which is really better? The answer might be provided with the Rabo's greatest secret. Kept in a potato barn behind his mansion, its ultimate disclosure to the world makes a dramatic statement about art."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"In the 5 or 6 Vonnegut books I've read so far, I've yet to be disappointed, and Bluebeard is certainly no exception. It is, however, one of his less fantastic tales. Karabekian has a less than ordinary past, but the story itself seldom leaves his house in the Hamptons, except for the random flashbacks to his childhood or his time during the war as a camouflage artist. The genius in this book is truly the characters and the twists of admiration, disgust, comraderie and annoyance that keeps even an old bluebeard constantly evolving.Though not my favorite of Vonnegut's books, I consider even the worst of what he's written absolute masterpieces."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"After reading other reviews of this book, I have come to the conclusion that it's a book for certain people, and those people love it to death, while the others find it a disappointment. Having said that, I must say that this is quite possibly the most moving book I have ever read. It is so much of an enigma to me as to what precise ingredients touch me so emotionally, but something in there spoke to me underneath the words. It's heartbreaking, beautiful, lonely, incredible, and as my title suggests, it hits, for me at least, incredibly close to home, as though I were a Rabo Karabekian in my last life.

For every brilliant CAT'S CRADLE there is an equally ludicrous SLAPSTICK. That being said, I believe BLUEBEARD to be his best work. The story is wonderfully involving without relying on gimmicks (like BREAKFAST OF CHAMPIONS), and the characters are marvellously drawn. I can also say that this novel involved me emotionally more than any other of his books. Not only do I consider it Vonnegut's best, but I would probably rate it among my personal favorites.

He never ceases to amaze me with how he pulls it all together in the end. Vonnegut has the knack for perfect endings, and this is no exception.I was a bit scared at the 'topic' of the book, which is a mock autobiography of an impressionist painter, as I've never been too heavily into the artistic world of painting, but regardless of the subject matter, the book is very much more.Rabo Karabekian, a minor character in \\"Breakfast of Champions,\\" is a stubborn, ghost of his past self at the opening of the book, until Circe Berman, a widow and pop novelist, shows up at his estate and begins to seek the non-ethereal man.While the novel is in the style of an autobiography, it is also crossed with a sort of journal of Karabekian's relationship with Berman, his cook, and his last surviving painter friend. All of the characters have depth, yet are developed slowly enough to be well digested.Throughout the novel, a Bluebeard theme is carried out, with Karabekian having locked up something in his potato-barn-turned-studio that everyone is dying to discover. Like something out of Catch-22, there are other smaller \\"Bluebeards\\" throughout the novel, as we see Rabo's childhood, 'apprenticeship', military service, marriages, painting career, and retirement.Anyone that likes Vonnegut will love this book, and anyone that hasn't read Vonnegut should."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"Just for fun I was looking thru Vonnegut reviews and was shocked that no one has reviewed Bluebeard.

This is a quick and easy book to read and can be enjoyed by everyone."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"Kurt Vonnegut is one of our most treasured modern American writers, and with good reason. Although it is not one of his masterpieces, Bluebeard is another fine novel from Vonnegut. It's written in the highly caustic first-person style of many of his books, and his writing is just as devastatingly clever as ever. The amazing thing about Vonnegut is that his prose is very simple - almost child-like at times. This would seem at first glance to trivialize the contents or take away from the produndity of the book, but this it does not do. As Michael Crichton has pointed out in his essay on Vonnegut, this seems like a really simple way to write; but, as anyone who has actually tried to do it knows, it is actually much more difficult than it seems. What makes this particular book special is that here we encounter perhaps Vonnegut's most recognizably human character. He has his faults, like all of us, and is a very tender and lovable character (as opposed to, say, the narrarator in Hocus Pocus.) We feel this man's tragedies as we go along. That his story is told to us through typical Vonnegut wit and farce makes it only that much the better. Highly reccommended for fans of the author."},{"Title":"Bluebeard: A Novel","review":"Most writers hit their stride during middle age.

Still, advanced age doesn't prevent him from spinning his satirical and comic magic.

I felt I could understand a little of that desire for, and strugge towards freedom, because although I was, in comparsion to Jimmy, in a much more fortunate situation, I was still imprisoned by my own unhappiness and that of my parents. I found it difficult to talk about my situation at home, because like a lot of unhappy young people I couldn't see where the problems came from, and so had no words to explain this unhappiness to my parents or to anyone else. One day I decided to write to Jimmy (who was still in Barlinnie) and to my astonishment he wrote back to me! I treasured his letter and even took it with me to hospital one night when I had cut my arm in a self harming incident. I told the duty nurse about him and showed her my letter. My parents came to see me, but they were drunk and it was not the same. Although I did not know Jimmy I felt that he would understand in some way how I was feeling. I wrote again, and he wrote back again. I wrote once more and then the letters stopped. I don't know whether he got tired of me! Or whether he was told to stop writing. A year ago in the final year of my BA I read Jimmy's prison diaries and realised that he had received many letters around the time that I wrote to him. He had a lot to deal with. I have though about him sometimes over the years, and thought about the strange connections we make with strangers and how they affect our lives. The last time I heard anything about him was over 8 years ago when I saw a documentary programme about him and his sculpting. He changed his life very dramatically in a way that I wanted to change mine. I wrote to him twenty years ago, and if he ever reads this, I have changed my life too. I have just finished a BA degree and I write about self harm. Like him I have used what life taught me and made some good out of it. Mine isn't a very dramatic story, and there is no happy ending yet. But now I don't necessarily expect one. I am still looking for a sense of freedom because I know that ultimately it is within all of us, and not something out there. If you read this Jimmy I hope all is well, and thanks for bothering. Not many people did at the time.

That is the only thing I love about this book.If you want to see how to build the box on the cover (and other similar boxes that are shown in pictures throughout the book), you won't learn it from this book. In fact, the boxes that you are \\"shown\\" how to build are not so impressive, in my opinion.Further, I consider myself a pretty accomplished woodworker and a guy who has put together quite a bit of machinery and electronics with pretty lousy instruction manuals. However, if this book was given to me as a manual on building the boxes in it, I would be VERY frustrated.For example, the \\"step-by-step\\" instructions for the VERY FIRST project continually instructs you to refer to other projects later in the book to learn how to perform a particular step. I'm sorry, but if you are teaching the first project in the book, a reader should not have to flip back to the middle of the book to learn how to perform a step.This book shows you one way to make a box using one set of tools and substrates. If you can buy it for the $8 I paid for the book, it MIGHT be worth the money just for some alternative ideas. However, I have seen articles in magazines like Fine Woodworking that give better step-by-step instructions on building veneered boxes using less difficult techniques and more commonplace shop tools.So, while I am impressed with the picture on the front of the book, I am disappointed that the book was poorly written and no instructions on building the box on the front of the book appear anywhere in the book."},{"Title":"Fine Decorative Wood Boxes","review":"Well. I have been to Andrew Crawford's website and I think his work is terrific, looks great, and uses wonderful techniques. So I expected this book to share many of those techniques. There's barely any hardwood used in the book so it won't cover issues such as wood movement and such things, but I expected it to be the case as most work is made out of beautifully veneered plywood (even though it is a bit of a letdown for me as I would have lliked to know how some of those techniques would work with hardwood).The real disappointment, however, comes from the choice of the boxes for the projects in this book. There are a couple boxes that I've seen on AC's website and look nice, but most are far from being on par with the work shown on the website and as interesting. I wanted to see how he makes those sweeping, curvy, arlequin boxes, but that type of box is shown only on the cover and on some photos, for advertisement, but not in any project. Not good when it's the box that is featured on the cover of the book. The curvy sides (laminated) box featured in the book is a project that would seem better suited for papier mach&eacute; than woodworking imho.Very little hardwood in the book but there is still some nice hardwood work on the website that is far above what is shown here, so why not include some of those?Despite the critiques, it is still a nice read, especially if you are intereted in beautiful veneer work and techniques and don't mind the plywood-centric construction. Quick but good sections on tools, finishing, mounting hardware etc."},{"Title":"Fine Decorative Wood Boxes","review":"If you check out my other reviews on box making books, you will want to start with one of those first. Box Making Basic's, by David m. Freedman, or Box Making, by Doug Stowe. After mastering the basic techniques and you feel confident in your box making talents, go ahead and purchase this book. Mr Crawford designs and makes beautiful art boxes, and his book is very good at taking your thru the steps to make your own variations of his creations. Nice section on tools, their care and use. Real good sections on selecting woods and veneers. Lots of pictures and diagrams to assist you in constructing the 10 projects contained in the book. Mr Crawford does a lot of inlay and veneer work. This is the reason you want to have the basic's firmly in hand before moving on to these projects. It's a new ballgame here. I have been making boxes for quite awhile, and some of mine have been fairly exotic, but Mr Crawford's book is way up there in the \\"WOW\\" factor. Especially the gallery portion at the rear of the book, featuring other artist's work. With all that said this is a \\"working mans\\" book. You can tell that he wants you to understand how to do this type of work and goes to great lengths to help you accomplish a finished product. As in most of these type of books, the author is attempting to teach you the basic's with tried and true designs, but expects you to supply the imagination to go beyond what is contained in the book. This is an excellent book, a welcome addition to my \\"library\\" and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"Early Chevrolet Corvettes 1953-67: All Six-Cylinder & V8s (Osprey Expert Histories)","review":"This was a great book.

It is the story of Shakespeare's growing up and of his love for the Earl of Southampton and the celebrated Dark Lady of the Sonnets. Marlowe and Ben Jonson are two more of the brilliantly drawn characters, and the whole life of Elizabethan England, the bustle of the busy port of London, and of the art and theater of those days is so really evoked that we feel we are there. My emotions were aroused, and I found the story evocative of my own life, of feelings I have had, the events being so engrossing, so engaging and involving, that I was deeply moved.

For anyone who loves historical fiction or Shakespeare, or wonders about the &quot;Dark Lady&quot; of the sonnets, this book will be mesmerizing. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"The Players: A Novel of the Young Shakespeare","review":"Steeped in Shakespearean lore, Cowell has fashioned a remarkable novel of the apprenticeship years of William Shakespeare; leaving wife and children at home in Stratford, Will seeks employment in London. Allowing himself one year to succeed, Will is easily seduced by the city and its merry players and theaters, the excitement of the stage drawing him like moth to flame. Authentic in tone and dialog, Shakespeare's London is roiling with activity and energy, Will surrounded by like-minded creative men, including Christopher Marlowe and Ben Jonson, building a camaraderie that sustains them through the most difficult times, sharing their joys and their failures, a bare existence that thrives on loyalty rather than financial successes. Shakespeare's internal struggle is the crux of this novel, the intimate perspective of a man driven by his love for language and the stories that surround him. Eking only a meager living from this environment, Will persists, unable to resist the siren call of the theater.Supporting himself by penning whatever will bring in money, from treatises to poetry, Will's friends are a great influence on his development as a writer. Still a young man, he harbors aspirations, gradually disdaining performance for playwriting, although his most powerful and enduring works are still years ahead. Cowell's William Shakespeare writhes in the crucible of his ill-defined passions, a yearning he has yet to articulate, status a great determinant in London society. Will, a married man, attempts to restrain himself from sampling the dark beauty of Emilia Bassano, for Emilia is the consort of Queen Elizabeth's cousin, but before long he is obsessed. But temptation arrives in yet another guise, the young Earl of Southampton, Henry Wriothesley, whose mother commissions Will to write a number of sonnets urging the handsome young man to marry. His awkward relationship with young Harry draws Will into one of the most agonizing periods of his life, an attraction so deep and troubling that even Emilia's charms cannot help the poet temper his imagination or deny his feelings.What I find most remarkable in this novel is the authenticity of Shakespeare's world, the author's confidence in recreating time and place in infinite detail, from the fond remembrances of Will's youth to the impulsive marriage that leaves him feeling trapped in a place where he can never accomplish his dreams. And those dreams are far from clear as Will experiences London; indeed, besides his attraction to the theater, Will is still fueled by nonspecific ambition. It is this internal emotional conflict that yields the bounty of creativity, a journey through unknown territory and complicated relationships that rend his soul, giving voice to the sonnets and plays that speak to the most vulnerable aspects of the human heart. To read The Players is to walk among them, feel the excitement of Elizabethan times, the queen thirty years on England's throne, and the birth of ideas, an emotional landscape wherein a man forges a bond with his future, the extravagant fruits of his pain our treasure. Luan Gaines/2009."},{"Title":"The Players: A Novel of the Young Shakespeare","review":"William Shakespeare comes alive in this novel. Cowell not only captures the uniqueness of a truly gifted artist, but also the separateness, the ability to both observe and participate in life, loves, relationships, time, country, and culture.The novel takes William from infancy in Stratford through many self-revealing experiences, including the tangled &quot;love triangle&quot; of his relationship with the &quot;dark lady&quot; of the sonnets and the Earl of Southampton.Ms. Cowell has written a masterful literary work that looks honestly, passionately, and compassionately at one of literature's icons, and finds in him a large measure of humanity.

Again:nicely written and translated; subject matter quite interesting and relevant"},{"Title":"The ROCK Of TANIOS. A Novel. Translated by Dorothy S. Blair.","review":"\`In our village, the rocks had names.' With the first words I knew that I was going to delve into this book and would not bring myself to put it down until I had finished!Set in 19th century Lebanon, The title \\"The Rock of Tanios\\" refers to a peculiar rock formation, looking like a great stone chair, that dominated the Lebanese village of Kfaryabda. The central characters are Sheikh Francis, a Christian Arab, and the sheikh's illegitimate offspring, Tanios. When I first started reading the book, I was on the quest to find why the rock was named after Tanios. Little did I know that that was the last thing that I was going to learn from this gripping tale. Through the fates and legends of these characters Maalouf creates a historical romance filled with local myths, political games, treachery, and love.I would have to say that one of Maalouf's main themes is lost or forbidden love; how we fall in love with what's different from us, and discover we're different from what we thought we were.And, it is forbidden love, which tears Tanios' family apart and drives him into exile.Deceiving as hope might be, a twist in fate and luck brings Tanios back to his mother's bosom. Ironically, as he finally makes it to his beloved home, Tanios is left yet again as the estranged boy who did not truly know his own identity, or did he?An amazing read, Maalouf has done it again. A prize well deserved for his fascinating imagination to mix true life with fiction."},{"Title":"The ROCK Of TANIOS. A Novel. Translated by Dorothy S. Blair.","review":"This book is a terrific example of historical fiction and well deserving of the Prix Goncourt. It contains the two most important aspects of historical fiction. First, great historical fiction must contain a great deal of information on the era and the people in which the story is told. It really must convey the \`feel' of the period. This story takes place (primarily) in a Druze village of Lebanon in the early to mid 1800s. You'll learn quite a bit about the complexities of 19th century Lebanese society and the larger scale geopolitical machinations between the French, British, Ottomans, and Egyptians, of which the proto-Lebanese state is caught helplessly in the middle. Second, the story contains a thoughtful tale about human ideals and relationships that is relevant and meaningful today. Maalouf succeeds admirably on both counts. The plot centers around a Druze youth who may or may not be the illegitimate child of the local sheik. This is a story about life's lessons and frustrations, and determining one's role in the world. Without giving too much away, the ending is extremely well done. Tanios (the main character) comes full circle, going from outcast to power broker, and realizes that being at the top isn't all that he thought it would be.

The Rock of Tanios is so exciting and fascinating, that you will start and finish reading this book within hours.There are also some messages Mr. Maalouf has sprinkled throughout his book such as this wonderful one on page 360:'Wherever you are , some will want to ask questions about your skin or your prayers. Beware of gratifying their instincts, my son, beware of bending before the multitude! Muslim, Jew or Christian, they must take you as you are, or lose you. When men's minds seem narrow to you, tell yourself that the land of God is broad; broad His hands and broad His heart.

I greatly enjoyed the inclusion of the Lebanese words in the book, though translated into English, you have to be Lebanese to truly feel the meaning.For me also, this fiction shows that the way of life in the Lebanese village's life of the 1800s in its reality still have echos in the daily political life of today's Lebanon."},{"Title":"The ROCK Of TANIOS.

I found her approach to be balanced in her attempt to show the varying ways women are treated in different Islamic countries. She NEVER presents herself as an Islamic scholar but merely as an observer of the various countries which she covered during her years in the Middle East.One thing that really shocked me was how the Koran seems to be interpreted by different groups for different reasons. It seems that anyone can rationalize behaviors by finding an interpretation of the Koran to support such actions. And each one believes that he is correct!To have a religion based on these varying interpretations is one thing, but to have entire cultures and political movements based on them is very frightening. Cultural practices seem to be intricately tied up with religious interpretation and vice versa.I find ANY religious extremism to be anathema, whether it is Islam or some other religion. When one refuses to believe that there are alternate ways to live a good life or to attain eternal happiness, this is very dangerous and leads to violence and wars, as can be seen in the history of civilization. I also am of the opinion that wherever (in the West or the Middle East or anywhere) any kind of religious fundamentalism exists, women suffer.I also realize that this is a Western look at women in Islamic countries and that there are many women living happy and contented lives in Muslim societies. The author never says otherwise despite what is written in some reviews.I could not understand those who said that Brooks was totally wrong in her reporting and that Muslim women are protected and treasured (and educated) -- when fully documented atrocities toward women are committed in Muslim countries and when women in Afghanistan are not permitted to go to school past the age of 12.While I do not think this book should be the only source that one should use to try to understand the Islamic countries and their cultures, it certainly provides a thorough background and basic explanations based on Brook's experience while living in these countries. I read this just after seeing the incredible documentary, &quot;Beneath the Veil&quot; and thus concluded that Brook's reporting was accurate. It certainly opened my eyes and made me want to learn more."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"I would first like to say that I really enjoyed reading this book. I have become very interested in women's life in Islam and this book was very well-written. She goes around and basically interviews women and men in Islamic societies and gives you the facts on what is going on in these third world countries. Some of these other reviews are very judgmental just because Mrs. Brooks is Jewish. The bottom line...Geraldine Brooks is a very talented author and deserves credit where credit is due. The world would be a better place if people could accept one another for who they are and not try and stereo-type them just because of their choice of religion. In the words of Geraldine Brooks, \\"But sitting there, sharing the warm sand and the soft air, we acepted each other. When she raised her face to the sun, she was smiling\\".

But being a woman in the Middle East is more like perpetual torture. Genital mutilation, stolen children, stonings to death, whippings, rape, and summary execution. Geraldine Brooks explains just how much of it is explained by religion, and when autocratic theocracy steps in to finish the job. A Wall Street Journal reporter assigned to Cairo, Brooks is a student of Islam, and of Arabic. She explains the rift between the Shia and Sunni sects, and opens our eyes to the Prophet's trials and tribulations with the women of his household. We learn how he made up the rules of Islam as he went along, in order to advance his own lust, and in the process, made slaves of Islamic women forever. Sometimes you will laugh, but it won't be for long, because unfathomable cruelty will crop up a few pages further on. Ms. Brooks has the journalistic talent of the young Norman Mailer; she sees layers of meaning behind every scene she describes, most of it lost on the scene's participants. She brings to life the ghastly reality of life behind the minarets and souks. She exposes the hypocracy and outright lies of Islam's apologists, and gives us the straight story, no matter how it hurts. You can read Bernard Lewis to learn the academic side of modern Islam. You'll have to read Geraldine Brooks to find out how it sounds, smells, and feels."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"It seems to me that there will never be a book about Muslim women that will speak truth to both western non-Muslims and Middle Eastern Muslims. And that is because we are both biased in our own way. Lifestyle and religion is personal and subjective. Most westerners think that Muslim women are oppressed because of the way we live and were raised. Many westerners think everyone should live like us. Most Muslim women do not think that they are oppressed because of the way they live and were raised. Many Muslim women think that we should live more like them. We can both be open minded, and we can both learn something about each other, but our biases, years in the making, will still be there.As a western account, this book is well-written, thought-provoking, engaging, and it opened my eyes to want to learn more about Muslim women. I did NOT think she &quot;hated Islam and Arabic Muslims&quot;. I thought she was trying to understand them, even if she did not succeed. In some ways I was more sympathetic to Islam after reading this. In others, I was more critical.I agree that one cannot learn about Muslim culture from a non-Muslim westerner. I agree that I need to read books written by Muslim women. But if I *only* read books written by happy Muslim women, then they might leave out the parts about Islam that aren't so good.

American women (and men) need to have a better world view of all religions and cultural customs because we are not islands in this world. This book, with vignettes by many Arab women from desert nomad wives to Queen Noor of Jordan, gives an excellent overview of Muslim women's lives summed up best in the misused Biblical verse, &quot;Women, submit to your husbands.&quot; Talk about men shifting the blame to women for their own irresponsibility! This book plaintively showed me how Arabian women live very lonely and often appalling lives based on forced submission to men, physical, mental and spiritual abuse, including female clitoridectomy, stoning, no educational opportunities, limited communication with others and forced limitation on travel. What a waste of 50% of the human potential of these countries. But, you know, I can't think of any fundamentalist group of any religion where women do not suffer the blame: loss of all rights to reproductive freedom, educational and career opportunities. This book is an illustration of what can happen when fundamentalists of any stripe create doubt, fear, exclusion and intolerance amongst the public. Use the minds that God gave you: think, read and ponder what we can do as a society for the good of the world and ALL its people. Stop the exclusion. Stop the blame and the hate.

Once a liberating religion of 7th-century Arabia, Islam was almost immediately taken over by extremists upon the death of the Prophet Muhammed. Today modern-day Islamic countries are cowed into submission by Islamic fundamentalists, and it should come as no surprise to anyone with any experience with religious fundamentalism that women once again get the short end of the stick.Much of what passes for Islamic practice in modern-day Islamic countries is supported by neither the Koran nor the hadiths (anecdotes and teachings) of the Prophet. The author travelled all over the Middle East and presents both the good side and the bad side of Islamic practice today. She points out that life is not as repressive in Iran as it is in say, Saudi Arabia. She shows how the Palestinians used to be at the forefront of womens' rights in the Middle East and how they've since been consumed by the fundamentalists. She spoke to the women, the mullahs, the bureaucrats, the husbands--a wide variety of people in various cultures. She questions why the Moslems have adopted every misogynistic practice, from veiling to polygamy to female genital mutilation, from their pagan conquests as they spread Islam throughout that part of the world.This is an excellent overview of the status of women in Moslem countries today.

This book was so interesting it was difficult to put down. She tells us about women she meets on her travels through several Middle Eastern countries, describing the erosion of women's rights as the fundamentalists gain influence. Several reviewers denied what she writes is true, how can you blame them? Of course they are ashamed of the way men treat them in their societies. They don't want their ill treatment tied to the Islamic religion, but as the author points out, all you have to do is read the Koran to find out that it endorses wife beating, polygamy &amp; child marriage, says that women's testimony is worth less than men's, that women shall inherit less than men, etc., etc. The Koran clearly describes women as second -class citizens. It is very sad to read that there are so many people living without freedom and justice in the 21st century. The world needs brave ladies like Geraldine Brooks who will go out and report the truth wherever they find it."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"I wish Ms. Brooks would update this book as a lot has happened since 1995. Still, it is a solid, well-written book on women and Islam. I found it very helpful as I am mostly ignorant about the subject. Always a pleasure to read a book by a masterful writer who happens to have an open mind and be an accomplished journalist!"},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"I read this book in only a few days, because with everything going on in the world today, I felt I had to educate myself, to the best of my ability, about what is happening in the Arab world. Coming from a Western country, with a Western mentality regarding the equality of men and women and the separation of church and state, I wanted to try to understand what it is like to live in a muslim country, as a muslim woman. What I learned about these women's way of life shocked and saddend me, because it is so foreign to me that I have a hard time processing what it must be like for them.What I learned in this book I will carry with me for the rest of my life, because it has helped me to have a greater understanding of the Arab world, that could not be different from mine. I learned that in extremist muslim countries the women must be veiled, basically, at all times, they may not look at other men, they must not touch unrelated men, meaning they may not even shake hands with unrelated men, they should not speak to unrelated men, because their voice may cause the men to lust after them, in Saudi Arabia women are not allowed to drive, the list goes on.I respect other people's religion, but this book is about what the woman are subjected to that the Koran says nothing about, but is enforced by the fundamantalists, claiming it to be for the women's own good. These woman are to this day subjected to \\"Honor\\" killings, meaning women are killed for dishonoring their male relatives, for example if they are suspected of no longer being virgins, and genital mutilation, their clitoris is scraped away to reduce sexual desire; the Koran does not support these things. The author says it best in the following passage: \\"If some nintety million little boys were having their penises amputated, would the world have acted to prevent it by now? You bet.\\"Women need to know what is going on with other women around the world, not only so that we can possibly help, but also gain some undertanding of what these women have to deal with before some of us sneer at a woman covered from head to toe, because most of us think they all have a choice. The majority of women do not have a choice, they are controlled by their male relatives, in a society that caters to males, who are sanctioned, by the Koran, to beat their wives if necessary. I respect a muslim woman for wanting to be covered and other religions expressions of faith, but we need to open our eyes to the women whose lives are out of their hands and run by men.Please, read this book, it will broaden your horizons and hopefully help you understand, well, at least to some extent."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"I could not put this book down!! I'm embarrassed to admit how little I truly knew about the Islamic religion or where and how women fit into it. I was mortified at alot of what I read. We, especially now, need to try and understand this religion and it's many factions. Geraldine Brooks does an amazing job writing, presenting, and wrapping up her glimpse into this very secretive world. I feel it's a book everyone, especially women, should read! Enjoy."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"You may not care to hear my oppinion because I am a non-Muslim Western white man but here goes. I'll excuse you if you flip to the next review. What I like so much about Geraldine Brooks book is the same thing I loved so much when I read &quot;1984&quot; by George Orwell. It is a portrait of complete domination of individual lives by a social order pretending to be their defender, thier protector. It reveals a society which completely extinquishes person freedoms but claims to be doing exactly the opposite. Double-speak, remember that. I'm amazed at Geraldine Brooks' retstraint at not venting rage at this sytem where people own the lives of other people. Where some people are treated no better then domestic pets.(however kindly) We did have slavery in America. We too were bind to it because we were in the middle of it. There were many passionate defenders. I'm certain many slaves resented Harriet Beacher Stowe for her book as I see people are critical of Brooks for hers. If a person has a free choice to subject themselves to a set a rules that is one thing. But if women NEVER experience free choice. If they are indoctrinated when they are born. If they are threatened for thinking for themselves and if they are comdemned for questioning the legitimacy of the social order (which is so much against them) then such a life is should be revealed for what it is. Truth hurts. I congratulate Geraldine Brooks for her courage."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"This is the third book that I've read that outlines the plight of Muslim women as a whole. Yes I'm sure, there must be plenty exceptions to the brutality and inhumanity that is outlined in these books and the stories that are depicted are most likely, the worst cases the authors came across but what comes through with disturbing clarity, is a systemic, religious, abusive, misogynistic undercurrent against all women of Islam, which varies in intensity from country to country (infidel women don't even count).Nine Parts of Desire is written by prizewinning Wall Street Journal correspondent, Geraldine Brooks and is based upon her experiences during the seven years she was stationed in the Middle East. She gets the title for her book from an old Muslim proverb \\"God created sexual desire in ten parts; then he gave nine parts to women and one to men.\\"Brooks does try to provide a more balanced view of Islam than previous authors have presented, however the bottom line remains the same - that Muslim women, in most Muslim countries, live at the whim and total dependence of their husbands or their male relatives. Brooks tries to explain and I do believe her, that this untenable situation is not sanctioned by the Muslim Holy book, the Quran. In fact she maintains that the Quran and Hadiths (sayings of the Prophet) of Islam's original message actually gave women sweeping rights that were unheard of in the Seventh Century. These rights included the right of inheritance and the right of divorce.Brooks claims that the rights of women started to erode early on as Islamic armies spread the word of the one true God in the Seventh and Eighth Centuries, by borrowing and adopting those anti-woman customs to which they were exposed. Islam adopted the royal Persian custom of veils, accepted gender mutilation from Egypt and when it found societies in which women had little or no voice in public affairs, its own traditions of lively women's participation withered. Women in the time of Muhammad rode camels and horses, ran businesses and even fought with the armies, yet woman of today are generally timid, fearful and backward, especially in the less progressive countries or the more primitive areas of large progressive countries.Nine Parts of Desire tends to concentrate on those countries where the author spent the most time and had Muslim women friends, namely Iran, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates, Jordan, Lebanon and even Palestine.CONCLUSIONNine Parts of Desire is a laconic, well written book of 289 pages. Though it is a relatively short book, Brooks manages to disseminate a torrent of information. There is also a useful glossary of Arabic terms in the back as well.Though Brooks does not make excuses for the troubling situation Muslim women find themselves, she does point out that those who condemn these practices in the West, tend to overlook parallel though less overt treatment of women around the world, including in the West. I agree that there are wife beatings, even killings in America but at least it is against the law. A woman could be stoned to death in Saudi Arabia if she has been found to have had sex out of wedlock. This requires testimony of four male witnesses, who in one case, I read about in another book, were the girl's accusers but were in realitly her rapists. Brooks on one hand show how Muslim women are discriminated against but also points out that many women claim to like their present status and point out the advantages of being anonymously cloaked. These tend to be older women who are afraid of change.A by product of Brook's writing, though most likely inadvertently was the appearance that Islamic society appears to be grossly inefficient. Prohibitions against the full integration of women in most of these countries make some of the simplest tasks virtual impossibilities. As an example she tells of a surveyors inability to conduct a poll in Saudi Arabia for laundry detergent. Saudi women are forbidden from talking to males outside of the family and females if allowed to work at all are restricted to jobs such as medicine or teaching.I think Nine Parts of Desire would be a good place to start for any reader that is interested in getting a balanced view of how women of Islam fair in various countries and the outlook for more liberal women's rights.Final Rating 3.9 Stars"},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Other reviewers have lamented that Brooks focused on the Middle East in general and on Saudi Arabia in particular to the detriment of providing insight into Muslim societies outside of the Arab world. Perhaps a quote from the book explains why Brooks made this deliberate choice:\\"...Saudi Arabia is the extreme. Why dwell on the extreme, when it would be just as easy to write about a Muslim country such as Turkey, led by a woman, where one in six judges is a woman, and one in thirty private companies has a woman manager?I think it is important to look in detail at Saudi Arabia's grim reality because this is the kind of sterile, segregated world that Hamas in Israel, most mujahedin factions in Afghanistan, many radicals in Egypt and the Islamic Salvation Front Algeria are calling for, right now, for their countries and for the entire Islamic world. None of these groups is saying, \\"Let's recreate Turkey, and separate church and state.\\" Instead, what they want is Saudi-style, theocratically enforced repression of women, cloaked in vapid cliches about a woman's place being the paradise of her home...\\"Brook's book was published in 1995. Nine years later, her assessment of Saudi Arabia's corrosive influence beyond its borders is still valid. Today, Wahabbi extremism, funded by Saudi backers, has spread out even further into the Philippines, Chechnya, Western Europe and the US in its most virulent and deadly form, terrorism. 9/11 hijacker Mohammed Atta's last written words requesting that no woman attend to his dead body betrays a poisoned philosophy that hates life as much as it hates women.Yes, Brooks expresses her opinion in every chapter. She is no more objective about religiously inspired misogyny than one can be about Nazis. To expect a completely neutral essay about either topic denies an understanding of the subject's inherent evil."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Frustrated at having to stay in the office while her journalist husband explored the exciting, adventurous, and dangerous sides of the Middle East, Wall Street Journal correspondent Geraldine Brooks eventually realized, through her assistant Sahar, a door that was open only to her: the world of women. Literally overnight Sahar changed from a fun-loving Cairo sophisticate in make up, mini-skirts, and stilettos, to a devout believer in hijab. Of the many questions that whirled around in Ms. Brooks's mind as she watched Sahar struggle with her new identity, one in particular stood out: \\"Why?\\" Using her own words: \\"To find the answers, I did something so obvious I couldn't believe it had taken me a year to get around to it. I started talking to women.\\"Ms. Brooks spent the next several years traveling around the Middle East and North Africa, talking to women. Through the voices of women she addresses issues such as hijab, polygamy, female genital mutilation, education, careers, and voting for women. She shares poignant interviews and conversations with Ayatollah Khomeini's daughter Zahra, Queen Noor, and wives of the heads of fundamentalist groups. Sprinkled throughout are fascinating vignettes of the wives of Mohammad. Far from being biased or stereotypical, this book gives a realistic picture of the world of women in the Middle East. Ms. Brooks shares the bad: such as Rahme who was forced to live with a co-wife in order to keep her children, and Margaret, an American who became the virtual slave of her mother-in-law, and the good: such as a woman who chose Iran over the United States because of the love and support of her husband's Iranian family, and Faiza who managed to become a prominent journalist in Saudi Arabia. She discusses the Islamic revolution in Iran not only in terms of repression, but also the ways in which it liberated women. She portrays the Islamic world as neither bad nor good; instead a mixture of both, as is anywhere else in the world.This book is a journey to discover the women living in the modern world yet bound by law centuries old. Ms. Brooks states that clearly and at no time is the purpose of the book construed to be anything greater or lesser than a quest for understanding. She does not claim to be a feminist or an Islamic scholar, and any criticism of her for not living up to either title is completely unwarranted because neither were the purpose of her book. Through her press badges, friends, connections, and sheer determination, Ms. Brooks was able to gain access to many places in which most of us will never venture. From remote villages in Saudi Arabia to Palestinian refugee camps to the rocky hillsides of Eritrea, Ms. Brooks has given Islamic women a voice. She has given us the gift of their stories, so that we too may come to our own understanding of the question \\"Why?\\"To those who question the validity of the stories she shares about Mohammad and his wives, I would like to point out that one does not become a correspondent for the Wall Street Journal by using faulty sources. I have read many of the books in the bibliography inserted in the back of the book, and it's all there. If you do not wish to take her word for it, by all means do some extra reading. As Mohammad's life was heavily documented, it is not hard to find relevant materials. I recently bought a book by Mumtaz Moin, entitled \\"Umm al Mu'minin A'ishah Siddiqah, and virtually every account given by Ms. Brooks about Aisha is in there: Ms. Brooks's superb writing however, gives life and vibrancy to the centuries-old accounts.\\"Nine Parts of Desire\\" is one of my favorite books. Geraldine Brooks is an extremely talented writer, and it is a joy to read. There are few books I could recommend more highly; it deserves 10 stars."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"My first instinct upon reading this book was to write a classic western feminist review about just how horrific life is for Muslim women. But all the reviews by other readers made me step back and think again. I'm still extremely glad that I read this book but it is a book to take with the proverbial grain of salt. The following are some of the thoughts this book provoked for me....First, it is interesting to me that the book turns conventional political wisdom on it's head in terms of &quot;friendly&quot; and &quot;enemy&quot; states. From Brooks point of view, Iran and Iraq are actually pretty good places to be a woman if access to some political power and fitness are the standards. Alternatively, our Desert Storm ally, Saudi Arabia, is a place that is far less in tune with American values, if measured in terms of the western standard of women's rights. I also felt that Brooks didn't spend enough time on two geographic categories - women in the small Gulf States and Muslim women in European and American societies.On a separate note, maybe I'm naive but it seemed pretty absurd to me that all this separation of the sexes is simply because the sight of a woman's flesh or the sound of a woman's voice could cause unpure/sexual thoughts. Well, I mentioned this to my husband who basically said &quot;well, yeah, those those things do cause those sorts of thoughts.&quot; So now I'm left to ponder whether Islam is trying to fight the inevitable tide of lustful thoughts or if maybe it has the right idea. Maybe Dave Barry is right when in his book &quot;Complete Guide to Guys&quot; he says &quot;I'm not saying that womend don't think about sex. I'm saying that women are capable, for at least brief periods of time, of not thinking about sex, and the most guys are not.&quot;Likewise, as a Unitarian Universalist, I'd like to think that there are positives and negatives in all religions and cultures. Yes, I find the idea of clitorectomies pretty horrific. Still, it seems like most of the western women I know are experiencing the functional equivalent of sexual drive neutralizing in the form of exhaustion as they persue the western ideal lifestyle. And it's not like we don't have our fair share of fundamentalists who would like to see women back in the home and dressing &quot;properly&quot;.Bottom-line: Not a book to swallow as the absolute truth but a book that can be a valuable place to start in thinking about different ways of dealing with the differences between men and women. (And while I missed the discussion, my book group reports that this was a dandy book for a lively debate.)"},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Books by journalists tend to contain errors of fact, roughshod generalizations, and questionable judgments. They usually provide masses of routine and well-known information. How refreshing, then, this study of Muslim women by The Wall Street Journal's former Middle East correspondent. It boasts not just a well-researched base but much new information and a strikingly new thesis. Brooks manages that rare mix, the immediacy of a reporter's experience and the solidity of a research paper.Each chapter in &quot;Nine Parts&quot; deals with an aspect of the female Muslim life, both the usual subjects (virginity, weddings, education) and the less so (commerce, politics, warfare). Perhaps the most colorful chapter deals with the Islamic Women's Games in Iran, where men could attend the opening ceremony but not the actual competitions-so that women could get on the track and strip down to their Lycra shorts.The most valuable aspect of Brooks's reportage is to show the diversity of fundamentalist Islamic approaches to women. Most striking is the contrast between Saudi Arabia, where women have effectively no public role, and Iran, where they serve in parliament and are steadily pushing back the limits. This leads the author to an unexpected but persuasive conclusion: \\"I found the brightest hope for positive change camouflaged among the black chadors of devout Iranian women.\\"Middle East Quarterly, September 1995"},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"If you want a good and wide perspective of why women wear the veil and &quot;submit&quot; to the clerics and family demands of the Hajib and chador, read this book.If you want to try to gain an insight on Islamic countries, and their ideas of America, read this book.It is not all-emcompassing and will not explain the histories and policitical formations of islmanic countries. But it is not designed to do so. It is about women and islam, in some of the most strict &quot;islamic&quot; countries.What it will do is give you an appreciation and insight about the differences found in the countries that make up the &quot;Middle East&quot;. It will give you some degree of insight about why some choose to follow the more fundamental interpretations of Islam. And it will definately inform you of the differences of each country's cultural interpretation (through the eyes of women and the journalist) of fundamental Islam.I purchased this book in 1996 during a business trip. I found that I could not put it down and finished it in two days. It filled in the gaps of the texts I read on Islam and the Middle East in College. I was very impressed by the accessibility of the writing and the information Ms. Brooks offers her readers.

I feel that Muslim women who take offense to this book are denying there is a problem. The book is well-written and passionate. The author, while a journalist, does not hide the personal effect this has had on her. The fact that so many women consider her experiences and depictions biased shows how little information leaks out. I suggest reading Amnesty Internationals World Wide reports on this region. There are many, many documented cases and studies that show this is a growing problem in need of attention.

I read 5 pages of \\"Nine Parts of Desire\\" was hooked finishing it today. Journalist/Author Geraldine Brooks has written her personal experience of exploring many of the world's fundamentalist Islamic countries -- Pakistan, Palestine, Egypt, Iran, Jordan among others. Upon finishing this book, I am floored at the power Islam has in our world. The Prophet Muhammed was as contradictory in his words as are the contradictions in the many factions of Muslims (Shiite, Sunii, Kurd). I feel that Ms. Brooks has given a clear picture of how women in Islam APPEAR to us in the Judeo/Christian/Buddist/Agnostic rest-of-the world....but I can't dispute what the Koran may or may not say. However, the \\"meat\\" of Geraldine Brooks's story is her personal experiences. We see the transformation of her assistant, the personalities of her guide, her talks with Ayatollah Khomeni's wife and daughters, lunch with the queen of Jordan and countless other experiences of women in Islam. Each having a varying interpretation of what the prophet Muhammed meant to say. Each wanting to change \\"their world\\" but having no real say-so as men make ALL decisions in the end....I highly recommend EVERY woman/man of ALL faiths consider reading this book.

The majority of muslims live in ASIA, places such as Indonesia, Malaysia, southern Thailand and AFRICA, not just northern African countries that you hear so much of nowadays such as Egypt and ALgeria but countries such as Kenya, Ghana and Nigeria. I do not condone any of the atrocities that take place in the name of Islam in ANY countries, but I am highly offended when someone can write a book, stating various &quot;facts&quot; such as hadiths that she has no source to back up.

The author obviously went in with the pinion that women were being mistreated in the Islamic world, a perception she &quot;supports&quot; with various unrelated examples. The book is obviously biased toward the author's western viewpoint of the status of women, and she applies her cultural standards to other cultures--something no self-respecting anthropologist (or journalist, in her case) should do.I will say one thing in the book's defense, and it is that through it all, she tries to remind readers that what goes on is some countries is in direct opposition to the example set by the prophet Muhammad. She makes an effort to separate what Islam requires/suggests regarding women, and what certain countries and people do to women in the name of Islam, and for that I thank her.

I am an Arabic Muslim, 21 years old young lady and I study Electrical Engineering.. I never had a problem being proud of whom I am, and where I belong to .. Im very happy in my life, respected and loved, and have a freedom to have my own desires in life, make my own decisions, follow my dreams, and I have the right to choose my way of doing that too. Islam doesnt keep us from doing that, it encourages me to be the best I can be, and all the men who are a part of my life do that too.We are more respected than many women in different parts of the world who look at women as symbols of sex more than they respect her brain, women in the west suffer from high rate of physical and emotional abuse, why do women from other religions then consider reading about Islam, believing in it and getting into it! its because they dont find the respect they are looking for in their cultures and societies. Islam is Kind, Islam respects a woman and protects her, and we all feel that.I dont know why did the Author bother and write about us, if she didnt write to tell the truth then why did she write?

Brooks does her best to pass rumour as fact and distortions as the truth. Her rendition of life for Muslim women encompasses every single racist stereotype of Muslims. From Islam as a women-hating religion to Muslim men as sex-crazed, uncontrolled individuals to the myth that the &quot;Green Menace&quot; is making its way to the shores of Europe and Austraila. She even makes a false correlation between the weight gain of her assistant with modest dress. She decontextualizes verses from the Qur'an isolating single lines to support her distorted notion of Islam. Her book is of value in two ways: it represents the worst in scholarship (actually, she is neither scholar nor expert of the Middle East or Islam) and it illustrates how cultural mores are assumed to be of Islamic in origin by her interviewees. Only someone who has familiarity of Islam would be able to make this connection because Brooks fails to make this simplistic mental leap. Instead, she portrays Islam as a monolithic religion of oppression. Her tone is outright condescending. If you want a fairer representation of Islam and its treatment of women or of Islam in general, I recommend three titles &quot;Qur'an and Woman&quot; by Amina Waddud and &quot;Windows of Faith, Muslim Women Activist Scholars in North America&quot; ed.

Brooks tries her best to be a scholar, but she simply can't overcome her journalistic tendencies. So the book ends up being really great for someone who kinda sorta wants to know about women in Islam but doesn't want to think about it any deeper than a surface level.Brooks plays up the negative and down plays the positive. Here is a synopsis of her argument: countries in the &quot;Islamic world&quot; are oppressive to women and inhumane! Freedom is restricted, human rights are constantly violated and life is basically a dismal affair for women. Oppressed, oppressed, beat up and knocked around, forced to wear layer upon layer of clothing in very hot desert climate, female circumcision (which is perpatuated by women themselves), the presentation of gross generalizations as fact, etc etc. These countries are backwards and the &quot;West&quot; is definitely better off, modern, full of equality and justice, the feminist movement, etc etc. (Oh yeah and by the way, where as the United States has never had a female present, in 1994 women led 3 Islamic countries. But let's forget that because I want to tell you about more atrocities. And nevermind the positive spin I COULD have put on things, because I have an agenda to push)Brooks is a journalist, not a scholar.

She's an anthropologist.As a side note, reviewers shouldn't use the term &quot;cultural relativism&quot; unless they understand its meaning. And the ideas and intentions behind its use... You can be culturally relative and still believe that certain cultural practices are inherently wrong. No one is unbiased anyway. The point is to be aware of them. It's something Brooks often chose not to do, which is what makes her book such a shoddy rag."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"This book was very interesting. I read it as part of a very white anglo book club. I highly recommend it for book clubs as it really gets some great discussion going. I hope that there are some isalmic women who see themselves in this book and decide to change. What a sad lifestlye however, the American fifties housewife was not much more enlightened. Change takes time."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"I enjoyed the book quite a bit and i found it to be fairly educational. I think those that bash the book are ignorning the parts where she points out that it isn't Islam that is the cause for the opression of women, but the interpretation and/or ignorance of some Muslims (or at least who call themselves Muslims :-) ). The book even put the Ayatollah Khomeini in a somewhat positive light. I'm not saying it made him out to be one outstanding guy, but certainly not the hate monger that the West made him out to be. The book also pointed out how the Revolution in Iran actually helped out many women in that country. The point is Brooks does is not completely negative towards the treatment of women in the M.East nor towards islam.On the other hand, the book is not totally faultless. She does not make it clear where she gets some of her information, as some other reviewers have pointed out. In addition, it seems as though she is a bit ignorant on the culture of the Middle East and a bit too stuck in the Western mind set for someone writing on a different part of the world. Nevertheless it is a good book that does provide at least some insight into the lives of women in the Middle East."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"What a wonderful read! I love all of Brooks' book, but I think this is the best by far! She takes the reader into a forbidden world. What a journey!"},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"As far as a comprehensive look on women living under Islam I have found no better. From the most restrictive (Saudi Arabia) to the most liberal (Egypt) one is presented with a fascinating glimpse of what it must be like to be female and to live in a Middle Eastern world. In Chapter 7 A Queen the author even writes of how an American woman (the former Lisa Halaby now Queen Noor) marries the King of Jordan, converts to Islam then having to face her own challenges adjusting to a slow-to-accept Islamic society. The author also writes of other American women married to Middle Eastern men and living in their respective countries subject to the same type of restrictions other Islamic women have had to face.Already in the Preface of the book I was shocked to learn that the wearing of the Islamic hijab (the veiled attire) for one of the author's colleague's signified \\"acceptance of a legal code that valued her testimony at half the worth of a man's, an inheritance system that allowed her half the legacy of her brother, a future domestic life in which her husband could beat her if she disobeyed him, make her share her attentions with three more wives, divorce her at whim and get absolute custody of her children.\\" I could not imagine any intelligent, well educated American woman born and raised in a democratic society ever learning to tolerate such injustice. Betty Mahmoody who later wrote her bookNot Without My Daughtercertainly lived to experience her nightmare \\"of an American wife who agrees to visit her husband's family in Tehran only to find herself trapped there by Iranian laws that forbid women to leave the country without their husband's permission.\\" Mahmoody's book does indeed \\"give an unremittingly bleak picture of life in Iran, describing wife beatings, filthy houses and vermin-infested food.\\"In contrast the author writes in Chapter 5 of a certain Janet from Kansas City who \\"gradually found herself coming to love many aspects of her life in Iran. She found that Iranians lavished affection on the few Americans who stayed. Some Iranians had warm memories of American teachers or technicians who had helped the country while even those who saw Americans only as rapacious exploiters felt that Janet, by staying, had aligned herself with Iran. Instead of being greeted with hostility, she found herself welcomed everywhere--pushed to the front of food lines, given the best meat and helped in every possible way.\\" Yet at the end of this same chapter the story of Margaret, another American born Islamic wife, is highlighted. Her husband accustomed to going on long business trips to America had, instead of taking her for a visit to her parents, chose to leave her behind to do the chores for his mother and sister: \\" 'My mom's not too pleased' she said. 'She calls up and says, 'You waiting on his relatives again? ' She knows they're working me to death. She wants me to come home.'\\" Yet, when asked by the author why she had not taken up her mother's advice and go home for a while Margaret \\"straightened her hunched shoulders and kneaded the small of her back with a clenched fist. 'I can't' she said \\"My husband doesn't want me to.\\" It was up to him to sign the papers that would allow her to leave the country.\\" How truly sad a scenario!Some Islamic countries, however, seemed to have a more open mind when it came to military service. In Chapter 6 Jihad Is For Women Too the author wrote of how the Emirates' president Sheik Zayed's wife, Sheika Fatima, offered the radical solution of recruiting women to deal with the manpower shortage. Hessa al-Khaledi, a friend of the sheika's, and the first woman civil engineer in that country was delegated to solve the problems of recruiting the Emirates' first women soldiers and \\"reconciling the religous establishment to their existence.\\" A major problem came up with who would train these women. The Emirates only qualified instructors were men and that was unthinkable. \\"The answer was obvious to anyone who had watched the U.S. military descend on nearby Saudi Arabia. There, U.S. Army women were flying troop transports, maintaining missile batteries, trucking munitions to the front lines, The Emirates asked the U.S. Army if it could spare a few of its senior speciailists whose average length of service was fourteen years. Their commander, Major Janis Karpinski, was already serving in Saudi Arabia.\\" Major Kapinksi, who years later was promoted to Brigadier General Karpinski wrote of this in her bookOne Woman's Army: The Commanding General of Abu Ghraib Tells Her Story.This is all well in good up until you read Chapter 10 Politics, With and Without a Vote. Out of everything I read in this book the story of what happened to a group of university educated, high achieving women from what Saudis call \\"good families\\" was the MOST shocking. The author described how in November 1990 forty-seven women, driven by their chauffeurs, met on the parking lot of the Al Tamimi supermarket in downtown Riyadh. There, dismissing their drivers, about a quarter of them slid into the drivers' seats of their cars, the rest taking their places as passengers. A few blocks later members of the Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice stopped the cars at the intersections ordering the women out of the drivers' seats. Soon regular police arrived, the women were yelled at that they had committed a religious crime and the police drove the women's cars to police headquarters with the woman in the back. The author goes on: \\"While the women were held at the police station, Prince Salman summoned a group of prominent relgious and legal experts to discuss what they had done. The legal scholars concluded that no civil violation had occurred, since the women all had international drivers' licenses recognized by Saudi law. The religious representatives found that no moral issues were at stake, since the women were veiled and the Koran says nothing that could be construed as forbidding an act such as driving. The women were released.\\" One would think that when the women who had taken part in the demonstration returned to work the next day at the university they \\"would have been greeted as heroines by their all-women students. Instead, some found their office doors daubed with graffiti, criticizing them as un-Islamic. Others found their classes boycotted by large numbers of conservative students. Soon denunciations spewed from the mosques. Leaflets flooded the streets...Predictably the womens' phones began ringing off the hook with abusive calls. If their husbands answered, they were told to divorce their whorish wives, or berated for being unable to control them.\\" This was NOT the WORST part of this however. These women ended up being BETRAYED by the ruling family who instead of standing by them on Islamic grounds, proclaiming that what the EXTREMISTS were doing was entirely contrary to the Koran, caved to THEIR pressure: \\"Prince Salman's committee's findings were quickly buried. Instead, the government suspended the women from their jobs and confiscated their passports.\\" To add insult to injury a week after the demonstration: \\"Prince Naif bin Abdul Aziz, the interior minister, joined the slanderers. At a meeting in Mecca he denounced the demonstrations as a \\"stupid act\\" and said some of the women involved were raised outside Saudi Arabia and \\"not brought up in an Islamic home.\\" He then read out a new fatwa, or ruling with the force of law, from Saudi Arabia's leading sheik Abdul Aziz bin Baz stating that women driving contradicted 'Islamic traditions followed by Saudi citizens'. If driving hadn't been illegal before, it was now. \\"Although some sixteen years old now, this is still an OUTSTANDING book about life for Islamic women in their respective countries. As a Lithuanian-American who was encouraged to seek as much higher education as I could, never treated as property by either my father OR my husband I feel extremely fortunate to be living in the United States free of such restrictions. The Islamic faith does appear to have some real problems in its interpretation and application of the teachings of the Koran. I had previously read Irshad Manji's bookThe Trouble with Islam Today: A Muslim's Call for Reform in Her Faithwhich describes this in great detail. I would highly recommend Manji's book in addition toNine Parts of Desire: The Hidden World of Islamic Women."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"What an excellent book for understanding the women of the Islamic world.

Her diligence in getting the latest information from her subjects, and sensitivity to those she interviews, as well as her story telling skills, draws me right into the pages. After reading her various books, I trust she has done her homework and is sharing with us the hearts and souls of the characters she interviews. The reader comes to understand how truly complex are the issues of women who practice this religion. I was unaware that the countrys in the Middle East and beyond who practice Islam, have their own interpretation of the Koran regarding the status of women based upon the political leanings of that group/country. A very alarming circumstance to those of us who live in an open society. These issues are truly complex and no easy solution is evident. My heart hurts for these sisters who don't have the right to explore how they would wish to live their lives. And my spirit deplores the anguish foisted upon these women by the men who supposedly love them. This book is a very enlightening read."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"While this book is not meant to be an anthropological analysis of Muslim women, it does give insight into the Muslim world at large.

I suggest this book to all."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"This is just one of the facts that I learned from this book. It became not just a fact but an insight as I continued reading it.The book's excellence is demonstrated in that 13 years after its publication it is still being read. Its continued relevance is evidenced by so many current reviews here on Amazon. Since its publication there have been many books on this topic, including social studies and personal narratives, but this one still stands out.Brooks spent 6 years in traveling to Middle Eastern Islamic countries covering the plight of women. While there is a chapter on Queen Nour, the book is primarily on the many anonymous middle class women who must submit to decisions about their lives, their health, their time, their children, where they can travel and even their dealth, all made by men. These men are not required, and most are not conditioned to, value her or consider her opinions or needs. They seem to be driven by their \\"honor\\" which is reflected by how well she masters the art of submission.Brooks gives the clearest presentation I've read on the origins of the anti-woman practices that are permitted. She describes Mohammed's relations with his wives and the aftermath of his death which set the stage for others to interpret and misinterpret his words and actions.The last chapter, where the author summarizes the issue and the lack of attention it receives world wide is pithy and strong."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"This book was published in 1995. To me, that makes it even more valuable than if it were published yesterday.It is a pre-9/11 account of the author's experiences \\"behind the veil\\" of many Islamic countries and cultures. Because it is pre-9/11, I don't feel like the author had any agenda other than to tell her story. And a fascinating story it is!I feel like this book helped me better understand Islamic cultures, the forces that have shaped the religion, and, most amazingly, why some Islamic women rushed to adopt the veil. (No, it wasn't a bad hair day.) Just comprehending the incomprehensible has value, especially today.But what is most troubling about this book is that it is hard to imagine how our Western culture and their culture can ever be reconciled. The author doesn't draw this conclusion, but it's hard not to draw it yourself. I hope I am wrong, but at least now my eyes are opened. Very important book!"},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"This was a good look into the exotic lives of Muslim women in these fundamentalist times. It was a story told from a journalists perspective. It read a bit like a newspaper story. Ms. Brooks reports her observations and experiences without too much bias, that I could see anyway. She certainly reports her personal reactions to some of the stories, but it seems she leaves the reader to form an opinion. The very last page or two she sums up her overall feelings of the female plight in the fundamentalist Muslim world. She is clearly concerned, but I wouldn't say she condemns the religion at all.Ms. Brooks does try to offer insights into why fundamentalist Muslim women would choose to wear the chador, why they would like their style of life even -- which they often do. I would have actually liked to have learned more about that. I feel like I developed a kernal of understanding about why Muslim women would want to wear hijab/chador and want to live the strict, fundamentalist life.My complaint about the book would be the editing maybe. Each chapter makes sense as being about a particular aspect of the lives of Muslim women. But the book still seems disjointed somehow. There is repetitiveness in themes. It seemed to become the same thing over and over. And it seemed incomplete, fragmented. That is why I am only giving it 3 stars.Geraldine Brooks also wrote The Year of Wonder which was an excellent historical fiction. I would hightly recommend that book."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Having travelled similar turf as the author as a vagabond of the sixties, I have followed the cultural and political happenings of this area avidly. This is the best book I have seen on this subject. Her objectivity struggles with her emotion in a Hesse-like manner throughout the book. I hope her work brings attention to the scandalous, inhumane treatment of women of Islam. As she states in the last paragraph on page 231 of her conclusion. \\"It becomes insuffient to look at Islam on paper, or Islam in history, and dwell on the inarguable improvements it brought to women's lives in the seventh century.\\" I could just see her stuggle over which adjective to use, finally compromising to go with \\"insufficient\\".&lt;"},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"This book makes for a very smooth and enjoyable read, but its analysis of the lives of Muslim women is faulty. First of all, like many books of its type, it falls into the trap of Muslim women= Arab women (the only non Arab country given any attention is Iran). In fact, as less than 20% of the world's Muslim population is Arab, no book purporting to deal with \\"Muslim women\\" can be complete if it ignores that other 80%.This book has also been accused of \\"tabloidism\\" in its search for facile conclusions and the way in which it seeks out the more \\"sensationalist\\" aspects of Muslim women's lives. The accusation has a lot of truth in it, and the way in which Ms Brookes promotes herself as an intrepid foreign correspondent is also a touch annoying. I'm not saying she is not a brave and competent journalist, just that it would be a bit more informative if the book dealt less with herself than with the women she interviews.All in all, I would say that Jan Goodwin's \\"Price of Honour\\" is a considerably more thoughtful and informed introduction to the same complex subject."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Geraldine Brooks's book, Nine Parts of Desire, gave me the background on the Islamic world that I needed in order to understand the views and behaviors of my coworkers and community members who follow Islam.

It would be great if books like this were required reading in high schools (along with a variety of literature exploring the different cultures and mores of the world)..."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"In Nine Parts of Desire the author brings us face to face with a range of Muslim women from various countries - Iran, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Eritrea, etc. - and gives us vivid sketches of what life is like for these women.Some of the women are educated (though what education means for a woman varies from place to place); others are barely literate. Some work outside the home; others rarely leave. Both married and unmarried women feature in the pages of this book - some from rural areas, others from large cities.What I chiefly liked about the book is that it doesn't shy from showing painful, vicious and puzzling things. Nor does it try to conceal beauty or positive circumstances. The portrait it paints of these women is not simple, but complex. Take one woman whom the author got to know well. She is from Iran, well-educated, who can readily discuss Persian poetry and her country's politics; she also calmly proclaims that Salman Rushdie should die and that Israel should be obliterated. One woman is married, has kids, and wears a veil; yet her husband, rather than keep her home as is his prerogative, is rearranging his business so that she can travel abroad and complete post-graduate work.More often than not, though, the women worry about whom they will marry. What was often the most painful to read were sections about women trapped in stifling marriages. Even when there wasn't physical abuse, there were limited or nonexistent personal choices (regarding work and travel outside the home, for example), opportunities denied, crushing housework, and pressure to have children, particularly male children. For the vast majority of women in these societies, personal advancement and fulfillment depends on how understanding and progressive their husbands, fathers, brothers or other male relatives are; an opportunity - for work, study, travel - can usually only be available if a man chooses to permit access to it.The author tries to make sense of what she sees, relating it to the Koran, and attempting to show how, in most cases, the strictest and most oppressive interpretations of the Muslim holy book are adopted, when there could be room for more openness, tolerance, and freedom for women. She also tries to understand why some horrid practices, such as female genital mutilation, that existed prior to Islam were taken up so readily in some parts of the Islamic world. Arguing that these practices were not originally Muslim does not mean that they can be ignored or that criticism is not warranted.The book offers a very complex portrait of the Muslim women that it presents, and the contradictions within the societies in which they live. Some of the women whole-heartedly defend their societies and support further adoption of fundamentalist religious rules; some try to rebel. There are women who accept and won't go too far in changing the status quo in their lives... yet they have their worries and private criticisms as well, or wish for things that they cannot, in the places they live, have. It's eye-opening to read, and it's wonderful that the author chose to give voice to these various women and, through them, illustrate the societies in which they live. It's also important to learn more about these societies, as more and more Muslims move to the western world; the author raises one example of a British trial case in which a man who murdered his wife got off on a lesser charge rather than premeditated murder, because the jury failed to understand that what he had committed was an honor killing rather than a spur-of-the-moment \\"crime of passion\\"."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"They say that nothing hurts more than the truth. Geraldine Brooks pulls no punches in illuminating Islam's darkest corners. I wept when I read it and I cannot condone any aspect of the cruelty perpetrated on women in the name of Islam."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Ms. Brooks presents a wonderfuly accurate portrayal of Islamic women in the Middle East. She does not discuss the more tolerant views of Muslims in Europe, America, or other parts of Asia.I can only speak for treatment of women in the Arabian Gulf States, and of them, she is VERY ACCURATE! I wish people could come and see for themselves, unfortunately, visitors visas are not issued here. If you want to know the TRUTH of how Arab women are treated and disrespected, please read this insightful book.I only wish she had had a male write of how men speak of women when the women are not around. After one hears those conversations, you will understand all you need to about a woman's place in society here. The best way to summerize this book is with the following, where Ms. Brooks quotes Iranian, Fatemeh Givechian,&quot;No doubt the policy led to more awareness of one's own gender, but not necessarily any increase in one's knowledge of the opposite gender. Sex segregation to this extent is not natural...There will emerge a dual society of male and female stranger to one another and unaware of each other's anxieties.&quot;"},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Yes, it's true, I bought this book from the library rather than return it to them. Isn't that awful! I have much contact with Muslim women and was intrigued by this book. It made me want to do as the author did and go live with them to experience their rich culture. The author shows, not a society of repressed women, but a society of women that have a wonderful life. Of course, each family is different. Some of the things in the book did not hold true for some of the Muslim women that I have talked to. However, this book does help in a great way to reveal the mystery behind the veil in a positive way, removing many of the stereotypes that the west generally has of women in the Middle East."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"This is not a simple book that tells us that all women who wear hijab are miserable; far from it. Here we have Leila, an American, who chooses the Islamic-Iranian way over the American one because when she was ill and her family was too busy to drop everything for her busy she kept thinking \\"if I were in Iran the family would drop everything. As soon as I was cured, I came back here and it really is a good life\\" (103). And Geraldine Brooks takes pains to point out that for many women like American-born Queen Noor it is, indeed, a good life. But she also points out that for other women: the women who suffer honor killings, clitoridectomy, inability to drive, inability to move around without a male relative's permission, inability to have a job that either their husband or the \\"politeness police\\" find inappropriate-it is not a good life. And that these women live not only in some exotic Middle Eastern country; they are also our next-door neighbors.And even as she finds it very agreeable to take a break from her own male-dominated world of journalism while \\"squatting on the floor of a Kurdish friend's kitchen, helping the women with the bread-making... surrounded by women [and doing] a task that was ours alone\\" (235), she is not at all pleased that a little boy is able to come in and break off tiny morsels of the bread while his sister is already \\"part of our bread-making assembly line. Why should he learn so young that her role was to toil for his pleasure?\\" (235)Indeed, why should he learn that at all?For in such a world; a world where women are behind a curtain; where they must do things for their husbands' or brothers' pleasure, there is not one world but two. In a book that looks at the lives Muslim women lead all over the world from Iran to Britain, Geraldine Brooks points out how the curtain segregating the men from the women has created in Islam \\"a dual society of male and female stranger to one another and unaware of each other's anxieties\\" (182).She writes of women who find this arrangement relaxing, of professional Muslim women who look for a perfect husband \\"for babies\\" and nothing else and she writes of families who struggle to find ways of doing things together in strictly segregated societies. She writes as much of happiness as of pain. But most of all she writes of segregation. Of two worlds: one for women and one for men and never the twain shall meet. And, in the end she asks us all, is this what we really want? Or will we make a stand against segregation based on sex? Should we not say even \\"in an era of cultural sensitivity that certain cultural baggage is contraband in our countries and will not be admitted\\" (238)?"},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"This book is NOT a Islam vs. other religions debate. I think what the author intially set out to do was capture the ill treatment of women in Middle Eastern countries, because - let's face it- it appears that most of them practice pretty nasty customs. However, she questioned the validity of Islam as a religion, which isn't wrong, except for the fact that quite a bit of her research isn't backed up legit scripture or hadith. Instead of saying so, she 'declared' a lot of customs in a fashion that made it appear as though they were solid facts when they aren't - which is primarily why I guess some Muslim people seem to take offense. I don't think that she could seperate culture from religion- and that's a view that many Americans share (especially post 9-11). She went in with a naive attitude, like these 3rd world countries were supposed to be in as good of state (economically,socially, etc.) as the US or the UK. You will find equal degree (not same) treatment in many South American and East Asian countries as well. Why she chose the Middle Eastern area, a region with continous conflict, to show a reflection of Muslim women, I don't know. Maybe picking countries like Bangladesh and Malaysia (the 2 most highly populated Muslim countries in the world - yet very different than Middle Eastern culture) would've given her story a different angle. That being said, I really enjoyed the book because it primarily focuses the impact on WOMEN during the political changes and revolts (most books about Middle Eastern conflict don't document the female perspective). Does it provide good religious arguement? No. Is it biased? About as biased as one would be if they were sheltered. The reality? She acts far too shocked to find out such treatment is going on. Read this book to open your eyes,but disregard it as a religious reference. It is still a must read."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"I have read many books related to Islam and this is one of the best. Many writers approach Islam with a political axe to grind, either intentionally seeking to defame the entire Muslim world or serving as apologist's for the religion's tendencies towards misogyny and violence.But Brooks, in contrast, comes across as an open minded journalist attemping to report honestly on her experinces living and working in the Middle East for six years. Yes, she's a Western secular feminist and she makes no secret of that being her personal perspective. But still she strives to maintain her journalistic objectivity and report on the wide range of differing opinions among Muslim women themselves. For instance, she describes her conversations with Muslim women that prefer to stay veiled as well as her talks with Muslim women that see veiling as oppressive and confining. She doesn't offer a blanket condemnation of the women who prefer to be veiled. But instead explains the cultural and religious basis for veiling while articulating her own liberal Western perspective that finds it to be a disturbing practice. She doesn't pull any punches in explaining some of the worst excesses of Middle Eastern Islamic culture, such as the Saudi Arabian father who murdered his own daughter for not being a virgin on her wedding night. But she also recognizes that early Islam, at least while under Muhammad's leadership, generally improved the status of women in the Arab world.Still Brooks makes it clear that it isn't so much what a religion claims to believe in but rather the real life actions of it's followers that truly matters. Islam has some admirable beliefs, such as its emphasis on helping the poor and needy. But still it's indisputable, at least from my liberal Western perspective, that women in the Muslim world are far too often treated as second class citizens and Brooks does a fine job of articulating this as well as many other aspects of life for women in the Middle East. Highly recommended!"},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Geraldine Brooks uses her experience as a journalist in Islam countries to write about the plight of Muslim women. She details some of the customs in these countries, from the veiling and seclusion of women to the \\"honor killings\\" of adulterous women by their male relatives. She points out the double standard and the hypocrisy of men who oppress their wives and yet whose own behavior is dishonorable and certainly not what the Koran demands of them. She describes the life of Muhammed and shows that many of the tenants of the religion he founded are based on making his own life more comfortable. This is an interesting and thought-provoking book."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"This is a fascinating book about the socio-political status and impacts of women throughout the history of Islam. I found the chapter that discusses the women in the Prophet's life VERY interesting, especially how it relates the ways in which those women (particularly Fatima and Aisha) still affect Islamic society's views of women.Contrary to what other reviewers would have you think, this book is not an indictment of Hijab, nor is it an indictment of women's status in Islamic culture; rather, it is an examination of how the status of women differs among the Islamic cultures of North Africa, Iran, Palestine, and the Arabian Peninsula.More particularly, it is an examination of how the modern-day status of women in those particular areas compares with and contrasts to what the status of women should be as set out in the Koran and various Hadiths. This is rather interesting when Brooks addresses FGM, and various (not all) leaders' silent consent of the practice in certain areas.All in all, this is a fascinating book that addresses several interesting points of women's status and women's roles in Revolutions and other fights.I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5, because Brooks does show some amount of bias in her writing; however, keep in mind that this book is also a memoir of her experiences in North Africa and the Middle East. This is not a text book, so you can't expect it to be completely free of bias."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"As a die hard feminist I was expecting to have no sympathy whatever for women accepting the veil but I found Geraldine's book impossible to put down. Like women all over the world who use icons and fashions, veiled women have an enormous range of emotions about it, ranging from profound significance to seeing it as a useful cover-up and provider of privacy in public. I now appreciate more the significance of the veil and the reasons women have for wearing it against, or for, their will. As a symbol of all female issues, the most profound of which is freedom to live as an individual and equal, I realize the beauty of Geraldine's book's simplicity for neophytes in Islam like me. Many, many kudos for taking the role of independent reporter and female in perhaps the toughest possible assignment."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"I suppose I have read both better and worse books about \\"women and Islam\\". I suppose I had high hopes for this book, given the general descriptors. My main complaint is that the author presents many heavy handed stereotypes and the standard misinformation, and that is that.Since there are many long reviews of this book, I will simply state that as a parallel format book, Price of Honor will educate those who really desire accurate information more than this book will ever. And by the by, I have TONS of books on the subject!"},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"My review is very simple. In many ways, Brooks' book is enlightening. A minority of her examples should be given some definite thought, especially by Islamic scholars and jurists everywhere (case in point, is the issue of preventing women from attending men's soccer games in Saudi Arabia).Her observations on &quot;Muslim culture&quot;--as distinct from &quot;Islam,&quot; the religion practiced by Prophet Muhammad--are keen. She manages to find internal inconsistencies within the laws of the nations whose rich, corrupt leaders purport to call &quot;Islamic.&quot;However, Brooks, like so many other arrogant, Western &quot;scholars,&quot; tries to interpret the Qur'an and Islamic history without even knowing Arabic. Scholars of Islam dedicate their lives to the extensive study of Arabic and the nuances of text and interpretation of the Qur'an, and only then do they arrive at conclusions and fatwas (legal opinions). To have skipped this essential part of understanding, Brooks is either extremely intelligent or extremely careless. I believe the latter is more likely.What is funny to me are the reviews by the established book critics that appear in the Amazon.com description for this book. Not one of those reviews has people who are knowledgeable about Islam. They claim this knowledge by voicing their support for Brooks' understanding of Islam. I find it ridiculous that the ignorant confirm the knowledge of ignorant.Such is often the case, however, with these Western journalists, whose avowed aim when it comes to Islam and Muslims, it seems, is simply to denigrate, dehumanize, and vilify. Never to understand, empathize, or sympathize. This is comical on one hand, horrific on another."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"I read this book, and found it to be an accurate desription of life as a Muzlamic woman. My daughter and son, Leena and Carl, were kidnapped to Iran (that dreaded terrorist fundamentalist muzlamic state), by their non custodial father. Another true book and hit movie that shows the pain of an american woman who lost her child to a terrorist is Not Without My Daughter. I feel that both of these books will help to expose the terrors of Islam."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Great book to read ,it unviels the real status of women in Islam, many people say,it is a tradition, and not the the Islamic sources, Therefore if you read this book ,you should read the book ,&quot;Why I am not a Muslim&quot; by Ibn Warraq ,Chapter (Women in Islam) Then you will find out the truth by yourself."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"I am especially amazed at the false information presented in the chapter \\"The Prophet's Women.\\" Many of the hadith mentioned are considered weak or wrong. Many of the Koranic verses are taken out of context and highly misunderstood and words were taken out of the verses to change the meaning. I'm not saying the book is 100% false, but it is significantly false. I am very much disappointed with it, in fact. It only perpetuates negative stereotypes about the religion which are completely unnecessary."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"This truly was a fascinating read and I could not help but appreciate Geraldine Brooks' devotion in her interviews and putting this work together. Written in the 90s (aka pre-9/11 world and view of the Middle East) she tries to figure out the whys between traditions and laws regarding Islamic women. Brooks is a lovely writer and her works paints a vivid image of Iran and other countries, as well as various women she meets. That said... I can't help but consider this a feminist work. Most of Brooks' conclusions dwell on negativity and harshness. Indeed, it's hard for a person to fully understand another mindset and Brooks does her best to be understanding. And good qualities is mentioned.Brooks tries her best to be unbiased, so I guess I can't fault her for that. But maybe an effort to speak of more good would be appreciated."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"This book gives the reader an excellent way to obtain a view into the lives of woman living in the middle east; with readable definations and historical prespectives that explain middle eastern ways. Geraldine Brooks real life accounts make this a valuable resource and interesting read."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"I am a muslim woman and very proud of it. The writer has no respect for the religion, and did not even try to understand the culture! Many westerners could find this book entertaining, it confirms all the stereotypes, but everything is relative in life, and this is what is hard for the Americans to see, because their only beleive if that the way to be is the American way!I am an engineer in an American company, I disliked this book very much eventhought I am not a fanatic (some reviewers claimed that only the fanatics dislikes this book)There are many exellent books written by MUSLIM women on MUSLIM women... Please read those and not this one!I have seen 100 times more non-muslim women complaining about Islam, than muslim women... Thanks for complaining for us... we do not need it!"},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"I read this book twice, and I still can't believe I spent money on it.Geraldine Brooks' book is nothing more than an attempt to &quot;prove&quot; the same, old tired allegations and stereotypes held against Islam and Muslims. It seemed to me that she not only hated Muslims, but Arabs and Persians (Iranians) as well. I can not understand the source for her hostility and unbridled sarcasm. I found her condescending attitude towards Muslim women (In the name of &quot;Feminism&quot;) slighly disturbing.Despite the other reviews here by non Muslims who found it fascinating, I found this book to be highly innaccurate. (For reasons too lengthy to go into in this limited amt. of space.) Suffice to say that Brooks is a muckracking journalist, and not a scholar of religion. To use her work as a textbook on Islam is a mistake.Non Muslim readers of this book take note: you would be better served learning about Muslim women from the Qur'an, Hadith, and from Muslim women themselves. If you are so concerned about Muslim women, why not listen to what they themselves have to say, instead of what someone who obviously has no regard for them tells you?"},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"....No doubt there will be those who will post that this book only reflects the cultural misfortunes of the Arab world, but it does more. Combined with the book, The Book Seller of Kabul, it exposes Islam, and it's prophet (I hesitate to give him that title) as a mind destroying theology, whose sole purpose is to crush human nature. Both books show the intolerance of Islam and the fractured thinking it produces. The author tells of one educated woman who speaks of kindness and peace one moment and hatred for the Jews in the next, without missing a beat. This line of thinking has its origins in the koran and the hadiths. One can read it in the directives given to mohammad to a group of his warriors who wished to have sex with a few captive women (the men were married), mohammad ok'd the assualt as long as they practiced coitus interruptus. Thus one can do wrong as long as you didn't intend to do a greater wrong!!! Welcome to Islam."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Here is a book about something we, as Americans, know very little about. As a journalist, Geraldine Brooks was tired of spending her time trying to get any serious news from the men who control the middleastern countries where she was working, so she decided to see if there would bemore forthcoming from their women.She simple spoke at length with many women from a number of these countries.As in all cases, the women varied across the scale of very unhappy about there lives under Islam and working hard to improve it to those who felt safe and secure under the rule of men."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"So much to learn for us westerners. Surely a compelling presentation of nonfiction, filled with tales of personal relationships and events. A must read."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"All girls/women should read this book, a thought provoking account of the years spent by the author in the Middle East observing and writing about the lives of the women she met there. Many of the circumstances described here you have probably heard before but Brooks has a way of bringing the lives of these women to light in vivid technicolor. Her unbiased reporting only makes the facts all the more compelling."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"I recommend all works of Geraldine Brooks: March, People of the Book, etc. She was a reporter in the mid-east and tells the story of the women she encounters in the Islamic world. If the people of the West are hoping for the 'women' of Islamic societies to help usher in an era of modernization, this book quickly puts those thoughts to rest. The West will never understand the culture of the East and this book explains why."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Geraldine Brooks, who I knew previously for her novels, was also a foreign correspondant for the Wall Street Journal. When her female assistant, who previously painted her nails and talked about dating at the office, decided to don a veil for modesty, Brooks became curious about the role of women in Islam. She discusses Mohammed's experiences with and teachings on women, as well as the modern interpretations of those teachings and what that means for modern women in Islam. This book was obviously written before 9/11, so it's missing some important changes that have happened as a result of the attacks and would be significantly improved if it were updated, but the current text is still very worthwhile for those of us who don't have much knowledge of Islam or its teachings."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Usually the discussions on Islam and women in confined to the single issue of the veil, and perhaps oppression. This book delves into broader issues that reflect the theme - such as how the resurging puritanical movement affected other \\"women's\\" fields such as arts, dance, sports, military, polygamy, higher education, and political participation. As a journalist for WSJ, the author effectively used the personal anecdotes with women as well as gutsy personal experiences to unravel the story, and tying it to broader regional trends. For instance, why do women have more rights in post-revolutionary Iran than in Saudi Arabia, despite both theocratic regimes forced women to cloak and segregate themselves? Brooks theorized the answer lies began early in the revolution's active enlistment of women during the protests, and later on their gender segregated schools drew conservative women out of the house into the public realm whereas they would not have done so earlier. Brooks is also harsh in its criticism of male jurists and clerics adopting misogynist/hardline positions without a textual basis, and the women who push back in a variety of ways. But similarly she is also critical of Western bigotry, such as France's anti-burqa laws; seeing both as men attempting to impose their beliefs upon women's bodies. After all, the greatest challenging lies in protecting women's freedom to choose, and respecting those decisions.Frankly I didn't expect this little book to be so engaging, and being well-documented and researched. One rather glaring absence is the lack of mentions of South and Southeast Asia, whose populations far surpassed that of the Arab/Persian realm, and whose different cultures and practices would shed light on a host of different women's issues. The author is also sometimes quick to judgment, but in her interactions/interviews this led to some interesting conversations a more reserved interviewer might not have encountered. But then, this book is ultimately about one journalist's journey and observations during her post in the ME as opposed to some authority on the topic, so as that it succeeded. And as always, I give applause for crazy brave journalists who go to the frontlines (Eritrea, Gaza, etc) for the pursuit of knowledge.Final Notes* Is this an objective book? NO. But then, it is impossible to ever be truly objective when discussing cultural issues. In the end, you have to read different perspective and make up your own mind."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"I am a Brooks fan and this didn't disappoint. It is an interesting look at the lives of several Muslim women. I was surprised to find that it is the younger and sometimes well educated women who are sometimes embracing the veil and fundamentalist views.Brooks included a variety of women's stories, from those who embrace the fundamentalist views to more liberal women, including a police chief.She shows respect for the religion's history which initially gave women more rights. However, she also says the religion has changed from Mohammed's time when his first wife was a business woman to one that has \\"proved such fertile ground for almost every anti-woman custom it encountered in its great march out of Arabia.\\" She says it needs to be accountable for that."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"This book is not a quick read. I read it slowly, a chapter or two a week for about a month. I learned a lot about the role of women in the middle east.The book deals with several different women in the middle east and discusses what their lives are like. The author believes that women are repressed, held back and not permitted to fully participate in many aspects of life.Since there is so much talk about the middle east today, this is a good book to read for increasing your understanding of what life is like there, especially for women."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"It is true that many a journalists' effort to write an articulate and informative books on the Middle East (particularly Judith Miller and Thomas Friedman) have been bogged down by their tendency to focus on the extreme situations and exclude the nuances fostered within a religious and cultural system that when applied correctly, is just. In avoiding this tendency, Brooks has written an excellent book. Ms. Brooks spends much of her efforts on understanding what the prophet Mohammed expected of women during his time and how that should be applied today.Brooks is correct to analyze Saudi Arabia's interpretation as the horrible extreme that is being promoted through much of the Sunni Muslim world. This system has been accepted within a framework of a predominately Whabbi Muslim society and the keepers of the two greatest Islamic holy sites. What sets Brooks apart is that she goes into the homes and speaks with women, underlies the clear contradictions in women's lives and leaves the reader to make their own judgment.I think that Brooks ends the book with a clear message. When we see the often bloody struggles in which Imams, political leaders and fundamentalists go through to interpret the correct use of the Koran and the Hadiths, we see that religion is in fact and matter of interpretation. Each individual that Brooks spoke with believed that their interpretation was correct. By the end, it is clear that there is no single interpretation that is correct! For this reason, to cement women's social standing through unchangeable laws is ludicrous: there is no one that has the indisputable ability to interpret God's word correctly that will alter half of the populations lives. Islam is clearly a matter of personal interpretation and when put in political hands, it is mangled and dis-formed for political purposes."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Nine Parts of Desire was the first book I read about Muslim women. The book was riveting and I could not stop reading. Brooks tells the story in a way that makes the reader keep going. I have since read other books about Muslim women and I still find myself going back to this one because of her clear and concise explanations. I was impressed by the fact she did nothing to condemn the religion of Islam. I found that the biggest threat to American democracy is not from Islam but rather the radical fundamentalists in any religion. This book opens your eyes to the suffering of other people in other countries."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"As a woman who has herself spent time in many Muslim countries, I was disappointed by portrayal of Islam in this book.To me, this book is a Western and non-Muslim women's viewpoint of what it is like to be a Muslim woman. What if an outsider stepped into America to write a book about women's rights? What would they say? Statistically, women are paid less than men for the same jobs. While women are entering the work force in unprecedented numbers, in homes women still do a disproportionate amount of housework. Women are constantly bombarded with images and advertisement that aim to hinge their moral worth on the ability of their body to resemble a 20 year old. Yet, when women display themselves the way our culture tells us to, we are often subject to sexual harassment. As a women from the West, I would still argue that I have freedom at that living in a capitalist society doesn't mean I'm oppressed, but from an outsiders view, my argument would likely not seem very convincing.If we really want to be feminists, let's give Muslim women the opportunity to speak for themselves. What do real women - not Western ex-pats or Queen Noor? When Brooks does relate discussions with real women - like Sahar - she dismisses their views as brainwashed.Lastly, Brooks over emphasis of the importance of clothing in women's rights movements is a superficial way to assess women's rights, and frankly, a tool that has long been used by colonialists to justify their violent actions.If you are going to read one book on Muslim women, I suggest Women and Gender in Islam: Historical Roots of a Modern Debate by Leila Ahmed. While having feminist undertones, this book retains a higher degree of accuracy and fairness. As other readers have remarked, Brooks book is worth reading only if you take the time to read a wide range of books with different opinions on the subject. Otherwise, \\"Nine Parts of Desire\\" will only perpetuate stereotypes of Islam and Muslim women."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Brooks writes that our understanding of the real lives of Islamic women in Arabic nations is just as shrouded as the chador-clad women who live there. \\"These incidents come at us from so deep in left field that we, as Westerners, have no coherent way to think about them. We shrug. Weird foreigners. Who understands them? Who needs to?She writes that we can't just examine the Islam of the Koran, we must ask - urgently - why this particular faith has been such fertile ground for almost every \\"antiwomen custom it encountered in its great march out of Arabia. When it found veils and seclusion in Persia, it absorbed them; when it found genital mutilations in Egypt, it absorbed them; when it found societies in which women had never had a voice in public affairs, its own traditions of lively women's participation withered.\\"Women in Islamic nations can't travel without written permission from their husbands. Some conservative families don't let their sons marry a girl (yes, girl - ages 8, 9, 10...) who has EVER been seen by anyone other than her immediate family. Many women can't attend school, can't go to the beach with their families, can't maintain visitation with their children if their husband suddenly decides to divorce her by merely declaring it so.This book made me feel lucky to have the liberty and freedoms that I do as well as outraged that such treatment goes on today in the world."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"This is an interesting anecdotal discussion of the plight of women in Islamic countires. The stories are vividly told, and always interesting, and she has a nice ey for detail. Refreshingly, the author is unwilling to let the abuses slide with a some platitude about multi-culturalism.There are some annoyances. She tries too hard at times to argue that &quot;real&quot; Islam would not be like this, and her discussions of Islamic history are unskeptical. She takes a couple cheap shots at some westernm politicians she doesn't like. But the material she covers is all well covered, and important.If you are wavering, just read the bad reviews here, and see how tendentiuous and vacuous they are."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"I read this book at the suggestion of my sister, and after the attack on the United States by fundamentalist Muslim terrorists (the book was written several years before the destruction of the World Trade Center). I agree with other reviewers that Geraldine Brooks' insightful, thoughtful, provocative book functions as more of a condemnation of the interpretation of Islam by a loud minority of men who are apparently so deeply insecure of their intellect and masculinity that they must legislate and reduce the role of women in society to invisibility than as a condemnation of the religion itself.Readers will gain great insight into the current dilemma of women in Iraq, who are finding that they had MORE rights under the brutal regime of Saddam Hussein than under the Sharia law of fundamentalist clerics. What I find especially provocative is that the tenants of Islam are applied unequally to men and women: men seem to have some leeway in adapting to modern times and customs, whereas women have had their freedoms truncated from those available to them in the seventh century.Anyone interested in the history of the Middle East and how human rights abuses hide under &quot;cultural sensitivity&quot; should read this book."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"I read this book before the 9/11 murders. The book gives chilling insight into the attitudes of fundamentalist Muslims, as well as enlightening contrasts on the treatment of women in various Muslim countries. The author looks beneath the surface in various situations and tries to give a balanced account on the lot of women in the middle east. I recommend this book to anyone who wants a greater understanding of Islamic culture in all its variations."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"This is a book likely to make almost any reader angry - whether Muslim or not. It portrays the Islamic world as essentially hostile to women, and it puzzles over the power that fundamentalist Islam holds over younger educated women living in Middle Eastern countries. With a journalist's eye and ear tuned to the incongruous, contradictory, and mean-spirited in the many cultures that make up the realm of Islam, she sometimes reacts with irony, dismay, and outrage at what she observes, especially when it takes the form of defiance against internationally recognized women's rights, a dogmatic and misguided effort she finds little support for in the teachings and practices of the Prophet.At the same time, readers will become familiar with the \\"family values\\" of Islam in its extremist forms. The enforced modesty of head-to-toe drapery is a mild constraint compared to the rigid restrictions that confine women to their homes, their behavior modified by beatings, as needed, their husbands free to take multiple wives, and divorce any of them merely by pronouncing the marriage over. Meanwhile, contact with any male outside the family constitutes dishonor so profound that it is grounds for murder. Brooks also devotes a horrific chapter to the widespread practice of genital mutilation.Written before 9/11 and the War in Iraq, this book was a clear warning to any western politician who failed to grasp the rage of the Islamic world against the evil that the West represents there. It's not too late to read and ponder it now."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"This book is an excellent source for learning about the role of women in Islam. Ms. Brooks combines research, anecdote, and experience to explain the complicated story. It was fascinating to read actual parts of the Koran which held that women were to be treated fairly and kindly; in fact the Koran deemed that women were to be allowed to run businesses, own land etc. To see how that has been thwarted in much of the world was just heart-wrenching. But Ms. Brooks goes way beyond the \\"to veil or not to veil\\" question; she gives a dramatic glimpse into health care, athletics, marriage, and war from a woman's perspective. I recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn about a complicated issue."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"A very interesting read for anyone interested in the cause of women in Islam. Some might find it biased - the author makes her opinion very clear and her view is not impartial.However, she makes some very good parallels between the situation in the Prophet's time and what it is today - and this is not a pretty picture. The testimonials of women is various countries of the Middle East are very enlightening and some make the situation of women in those countries very frightening. It is also interesting to see some of these women's view towards their culture, their society and the progress made by Muslim women.It is probably one of the best book, if not the best book I have read on women in Islam and I highly recommend it."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Nothing in life is un-biased, we view the world and its events and filter them through our own set of values and customs. This book is full of stories and experiences recounted by Brooks. Of course this book will be tinged by her perspective, but she does her best to show the stories as they actually happened. For others to deny these accounts as select extremes is to discount the fact that they actually happened and still happen to this day. In addition, not all the narratives in this book are negative. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and found it to be very enlightening without being overly judgemental."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"No one wants to hear that Muslim women are happy or that they choose, and enjoy wearing hijab. That is boring. They want to hear that we are beaten by our husbands everyday and oppressed because that is what gets good ratings and higher book sales.I think that in any society you can focus on a few stories which would make the rest of society seem terrible to an outsider. If I wrote a book for Muslim women, I could point out the terrible numbers of women killed and raped in this country making the United States the most dangerous nation in the world to be a woman. And how pornagraphy, strip club, popular music, and films degrade women in this county where even the common name for a women among young men is \\"Ho\\".As a Muslim woman I found a severe bias and crooked outlook in this book that focused on only the extreme stories and refused to discuss in which ways our lives are good. The assistant who began to wear hijab is seen in a bad way but many of us also made that choice and we were happy to live more deep and spiritual lives. We don't want to look like Brittany Spears, and I don't see why people in the West consider it oppression that we choose not to run around half naked but wish to remain modest and respectable. It is only a piece of cloth.....get over it. Americans focus far more on the hijab than we do.I am happy to be a Muslim woman, and happy to cover. I think this book in many ways oppresses Muslim women because when we go out on the street here in America or try to get a job we are treated in a biased way becuase of books like this which portray a charactuture of Muslim women rather than the reality."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Books on Islam generate a lot of controversy these days, especially after 9/11. Having read several I found this one fairly balanced. Brooks is a reporter by trade, which at times leads to a bit of superficiality in the treatment of complex topics but on the whole makes this a relatively dispassionate treatment of women and Islam.Of course Brooks brings a Western point of view to her subject, and is intensely critical of a system where women are subject to male family members with few personal rights. She is careful to point out that Islamic law does provide for inheritance by women and allows a type of pre-marriage contract that can protect them from the husband's polygamy, give them the right of divorce, establish that their education will be allowed to continue, etc. But one suspects that these privileges are available only to the wealthy as a practical matter.Brooks is careful to distinguish various Muslim societies from one another, just as one sees huge differences among Christian countries. She along with most authors I've read has little good to say about Saudi Arabia. But interestingly, she identifies Iran as a more progressive society in which women are permitted to work and participate in politics. And Egypt is described as having a lively, sensual culture that she believes will never be snuffed out by fundamentalists.One of the more disturbing chapters of the book deals with education. The number of women in school is unacceptably low,education often ceases as women are wed at a very early age, and much schooling is focused on the study of Islam. Even more disturbing is the increasing control fundamentalists exert over educational institutions, which results in a student body much more conservative than the faculty who were educated in more open-minded times. And academic freedom has no place here.Brooks tries to identify areas of repression that she sees as cultural rather than religious. At the same time, she says that Muslims cannot rely on the improvements to womens' lives that occurred during the time of the Prophet to defend Islam today. It is sadly true that any religion that literally relies on a Sacred Text from hundreds of years earlier--Christianity included--will inevitably fail to respect the notions of individual liberty and equality that are the ideals of the modern world.Brooks' book was written over 6 years ago. The trends she identifies are very disturbing, but except for some vague familiarity with Ayatollah Khomeini, few Americans had any of this on their radar screens before 9/11. A book like this will hopefully lead to some better understanding of this complex subject."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"These reviews are such extremes. Mulsims saying Brookes is an enemy of Islam etc. Others saying this represents the truth about Islam. What is required is some balance. The author is right about the sorry state of womens rights in Islamic countries. Her tone, while caustic, is entertaining and while I am a Muslim, I do not find it insulting at all. She is wrong on substantive areas of Islamic law. For example, she is woefully ignorant on divorce where the Maliki school allows divoce on the grounds of incompatability (contrary to her assertions). She also makes a great deal hinge on the age of the Prophets wife Aisha without even mentioning the controversy here (a comprehensive study by Pakistani Islamist scholars, Tehkik e Umar e Aisha, concludes she was 17 to 26 at the time of marriage). She does not search for truth and is only too ready to accept caricatures.All of this said, we Muslims need to think hard about her views as we create the surface perceptions she reflects. Rather than condemn her work, we need to ask outselves why we give others such impressions. In return outsides owe us to dig deeper for the truth."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Australian-born Geraldine Brooks spent six years as a journalist in the Middle East. She's also the wife of Tony Horwitz, who wrote &quot;Confederates in the Attic&quot; and &quot;Baghdad Without a Map.&quot; I read both of these books and remember how fondly he speaks of her. And so reading this book was, in a way, getting to know her too.Ms. Brooks is a secular feminist. She makes no secret of that. And, as a woman, she was able to gain entry into a the world behind the heavy veils, which she often needed to wear herself. She spoke with many woman, did a lot of research, and moved within this special world as an observer and witness to her times.Her interviews ranged from the Queen of Jordan to a Palestinian woman who lived in with her husband, his second wife and all their children in a modest hut. Some of the women she talked with were highly educated; others had never learned to read and write. They all accepted their religion and were able to express their point of view in a way I could understand even though some of them were often hostile to westerners.Ms. Brooks tried to cover a lot in her book -- the treatment of women in different countries, the practice of genital mutilation, education of women, legal status. She even discussed the contradictions about the status of women all the way back to Mohammed's time. That's a big order for a little book. It was not always successful. It only opened my mind. It did not satisfy it, leaving me with a desire to learn more. And especially wanting to read some works written from an Islamic woman's point of view.Also, since its publication in 1995, much of it is dated. Her interview with Mrs. Khomeini at the time of the Ayatollah's death took place in 1989. And, more recently, Jordan's King Hussein and Syria's Hafez Assad have passed away. But I must say that this book did open my eyes. It's time now to learn more."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"This is an exquisitely written book. Brooks has great talent for pulling the reader into the mind of the people she tells about, and especially, I found as a man, pulling you into the minds and lives of women. I found myself empathizing with the women in ways that only real life can provide. It is amazing what Brooks has experienced, but it is far more amazing what the women she tells of have experienced.Brooks writes honestly and directly about the good and bad of Islam, and how it influences women. She doesn't pull any punches, but also is not writing to denigrate, as she finds aspects of official and folk Islam that both hurt and assist women. She speaks of the positive attitude Islam has towards sexuality, being largely uncorrupted by the Greek dualism that invaded later Christianity, so that, within marriage, Muslims are encouraged to celebrate the gift of God in sex. Indeed, this provides the title of the book, as Ali, the 4th Khalifa, speaks of how sexual desire is 1/10th the man's, and 9/10ths the woman's. Of course, this provides later motive to sequester women, put them in hijab, and restrict them, so that the \\"ever-devouring vagina\\", as later Islamic jurists speak of, does not overcome the men around them.Since Brooks relies primarily on her experiences, with what she's seen with her own eyes and heard with her own ears, she is hard to argue with. This is the plight of many women in the Muslim world. But lest we think these are limited experiences of one Western woman talking with a few Arab and Persian women scattered in a few countries, Brooks has also done extensive research to intersperse between her stories- relying on the Qur'an, Hadith, Ijtihad, and Muslim history. But mostly she relies on women's experiences- for, let's be honest, the perspective of women is largely missing from the official sources, as it is in most religions- with notable exceptions like the wonderful hadiths of Aisha. Most of which were discarded by early Islamic jurists, as Brooks points out.One regret, is that there is not more here about the countries of North Africa, particularly, Morocco, with the exception of one paragraph paying tribute to that great Moroccan feminist, Fatima Mernissi. But of course, this book is about Brooks' experiences, not a research text, and her journalistic experience was much more centered on the Middle East.I found one of Brooks' most powerful arguments to be on issues like FGM, Female Genital Mutilation. She shares how Muslims say it's not authorized or encouraged in the Qur'an. How it's not only Muslims who do it, but some African Christians. I've hear this many times before myself. They're quite right. But Brooks brings up the sapient question- why isn't there more spoken against it from the minbar? Why are 20% of Muslim women in areas where this is practiced? If Islam is a religion that supports women, or if there are at least some aspects of it that are positive towards women (as I believe there are), why isn't there more said publicly about the plight of women, on many issues, to change things, to encourage women's emancipation, using the wealth of resources? Why isMernissisuch a lone worker in the night?"},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"As a non-Muslim who's been doing research on women in Islam, when I first ran across the reader reviews here, I figured they were just the complaints of religious Muslims oversensitive to any Westerner's depiction of them. But then I read the book. I was quite taken aback by some of Brooks's generalizations and sarcastic observations (she complains that it's hard to talk to someone who opens all conversations with the Bismillah--&quot;always a disincentive to small talk&quot;). The occasional hostility of her tone may well come from the obstacles she encountered as a woman traveling alone in the Middle East: she recounts being denied a hotel room, ordered to cover herself, and other harassment. But the unfortunate result is that her book sometimes reads like the supercilious and condescending travel narratives of Europeans during colonial times.Still, it's a wonderful read, full of vivid scenes and memorable characters--a great chance to visit a world most westerners will never see. Just don't take the author's opinions at face value."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"After stumbling into the Women's Studies section of my favorite independent bookstore, one of the titles that grabbed my eye was this one. It not only gave me an amazing insight into the lives of Muslim women (something no man would ever get first-hand), but I also received a broad grounding in the basics of Islam and it's history. Although many reviewers have not spoken well of her depiction of Muslim women, I find her descriptions dovetail well with the other books I have read that are also first-person accounts by female journalists. Like any writer, she most certainly reflects her own cultural biases, but the bigger picture rings true.My copy is stained and dog-eared from all of the friends and family I have loaned my copy to, calling it a &quot;must read&quot; for anyone who wants to understand the Middle East better."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Nine Parts of Desire by Geraldine Brooks details, as the subtitle says, the HIdden World of Islamic Women. Brooks is an Australian reporter who spent the late 80s and early 90s doing a lot of Middle East reporting, and spent a lot of time with Muslim women in various Middle Eastern countries at a time when fundamentalism was on the rise and had already triumphed in a few countries. She spoke with women who embraced a return to traditional women's roles (often symbolized by taking on the veil or chador or otherwise covering oneself and turning away from Western fashion and styles) and those who resisted it in countries like Egypt and Lebanon, which had had a more liberated tradition, and those trying to negotiate for greater liberalism for the first time in areas like Saudi Arabia and the gulf states.Ms. Brooks never takes her own personal reactions and opinions out of picture but examines Islamic beliefs carefully, bringing Islamic history of the first Muslim women, the wives and children of Muhammad himself, and the writings of the Koran and hadiths to bear on the modern day issues. She finds at times surprising amounts of liberation in the thoroughly fundamentalist nation of Iran as well as hidden hypocrisies in supposedly more \\"forward thinking\\" countries. She does differentiate between Koranic customs and tribal customs (particularly the practice of female genital mutilations)but does not let Islam off the hook entirely, pointing out that 20% of Muslim women live in areas that practice some form of genital mutilation and yet it is rarely spoken out against and most people who practice it believe it is officially sanctioned by the Koran.The bulk of Ms. Brooks stories were researched in the late 1980s and early 1990s, a period of great upheaval and change but only the start of another decade and a half of continuing change in the Middle East and the Islamic world in general. I found myself continually wondering what had become of the women she had interviewed, a decade and a half later, and how their opinions had changed or not changed. Alas, Ms. Brooks seems to have left reporting behind for the life of the novelist so the follow up remains for someone else to carry out, but this book still stands as an excellent overview of the varied worlds of Muslim women, even if it is a bit out of date. It's easy to see why it is frequently assigned as a text in college courses and it's well worth a read for any interested layperson curious about Islam and the role of women within it, as well as in a part of the world that remains a central focus of current events and politics."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Geraldine Brooks has written an excellent book on some of the most important issues an Islamic woman faces in the Middle East. She combines the real life stories of women with quotes from the Koran which either support or do not support the way of life they are subjected to. She also includes the male perspective and their interpretations of the Koran - all which affect the lives of the women in her book. I have lived in the Middle East for short periods of time and I have found her analysis to be well founded. In her six years in the Middle East she experienced the lives of a diverse group of women, from Bedouin to Queen, teachers to rebels, working moms to women in the military, and more. Her point of view from the heart left me with a mixture of emotions."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"For those of us who have a newly kindled (or revived) interest in the lives of Islamic women in the Middle East, this book is a welcome read. I found it as easy to devour as a novel, but full of glimpses into the lives of real women the author has encountered during travels and journalistic expeditions in the Middle East. From relationships between women in multi-wife and/or multi-generational households, to attitudes on women in education, business and sports, this book gives you a little of everything. While I still find myself confused about some of the terminology and apparel, this book made me feel like I had some grasp of the issues facing women in Islamic countries. I was particularly interested in the accounts of the author's experiences with the family of the Ayatollah Khomeini, and in the descriptions of the teachings of Mohammad as she sees them played out in the lives of Islamic women. I felt she did a pretty good job of remaining non-judgemental, especially being Jewish herself. I didn't think she was critical of Islam, as much as the way certain cultures have interpreted or distorted Koranic (?) teachings."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"As a western muslim woman, I was apprehensive before choosing to read this book. I was concerned that it would be one of the many that confuses cultural misogyny with religion. Although the writer is not muslim (a rather secular Jew), she sincerely attempts to separate the typically anti-woman cultures in the Middle East from their association with Islam, which, as she freely states, gave women dignity and significant individual rights in the 7th century A.D. long before any western women were recognized as thinking, feeling, soul-possessing humans. She historically examines where the divide started - where culture became imbedded in religious thought and doctrines, and how that has adversely affected the life of women in the Middle East for far too long. She also clearly presents how current surges in religious extremism, basically sparked by Zionism in the Middle East, have further aggravated and lowered the social status of muslim women in the region. I am impressed by her research methods, which involved immersing herself in the culture, dressing according to local custom, and befriending muslim women in each country she visited. It is truly a gripping book, and a sad one. But because it is so well-written, it hits all the major issues on the nose and clarifies ones understanding of human rights, not just woman's rights.It is not, however, representative of Islam. Those readers interested in Islam should read books by the Morrocan muslim scholar Fatima Mernissi or more directly, the Qur'an itself.Nevertheless, I do have two objections. One is that she did not interview Western muslim women to compare them to the condition of their M.E. counterparts. My other objection is that she does not acknowledge that until the early 1900s, Western women arguably had even fewer rights and priviledges than their Middle Eastern counterparts. Less that 100 years have past since then, and look at women in the West today: surely, we finally have the right to vote, to control conception, to keep earnings, to marry at will, to divorce, etc., but at what cost? When a woman chooses to marry and keep her job in the West, how is she viewed? What is the divorce rate for such marriages? How do the children involved in that union fare? Does a woman feel liberated from her body or is she enslaved by the diet culture? All these questions are equally relevant for the person truly interested in the human condition of the late 20th century.As a feminist, however, I still believe the book deserves five stars, not just four. This is due to the incredible effort involved in writing it to the best of the ability of the author, Geraldine Brooks, and for overcoming so many of the prejudices Americans typically hold about the Arabs."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Brooks makes no secret of her own opinions about many of the oppressive practices women in the Middle East endure. That said, she allows them to tell their stories with limited interference. She does what most authors fail to do - allow the diversity of opinion and beliefs of Muslim women shine through. Never does she overgeneralize. As with any book about Muslim culture, readers must attempt to extract the story from the bias of the author. It's well written, easy to understand and read, and leaves you with the desire and resources to explore more on your own."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Nine Parts of Desire is a sensational telling of the cultural and religious traditions women in the Muslim world. This unique book tastefully reveals the intricacies of modern day life by incorporating narratives of the first female followers of Islam. The traditions initiated by Muhammed and his wives, and the leaders who succeeded him, vigorously affect the roles and norms of Muslim women today. Brooks provides a rich and diverse account the life of women throughout the Muslim world. From queens to hairdressers to armed guerillas, these women all search to understand their identity and role within society. Nine Parts of Desire is an essential to understanding and appreciating women of the Muslim faith."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"I found this book very interesting. My sister first got a hold of this book, and she liked it so much that she bought copies and gave it to me and some of her friends as a gift.Now I recommend this book to whenever the topic of middle east comes up, and I am buying copies and handing it to friends. It is a real eye opener, in terms of exposing the plight of women in some of the arabic countries.Another comment I would like to make is that has been a recent innundation of one-star reviews from people who didn't like the portrayal of some countries brought down the overall rating. I think this book makes an excellent read, and is a pretty fair first-hand account, and deserves at least 4 stars, even if you don't agree with her."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"I picked this book up from a train station where it was left for someone else to read on the \\"book exchange\\" shelf that commuters use to leave/pick up books like a commuters swap meet.Little did I know that I would be reading one of the finest investigative journalism books that I have ever read and I have read well over a hundred on many topics.I know a fair bit about Islam and lived with a muslim family when working abroad (for years), and I knew that Islam was practiced very differently from country to country--or what many muslim women I came to know referred to as \\"the rules of men\\". And therein lies the basic problem with how Islam and Christianity and Judaism and many other organized religions are practiced--they are the rules of men that benefit men more than women.I found Brooks' writing to be emotional, rational, her optimism and thoughts far-reaching and most importantly--I felt she relayed very important information and feelings from our muslim sisters in parts of the world we rarely get a look into.Most amazing was her information and interviews in Iran--really eye-opening and so unexpectedly prgressive there for women (well -educated, business owners, international business women) compared to Saudi Arabia where women cannot drive much less have employment.And I loved her quest to be a belly dancer--bravo.A really great read--informative and entertaining and very real life--I felt it increased my empathy and understanding of women just like me who maybe had different shackles, but are still trying to make their way and their mark in this difficult-to-navigate world of Rules made for women by men."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Though written in 1994, 'Nine Parts of Desire\\" is timely and quite informative! It provides a view of women's lives in the Islamic culture that is seldom seen in such depth. The fact that it was written before 9/11 makes it even more interesting. Ms. Brooks has written of her experiences and travels, the women she got to know and their evolving lives. Be ready to be surprised!"},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Geraldine Brooks is as talented at non-fiction as she is at fiction. I could not put this book down. It is easy to read this explanation of the different levels of individual rights found among Muslim women in different middle eastern states. Brooks traces the circumspection of women's rights to the Koran and Hadiths from Mohammed's time. Interestingly Islam appeared to expand women's rights of the 7th century. In the era of Mohammed and for hundreds of years thereafter European women had no property or inheritance rights. In Islam a woman is entitled to inherit half of that bequethed to male heirs. Instead of interpreting these surahs as expanding women's rights, the Muslim communities have used them to infringe on women's rights. Thus this surah is interpreted to mean that a woman can only inherit half that due her brother. Rather it could be interpreted to mean that she must inherit at least half that which her brother inherits, and she could inherit more. It is merely a floor of inheritance. However, in fundamentalist Muslim cultures it is viewed as a limit on inheritance. Many of the infringements are culturally tied to their local society. In Saudi Arabia it is very difficult for a woman to engage in business or a profession and still remain covered and completely seperate from men. However, in the Koran the seperation was really limited to Mohammed's wives and not the community at large. Similarly in the Koran a medical doctor can touch and speak to a patient of a different sex. However, in Saudi Arabia many doctors do not. It is permitted even there in some cases.Sporting events and activities for women are severly limited in some Muslim countries particularly Saudi Arabia. This is a shame since physical fitness and excellence are so important to good health.Brooks clearly explains that Islam and democracy cannot truly exhist in one society. Islam is a theocracy with a dictatorship. However, India is an example of a democracy that has a very large Muslim population. Hence, India does not fit the mold.She describes female genetic mutilation which is at best a crude, dangerous and painful proceedure. It is really inhumane but contiues to be practiced. Most telling is the fact that when a woman is raped she is punished or killed because she had sex outside of marriage. This ia a really warped view of morality. However, it has found a home in Islam. Brooks describes womens' lives among the poor, the wealthy, the educated and the uneducated. Clearly the poor uneducated women come from more fundamentalist households.I heartily recommend this non-fiction work by this talented writer. Everything that I have read of hers is excellent, and this does not disappoint."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Geraldine Brooks takes us inside her personal trip trough the Islamic world and gives as close to an UNBIASED view of the treatment of Islamic women that i could imagine. she is careful to point out the reasons that are given for wierd practices. She doesn't shy away from her disgust for certain treatments.For example the propagation of so-called \\"honor killings\\" that still take place all over the world, as well as many other ways women are opressed in the mainstream Islamic world.O by the way the writting style is smooth and easy to read. You can really enjoy this book even though the topic is sad the way it is told is great!"},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Geraldine Brooks's book, while written before the \\"War on Terror\\" era, allows for a much better insight on Islamic life (specifically the treatment of women under Islamic law) than watching the evening news. Her panorama of experiences in the Middle East allows for the reader to see the tremendous variation that exists in Muslim countries. The background that she provides on Islam is also very useful for a Western understanding of the social climate in that part of the world. This book is an excellent starting point for anyone seeking to learn about the Muslim world."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"I enjoyed this book enormously and consider it should be compulsory reading!

Read it and enjoy through the tears!"},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"I think this was a great book and I couldnt put it down. I think Geraldine really gave an unbiased account based on the woman that she met.

Her very choice of words and the way she describes people - whether they are her personal colleagues or relatives of Khomeini - belie her prejudice, which makes it impossible for her to write anything objective. Good thing another Western women - Elizabeth Fernea -addressed the task in a far more professional manner."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"The author clearly shows no proof of actual understanding of islam or women in islam. All of her views are based on hatred against islam. The author entirely ignores the fact how pre-islamic societies treated women. In Arab girls used to be burried upon their birth, because they were believed to bring shame to the family. Christians and Jews were not much better in treating women and still exploit women. Islam gave women the respect and encourged them to be educated and be prominent parts of the society. There have been numerous women leaders in Islamic society. The western people are the hypocrite, they believe they have given freedom to women, but they are abused by men."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"I do not recomend this book to any one, its too biast and narow minded and lacking the fundamental truth."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"The book was recommended to me by a British friend who found it very facinating (despite her frequent visits to the Middle East. Constraints of time prevented me from reading it but in the course of my reaserch on how the both the West and East percieve women, I picked it up and finsihed it in one go. As a Jordanian muslim woman, I was insulted by some refernces to Jordan in particular and the Arab world in general. It seems that Brooks was only too willing to take many things at face value losing in the process the ability to judge objectively. And judge she did; from her misrepresentions of Islam up to her incessant attempt to form some interrelatedness between many abhorrent cultural pratices and Islam. I admit that women in Jordan like everywhere else around the world are the victims of male-dominated societies, but Islam is not the culprit. It is the misinterpretation thereof. I do not expect Brooks to undertake the difficult task of untangling Islam from the web of cultural backwardness, however, I advice her not to take her topics so lightly. Her account in particular of the &quot;crime of honor' committed by a Sudanese against his wife is a case in point. Not only are these crimes completely divorced from the spirit of the religion but it seems they have become a new weapon in the hands of the West in its renewed attack against the Middle East. We the Arabs live in the heart of the world, progeny to an amazing history and civilization that saw its climax when Europe was still fighting its battles in the Middle Ages, so please be careful how you approach such a history and civilization. More importantly, writers like Brooks should spend more time reseraching her topics regarding the Middle East to avoid the reductionism that ran like a thread throughout her whole book."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"I believe that some of the information is accurate, however, I suggest reading about women in Islam from a Muslim woman. A secular feminist is not going to give the proper picture about a woman in Islam. It is like asking a dog what it is like being a bird. Also, most of her discussion is about \\"cultural\\" norms. It doesn't relate to Islam at all.

I am an American Muslim woman who is fascinated with her beautiful religion, one that protects women and gives them just rights. Thank you very much."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"I guess it is a good market now for anything about Islam.

Finally, I thought, something positive about Muslim women! But when a book starts off with an incorrect fact, you know there's something wrong right off the bat. To clarify, Brooks starts off the book with a quote from Ali ibn Abu Taleb (a quote we don't even know where she got from!) and states that Ali is the founder of the Shiite sect of Islam. Wrong! Ali died before the Shiite sect was founded and he would have never allowed for such a divide between Muslims to occur.I won't get into a lengthy explanation of why I thought this work was lacking. I will simply quote another reader's review: \\"...They don't want their ill treatment tied to the Islamic religion, but as the author points out, all you have to do is read the Koran to find out that it endorses wife beating, polygamy & child marriage, says that women's testimony is worth less than men's, that women shall inherit less than men, etc., etc. The Koran clearly describes women as second -class citizens.\\"Now you tell me, if a reader is getting this from Brooks' book, has Ms. Brooks really done a good job of defying our stereotypes and illustrating that Islam's holiest texts have been misused (as it says so on the back of the book)?

The author originally set out to simply observe and learn about the 'women behind the veil'. This is something many of us in the West would like to do since we dont often see Islamic women, instead we ususally are confronted by Imams and Islamic groups telling us how we shoudl view Islam.The author spent time among Islamic women learning of their toils and their hardship as well as their joy. THis book takes one on a ride through Islamic history and culture as it pertains to women. The author looks at Mohomed and his treatment of women, his polygamy and the cutting off of womens hands ordered by his successor.The book looks at Iranian women in the time of fundamentalism. How they were not allowed to touch 'unrelated' men and how this was embarrasing when one met Michael Gorbachev. She sheds light on the barborous nature of fundamentalism which frequently twists religion to suit its chauvinistic theories.The author looks at Islamic Queens and leaders like Benezir Bhutto who challenged the Koranic 'a people led by a women shall surely fail'. The author then takes us on a tour of the evils of fundamentalism as its ignorance was applied to Rushdie and even towards calls to tear down the 'idolatrous' pyrimids.Lastly the author takes stock of Islam and women. She cites the fact the women married to Muslim men are 8 times more likely to be killed by their husbands. She cites female circumcision, the veil, noneducation of women, Polygamy and the murdering of women who dare go without the viel to show the fundamentalism has warped what should have been a beautiful religion.This book is an insightful, intelligent and unbiased account of the lives of women in Islamic society. The author shows how our own prejudices make it so that musim men who murder their wives actually get shorter sentences because we judge them 'deranged' rather then 'premeditated'. This book opens the viel on Islam and is essential reading for the Westerner."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"One of the best books I have read on the subject. Truly interesting reading for us westerners in light of the world today. I felt it helped to understand how the people of this religion live, how the women are treated is very interesting! A big difference from our western freedom, which we often take for granted."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Geraldine Brooks' examination of women in Islam is an excellent source of historical chronology in the Middle East. Her portrayal of Muslim women, however, is stereotypical and biased. The reader gets the impression that Brooks has set out to show all the negative aspects of the religion in regards to women. She throws in two examples of Muslim women who are happy in their marriages, and who live contented lives. These two women's stories seem to be included to &quot;prove&quot; the author's objectivity, which otherwise is absent. Some of the details regarding the religion itself are laughable to the reader who has any knowledge of Islam, and one can only wonder why someone who is supposed to be as educated as Brooks would place herself in the situations that she does. Overall, the book should be read for historical content only. Islam should be left to those scholars who are truly interested in an objective examination of the religion's practices, and how they affect women."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"This book introduced me to the Islamic view of women--although, I must admit, I have no real context for Islam.

I am so glad I was able to find this copy of it. This would be a good companion piece to Reading Lolita in Tehran.Book was delivered on time and in good condition."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"I heard about this book at a slide show given by my college alumnae club which I attended with my mother (also an alum), and we were curious enough to pick up a copy. Who would have guessed that a book on such a subject could be so completely riveting? It was absolutely impossible to put down; I devoured it in a day. And that was no fluke--my best friend had the same experience. The book is as much about the author's search for an identity for Muslim women that she could understand as it is about the women themselves, and her realization that they are as varied as women everywhere is only one of the discoveries she made and wrote about so eloquently. Ms. Brooks is a gifted writer, but she is even more a gifted observer and faithful chronicler of what she sees, even if it isn't what she wanted or hoped to see. Her search for a Muslim feminism was largely in vain, but her exploration of why this might be so was careful, detailed, and very moving. She speaks strongly, for example, about practices harmful to women which have become associated with Islam but have their origins elsewhere. It was an honor to share her insights, and I would highly recommend this book to just about anyone."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"I read this book hoping to understand women in Muslim countries better, and to overcome some of my prejudices. It didn't have that affect, but it was a book worth reading for sure. I think the main thing I brought away from the book is the similarity between radical fundamentalists of any stripe. It certainly pointed out to me the dangers of a theocracy...of sinful people trying to figure out God's agenda (which can only be in light of their own?). It is interesting to me that God gives people far more freedom than people purporting to represent Him would allow."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"I read this book for the first time well before 9/11, and I think it could be a useful read for a lot of people exactly for that reason- it was not written with the hindsight of 9/11. A lot of other reviewers have described Brooks' standpoint, so I won't go there, but I will say that her writing itself is beautiful. She does not use clunky language to get her point across, and this gives her writing a great deal of eloquent power. I found myself re-reading it several times over the course of a couple years."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Ms. Brooks is a talented writer and it was a pleasure to read her work. Her six years living in the Middle East and associating with Muslim women from all levels of society and in many countries gave her fascinating insights into everyday Muslim women's lives. Some reviewers here did not like the book because Brooks expresses negative opinions on some practices in Islamic countries; perhaps they are expecting a glossing over of these things in order to shed nothing but a rosy light on women's lives in Islam? In fact, this book presented some aspects of Muslim women's lives in a far more positive light than I expected. For instance, I read Azar Nafisi's book \\"Reading Lolita in Tehran\\" before reading this book, and was surprised to find Brook's examples of life for women in Iran to be far less bleak than what Nafisi showed (Nafisi's book is also great and I recommend it). Brooks also made Khomeni seem far less of a monster than my previous impression of him was. I thought she treated Islam with great respect and gave her analysis on things often very objectivley; when she casts things in a negative light it is because they are truly brutal and inhumane. I am hoping she will write more on this subject in light of all the recent events in the Middle East over the past 10 years."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"While it is true that the degree to which women are oppressed around the world varies considerably, it seems to be a common thread throughout the Islamic world. It is disingenuous to suggest that the second class citizen role accorded to Islamic women is really a reflection of their importance, and other such blather. And it is at best disingenuous for Islamic women who voluntarily took on the hijab and the chador and that second-class citizenship in some burst of revolutionary fervor to pretend that many or most of them don't continue to do it out of downright fear, long after they've lost their zeal.The pervasive theme that runs through the stories of the women in this book is, in fact, fear. It manifests itself even in the more liberal segments of the Muslim world. To pretend otherwise is not naive, it's dishonest and dangerous.Too many people want to keep their heads in the sand on this. The accounts in this book are a wake up call."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"I thought this book presented a very well balanced view of life for muslim women, and it has tempered my understanding of issues in the news today. Not all Muslim women feel oppressed, which shocks the feminist I am, but it is their life to live, not mine. The varying degrees of freedom described allow me to see that Iranian women are really much better off than their Saudi counterparts. The chapters (alternating with the interviews of women) which follow the use of the Koran and Haddeth to justify women's treatment, and the various interpretations of these help me understand the situation better than anything else I've heard so far."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Using her six-year experience in the Middle East, Geraldine Brooks wrote her first book entitled \\"Nine Parts of Desire,\\" which was published in 1995. The author spent sex years researching the status and the role of women in several Middle East countries such as Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq. The book is broken into thirteen chapters, which describes the journey and the observation of the author in the Middle East countries. She writes about the history of Muhammad and his wives, the purpose for the veil and hijab, the Islamic marriages, the women in military, politics, business, and entertainment, and the author's experience with Queen Noor in Jordan.In part, this book explores the women's social status as defined by the Islamic culture and the words of the prophet Muhammad. Since Muhammad's death, the Islamic culture has been defining women according to their Koran, which became part of Islamic law (p. 190). The Muslim traditions and customs, such as hidden faces, hairs, or exposed skin of women, seems to came from the book of Koran that expresses Muhammad's accounts with his wives and his revelations. The Islamic laws seem to require women to wear hijab, cloth covering all of their skin expect for hands and eyes, and restricted social interaction between men and women who are not related by blood. In this book, Brooks mentions that the prophet, Muhammad, had a revelation from Allah that required women to be put in seclusion and to wear hijab when in public to avoid the sight of men who might feel temptation or desire to them for their own (p. 4-5, 20-1, 83). The Koran's accounts of Muhammad and his wives seem to show examples of why women needed to be covered and how this gives men ideas of being pure-hearted.Throughout this book, one can comprehend why the repression against women became intensified in the Islamic societies in the 1970s to the 1990s through the defined social status of women in Islamic culture, Muhammad's interpretation of women's status, the rise of the fundamentalism and its mission, and their reasons for repressing women. With her extensive experience interviewing Muslim women in the Middle East, Brooks has written a fascinating book which expresses an unique perspective about the lives and tradition of Muslim women of the Islamic culture."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"When I first wanted to know about Islam I was at the bookstore and found this book. I thought it would help me to know a little about Islam and even more about the lives of Muslim women. After I read the book, I was even more determined to find out about what really is truth and fiction in Islam. While the author may very well have witnessed these stories she writes about in her book, she has sadly left out stories from the other perspective. These stories are not the example of typical Muslim womens lives. Many of the Arabic Muslim women I know would be shocked to see this type thing written about them. Islam and Muslims should not be incorrectly linked with the traditions of certain cultures/countries. Islam and culture are not the same. The author is also NOT an expert on Islam, the Qur'an, or Hadith. I hope this book will inspire others to look further and be informed. To know the truth, one should seek further knowledge and not just the word of one misonformed, western reporter. A better book to read is &quot;Daughters of Another Path&quot; which gives a more honest and accurate look at the lives of Muslim women.And an important aspect of &quot;Daughters of Another Path&quot; is that it includes the actual words and thoughts of many different Muslim women, and not the feelings necessarily of the author."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"This book was a surprise from the beginning. I never ceased to be amazed at the places that the author was able to find herself and the experiences that she had. The honesty that was revealed in her reporting was gut-wrenching at times, heart stopping at times - I found myself not wanting to put the book down. I've read a number of books with the women of Islam as the topic, and this one hit home more than any other. A must read for anyone interested in seeing the \\"real\\" story behind the veil."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"After I finished this book I was dying to read more, I went to the library and I picked up biographies on some of the personalities, I began reading more and more about Islam, the middle east, etc. This was exceedingly well written and I have recommended it to everyone I know."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"When I picked up this book, I could not put it down. Everything about this book fasinated me: the connections to ancient Islamic hadith, the lives of specific women, and the overlying comparisions on treatment of women in the Middle East. One by one, Brooks takes issues she encountered while living there and address each on its own. She laces individual stories with greater events and observations, trying not to make judgments - until the end. Then she sets forth with a fury and I can't help but admire the way in which she puts forth her arguments.The book was clearly written for a Western audience unfamiliar with most Islamic traditions and that happened to work out nicely for me as I just happened to be that kind of audience. This book was not meant for people very familiar with Islam and the Middle East, if you are and plan to read this book, I would suggest patience as Brooks explains many things you might already know.The biggest flaw is the structure of the book, which seems to jump around alot and isn't bound by a central theme or string (other than Islamic women, of course). Each chapter stands on its own and address a different topic, which makes it nice to read, but negates the impact of the conclusion. The other problem is one of age. The book was written over ten years ago and most of the interviews took place during the late 80s, early 90s. This impacts the discussion of nations in the book, especially for Afghanistan and Iraq (of course). However, I did not find it that distracting as most of the book discusses the women and their every day life.In all, I would recommend this book, especially to people interested in Women's Studies or the Middle East. It's light reading and fasinating, so anyone interested in those topics should get around to reading it sooner or later."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"This book is an excellent starter to anyone interested in the lives of Muslim women in various different countries. Geraldine Brooks has an engaging style that is helped by her genuine compassion for those she encounters. Besides letting us into the world of these women, Ms Brooks also gives us many interesting excerpts from the Koran that shows that Islam does not necessarily have to be anti-women.It is not a huge book, and should be a fast read. If you have any concerns at all about the state of women's rights, you will come out feeling enraged, and will want to learn more. This book is highly recommended for its fairness and passionate arguments."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Brooks has written an engaging, informative and lively book abt Islamic women. She crosses class and ethnic boundaries to interview women throughout the Middle East (Saudi Arabia, Iran, Egypt, Iraq, Israel/Palestine, Jordan). My only minor complaint is that she confines herself to the Middle East---as she argues that Saudi Arabian culture has spread and changed the Islamic world throughout the Middle East I wanted to know what was happening in the Islamic world outside of the Middle East (Indonesia, the former Soviet Republics, Africa etc).That said, I would still recommend this book highly. Brooks' interviews with women---especially those who opted to wear the hijab and to advocate a restricted life for women in the name of radical/revolutionary Islam---are deeply insightful. I found the picture she painted of the Middle East incredibly tragic. This is a region where oppression of women is rampant. As Brooks herself points out if half of the male citizens of any country were denied their basic human rights, frequently subjected to genital mutilation or death after being raped, there would be an outcry throughout the world. But because we are talking abt Islamic women (many of whom live in oil-rich countries) there has been a reluctance on the part of the US and other industrialized nations to criticize the Middle East.Brooks' book is not a flat-out criticism of Islam---in fact, she shows through a discussion of 7th century Islamic beliefs and culture that Islam has the potential to create a world where women truly are equal to men and where women and men can enjoy the same rights and privileges. In many ways, Christianity and Judaism lack this potential and so Brooks' insight is especially interesting.This book should be read by politicians everywhere---not just women. Anyone who cares about human rights will benefit from reading this book."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"This books is as balanced as possible, and should be read by those who would like a better understanding of what it is like to live in the Middle East.From the perspective of a non-muslim woman who grew up in Saudi Arabia, I can vouch for the parts in Ms. Brooks' book that I am familiar with. Every woman I knew in Saudi Arabia was FORCED to wear the hijab, whether or not they wanted to, and flocks of muttawein scoured the city for women who even looked as though they were rebelling against this.I never found the majority of Arabs tolerant of other faiths, or even cultures(although there were always wonderful people who were exceptions). At the airport, customs officials would toss out spices and pickles,Bibles, crosses and videos, out of travellers' luggage.My father was the only one allowed to drive our family around, as my brothers were too young to drive.The overall atmosphere for young women was socially oppressive, restrictive and threatening.Luckily, my family moved out of Saudi Arabia eventually, and I love living in a country where religious tolerance is so widespread that I can walk around in my attire and not be afraid that some sex crazed man will attack me because he cannot help himself. And even if he did, this society empowers me to protect myself in many ways. I am not responsible for my brother's honour, only for mine. And he is responsible for his own.Having said all this, I was shocked to find that genital mutilation is a cultural thing, NOT religious in nature. I did learn this and many other things from Ms. Brooks which helped me understand and empathize with Islam better, so this book was awesome in that regard! Definitely a book to read for a different perspective."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Although numerous reviews are already at hand I feel compeled to add a few words about this excellent book.I would like to remind readers that this book was published in 1995, several years before 9.11 and the subsequent US examination of the Muslim world.The strength of this book is first of all in the quality of writing. The chapters go down as easily as water without losing any poignancy or relevance.While Ms Brooks was certainly dismayed by much of what she found in the countries she visited she has made a sincere effort to understand the women that she met and their Islamic position. She has not written caricatures for us but real life storis that are completely credible. They speak for themselves.An intersting insight for example is how strict enforcement of Islamic dress in Iran effectively liberated many village women while at the same time virtually imprisoning others.If she has a case to make it is that certain MEN, not Islam is harming women in many Muslim countries and this need not go hand in hand.This book is highly recommended for any man or woman who is interested in the situation of women and wishes greater insight into this facet of the Muslim world."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Geraldine Brooks, a journalist who spent many years in the Middle East as a writer for the Wall Street Journal has written an insightful, original look at the role of women in the world of Islam. It is interesting and entertaining. Unfortunately, it is also somewhat superficial.Each chapter opens with a pertinent quote from the Koran. The chapters themselves deal with such subjects as women's sports in Islamic nations, women's education, women in politics & arranged marriages. Ms. Brooks looks at these issues using examples from the full spectrum of Islamic belief which ranges from the harshness of Saudi Arabia to the liberalism of Turkey & the former Soviet states. Sometimes, however, her anecdotal style & lack of flow between chapters caused frustration in this reader.Each chapter in the book is a stand-alone essay. There does not seem to be a logical progression in time, geography or understanding. It seems as if each section was re-printed from magazines or newspapers, yet the title pages list no credits that would reflect this; maybe Ms. Brooks did a series of lectures that became \\"9 Parts of Desire\\". Whatever the reason, I personally felt the book would have benefited from a more linear progression, as the author immersed herself deeper into the Islamic world. Another option might have been to divide the chapters into discussions of each country, rather than by issue.What I enjoyed most about this book was the author's very original reading of the Koran & Mohammed's hadiths. As she explains in the first chapter, many of the Koran's revelations concerning the details of women's life came to the Prophet as a result of domestic problems he was experiencing. Her contrasting of the known facts of Mohammed's daily life to modern-day Islamic traditions is quite fascinating as well as valuable. Ms. Brooks also gives the reader some historical background to better understand the evolution of modern Islamic thought.For the general reader, \\"9 Parts of Desire\\" will prove an informative introduction to an alien viewpoint. Almost anyone will find it entertaining & thought-provoking."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"I live in Dubai and know a lot of people who have read this book, besides myself. I am an American, so you'd think my perspective would be similar to Brooks', but it's not. It is true, there are extreme, evil, awful and just wrong things that happen in the name of fundumental Islam, and I know I have shared stories with expat friends about them. But I and everyone I know who has read this book have been left with a bad taste. Brooks is a very good, engaging writer, and I did learn some things from this book, so I wouldn't disregard it completely. But I did find myself wondering why Brooks has such an agenda to convince the world of Islam's evil. Maybe she is bitter from her own experiences during the years she spent reporting in the Middle East. Brooks picks a lot of specific extreme examples and pretends to balance them with positive stories, but she alway ends on a negative note.I would have liked to see more discussion of the places in the world where Muslims live alongside people from other religions in relative tolerance. Places like Dubai, where the government itself makes a concerted effort to inform people about the difference between the cultural traditions of Arabic lands and the practices which are actually drawn from the Koran. I felt the book omitted a needed discussion of the Muslim women (and men) who have left their home countries when fundamentalist regimes gained power because policies advanced by such regimes did not reflect their own beliefs. Yet the book tries to pin the injustices it discusses purely on Islam, rather than the regimes in power in the middle east or on cultural practices not derived from Islam. Brooks seems to say, yes, there are Muslim countries where things aren't so bad, but still, all the problems they do have stem from Islam. If you are willing to do the work of reading a lot more to balance Brooks' perspective with more information, then it is probably worthwhile to read this book. On the other hand, if you only read one book about Muslims, do not make it this one."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"I've been reading various books on Islam, the Middle East, the war, and various related topics for some time now. This book is somewhat unique in that it's not old, but not that new either, having been written a decade ago. The author, is a convert from Catholicism to Judaism, a native of Australia who now lives in the States with her author husband (Tony Horwitz of \\"Confederates in the Attic\\"). She went to the Middle East as a correspondent in the early 90s, and wrote this book in an attempt to understand the plight and situation of women who are Muslim. The result is very interesting, a clear and illuminating account of the different situations women face in various Muslim countries, and how these things are changing. Because the book is a decade old, things have of course changed a bit here and there; but the differences she outlines are there, regardless, and very interesting.For instance, the author makes it clear that while Iran is a fundamentalist Muslim state, the status of women in the country is much better there than it is in our supposed ally, Saudi Arabia. Iranian women hold offices in their government (there are even deputy ministers), can have driver's licenses, and walk the streets safely, admittedly while robed. In Saudi Arabia they can't do any of those things, and of course the author makes it clear that the government there suppresses dissent out of fear that they'll wind up like the Shah.Brooks looks at the society and its attitude towards women in various parts of the Arab world. She even comes rather close to getting raped at one point, and spends a lot of time talking with various women, and of course with men who talk to her about the role of women in their countries.I enjoyed this book a good deal. The author has a sense of humor, recounting the incident where Muslim Clerical Police showed up at a university in Beirut to arrest Thomas Aquinas, because they found some of his writings objectionable. She illuminates her points well, and discusses the issues involved carefully. I don't know that I agree with all of her points (she's more confident that the Iranian Revolutionary government is positive) but she makes them well. I would recommend this book highly."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"I'm an American woman who has lived overseas in Morocco for twelve years. My friends and I are reading this book for our monthly bookclub selection. None of us was able to put the book down, once we started it. We all read the book in one or two days.The author is a journalist who spent considerable time in the Middle East, reporting from various countries. Although this is not a scholarly work, it is well-researched. The book focuses on her own personal experiences in each country, and ancecdotes from various women she met in each country.For me, the most interesting parts of the book discussed the home and personal life of the Ayatollah Khomeni. After reading this book, my opinion of both him, and of Islamic life in Iran, went up by about 300 percent. The author met and interviewed his wife, and various family members. He was a fairly modern, new-age husband, and playful father, who even got up in the middle of the night and gave his kids their bottles, and changed their diapers. The only thing he was quite strict about was the Islamic religion.Anyone who is interested in the lives of women in the Middle East should read this book. The book is as accurate today as it was when it was written."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"I enjoyed this book because of the wide view of Islamic women it portrayed. From reports of the Taliban and books like \\"Princess Sultana's Daughters\\", we hear of very restrictive regimes where women are oppressed. Geraldine Brooks shows us that many women choose the veil, and that there are many different kinds of Islam.I also enjoyed the chapters on women in Islamic texts, and where the traditions evolved from."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"as a muslim, i find it very disturbing and insulting to read books or hear comments about how islam is being unfair to women.i am twenty years old and living in a muslim country in the gulf, i have never faced a problem of what some anti islam extriemists claim to exist.it is true that there are some islamic extriemists whogive a misleading idea of islam and muslims, but those are a minority.on the conterary, islam gives its women their full freedom within boundaries that keep them safe and respected from all those around them."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Mrs Brooks is depicting Muhamed(pbuh) asa lustfull man driven by his male chauvinist sexual instict. Such a man could survive as a leader of his people maybe during his life time.But he could not bild a nation that continuosly expanded through out the past 14th hundred years and still despite all odds,the most rapidly expanding nation all over the world,espesially in the western world.Just an example of this growth and this divine merical is that Islam is the only religion in the Unitedstates today whose numbers grow beyond the natural birth rate of the population but rather through converting.This book is not worth discussing as a historical study.Because it lacks all elements of logical arguments and as a fiction it is terribly written.There are many westerers who wrote about Islam and Muhammed(pbuh)such as Arnold Twinbe who considered Muhammed the most influncial personality in the history of humanity and the same of Bernard Show.Even though neither historian could be considered pro-moslems.But they are defenitly serious historians."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Obviously this is FICTION !

It really is quite absurd for any of us who know the truth and I agree that anyone who wants to know the truth should certainly not believe what someone that doesn't seem to have a clue says. But then I am of the mind that the book MUST have been written as some kind of JOKE? Right?"},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"This is an amazing book!!Reads like fiction. Provides a perspective we never get. Everyone should read it. Brings just a little bit of understanding."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"As a non-Muslim western woman with very little knowledge of either Islam or the Middle East, I cannot judge the accuracy of this book. I do feel that anyone who simply jumps on the bandwagon of \\"oh, look how oppressed Islamic women are\\" is missing the point of the book, even if Brooks doesn't doesn't communicate that point very effectively. As other reviewers have pointed out, we Westerners - or at least American women like myself - aren't as equal as we'd like to think. It's true that Muslim women in the Middle East are denied or discouraged from dress and behaviors that Americans take for granted. But how do we reconcile that with the shameful fact that there has never been a woman President, that there aren't even any female candidates? We may be allowed to dress scantily and have all the affairs we want, but the public still seems unwilling to grant us a position of real power.More than her (perhaps suspect) personally observed \\"facts\\", I find some of Brooks' ideas provocative. Using slavery as an example, she suggests that \\"...most Muslims now accept that conditions have changed enough since the seventh century to allow them to legislate against a practice that the prophet probably would have chosen to ban outright, if his own times had allowed.\\" Predicting what Muhammad may or may not have done is risky and of course totally irrelevant to literalists. But it is still interesting to consider in context what seem to be sexist laws. For example, the Koranic tradition that when estates are divided up, women inherit half of what their brothers do. By modern American standards this seems an outrageous restriction, but at the time it was tremendously progressive to recognize women as people who could own, rather than simply be, property. This practice was enacted in the seventh century. Compare it to England, where it's been less than 150 years since women were given the right to own their own property.I guess my main point is that the situation is far too complex to cover in the span of this small, highly subjective book. It's really more a collection of anecdotes about personal experiences with Middle Eastern culture and politics; to describe the topic as women in Islam is very misleading. However, it has caught my interest and I'm looking forward to reading more recent and comprehensive works, preferably by Muslim women."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"Everyone woman in the USA should read this book to understand how very lucky we are. The book was written well before 9/11 and I think I finally understand what was in the mind of the terroist."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"This book was a fascinating read, but did not represent my experiences as a Western woman travelling in the Middle East and North Africa. While there are indeed many cultural practices that are wrongly justified by adherance to Islam, this is true of any religious or ethnic group. Clitoridectomy cannot be defended, however neither can presenting all Muslim women as oppressed slaves. This book should be read as interesting tales of one Western woman's experience as seen through her own eyes, not as hard facts describing every Muslim woman's life. I found many gross generalizations that simply cannot be substanitated."},{"Title":"The Nine Parts Of Desire: The Hidden World Of Islamic Women","review":"In this review I will explain that Ms. Geraldine Brooks fails to provide a meaningful view of Islamic women's life because as an outsider she maintains an antagonistic relationship with her subject. However being an outsider itself does not imply that one can not conduct successful study of a religion. That being said I would like to point out different ways in which she maintains adversarial attitude towards Islam.I will show that she used faulty methodology to study or observe Islam and its impact on women in the first place. Second when she decides to put her observations in writing, she doesn't focus on any single system and hence comes up with generalizations that can be misleading as to a religion as diverse and complex as Islam. Third she is too occupied, by her preconceived convictions and notions on life and freedom, to give a fair account. Last but not least she fails to pay respect to the religion at least in letter if not in spirit, which poses a serious limitation. In support of my view I shall elaborate each aspect of her antagonism with excerpts from her book.For the first objection we don't need to go too deep into reading this book. As the introduction to the book explains the fact that her visits and stays in the Middle Eastern muslim countries, which provide for the inspiration and information of this book, were for the purposes of journalism and not the study of Islam or muslim women. Her visits were infrequent to most places and her contacts were professional (as journalist) as opposed to personal.For example, she talks a lot about women in Iran, but she supports it only with account of two visits to Iran. First one of those visits was on a 48hr visa in the country. Another problem with that visit is that it was at a very unusual event (death of Ayatollah Khomeini) and in a quite formal setting (mourning). These two factors make this visit a very unlikely time for observation of every day Iranian life.Another example of her gross generalization based on little information is evident in the following excerpt: Almost every week of the Mehmoudzadehs' life contained some religious observance bound up in the rituals surrounding births, betrothals, marriages and funerals. During one week-long visit to the family, I learned a lot about Iranian life from two very different deaths.Here she makes a generalization about every week in Iranian life based on her one \\"week-long\\" visit to Iran. These two examples should make this discrepancy clear to the intelligent reader.Second problem with this book is then its vast coverage of many different cultures and then making generalizations from that for over 1billion people. She selectively takes examples from different cultures and applies them to Islam when in fact they are more part of the culture than religion. Like the example of cliterodectomy, that she herself says was an essentially African practice as she says: Widespread mutilation seems to have originated in Stone Age central Africa and traveled laws, down the Nile, into ancient Egypt.However at various instances she tries to hold Islam responsible for this practice, and associates it with Muslims in general by implication, for two reasons as she puts them: It wasn't until Arab-Muslim armies conquered Egypt in the eighth century that the practices spread out of Africa in a systematic way, parallel to the dissemination of Islam, reaching as far as Pakistan and Indonesia.This first reason is quite immature and it is like saying that Internet is responsible for pornography because it spreads it, when its not the Internet that is responsible but only the people doing it and Internet provides only a medium that can be used for many purposes. Similarly Islam harmonized and brought many cultures closer but then it was up to the people to exchange whatever cultural traditions they find attractive. So Islam cannot be at fault for providing with an ease to flow of information between cultures but only those people can be blamed who opted the wrong choices.Other reason she gives is the support of local preachers to this practice in Eritrea, again thing to remember here is that these preachers don't fall from the sky and are a production of the same society that encourages the practice of cliterodectomy and so they simply affirm their cultural beliefs, not religious by any proof.Then the third problem with this book is her indulgence in her own convictions about life and notions on life and freedom that inhibits her ability to think in a fair manner. One example is that she continuously assumes that Hijab (veil) is oppressive to women. Here is the irony however, most women that she knew either wore Hijab or started wearing it by their own choice. A good example will be her Egyptian friend Sahar who started wearing Hijab later in life by her choice as it says in the book: As the weeks passed, Sahar drifted deeper into new identity... Sahar seemed comfortable with her new self... Hijab, she said, gave her security on Cairo's bustling streets.Also she misses a key concept about Muslims after all her years of experience which is that, not every Muslim is fundamentalist and more importantly most fundamentalists are not a bunch of extremists. She is profoundly confused about the second part as she always mixes fundamentalists with extremists (who can be fundamentalist or anti-fundamentalist as well). Surprised? A good example of extremism against fundamental religious values is describe in the book: In 1935 the Shah's father had banned the Chador. Reza Shah wanted his country to look modern and he thought the ancient black cloak didn't. But devout women, especially the elderly couldn't suddenly make so drastic a change. In her memoir, Daughter of Persia, Sattarah Farman Farmaian writes of her mother's desolation. &quot;When my mother had learned that she was to lose the age-old modesty of her veil, she was beside herself. She and all traditional people regarded Reza's order as the worst thing he had yet done -- worse than his attacking the rights of the clergy; and worst even than his confiscations and murders.&quot; Women who disobeyed the Shah's order and ventured into the streets veiled risked having their coverings ripped off and scissored by soldiers. Chador- wearing women were forbidden to use public transportation and denied entry into many stores. Rather than face such humiliation, many women simply stayed inside.This is the example of real oppression to which Iranian people revolted and opted practices that they passionately believed in, over the ones that were imported and superficial. She fails to comprehend such basic fact and keeps on trying to convince those women that if they observe Hijab then they must be oppressed.Last problem and the most serious one, stems from the previous problem of her preconceived notions and convictions, is her lack of respect for her subject. The very first chapter and her account of the \\"Muslim-world\\" ends with sarcastic remarks on last prophet of Muslims, prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him), as she writes in her book: The reason for my sleepless night lay in that desert town. I couldn't check myself into a Saudi hotel room in the 1990's because thirteen hundred years earlier a Meccan named Muhammad [peace be upon him] had trouble with his wives.The actual reason was the Saudi law against giving rooms to lone women, to discourage prostitution, and her ignorance of local laws because it was not like her first time in that country. It's like getting locked up in America for driving without license because of your own ignorance of the law and then blaming it on Capitalism for its moneymaking laws. Including America most places don't consider ignorance of the law as a valid excuse.Second example of her pre-occupation of her own notions and lack of respect is shown in her account of Khomeini. She says first: Somehow I'd never imagined that the stoney-faced Ayatollah had a wife-... And I hadn't pictured him with the cute, giggling great-children who romped around us in the carpet-strewn courtyard.Then she is told by late-Ayatollah's daughter as to how kind he was to his wife and kids. Then she also finds out that he never made any money for himself and practiced humility and simplicity, she mentions: The carpets are all borrowed. The family doesn't own anything this good,\\" explained one of the Revolutionary Guards who had worked as household help...Now here comes the strange part, which is her total disregard for every thing good she learned about this man and still see him under the same conviction as she did before, as she describes later in the book: Zahra invited me to a conference... titled \\"Aspects of His Highness Imam Khomeini's Personality\\". I studied the title with bemusement. The only aspects I was familiar with were his penchants for condemning novelists to death, dispatching young boys to the war front as human minesweepers and permitting little girls to be married off at the age of nine. This is all, good words, she could muster up for a great man on his funeral.

I found the author's final thoughts particularly compelling: what if it were not the subjugation of women but the subjugation of a race we were talking about, would cultural relativism still be appropriate?

How inspiring this is, whenever someone is able to write a fluent, beautiful book which depicts such a shining achievement. But this book is even better, because her spiritual path is on the border between traditional Judaism and modernism. This precarious journey walks straight through the most important questions a Jewish woman can ask herself.This is a starkly honest book, which shows her struggles and her triumphs. The prose is clean and direct. The power of this book comes from the power of the author's heart: she writes with love of the life she is trying to lead, and of the conflicts she faces, within herself and with the world around her. This woman wrestles with herself, on the pages of this book. And she makes her world vivid enough that the reader can enter, can understand how she got where she is.Once I started reading, I could not stop until I finished. Sleep on one night seemed less important than soaking up these words."},{"Title":"Life on the Fringes: A Feminist Journey Towards Traditional Rabbinic Ordination","review":"This is a book I could never before have read with an open mind.Fifteen years ago, I'd have dismissed Ner-David as an apologist for Orthodoxy, trying to cram modern sensibilities into a hopelessly outdated mold. Ten years ago, during my own tumultuous &quot;return,&quot; I'd have sneered at her willingness to entertain thoughts of mixed seating, uncovered hair and egalitarian prayer.It's only now, I think, that I'm ready to hear the honest questions Ner-David and others like her are asking and to understand that the Judaism we share is resilient enough to answer to -- and thrive from -- challenge and diversity.Ner-David's narrative, interwoven with threads dealing with her own physical frailty, tells a story not of a senseless rebellion against Orthodoxy but of a young woman's awakening to a deeper, more genuine love of her tradition.I wish Ms Ner-David a Yasher Kocheich -- may she never stop asking."},{"Title":"Life on the Fringes: A Feminist Journey Towards Traditional Rabbinic Ordination","review":"For the beginner or the advanced scholar, this book offers a fresh and sometimes revolutionary viewpoint on the balance between tradition and modernity.

A perfect blend of scholarly insight and personal journey."},{"Title":"Life on the Fringes: A Feminist Journey Towards Traditional Rabbinic Ordination","review":"this is a great book. it combines a memoir style with scholarly research and notes. ner-david grew up orthodox but rebelled during her teen years, secretly breaking shabbat laws, for example. in college she became observant again, but only after beginning a struggle (that she still continues) to reconcile her feminist and pluralist opinions with traditional judaism. she has a very strong personality and is dedicated to orthodoxy as well as feminism. the book is divided into chapters based on a topic: marriage, torah, law, etc, all consisting of scholarly discussions combined with ner-david's life and personality. it's very encouraging to find a woman like this who feels that it's possible to be feminist and religious."},{"Title":"Life on the Fringes: A Feminist Journey Towards Traditional Rabbinic Ordination","review":"Ner David's story of struggling to reconcile orthodox Judaism and feminism without compromising either is inspiring.

I am so glad to have read this book."},{"Title":"Life on the Fringes: A Feminist Journey Towards Traditional Rabbinic Ordination","review":"I read this book as part of a series on Jewish women pioneers in the rabbinate for my Jewish Renewal women's havurah. We liked the book, and respected Ner-David's commitment and fighting spirit in her pursuit of Orthodox ordination. She writes beautifully and perceptively about spirituality, her stormy adolescence, and her gradual evolution into a female Orthodox rabbinical student.But as mostly non-Orthodox Jewish feminists, we were sometimes baffled by her persistence in trying to gain acceptance from an Orthodox community that seemed to mostly want her gone and was frequently very cruel to her.I kept thinking --- \\"why doesn't she just get ordained as a Conservative rabbi? why throw herself against a brick wall?\\" Also, the parts of the book where she did technical analyses of the Orthodox laws of family purity, the mikveh, male rabbinical control of Orthodox women's lives, etc. were tedious and baffling for non-Orthodox feminists --- I kept thinking \\"this stuff is really offensively medieval --- why do you put up with it in the 21st century?\\"But --- that's just my bias. The Orthodox feminists (see the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance at www.jofa.org) have built a strong and viable women's movement of their own, and as an Orthodox feminist, Ner-David commands my respect for her willingness to stay and fight on her own turf, and we share a passionate commitment to Jewish prayer and spirituality."},{"Title":"Toward a philosophy of history","review":"This is practically the same book as History as a System.

History as a System omits the fifth essay in Toward a Philosophy of History and replaces it with an afterword by John William Miller.

The book relies heavily on regimantal after battle reports, some of which are printed in their entirety.The prose is sparse and the story is sparingly told. Nevertheless, this account of the service of one of the best regiments of the Civil War (which suffered tremendous casualties opposite the Bloody Lane at Anteitam and helped repel Pickett's Charge at Gettysburg) is fascinating."},{"Title":"The Divine Comforter: The person and work of the Holy Spirit","review":"A concise, easy to understand book, that explains all the truth concerning the often mis-represented and errant teaching concerning the Holy Spirit in the book of Acts.

In addition, there are some extremely questionable \\"facts\\" presented--such as crediting the creation of the Gimlet to Sir Thomas Gimlette on one page, then giving credit for its creation to Harry Craddock two pages later. Didn't anyone bother to review these pieces before publication? The book is, as a result of the obvious lack of attention, very uneven. Some pieces are quite well-written, while in other cases the errors are altogether distracting.Would I recommend this book to someone interested in Cocktails? Absolutely!

I was pleasantly surprised to be comforted with the love shown by others and the growth of their faith in the process. As I finished the book at 1 a.m., I turned off the light next to my bed, but felt totally enlightened with the love of God projected through the heartwarming stories in this inspirational book.

In a spirit of love and compassion with both spiritual and practical emphases, she helps us see the often neglected needs of children during times of great stress and grief. I loved Cyndi's transparent style, and the things she shared from her own family's losses, including the things she did to help her own children through the loss of their dad. So many times, we overlook and are even clueless as to how to help a child heal through divorce, death, or other difficulties. This is a book all parents need to read in order to walk themselves and their children victoriously through the valleys of life. It offers not only grief relief for both kids and parents; it offers a life preserver to those who are truly sinking.I highly recommend this book!"},{"Title":"Glands - our invisible guardians (Rosicrucian library)","review":"Glands-Our Invisible Guardians is another link to the mystery of life.

Explanations in the book enables the reader to see clearly our connection to the whole of the universe inwardly, not outwardly. When Jesus said he would tear down the temple and rebuild it in three days he was referring to his body, the only temple in which we find God. Understanding the purpose, operation, and function of the glandular system opens a gateway to perfect union with ourselves and therefore God. This little book has been life changing as I am now paying greater attention this neglected aspect of myself which will ultimately lead to greater health, yes, but more importantly to enable me to connect to the greater part of myself."},{"Title":"Three's a Crowd","review":"I stumbled across this book years ago and loved it. It is the story of a set of identical twins who have grown up extremely close and done everything together. They even fall for the same guy. Unfortunately only one of the girls can have him. The book tells the story from both twins point of view but there is an emphasis on one twin. I don't want to spoil the fun but one of the girls ends up with the guy in the end while the other learns something valuable things about herself.i enjoy reading young adult fiction from the forties and fifties and this book was no exception. The story is fun and very clean and speaks of a simpler time without all of the teen angst and home life problems that so many of today's young adult fiction focuses on. There is enough to worry about without being bombarded with those types of problems in books.

An ex-movie star takes the two weeks to help closest friend from his glory days finish a movie. It is an obligation, a chance to pay a debt, but it is also an opportunity to escape for a moment a life that has become to routine, and see if he made the right choice when he traded the demands of art for the stability of a normal life.A crazy film genius, two actresses stretching their muscles, a group of financiers, a girl who lives to party (or does she?).

It was so helpful to not only myself, but to my entire family, as we prepared ourselves, for the loss of one of the most significant people in our lives, our father. He was also the husband of my mother for 50 years, my children's grandfather, and a cherished friend, to many people.This book helped my family, when we needed it the most. It was short, to the point, and written by a wonderful hospice nurse with more than 16 years of knowledge behind her. The author covers the physical, spiritual and physiological changes that occur, when a patient starts separating from this life, to that of the next. I think the book helped us tremendously, when we had little time for reading a longer, more complex book, because we were so busy caring for our father, we were short on time for much reading. We had no idea what to expect, as the time drew nearer for us having to say 'good-bye' to my father, and it helped us to know that what my father was experiencing, was all perfectly natural. It helped ease our fears in many ways.I highly recommend this book, to all people who are in the difficult position of caring for a loved one in their final days/hours. It's easy to read, highly informative and not too long, because there's really not much time to read, while caring for your loved one, in those final days. I am very thankful that we had my father in hospice care. He wanted to die in the comfortable surroundings of his home of 40+ years, with dignity, and with the love of his family surrounding him. Hospice care helped us to fulfill my father's final wishes. I believe this book helped ease our fears, and we were able to accept my father's death, knowing that he got the best care possible through hospice. May God be with you, when you find yourself, or a loved one in the position of needing hospice care. But speaking for me and my family, this book provided very helpful information, at a very critical time."},{"Title":"Chance. A Tale in Two Parts.","review":"It is paradoxical that Conrad's most successful work at the time of its publishing should also be the least satisfactory of his major works. Narrated largely by Conrad's alter ego Marlow it is the story of young Flora de Barral who is torn emotionally between her imprisoned financier father (who bears a strong resemblance to Trollope's Augustus Melmotte) and Captain Anthony, the respected brother of her Feminist guardian Mrs Fyne. Written during the suffragette era Conrad attempts to address directly the issue of feminism but the prejudices of the time (Victorian/Edwardian) and his origins (Polish) act as impediments to his impartiality. Though I feel that it is a judgment based on today's standards to describe Marlow's narrative as misogynistic, it does at times make uncomfortable reading: \`...Mrs Fyne did not want women to be women. Her theory was that they should turn themselves into unscrupulous sexless nuisances'. As such it acts as unwitting historical testimony to male attitudes of Conrad's background at that time.Ostensibly a tale of doomed love Chance is an overlong and confusing nested narrative that nevertheless is a four-star work because it is a fine story written in a beautiful, dignified English that has long since been abandoned for a prose that is dull and functional or pompous and overblown. If you are a Conrad fan like me and you wish to \`complete the set' then it is an interesting diversion for that great author, though, not surprisingly, the best passages are on board The Ferndale. If you are new to Conrad then I don't recommend this as a starter. Instead go for any of his well-known works which are all readily available."},{"Title":"Chance. A Tale in Two Parts.","review":"Chance contains many of the themes found in Conrad's more critically acclaimed work: the role of womanhood in the Empire (HOD), the pressure of external events on personal relations, (The Secret Agent), the psychological struggle for dominance as well, often found in Conrad's shorter sea tales, but where Chance succeeds is in its narrative misdirection geared toward the reader. We at first assume that the novel will settle on some misadventure that is flashed back by Powell, and then we discover Marlow at the table, and discover it with a sinking feeling, and then get sucked into a series of narratives within narratives, a technique for which Modernism owes Conrad a great debt. We have the unnamed narrator who tries to contain Marlow, and Marlow who has to contain the Fynes, who have to contain Flora de Barral and her comically dim-witted father, whose narrow intelligence later becomes monstrous toward the novel's end; but this multi-layered technique is also the story's greatest weakness. Conrad weighs even minor characters down with a wee bit too much pressure: One expects a consequence from the second Mr. Powell and Flora's embittered governess, a consequence that never quite materializes given the effort Conrad puts into their backstories. It is mildly anti-climatic, and had it been shorter would have amounted to less labor for the amusingly frustrated spectators we are invited to be as Flora moves through her various stages of despair and then making terms with the world. The final picture we have of her, as a virtual goddess about to be united with the salt of the earth, relieves the burden the faithful reader carries along."},{"Title":"Chance. A Tale in Two Parts.","review":"From the author famous for seminal works like The Heart of Darkness, The Secret Agent and Nostromo this novel is often left unmentioned within his repertoire of books. This is unfair. I would say Chance is Conrad's most beautiful story, the construction of the plot masterly from start to conclusion, and probably the only novel of his which genuinely leaves a good feeling and makes the reader smile. His handling of the material from Marlow the teller of the tale, the way the novels flits from present to the past and back again flawlessly, surprises one how so far ahead Conrad was compared to the standard straight-line story telling that dominated writing of that era. But bottomline is despite the technical perfection, a story would only succeed its telling if it has heart. Here Conrad never faltered and one feels for the heroine in the story, and it would be hard not to let out a whoop of bemused joy once the final page is turned. Simply sublime."},{"Title":"Chance. A Tale in Two Parts.","review":"I cannot believe that there are no customer reviews already for this spectacular novel - full of intruiging situations and wonderful characters - certainly the best Conrad female character I have read. Conrad is a wonderful writer in style and the manner in which he tells a yarn - how then has this novel become so 'lost'? It has wonderful lines ('Don't be in a hurry to thank me,' says he. 'The voyage isn't finished yet.' p22 Oxford World Classics), great insights (women respond to the smallest things, which immediately had me nodding in agreement from my own experience), spectacular descriptions ('Yes, I gave up the walk [along a cliff top with the intention of killing herself],' she said slowly before raising her downcast eyes. When she did so it was with an extraordinary effect. It was like catching sight of a piece of clear blue sky, of a stretch of open water. And for a moment I understood the desire of that man to whom the sea ans sky of his solitary life had appeared suddenly incomplete without that glance which seemed to belong to both of them. p231). The characters are admirable in behaviour sometimes, victims sometimes, regrettable in behaviour sometimes, or just plain confused - just like real people. But one thing I really like is the way the narrator of the story is an observer, barely a participant of the events being described.This may not be the perfect novel, but I urge you not to miss it. The chapter 'On the Pavement' by itself is worth the read!"},{"Title":"Chance. A Tale in Two Parts.","review":"This book is just perfect. It's very well written. Conrad shows an understanding of the predicament of women of his time. Conrad advances the plot though the voice of the characters, who tell a story, which involves another character telling a story, etc. At one point the tale is six levels deep; but such is the skill of Conrad that you do not notice and are never lost. One of Conrad's two or three best. A book I was sad to end because I was enjoying it so much."},{"Title":"Chance.

The narrator of \\"Jim\\" and \\"Darkness\\" is back here telling another story about people he doesn't actually know first-hand. This time the central character is young Flora de Barral, set adrift in England by her father's scandal-plagued financiering. Haunted and helpless, her wide blue eyes giving her the look of \\"a forsaken elf,\\" Flora takes what comes in life, seemingly unable to function for herself. Can she find her own way? Will she become ruthless if she tries?All this may sound precious and twee, very much in the style of period romances more suited to Henry James than what you expect from the shamelessly macho Conrad, with his damned souls sailing heedless into typhoons. Yet Conrad makes this odd Merchant-Ivory production work by making you care for Flora in a way that draws you in more deeply than even the classic \\"Lord Jim\\" ever did. \\"Jim\\" was a philosophical novel; \\"Chance\\" is a uniquely intuitive one, more about feelings than ideas, yet quite brilliant in its concept all the same.Published in 1913, one year before World War I would change forever the genteel world it so painstakingly describes, \\"Chance\\" was the one book by Conrad that clicked with readers in his own lifetime. It's been disregarded since, as modern readers embrace more dour Conrad fare like \\"The Secret Agent\\" and \\"Nostromo.\\"It's our generation's loss. Missing \\"Chance\\" is missing the other side of Conrad, the bleak nihilist discovering for once \\"the precise workmanship of chance, fate, providence, call it what you will.\\" Other Conrad books feature broken-up narratives and odd framing devices, but the structural convolutions in \\"Chance\\" actually propel the story rather than hold it back.Marlow's narration is a marvel of storytelling economy, carrying you across windswept moors and the high seas, not to mention a source of much dry wit as the rather mysterious misogynist fires many shots across the bow of womankind. \\"Mainly I resent that pretence of winding us around their dear little fingers, as of right,\\" he snorts.Is Flora exhibit A in this case against? Certainly she winds the helplessly infatuated Captain Anthony around her finger, despite her apparent total lack of reciprocal devotion. Flora does love, only it is in a flawed way, for her crabbed, corrupt father who believes the two of them too good for the rest of the world. Yet love can be a form of redemption despite itself.Women, Conrad writes, can be fiendish and dumb, yet they are \\"never dense.\\" \\"There is in woman always, somewhere, a spring.\\" Realizing that spring here is at the heart of \\"Chance,\\" and makes for Conrad's strangest triumph, the one book of his that not only makes you feel smarter for reading it, but happy to be alive."},{"Title":"Chance. A Tale in Two Parts.","review":"Chance is a wonderful Conrad novel that no one really pays attention to nowadays. True, it does not have the same magic as Lord Jim or Heart of Darkness, but it is brilliant in that Conradian way. It features the return of Marlow, so it is an especially interesting read for Conrad fans who have been with Marlow through other novels and stories. His role in this book is less hands-on. He does not have a very strong tie to the two characters he most discusses. He does, however, have a more active role in the actual narration. His audience this time is not passive, but questions his analyses and puts in their own ideas. A hilarious example:&quot;You are the expert in the psychological wilderness. This is like one of those Redskin stories where the noble savages carry off a girl and the honest backwoodsman with his incomparable knowledge follows the track and reads the signs of her fate in a footprint here, a broken twig there, a trinklet dropped by the way.&quot;For those unfamiliar with Marlow, the commentator is refering to his capacity for putting together pieces of information to create a sketch of a person, and we have to filter through some of Marlow's pretensions to get a real view of what is going on in his story. At one point, he compares women to electricity. Both have been captured, &quot;but what sort of conquest would you call it? (Man) knows nothing of it. And the greater the demand he makes on it in the exultation of his pride the more likely it is to turn on him and burn him to a cinder.&quot; Ah, Marlow, you rambling fool.This is the novel that brought Conrad popular success, rather late in his career. It is one of his only female characters with a dominant role, but don't expect a strong feminist type. Flora de Barral is naive, at the mercy of others and their wills. I didn't feel quite as close to the characters, and Conrad tries a little too hard to philosophize on the role of chance and circumstance in our lives. Still, very enjoyable, witty, pure Conrad that you shouldn't miss."},{"Title":"Chance. A Tale in Two Parts.","review":"My first Conrad read was Victory, and I have been hooked ever since. I chose Chance because it was Conrad's first commercial success, and I was curious to see what the public liked better than so many other great novels such as Lord Jim. As other reviewers have suggested, the ending must have been the difference. There is far more sweet than bitter, and it's usually the other way around in his books, especially the love stories. I suspect we may learn more from sad stories than from happy ones, but in any event, Chance is not without pain and suffering. As the capable narrator Marlowe repeatedly emphasizes, the novel's heroine, Flora, leads a difficult life. Her father is one of the great villans in literature. He really steals show from Marlowe--well, almost.What I like most about Conrad's use of the narrator, particularly in Chance, is his role as an interpreter. In most novels, the reader must examine the story itself for the life lessons Conrad so uniquely presents. Marlowe enables Conrad to speak more directly to the reader, and I found him doing so more in Chance than in Lord Jim. There are a few arguably gratutious digressions--one about the differences between men and women comes to mind--but that's Marlowe.The bottom line: if in reading Lord Jim, you really enjoyed Marlowe's character, you will love the extra depth and insight Chance provides. If you love Conrad, then I expect you will find this to be one his most enjoyable books. And, if you have never read Conrad, but are curious, this is an excellent novel to start with, for it cannot be sterotyped as a South Seas adventure novel full of Pacific atmosphere and nautical terms."},{"Title":"Chance. A Tale in Two Parts.","review":"Henry James didn't like Conrad's eighth novel, Chance. He criticized it as being \\"steeped in perfect eventual obscuration\\", with difficulties \\"wantonly evoked.\\" I disagree completely. \\"Chance\\" seems to me one of Conrad's most deliberate novels, one in which he achieved narrative virtuosity, making the title subtly ironic since from a structural viewpoint nothing is left to \`chance' and every twist of narration is superbly controlled. Curiously, the reading public in England and America may have felt the same admiration for this complex novel, since it became Conrad's first real \`best seller.'Henry James. Stephen Crane, Thomas Hardy, Edith Wharton, William Dean Howells, Ford Madox Ford, and Joseph Conrad. Are there any writers in English today who approach them in artistic \`specific gravity'? That is, in the density of nuance and complexity of characterization, let alone the sheer scope of language? Could any of them even get published today, or have a career as a writer? The perspicacity of the reading public of their generation is not to be despised!This novel is a tale retold by an unidentified narrator, of a tale told in several sessions by that consummate teller of tales, Marlow. But most of what Marlow tells is in turn second-hand retelling of what he has learned in explanation of events after the fact. Pay heed to the punctuation when you read this book; quotes within quotes within quotes abound. Yet this is anything but \`wanton.' Much of Conrad's understanding of life can be perceived in his characters' need to act on information they don't yet have and to proceed through the passage of time without the foresight of a novelist with a plot outline in hand.\\"High drama - suicide, swindles, elopement, love, murder - for a rousing good tale!\\" That's what the blurb on the dust-cover of my edition of Chance promises to the reader, and it's essentially true. But those crowd-pleasing elements could be written into a much less allusive, elusive pot-boiler by any old hack. Conrad, as usual, has written a novel that gets better the more you think about it, both while you read and after. \\"Chance\\" truly is the subject here, and I \`think' that Conrad was struggling to redefine the meaning of chance, in fictional illustration, from the older concept of \`luck' to a modern concept of \`contingency' or accident. The older sense of chance represented something internal - intrinsic - to the individual. That's why coincidences and chance encounters seemed so plausible to Victorian novelists; such \`chances' were bound to happen! The \`chances' that occur in Conrad's novel certainly determine the course of events, but they are NOT bound to happen. It's not claiming too much to say that Conrad was one of the first novelists in English to write in the post-Darwin climate of scientific relativism, of atomistic, impersonal chance.Long live Marlow! I'd give a gland to run across him in a hoary harbor tavern on the Thames, and to sit spellbound for an evening, listening to one of his wanton narrations!"},{"Title":"Chance. A Tale in Two Parts.","review":"This is one of the few Conrads that I had not read before. From the descriptions I had gotten a wrong impression and had stayed away in the past. I expected a sombre rumination of female problems. Wrong expectations!It is Marlow's last performance, and it is more land-based than his 3 previous tales; but not entirely! Marlow has matured and has broader interests, he is looking into society, describes a strangely modern financial fraudster, takes up women's movement as a subject, with less than full enthusiasm.Marlow has changed his sense of humour, he is an ironist now. Past Marlows were entirely un-humorous, to the extent that I mistook him for Conrad and was surprised how funny some of Conrad's non-Marlow tales are. Take Secret Agent!Chance is as funny as Secret Agent. And yet it is also a Victorian standard plot, a damsel in distress story as any of the wildest romances of the previous century. If one would want to summarize the 'plot', it would sound very pedestrian, so I don't do it.Like Lord Jim, this novel started as a short story, initially called Dynamite. Like Rescue, Chance was interrupted and took years to be completed. Like Victory, it was an amazing commercial success for a writer who was a typical writer's writer: high reputation, little business. This book sold like hot cakes in the US and gave Conrad a comfortable last decade of his life.One might suspect the bestseller status was due to a misunderstanding, and the introduction to this edition presumes that Chance was a very unread bestseller. I am not so sure. The novel is quite entertaining. While the plot (fraudster's daughter in existential trouble gets rescued by sailor after going through all kinds of other people's schemes) is nothing spectacular, the manner of telling it is a very amusing way of the Marlow narration style: he collects bits and pieces from several sources and the tale's story is happening over 17 years. It is never a difficult structure and Marlow's ponderous style in, say, the Heart, is replaced by light-handed banter.I found it very enjoyable.'Luckily people are for the most part quite incapable of understanding what is happening to them; a merciful provision of nature to preserve an average amount of sanity.'"},{"Title":"Chance. A Tale in Two Parts.","review":"A chance meeting with a Mr Powell leads Marlow to recollect his chance connections To the Feins-and Mrs Feins' brother Captain Anthony ; his chance meeting with Flora De Barrel,daughter of a disgraced financier,and their elopement on Anthonys ship.Chance occurances and happenings connect lifes machinations according to Conrad, and this story unfolds gracefully on such chances ,with the proceedings kept in witty check by Marlows narration.Conrad is the master of descriptive, meticulously detailed story telling and 'Chance' is no exception to this rule. Perhaps a little over long, and your sympathies wax and wane at times, but a great tale written in a style and manner few in the past-and possibly none today-could match and master,"},{"Title":"Chance. A Tale in Two Parts.","review":"Right. Hats off to the other reviewers here who, to a one, are superb writers and readers as well as admirers of Conrad. It so happens, that I can't bring myself to agree with them in their unabashed adoration of this particular novel, but it is a delightful rarity in the Amazonian jungle to find an entire page full of competent, well-penned reviews. Good show, all.Unfortunately, I simply can not dish up the same unbridled enthusiasm in my assessment of this work. The plot is positively a Victorian throwback in its contrivance, which leaves not a whit in its structure to chance: Damsel in distress rescued by old codger of a sea dog, but - Avast! - curmudgeonly ex-con father of said damsel throws spanner in the works, until, after a couple of fatalities aboard ship - with which the ever so honest sea dog of a Captain goes down, damsel, once again in distress, is saved by young second mate. And they lived happily ever after.... I must say that this rather laughable plot brought to mind watercolours of Victorian women hiding under parasols on Brighton beach flipping anxiously through the pages.Luckily, and not by chance at all, to save the book from absolute inanity, we have Conrad's persistent alter ego, Marlow, telling the tale, with his pointed aperus and contemplations regarding the human plight, complete with the nested narrations, all we've come to expect from the epic spinner of yarns, regaling us with the story.The book is not unenjoyable; it just doesn't rise to the high tide of great literature which Conrad's other novels do. But, if you're willing to suspend disbelief in the contrived, well-nigh Dickensian nature of the plot and be swept along by Marlow's ruminations, the book will provide what I believe is termed a \\"good read\\". For, as Marlow avers herein: \\"Luckily, people, whether mature or not (and who really is ever mature?) are for the most part quite incapable of understanding what is happening to them...\\"A good beach read by a writer whose best work lies further out in those unfathomable depths."},{"Title":"Touch of Night (Dreamspun)","review":"This is the type of reading I love.

Armand met with Lucien in a seedy bar the Witches' Brew in a downtrodden Philadelphia neighborhood. However, Armand never came home or contacted his sister afterward.Terrified for what might happened to her sibling, Aries goes to the same bar that is the last place she knows Armand went to; there she plans to accost Lucien, the last person she knows of who spoke with her twin before he vanished. Though attracted to one another, Lucien refuses to get involved with her brother's potential plight as he insists Armand is an adult. Despondent, Ariel returns home not sure what to do next while also berating her self for wanting the so-called warlock. However, something must have happened because Lucian suddenly appears out of nowhere in her home agreeing to rescue Armand, but Ariel must accept all his stipulations starting with sacrificing her soul. Ariel wonders if her biggest fear is not for her brother or even her soul, but for her heart as Lucien frightens in ways no man has ever before.This is fantastic romantic fantasy starring two terrific protagonists. Perhaps antagonist might be a more suited definition of their early relationship as the heroine distrusts the warlock, does not believe in paranormal powers, and wonders if he harmed her twin even as she falls in love with her \\"adversary\\". The story line is action-packed while Rafferty's realm sees plausible. Still the tale belongs to the changing relationship between the cynic and the warlock with souls and hearts on the line.Harriet Klausner"},{"Title":"Touch of Night (Dreamspun)","review":"I purchased the trilogy after reading a wonderful review form someone's list.I am an avid Nora Roberts, Danielle Steel reader and these were a bit disapointing.

One African man named Sousa was even elected to the Maryland Assembly! This all changed as the need for a large, cheap labor pool grew. The 1600s saw laws giving African indentures their freedom taken away.The cultivation of labor-intensive crops increased the demand for slaves and thousands arrived every year. No matter what a slave's social standing at home, his status was equal with all the other slaves getting off the ship. Also, the African concept of slavery ending at the end of a time of service did not exist here.Potential for extreme profit triggered wars among African tribes and helped fuel the endless need for new captives. Shockingly, about ten million slaves entered the colonies from 1500 to 1800! That growing number of African-Americans in the colonies brought with it a growing fear of revolt and, therefore, ever more restrictive laws. After a 1712 revolt in New York City, slaves were burned at the stake for their involvement. Naturally, passive resistance became an effective tool because a slowdown could leave a plantation owner financially ruined.African-Americans in the Thirteen Colonies clearly presents the history of slavery to the modern struggle with discrimination. Onesimus, James Derham, Benjamin Banneker, Phillis Wheatley and other notable African-Americans are discussed. Illustrations, a glossary and timeline all add to the book's value. Deborah Kent's book is a tremendous asset to any student's understanding of a challenging and very disturbing subject.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"African-Americans in the Thirteen Colonies (Cornerstones of Freedom)","review":"The student's in special education enjoyed using this book to study social studies."},{"Title":"SEX AND THE OFFICE.","review":"This is a follow-up to \\"Sex And The Single Girl\\". It deals with surviving as a nubile female in a large office in a very large city (New York or Los Angeles). And in the 1960ies or even '50ies. Like the original, saucy sex features heavily in the title and the promise, but little in the book. Instead there are mostly anecdotes and some very jumbled advice. One example is to ignore it if your employer forces a kiss on your mouth after the job interview because he's just a weirdo who will do this to anyone. It's all a bit musty and unenlightened and unwitty.

There's precious little violence and no sex, and certainly no drugs or rock and roll (although there is a little drinking). No, there is simply fine story-telling, with believable and likeable characters.If you saw the TNT western, THE GOOD OLD BOYS (starring Tommy Lee Jones), then you know about Hewey Calloway, one of the last of the good ol' cowboys of west Texas back in the early 1900s. The film of course came from Kelton's earlier book about Hewey and his pals. THE SMILING COUNTRY continues Hewey's story four years later, and some of the same folks are here again - Snort Yarnell, Hewey's brother Walter and wife, and of course Miss Spring Renfro. I ain't gonna give any detailed spoilers here, but I will say it's a \\"happily ever after\\" kinda book - I hope. 'Cause I loved this book.I've only read a couple of Kelton's books - THE PUMPKIN ROLLERS comes to mind - but just a couple years ago I read Kelton's memoir, SANDHILLS BOY, which was an engaging and wonderful book about a man I wish I'd known - a WWII veteran who brought home a bride from Austria. Theirs was a happily-ever-after story,because they were still married when Kelton died in 2009. A terrible loss to the writers' community, and to the world in general. Fortunately for western lovers - or just lovers of good books for that matter - Elmer Kelton left behind dozens of great books in which he will live on for a long time.

The remainder were returned to this camp or to concentration camps.The bravery and ingenuity of those involved is staggering. They constructed 250 compasses, moulding the casings from broken gramophone records and then adding needles and glass. The entire construction is detailed and is amazing.They moved hundreds of tons of sand, made bellows for moving fresh air about, forged papers. All this was done by scrounging and stealing the required materials. Then the talents of the prisoners were put to use in making what was required.This camp was the one where Eric Williams and colleagues escaped from and was immortalised in The Wooden Horse.The author Paul Brickhill was also a prisoner at this camp at this time but he did not partake in the tunnelling or escape due to his claustrophobia.This a a very moving tale of bravery and determination and another reminder why ANZAC Day is so important, - that we never forget -what previous generations have done for us."},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"Yes, all the other reviewers are correct!

My family and I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this during a long road trip; 7.5 hours on one disk instead of fumbling around for multiple disks was also very helpful. The narrator does an excellent job in expressing the emotions of the characters and also holding the attention of the listener. I highly recommend this story and this audiobook version to anyone with an interest in history, especially WWII and military history."},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"A couple of people offhandedly told me I ought to read this book. I eventually got around to buying it -- and could not put the thing down. When I finished it, it didn't take long before I started it again; and ordered another book on POWs in Germany. Since then I've read about every book on this subject I can get my hands on; Brickhill did /that/ good of a job.Admittedly, the men lack some characterization, but the story is so vibrant that can be passed over. (TryA Gallant Company: The True Story of the Man of \\"The Great Escape\\"for characters). Brickhill relays some of the other escapes that were pulled in the camp -- several unsuccessful and a couple \\"home runs\\". The story flows with the feel almost of fiction, it's so well-paced. You'll be drawn in by the story; it is at times funny, others tragic, but you won't let go. It's too Great."},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"Paul Brickhill is a superb author and this is one of his finest works. Far better than the film - if you thought the film was far fetched, well, the truth is even more astonishing. An exhilarating history, and an absolute must-read."},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"Paul Brickhill's novel \\"The Great Escape\\" is absorbing reading about British and American POW's efforts to escape from the camps of their German captors. What is significant about this book is the ingenuity and tactics employed by the prisoners in their numerous escape attempts. Most people are familiar with the film of the same name, but this book goes into much greater depth and detail. What I found most interesting about the book was how the Allies were able to bribe the German guards into obtaining essentials they needed for their escape and aftermath. The German guards' fear of retribution from their own superiors helped advance the Allies' efforts. This is a very good book and makes for good reading. Paul Brickhill's dedication is \\"for the fifty\\" who paid the ultimate price of which there is no greater honor."},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"An incredible story of raw determination, ingenuity and organization, substantiated with photographs mostly taken by the Germans. Man, is this ever a quick read! I couldn't put it down, and I'm *not* an avid reader. I would have read it faster were it not for so much flipping back to the diagram of the compound to follow along with the text. No one, no matter how imaginative, could have possibly made all this up.There are many parallels with the movie: There actually was a prisoner in possession of a brand new civilian suit (obtained in Prague on a previous escape attempt and smuggled back into camp), someone who took a trunk through the tunnel, and the guards actually did use the prisoners' English word to refer to the \\"cooler.\\" Also true was that once outside the fence, one was far from being \\"out of the woods,\\" figuratively as well as literally; one was still deep within the heavily-policed, papers-conscious Reich.There wasn't just one tunnel, though, and here are accounts of absolutely relentless escape attempts and incredibly clever make-do fabrications of fake everything, from gate passes to German uniforms and gun replicas --out of anything they could scavenge, inveigle, connive, beg, borrow, or steal.There is insight regarding the personalities of the Germans as well as the prisoners, and why these POWs, mostly pilots, were placed in a relatively humane camp, and how they built a well-managed intelligence network among themselves. Some of the British slang and military acronyms from a bygone era gave me pause, but it was part of the adventure. A very inspiring tale!"},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"I first saw the movie as a child in the 1960's, and became fascinated with the subject, which lead me to this book. The details of the escape are described in minute detail. The drawings included, made by Kenyon, one of the camp artists, are very informative and clear. They show such things as the layout of the camp and its tunnels as well as the stooge system for protecting the forgers from approaching Germans.One can sense every emotion from Brickhill's writing: The cursing of the diggers when buried by sandfalls while excavating the tunnels, the frustration of those attempting to remove the outer cover of tunnel Harry's exit shaft, the shock of the discovery that Harry's exit was as much as 30 feet short of the woods, the fury of the Germans at discovery of the mass escape, etc. One can also see that the evacuation of 200 POWs through one tunnel in one night, even without setbacks (such as the air raid) turned out to be an impossible goal. Most men in the tunnel took much longer than 2-3 minutes to get through it. In fact, several got stuck several times.A major factor leading to the rapid capture of most of the \\"hardarsers\\" (those striking out on foot) was the snow on the ground. It forced most of the men to walk on or near the roads, where they were easily spotted and apprehended for questioning.Brickhill also devotes some detail to the pursuit of the German murderers of 50 of the escapees. He recounts the lack of cooperation of the Soviet-imposed Communist puppet government of Poland, in which the previously-German Stalag Luft III campsite had found itself after the establishment of the Oder-Neisse line as the postwar boundary of Poland. (Of course, Brickhill could not have foresawn the fact that after Communism fell in Poland after 45 years, the Polish officials were free to express an avid interest in the onetime site of the camp)."},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"By now, everyone knows the story. I bought the film version on DVD a while back. I laughed a lot and enjoyed the film greatly (I think it's well done).The tale is immense in scope, so I figured I'd read the book. I was in for a huge surprise. Half of the film's ideas come from Brickhill's prelude, and have nothing to do with the actual escape (or camp!). This meant only one thing: Brickhill's tale, thick as it is, is going to be completely original and that much more satisfying a read.Paul Brickhill was the boss of a small group of prisoners who worked as stooges (watching out for Germans espying on their prisoners' doings). He writes fluidly and very well, and his obvious post-war research is superb (he tells the German angle in some parts). The book is easy to read, has moments of humor, and the descriptions are fantastic and there is never, ever, a dull moment from page one.Little did I realize how much the film throws out the horrors of Nazi Germany (or seemingly takes it in stride). The film plays out escaping as a game, and even in the book, characters try to escape constantly. While the Geneva Convention includes a clause that states escaping should not be prosecuted severely, as it is a logical reaction to imprisonment, the reader will recall that Nazis don't necessarily believe in anything other than the word \\"kill.\\" Therein lies the terror.There is no Steve McQueen here, and, while there is a cooler, it's the least of the prisoners' fears. There isn't a small group of characters that the story revolves around. There are hundreds of people, and Paul introduces them at varying and strategic places within the story. You learn about new escapees up to the very last chapter. Everyone is a hero in his own way.And while I was reading, I admittedly \\"forgot\\" about the Nazi terror and was constantly thrilled to see what would happen next, not realizing how everyone's lives were really in constant danger. Chapter 19 is one of the most frightening moments in the book. It is also the introduction of Hitler, and some of his own decisions regarding the Britons, the Americans, and even the Germans themselves.Brickhill's fears aren't of being caught and thrown into a cooler. It is of being caught by the Kriminalpolizei, or the Gestapo, or of starving while eating illegally small portions of German rations (at one point, the prisoners are fed filthy water condensed on a motorcar engine).This book is quite simply amazing. Do not expect the quasi-solo efforts of the brilliant escapes and happy fortunes as occurs in the book \\"Papillon.\\" Expect frustrations, anger, impatience and, most of all, the miraculous teamwork that results into a years-long plan: the great escape.I read the 1966 Fawcett Crest edition (see \\"customer images\\"), which includes an introduction by Brickhill's Stalag Luft III cohort George Harsh, and new illustrations from fellow prisoner Ley Kenyon, based on his own original drawings from the war."},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"Paul Brickhill's novel \\"The Great Escape\\" is absorbing reading about British and American POW's efforts to escape from the camps of their German captors.

They emphasize quite different aspects, and some parts of the movie were clearly made up with entertainment value in mind (people jumping motorcycles over fences for instance!). I can't blame the movie makers of course, because the compelling essence of this story is the daily slog of tunnelling set against the backdrop of the mind-numbing drudgery of incarceration. No movie could be long enough to get this point across, but the book allows one to build up a better picture of what captivity was like, particularly because it provides such incredible details. I was really struck by the ingenious ways the prisoners found to fake German uniforms and official passes, improvise tools, and build radios and other vital pieces of equipment. The book provides sufficient descriptions to allow you to get an impression of the main characters and camp layout, though I personally would have enjoyed a few photographs of the people involved (good and bad), though I realise these wouldn't have been easy to obtain.The author has a relatively dry style typical of a historian rather than a dramatist, and at times relates key events remarkably passionately. The book ratchets up the tension without having to try too hard however, and I could sense the tension that existed whenever the guards entered the barracks to check for tunnels. The depression that accompanies every uncovered tunnel jumps out of the page, as does the resolve to keep trying to escape without ever accepting captivity.I was also pleased that the author described the events some time after the final escape, so that I could see how thoroughly the Allied authorities pursued the main protagonists, and what was their evetual fate.This book was a fine testament to the memory of the brave men who didn't wilt despite literally years of incarceration in conditions that can best be desribed as spartan. If they had all died without anyone knowing their story the world would be a poorer place."},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"220 Allied POWs would have been swarming all over the Third Reich before the Germans realized they were missing. Unfortunately, only 76 managed to escape through a tunnel under Stalag Luft III that had taken a year to dig. Of those 76, only 3 managed to make their way back to Britain. Twelve found themselves back in Stalag Luft II in a matter of days. Eight wound up in concentration camps. The remaining 50 were shot by the Gestapo, on orders from Hitler himself. Among the 50 was South African-born RAF Squadron Leader Roger Bushell, a.k.a. &quot;Big X&quot;, the originator of the escape plan. The Great Escape is an incredible read. While the book is narrated from third person omniscience, its author was anything but detatched from the story. Paul Brickhill mentions his own role in the escape only very briefly in the foreword to the work. A key element of the escape plan, as Brickhill recounts in great detail, was the forging of official papers required for freedom of movement across the Reich. Brickhill led the gang of &quot;stooges&quot; that warned the forgers when camp guards approached. He found himself barred from participating in the actual escape when Big X learned of his acute claustrophobia. That fear may well have saved his life. After the war, Brickhill interviewed several of his other fellow survivors to assemble the grand narrative. The result is a riveting tale that ranks among the greatest war stories ever written, fact or fiction. You've seen the movie. Now read the book!"},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"This is an exceptional book for many reasons. The main escape is truly one of the more tense scenes I've ever read, and it is truly incredibile, but there are more dimenstions to this book.Brickhill gives us a first-hand account of life in a German POW camp. He goes into great detail jury-rigged engineering involved. From building the tools, to digging dunnels, to forging documents, to designing air pumps, all in a covert way in a prison camp environment.An interesting them was that they were escaping to a far more dangerous place then the prison camps. WWII Germany was not a safe place to be picked up by the Gestapo if you were an Allied soldier. Brickhill's complete research into the fate's off all the people involved on the German and Allied sides caps of the book perfectly.I also highly recommend seeing the NOVA special on PBS about The Great Escape after reading this book. They show excavations of the tunnels as well as interviews with the soldiers."},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"Paul Brickhill, based on his actual experiences in a prison camp and using characters based on real life POW's, takes the reader behind the wire at a World War II prison camp. These men were trapped, unable to fight for their country in battle, so they found a way to do the next best thing. Led by Roger Bushell, they formed the X organization, a group of the most intelligent and resourceful prisoners from the British and American air forces. Using only their wits and the few materials available, they devised and executed a plan to tunnel under the fences and escape into Nazi Germany. Unfortunately this led to fifty of the escapees being shot by the Gestapo, but Brickhill does credit to their memory with this book. Using a light writing style, humorous anecdotes, and fascinating descriptions, Brickhill has created an entirely readable adventure with charismatic protagonists who gain the readers respect and sympathy from page one."},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"I'm writing you about a man named Steve Martin who came to my house last evening to show me his collection of 'Great Escape' original material. As you know, my father was the first Canadian Prisoner of war and was #68 of the 76 who escaped. This is how he came to call me up for this meeting. I was completely blown away by his collection. He has a rare letter from BIG X, Roger Bushell, who of course was the leader of escape. He has a tile from the Harry tunnel, that the stove was resting on, tons of stuff on Wally Floody, who engineered the escape and became friends with Steve. Also pictures of George Harsh, if you're a historian you should know this name or research it, and Johnny Dodge [the artful dodger]. The list go on. He even has sand from the tunnel. He's 42yrs old and when he was 12 he read Paul Brichman's 'The Great Escape' and got hooked and has been collecting ever since . He's gone to their reunions and has several letters and autographs. He has a museum of history pertaining to the 'Great Escape'. I can't even get close to telling you what he showed me and he said that was nothing compared to his complete set. I urged him to get a web page set up to which he has very little experience with computors. This man has a gold mine and needs direction.

This is the true, fascinating story of how an incredibly resourceful group of POW's was able to plan and execute a mass escape from a NAZI prison-camp. Every school-child should have to read this book, to learn what we all are capable of if we set goals and persevere. The detective story in the epilogue is fascinating reading as well. It would make a great full-length story on its own."},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"It's really amazing that these POWs could actually go through all of this. I was completely saddened when I read about the fifty men who were shot. It was totally depressing that all that hard work, perservance and risk taking ended in such a lost of life. I can't believe it is true. People today just don't have the same type of endurance, patience nor resourcefulness. We could all learn a lesson from this book. It is a bit long . . . almost a How-To guide for prison camp escape but the information is really interesting and it was really intelligence how the men were able to make something useful out of nothing. They were really able to draw on their skills. Although, my people were never in the war, this story reminded me of the Inuit's way of finding what they need out of nothing. Resourcefulness and creative thinking are very important skills for any culture."},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"This is an engrossing tale of courage and ingenuity. Amazingly, under the paranoid eyes of their German captors, 76 RAF prisoners of war managed to tunnel their way to (at least temporary) freedom. The story is presented as a factual account - there isn't much dialogue, and characterisation is sketchy, but this is inevitable; a novelisation of the book would have spoiled it, for me at least. The blow-by-blow details of how the escape was accomplished are engrossing, and the author generates tension skillfully. I found myself in the tunnel with the roof collapsing, and shivering in the snow outside the wire fretting about the guards and searchlights. A cracking read from start to finish."},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"On one level, it is one very well-told war story and ranks at the top of its genre on those terms.More important, it is a celebration of human ingenuity and our capacity to overcome, accomplish, and organize.

A mixed group of British and American fliers, many of whom were veterans of previous escape attempts, planned and implemented a year-long scheme to dig three tunnels under the noses of their German captors, one of which finally reached outside the compound and permitted an escape attempt. Brickhill was one of the POWs who worked on the effort; he provides fascinating details on the security plan that hid the tunnels from the Germans, along with the associated efforts to improvise equipment, escape clothing, and fake documentation. Brickhill also sketches the personalities of the leading participants, many of whom will be familar in outline to those who enjoyed the movie \\"The Great Escape.\\"Brickhill also provides the necessary context of realism. The POWs were half-starved, suffering from the effects of years of confinement and separation from home and family, and in constant danger of provoking deadly retaliation from the Germans. That so many sacrificed so much is a testament to them all as human beings and representatives of the Allied military effort.This book is highly recommended to those readers interested in the POW experience or wanting the real story behind \\"The Great Escape.\\""},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"This is a wonderful tale about Allied Prisoners Of War who escape their camp thanks to a tunnel that they dug.

This book is a great example of the Triumph of The Human Spirit in the face of Adversity.If you have seen the movie do yourself a big favour and read this book.And if you haven't seen the movie read this book anyway.

The combination of a seemingly hopeless situation ( a POW camp ), the meager supplies and materials to work with ( i.e. carving an official stamp out of a boot heel! ) and Mr. Brickhill's descriptions that give one the feeling of actually being there, create a story that no true thinking man ( or person ) can deny as even more fascinating than the movie.

Prisoners from any background other than capitalistic democracies such as the UK and the USA would not have had the will, the initiative, the creativity and the sheer gall to achieve what these men did (and it compares in no way to a bunch of fanatic brutes who simply hijack some planes and crash them). (And, we certainly don't see any of those Al-Queda thugs escaping from the US Army's prison compound in Cuba!)The conception, the planning, the attention to detail, the manufacture of materials (including coercion of foolish German louts who fell into blackmail traps) and the execution make this one of the most riveting stories, war or otherwise, ever told.

The movie of the Great Escape is one of my favorite all-time movies. So I was excited to read the book, and it did not disappoint.

The section on the post-war search for those responsible for the murder of the 50 is also worth reading.When Brickhill tells of his own part in the escape (providing security for the forgers), you can get an idea of how large the X Organization really was.It's not &quot;Hogans Heroes&quot; or the Hollywood movie based on the book - it's the real story and it's well worth the time spent reading it."},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"It's a shame the publisher decided to put a picture on the cover of Steve McQueen wrapped up in the barbed wire at the end of his big motorcycle escape attempt. Because, you see, that never happened in the TRUE story of the Great Escape contained in this book. The movie (while good) took serious dramatic license, while Brickhill's book presents the facts. And they are quite inspiring and thrilling enough without the addition of fictional elements such as McQueen's stunt riding.I first read this book while in elementary school, and was hooked to the extent that I've read it many times since over the decades. A truly outstanding story."},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"This is a true story, written by a man who was there, Paul Brickhill. The year is 1943, and thousands of Allied aircrews and soldiers find themselves forced as unwilling guests to endure German military hospitality. Led by Roger Bushell, hundreds of Allied officers, worked right under the Germans' noses to prepare and conduct the largest Allied POW escape during all of WWII. Though living on semi-starvation rations and locked up away from the world, these ingenious men craft tools from cans and odd bits of metal, sew suits and civilian clothes from uniforms and shoe polish, make mining equipment from bedboards and duffel bags, and create almost perfect forgeries of German IDs and travel documents. And they manage to do all this despite the very strenuous and determined efforts of their German guards to detect all this.The focal points of all this activity are the escape routes themselves - tunnels called Tom, Dick, and Harry. Rather than pinning all their hopes on a single tunnel, the prisoners start working on three tunnels simultaneously! Although they later give up their effort on two of these tunnels, their foresight later enables them to make their escape as their original tunnel was discovered and destroyed. These desperate men are playing a dangerous game as the German population and government is becoming increasingly embittered and bloodthirsty against Allied servicemen, especially aircrews that are systematically leveling German's cities.After almost a year of planning and preparing, the prisoners set the date for escape. Over 200 men are granted spots in the night's escape roster! They are dressed in their civilian clothes, carrying valid IDs and travel permits, using prisoner-mimeographed escape maps, holding plenty of Reichsmarks, and stocked with iron rations. Everything has been planned to the last detail. (How they managed to secure and/or make all this you will have to read to believe.) When they make their break, it will become the biggest manhunt in all of Nazi Germany's history!The TV show, Hogan's Heroes, is loosely based on this book with many of the personalities and ideas taken from Brickhill's book. What I enjoyed most about the book was the ingenuity and perseverance of these men to overcome such huge difficulties in organizing their unprecedented escape. The book is a breeze to read with the words flowing effortlessly across the page - I had it read in 3 - 4 days. It also has a few hand-drawn illustrations. Not just a great book, but also a true-life story of determination, dedication, and success!"},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"I first read the book when I was 13 in 1968. The creativity of the prisoners was a thrill to read.Sad that 50 of them were murdered by the Germans."},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"The Great Escape is one of the best books I have ever read. The plot take major twists that I never saw coming. The Book keeps you on your toes and guessing what is goin to happen next but you bever can guess right. Paul Brickhill does an amazing job on making the book flow together. The way the soliders use common items to escape is amazing, it is very creative in what items they use to make certian tools. Its a great read and not too increadably long."},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"If you want to know how to make something out of nothing, this is the book for you.

Dee SchauerTexas"},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"What a wonderful book. I've read it a few times and I marvel at the every day heroism displayed by the hungry, sex-starved men of Stalag Luft III.My own copy is the First Edition, printed by Norton in 1950 and signed by George Harsh who wrote the Introduction. I got it for an astonishing $12 and it's one of the most treasured books in my collection.It's part memoir and historical account. You read as the POWs begin their audacious plan and despite for many of them, what would be a tragic ending, you marvel at what these men had to endure and go through.Despite the tragedy, this is no weepy account. This is a testimony to the human spirit which triumphs in the face of human isolation. They are prisoners true, but they in the end, are the ones to triumph over nazism.The movie of course, inspired me to read the book, but just remember that the movie's characters are fictional composites of the real men. It would do well to remember the old cliche, \\"the book is always better than the movie,\\" which is entirely true in this case.A Wonderful Book.Read It."},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"I found this book to be really good. I really liked the ingenuity that these POW's used in their attempts to escape. The book describes the problems that the escapees were faced with as they planned an escape and how these problems were eventually solved. The way the book details some of the German guards was interesting also because some guards were helpful in making the great escape possible. The book that I read was the paperback version and had many drawings that give you an idea of what the camp and tunnels looked like. I did run into the hardback copy later and found that it contained actual photos from the prison camp and had actual pictures of the tunnels and of some of the participants both German and Allied. I give this book a thumbs up for anyone looking for a book that offers a different look of WWII, one from inside a German POW camp."},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"I love both the movie and the book but they can't be compared to each other. The book gives a true look into the civility of regular German guards and captured Allied aircrews. With only a few prisoners succeeding in the escape, the book shows a true spirit of freedom."},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"No idea how many times I read this, growing up. You should see the thing. No boy should be allowed to grow up without the opportunity to read this book."},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"I'vve not read it"},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"It's a rare thing indeed to discover a movie adaptation is actually better than the book that inspired it, but here it is: Paul Brickhill's THE GREAT ESCAPE is a great plot with no characters to speak of.Brickhill gives a firsthand account of the escape of 76 men from Sagan, a German prisoner-of-war camp, during World War II. Through tireless efforts and disheartening setbacks, the men managed to dig a lengthy tunnel 30 feet down into the earth, and 300 feet towards possible freedom. The plan, which originally called for three such tunnels, was the single largest escape in WWII history, and the efforts, patience, and bravery of the men secures their escape as one of the most noble efforts of man.What a pity, then, that THE GREAT ESCAPE is a fairly badly written first-hand narrative, related with all the style of a person making a grocery list. Brickhill has provided the bones of an amazing story, but he neglected to provide any meat along with them.The story couldn't help but lend itself to a fascinating read. The actions of these men could never be anything less than remarkable. But all Brickhill does is tell the story. He doesn't add any true characterization to the hundreds of people who pop in and out, resulting in a lack of empathy for these men. The reader is left wanting to know more, but is frustratingly denied the opportunity. Even the leader, Roger Bushell, is a cipher, easily interchangeable with any other character.It is easy to see why this story makes such fertile ground for a movie. The plot is astonishing, and the complete absence of any true personality leaves the filmmakers free to make up any character they want. Roger Bushell didn't escape from Sagan, Richard Attenborough did. So did Steve McQueen and Charles Bronson.I don't want to seem as if I am making light of the situation. THE GREAT ESCAPE was a shining example of what humanity can achieve under the most strenuous circumstances. But Brickhill doesn't provide us with any reason to care. The story unfolds with all the excitement and tension of someone telling of their day at work. Simplicity in storytelling can be a fine thing, but not where the story demands so much more."},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"I read this book, as many readers might be so, I am a big fun of the movie \\"The Great Escape\\" staring Steve McQueen, Richard Attenborogh. I was so crazy about it then bought a book.The book is not an original story of the movie, that is a real story during WW2. The movie is dramatized so more entertained but less accurate and cut details.There is not a great bike scene by McQueen but many aspects of escape dramas, I would say that is more dramatic."},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"I'll admit I can't say much, and from whay other reviewers wrote, it WAS an amazing story, but does ot really call for swears? Okay, in quotes, fine. In the text, I myself find fault. I don't mean to judge, but as for those who want swear-free reading, steer clear unless you feel like using a white-out pen on practically every page. I didn't even get past the first chapter since it didn't seem worth the time and effort of whiting-out so much. This reveiw is merey my personal opinion and to also aware those that want CLEAN reading material. I am not judging. I hope I helped!!!"},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"Brickhill's book is a fascinating story and extremely well written. It is more visual in its writing than the movie ever was. The story is fascinating and the roles played by men of all types reaffirms the capability for heroes within all of us. As a younger man I read every book I could find about WWII POWs. This included both American and English publishers, and covered both the European and Pacific theatres of war. The Great Escape does a better job in taking us there and making us part of the action than anything else written. I would also suggest adding the title &quot;King Rat&quot; by James Clavell to your links for books of this type."},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"I have an original paperback of this book from 1956. I read it for the first time in 1975 for the first time after seeing the movie on t.v. have since read it a dozen times and now my 11 year son has also read it. It is a story of true courage and heroism that most people in the world seem to have forgotten about. A great life's lesson is to be learned in this tale."},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"A fascinating account of one of the most interesting events in World War II. I would advise any one interested in WWII or prison escapes to read it."},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"This book was great anyone who liked the movie, will love the book. This one of the best adventure stories of all time."},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"I love the movie the Great Escape and I loved reading the book it was based on. The movie did an excellant job of following the book but reading the book gave me so much more of an understanding of what these men went through and the courage they had. To truely understand the courage these men had and what they went through, you have to read the book."},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"Very interesting and easy to read. Even though we have seen the movie many times,this book was exciting. I was once more impressed about the toughness and the resourcefullness of these men who fought in World War II. If you have an interest in World War II you should definitely read this."},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"A fan of the movie, I wanted to read the book. Knowing that the author was one of the prisoners means you are getting the real story, as they experienced it and remembered it later. It was fun to see just how well the movie did capturing what really happened (even if no Americans really escaped through the tunnel). It was an incredibly entralling book. I followed it with &quot;Stalag Luft III&quot; which was disappointing in that it seems to be more a history of how the Germans took care of those in the camp rather than of those in the camp."},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"The Great Escape by Paul Brickhill is a great retelling of the now famous mass escape from Stalag Luft III near Sagan, Germany in the spring of 1944. Brickhill documents in great detail all the little things the prisoners had to do to escape from the so called \\"perfect camp\\" they had been placed in. Hundreds of prisoners played a part in the digging of the three tunnels(Tom, Dick, and Harry), forging hundreds of papers, making clothes for all the escapees, watching for the German guards, \\"ferrets\\", and so much more. It is astounding as you read the novel how much actually went into the mass escape of 250 officers. Unfortunately, only 76 prisoners made it out before the tunnel was discovered. The book also documents the aftermath of the famous escape as the prisoners attempt to make their way to freedom, and then their subsequent executions at the hands of the Gestapo and SS. This is an excellent book that tells the true story of what really happened during the Great Escape.If you haven't seen the movie The Great Escape, I highly recommend reading the book and watching the movie. While watching the movie, you can see what characters are based on the real people who took part in the escape. The movie takes some liberties, but it is an excellent companion to the book. An interesting fact is that author Paul Brickhill was one of thousands of prisoners at Stalag Luft III where he documented this incredible story. Also taking part in the movie was tunneller, Wally Floody, who served as a technical advisor to director/producer, John Sturges. For an excellent depiction of the famous mass escape from Stalag Luft III, check out The Great Escape, and the movie too!"},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"In this installment British and American prisoners are trapped in a Nazi POW camp, and takes place in Germany during WWII. Of the group that trys to escape is the books author himself, Paul Brickhill. Led by fearless Englishmen named Roger Bushell, both British and Americans come together and plan an escape from the Nazi camp. The task is hard, digging tunnels under the camp's grounds, while creating their clothing and/or weapons needed to dig the tunnels and escpape. The men are faced with many different turnpoints and struggles like: they would have to restart digging a tunnel everytime they made a little mistake or they would have to go without any sleep night after night. I really enjoyed reading this book and recommend it for ages 6th grade and up. Thank You!"},{"Title":"The Great Escape","review":"As good as the movie \\"The Great Escape\\" is, it's impossible for it to capture in full detail the grunt work, planning, and tedious efforts that went into digging tunnels out of this prison camp. When simply acquiesing to the Germans and spending the time in the POW camp playing ball may have appeared a safer, less strenuous route, scores of these men never ceased making lives hell for the Nazis by constantly digging and preparing for breakouts (and thus often making life miserable for themselves).It is easy to forget that these POWs had every reason to believe that they would be prisoners for 8, 10, maybe 15 years, the prospect of which must have been devesating. Brickhill captures the efforts, personalities (on both sides), and ultimate tragedy in a very readable, tight story. Highly recommended for all ages!"},{"Title":"Poughkeepsie: Halfway Up The Hudson (NY) (Images of America)","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Poughkeepsie, NY: Halfway up the Hudson!

I found a later version of this manual that seems to actually give some trouble-shooting ideas for each code. It's not great, but better than this one, but it unfortunately is for the 24V engine, and I have the 12V engine, so it wasn't perfect either.But, I don't think there is better info for these VWs available."},{"Title":"ENGLISH WAYFARING LIFE IN THE MIDDLE AGES","review":"J.J. Jusserand's \\"English Wayfaring Life in the Middle Ages\\" was first published in English by Ernest Benn Ltd., in 1889, as translated by Lucy Toulmin Smith. The last revised edition was published in 1920, by which time it was already showing its age, as the occasional attempts to bring it up to date reveal. Despite a nineteenth-century flavor of antiquarian curiosity-collecting, it retained a following, and was reprinted soon after World War II (1950). I have a University Paperback reprint (Methuen & Co., Ltd., London, and Barnes and Noble Inc., New York), originally issued in 1961.In the late 1960s it was still fairly common to see it cited in bibliographies and suggested reading lists, usually in connection with \\"The Canterbury Tales,\\" but sometimes with a book for children, \\"Adam of the Road,\\" by Elizabeth Janet Gray (1942; itself currently in print). There were apparently reprintings during the 1970s and 1980s which I have not seen. Now, well past the book's centennial, it is available from Kessinger. I would not be surprised to see it picked up by another publisher.What, except inertia in non-medievalist circles, and perhaps a certain (limited) practical utility for readers of Chaucer, has kept the book going? It continues to be available in the face of several revolutions in approaches to the Middle Ages, and a basic shift in scholarship from anecdotes and quaint customs to elaborate documentation and tightly focused questions. Other, more technically distinguished, books on medieval life languish out of print, and \\"English Wayfaring Life\\" still goes on -- and on, and on.Mainly, I think, it is the book's sheer charm. Jusserand had read a great deal, and selected really interesting bits and pieces to fit together in a loose framework. Despite the juxtaposition of possibly atypical incidents from a wide variety of times and several regions of the British Isles, the idea of presenting the types of people, places, and events a medieval traveler might have encountered makes the book feel like a narrative, rather than a rummage-sale bin. And Jusserand (and the translator!) could really write. Although the presentation is occasionally cloying, and the grasp of \\"modern\\" science and medicine sometimes so vague as to be amusing, Jusserand obviously likes the world waiting to be discovered in old documents, and wants the reader to share this interest.J. J. Jusserand also wrote \\"A Literary History of the English People,\\" which Tolkien alluded to with contempt in a public lecture (\\"Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics\\"). Years ago I tried to read it, on the strength of \\"Wayfaring Life,\\" and I understand Tolkien's annoyance. Jusserand there seemed to value anything in English in direct proportion to its similarity to something in French, and attributed anything he didn't comprehend to English muddle-headedness -- or beer. (If only those Anglo-Saxons drank more wine!) Michael Drout has an account of the matter in his edition of Tolkien's \\"Beowulf and the Critics.\\"But in \\"Wayfaring Life,\\" Jusserand mostly stuck to concrete details, didn't pass off literary judgments as historical facts (at least not often enought to remember), and is fun, if hardly as authoritative as he perhaps imagined."},{"Title":"God Believes in You","review":"God Believes in You is a children's Christian picturebook with an abiding message of faith and love.

But the plot thickens in Singh's second; what if being the first to find, &quot;The Proof,&quot; meant having the upper hand in matters of terrorism, or the key to victory in World War? Singh shows that cipher-math has played an important role in historical events, and will continue to play a role in the security of individuals, corporations, and countries.While I won't be losing sleep trying to win the book's $15,000 Cipher Challenge, (I've got a Pentium II) I will now think hard about how cipher technology is used and regulated. Should the government be allowed to prohibit absolute cipher-security to protect citizens from harm, or does the right to privacy outweigh the risk of computer-aided crime and terror? I'm not the one with the recipe for Coke under his pillow, but if I were, thoughts of cipher legislation would keep me from resting easily.I really enjoyed The Code Book, but it should have been thicker with the stories for which Singh suggested there wasn't enough room. I hoped for more stories about the race between cryptographers and cryptanalysts, desperate to gain any intelligence advantage, holding the future of the free world in their hands; as a diversion from the objectives of the book, Singh chose only to relate the cracking of Linear-B. (Not quite &quot;The Day of the Jakcal.&quot;) Otherwise, however, The Code Book is, &quot;Uif Tiju!&quot;"},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"The solution of signals encrypted with the Enigma was one of the outstanding efforts by the Allies during WWII. The contributions of the Polish code breakers to this effortwere of monumental importance as were the efforts made at Bletchley Park. Reading signals from Nazi Uboats, microwave radar and the efforts of brave men led to success in the battle of the North Atlantic. Moreover the concept of designing an electromechanical mechine to recover clear text represents one of the important early steps in the history of the development of the modern computer. This is most clearly seen in the relationship between Colossus and the Lorenz Gehimeschreiber. This book provides an extremely thorough and readily understandable explaination of the operation of Egnima. For this reason alone, I consider it extremely rewarding reading. For those who have not previously explored any of the history of cryptography this book provides a highly readable overview of remote and recent events as they relate to the topic. I found it extremely informative with regard to the function of the plug board on the Enigma. It was quite interesting to learn that this component of the device provided the the greatest number of possible encryption but was the second least secure aspect of its operation. Operator error, of course, being the very least."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This book reads like a novel, but keeps a very technical perspective. I would recomend this book for anyone intrested in cryptology, followed by applied cryptography.Awsome book"},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"I received this book as a Christmas present, and had nearly finished it before the sun set Chirstmas Day. Though I have only completed two of the ciphers Mr. Singh includes in the competition he sponsors, deciphering the codes helped me understand better the mindsets of those he describes, and the analyses he forwards."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"I'm sure everyone is familiar with the idea of the \\"monoalphabetic cipher,\\" wherein a message is written in code by letting one letter represent another. To the untrained eye, the resulting text looks like gibberish without any structure. This is the starting point of Simon Singh's excellent primer on the nature of codes and ciphers, and he quickly points out the inherent weakness of the monoalphabetic cipher. As fans of game shows like Wheel of Fortune know, some letters are more common than others; the cipher is easily broken by frequency analysis - the most common letters in the enciphered text are going to be E, A, and S, for example. So, in fact, the enciphered text DOES have structure, and it's there for the deciphering by a codebreaker.The strength of Singh's book is its readability and structure. He introduces various methods of encoding information, points out the weaknesses that were exploited to break the code, then how the cryptographers came up with a new code to foil the codebreakers. Singh especially stresses the practicality of each method - there are very simple encoding schemes that are actually unbreakable, but also completely impractical for everyday use. This is especially important to the military - what good is a battlefield code if it takes too long to decode?Early chapters are of historical interest, but also contain codes and ciphers that are very easy to understand, so the reader gets comfortable with the language and problems of cryptography. Each chapter presents a more complex cipher than the previous, and each time Singh explains it easily, even such convoluted automations as the Nazi Enigma machine. He offers some fascinating diversions into ancient language elucidation (e.g., heiroglyphics), and eventually ends with a discussion of quantum computers and quantum cryptography. This is an area especially challenging to explain to the lay reader - based on the other reviews, he has done well. This section is clear and fascinating to read. As a chemist familiar with quantum mechanics, I can assure you that the scientific facts are presented accurately, much to the author's credit.Therefore, I highly recommend this book as an insightful, educational, and enjoyable introduction to cryptography. You will learn a lot, and will enjoy learning it."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Simon Singh has done an excellent job of narrating the history of codes and ciphers, covering material in quite a comprehensive manner, yet explaining it in a fashion that even readers who are not particularly gifted in mathematics will understand. His narration of the (frequently military) history surrounding some important events in the history of cryptography added considerable interest for me; there's just enough of it to add another dimension without there being so much that it detracts from the main story. His decision to include the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphics and Cretan Linear B script was a wise one, as well. As he notes, neither was an attempt to conceal the meanings, but the methods used are exactly parallel to many used in deciphering codes and ciphers.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This book is FANTASTIC. It details the cat and mouse game between codemakeres and codebreakers in a very lucid and intersting manner. It will make you appreciate the role of intelligence in warfare even more, and you will know about people and facilities who have influenced the course of world war 2 as much as aircrafts and battleships.This book really very interesting and informative and anyone who just wanna read a book just for kiling time should grab this one."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"I'd like to put this out there first. If you dont like math and science, get a clue you wont like this book. I however do enjoy math and science, especially computers. This book captivated me from the beginning I very much enjoyed how the material was presented in the codemaking, codebreaking chronology. There was however a section on language as code that I did not care for, but in all honesty Simon Singh writes at the beginning of the chapter that it is a bit of a detour and you do not have to read it.

He details it's use in wars, especially World War 2, and commerce. He even delves into the political ramifications of strong versus weak encryption when discussing PGP.Singh also provides easy to understand ways on how encryption works and even more intriguing, how to break it. He shows how all various encryption algorithms are done, and then how code breakers can decipher them, both in practical and historical consequences.In the end, he even provides a challenge for would be decipherers out there.

An excellent book."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Here comes another absorbing tale from Simon Singh after his equally gripping &quot;Fermat's Last Theorem&quot;. Singh must be applauded for successfully rejuvenating this arcane subject and making it accessible to the curious as well as the specialist. Cryptology is as old as human civilization and the need to put a message in a code or a cipher led to its birth. Since then it had become an inalienable part of statecraft, diplomacy, war and government strategy and now in commercial transactions.Cryptology is a science of encrypting a plain text message/data by a use of a cryptographic algorithm or cipher and making the message secure(cryptography/code-making) and in reverse decrypting the cipher text by various analytical/mathematical tools and breaking the secure data(cryptoanalysis/code-breaking). This book traces the incredible history of cryptology from the time of Caesar (the Caesar Shift cipher) to the present day attempts to secure data using quantum physics(quantum cryptology). This type of encryption is supposed to be so strong that it is impossible to break it with present day tools, but initial strides made in the development of quantum computer(based on the property of subatomic particles to attain all possible quantum states all at once as stated by the Copenhagen Interpretation and therefore computing results of different variables all at one go and thus it's potency, unlike in the present day computers where computation is done sequentially, taking one variable at a time). In between, Singh has plenty to discuss about the development of the Vigenere Cipher(16th century), ADFGVX cipher(used in WW-1), DES and finally to RSA encryption method. In RSA if an extremely large value of 'n' (product of two massive primes) are taken then the combined effort all the computers on this planet will be unable to break the RSA cipher even if they kept on working MANY TIMES the age of the universe! This is because factoring 'n' into its two large primes is extremely difficult. RSA is presently being commercially used for secure internet communications, on smart cards, secure telephones and many commercial software products. RSA differs from other encryption system because it uses public key cryptography, where key exchange could be done on non-secure lines unlike in other cases where secret key exchange is used and which has to be done in highly secure lines.After completing the book, I found some missing topics like a discussion on the Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems, the adoption of the Rijndael algorithm as the AES(Advanced Encryption System). However, these omissions in no way weakens subject. Singh has also peppered his storytelling with interesting anecdotes for good measure. Though present day cryptology is heavily dependent on mathematical tools, this book barely contains any mathematics(Only RSA details some math). However, no math does not mean the book is in any way incomplete.All in all, a truly engrossing and fascinating tale about the science of secret writing which doesn't remain so secret in front of Simon Singh's masterly storytelling.

Singh takes the perspective, that without the Bletchly Park operation, the US would not have successfully broken the Enigma code, but that is just not entirely true. The more true statement would include that the British turned over vital information early in the war to the US, which assisted the US in creating faster and better BOMBE machines, and that the advances made by the US were then never matched by the British throughout the war.I would consider this book as telling only part of the story, and David Kahn's works on the subject as being much more authoritative on the historical perspectives anyway. For more truthful and factual information about the breaking of the 4-rotor Engima machine, Kohnen's &quot;Winn and Knowles&quot; (published by Enigma Press in Poland, 1999) publication is clearly a better choice."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"If you know the history of how codes (and cyphers) were constructed and deconstructed then this is an interesting review of their history.

In addition, it seems to have been scanned, converted to text and then not entirely successfully proof-read. Surely there must be the original text-file somewhere.The occasional typo, no problem, but the lack of figures?"},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Like all narrative non-fictional works that, eventually in this case, deal with technical subjects whose details are beyond the scope of the non-specialist reader, this book attempts to strike a balance between two extremes, between a book so chock-full of technical detail that it reads like a textbook and a book that skimps so completely on the heart of the matter at hand that it can only be described as fluff. Singh has done a remarkable job in balancing the two here, it seems to me, and the book is worth any reader's time whose interest is piqued by cryptography.Singh is singularly aided by his subject matter here. This book was recommended to me by a fellow poster on a crossword puzzle blog which I frequent, as a daily solver of the New York Times crossword. The discussions on the blog vary from the whimsical to the technical with all manner of things mooted. So goes Singh's book as well. But what makes this possible is that cryptography and cryptanalysis, for most of human history, has been no more complex, au fond, than a very difficult crossword puzzle. And one is not surprised to see a crossword used during WWII by the British to test potential candidates for work at top secret Bletchley Park, which was responsible for cracking Germany's \\"Enigma\\" code. The crossword is provided in the book and was jolly fun to solve.It seems to me that up to the Vigen&egrave;re polyalphabetic coding, known for centuries as \\"le chiffre ind&eacute;chifferable\\", anyone with an interest in this book could understand and create such a cipher and write an encrypted message in it. Indeed, it's in deciphering such messages without the \\"keyword\\" that the technical going gets somewhat involved and perhaps beyond the ken of some readers not familiar with basic statistical analysis, and, not coincidentally, this decipherment of such encryptions is where maths starts to predominate. But it's certainly not difficult to understand the concept of how these encryptions are deciphered, it's merely very tedious and painstaking to do it as Charles Babbage finally did in the 19th Century.Up to this point, for this reader in any event, no trade-off was necessary and Singh is free to fill his tale of codes and ciphers with histories which hinge upon them, starting with the life and death of Mary, Queen of Scots. Also, he makes an elegant segue in the tale of how the Linear B tablets were finally translated, and the toing and froing of certain egotistical archaeologists etc. - It should be noted here the final decipherment and translation of Linear B was the cumulative work of men (and one woman) of genius who were linguistic prodigies. - Again, pass the 19th century and the non-specialist becomes more than a tad lost in the, literally and figuratively, nuts and bolts of Enigma machines and multi-lingual scholarship and fluency.Thus, it's no surprise that the ending of the book was the weakest part for me. Though it must be said that Singh goes out of his way to use \\"Alice, Bob, Eve\\" analogies to make the concepts clearer most effectively, being able to do what the main players in the tale are doing is far beyond the amateur's grasp. Also, the book is thirteen years old and the final sections dealing with computer encryption seem a bit dated already.In sum though, a very pleasing, well-written book about the perennial human need to keep matters secret."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"bought this a long time ago.Figured I would add my 2 cents.This book is awesome.

Highlights of the book are discussions of the Enigma machine and its decipherement during World War II by Marian Rejewski and Alan Turing, the decipherement of the ancient greek alphabet called Lineal B (not strictly a secret code, but a fascinating story nonetheless) and the more modern developements of public key and quantum cryptography (the latter one, still in development, promises the long sought dream of an unbreakable code). The book does not presuppose previous mathematical knowledge, though the later chapters do require some intense concentration on the part on the reader."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This book is an excellent one that intertwines the history, strategy, and mathematics of those dedicated to encrypting messages and those dedicated to exposing the encryption strategy and thus the message. It explains the idea behind several kinds of encryption strategies starting with Mary Queen of Scots and how her personal involvement in the plot against Queen Elizabeth I of England was exposed when her correspondence that was encrypted with simple monoalphabetic substitution was decyphered.This method was replaced with the polyalphabetic Vigen&egrave;re square, which protected military and government dispatches for 250 years, until the Victorian polymath Charles Babbage, who believed that the cipher was flawed in some small way, set about the task of finding that flaw, and eventually did so.Chapter 3 discusses how the invention of radio at the beginning of the 20th century enabled cryptanalysts to easily gather large amounts of intelligence, since anyone with an antenna could easily intercept enemy communications, thus driving the need for stronger encryption methods. This resulted in the \\"mechanisation of secrecy,\\" the creation of machines to scramble messages beyond the manual abilities of human beings. This contributed to the public-key cryptography widely used today by businesses and governments.The next chapter is about the Enigma machine, used by the Germans leading up to and during the Second World War, which performed a complex polyalphabetic substitution cipher. The book discusses how Alan Turing, a brilliant mathematician who devoted himself to the war effort, helped to crack the Enigma code machines used by the Germans. Turing and his colleagues' breakthroughs prevented U-boat attacks and ultimately shortened World War II, but because of the British intelligence community's policy of maintaining secrecy for its operations, his important work in this field was never recognized.\\"Language Barrier\\" discusses how the American military used Navajo Indians as code talkers because of the unique characteristics of their language. It also discusses the Rosetta Stone and how it was used to decode a lost language by using two other known languages.\\"Alice and Bob Go Public\\" discusses the solution to the so-called key-distribution problem. It talks about how James Ellis, employed by the UK Government Communications Headquarters, worked out how to achieve effective public key cryptography several decades before American academics published their solutions, and what those solutions were.In \\"Pretty Good Privacy\\" Singh talks about what sort of line that law enforcement agencies should take pertaining to civil liberties. This leads up to the story of Pretty Good Privacy and Phil Zimmermann's battle with the government.The final chapter is about quantum cryptography. The advantage this method has over traditional methods is that the exchange of information can be shown to be secure in a very strong sense, without making assumptions about the intractability of certain mathematical problems. Even when you assume the presence of hypothetical eavesdroppers with unlimited computing power, the laws of physics guarantee (probabilistically) that the secret key exchange will be secure, given a few other assumptions. I found Singh's explanation of this topic a bit more difficult to grasp than those in previous chapters.I highly recommend this book as a starting point for anyone interested in the subject of cryptography. Even if you are not interested in going any further with this subject, it is an accessible and interesting read."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Simon Singh provides a more than clear examination into the history and fundamentals of cryptography. The information is presented in such a way that people of all interests can enjoy the subject. Singh not only covers the beginnings of cryptography in certain regions but also helps to place them in their historical context. He clearly examines the effects of cryptography on multiple aspects of life then and even now. The book not only describes the origins of cryptography but also the mathematical, mechanical, and analytical aspects of such a diverse topic.

While it does have a marvelous treatment of modern 20th century cryptography- including the best description of the German Enigma machine and WWII Bletchly Park decoding activities I've yet read- what really makes this book shine is all the marvelous historical material.Most books on codes and ciphers begin with something like ancient Roman transpotion ciphers. Singh takes a different track. For him, what's most interesting is not the encoding- which is often a trivial process- but the attempts to break encrypted texts. To this end, Singh tells the story of the decypherment of Linear B, an ancient script that was for decades in the 19th century perhaps the greatest puzzle confronting scholars. The tale of the decipherment of Linear B is not only a gripping and fascinating tale in and of itself, but also the perfect story to introduce the reader to the methodology of codebreaking.From Linear B to quantum encryptation, Singh explains it clearly and fully; he's both skilled mathematician and gifted teacher.

It is for every person who has been curious or concerned about individual privacy and the security of transactions on the internet.Simon Singh tells the story of cryptography and how it influenced the outcome of history, with vivid examples. Had Mary Queen of Scots been aware that her \\"secret coded\\" letters had been actually deciphered and read by her jailers, she might have been spared the guillotine. From deciphering the Egyptian hieroglyphics with the aid of the Rosetta Stone, through cracking the German Enigma and the story of the Navajo Code Talkers and up to the use of sophisticated \\"unbreakable\\" encoding used in modern communications and over the internet, this is one fascinating story.Dr. Singh doesn't stop at telling interesting historical anecdotes. He actually explains and demonstrates what cryptography is with real examples of codes and ciphers and challenges the reader more than once to find the keys to such codes.Finally, Simon Singh leaps into the future when Quantum Computers will be able to break any existing code known today and concludes that:\\"A quantum computer would jeopardize the stability of the world. Whichever country gets there first will have the ability to monitor the communication of its citizens, read the minds of its commercial rivals and eavesdrop on the plans of its enemies.

For a beginner in cryptography, some of the technical stretches are a bit tough, but well worth the effort. I learned a lot from this book.The first 100 pages cover the history of (western) cryptography from ancient Greek steganography through the end of the 19th century with Marconi &amp; the invention of the Wireless. In between, he speeds through Arab cryptanalysis (a real revelation to me), the Vigenere Cipher, the Great Cipher of Louis XIV (invented by the Rossignols and broken by Bazeries), Samuel Morse &amp; the Telegraph (better communication needed ciphers), Charles Babbage, and the Beale Papers. The author gives equal respect and technical coverage to both the cipher 'creators' as well as the cipher 'breakers'.The next 200 pages cover 20th century topics, events and famous characters in cryptography. The Enigma Machine/Code -- designed by the Germans, then cracked by Poland (Marian Rejewski) on the eve of the German invasion; refortified by the Germans, then cracked again at Bletchley Park during WWII by a wondrous team, including Alan Turing. The Zimmerman Telegram and the Navaho Code Talkers each receive very nice treatment. Even the history of the decipherment of Egyptian Hieroglyphics and Linear B (both, as it turns out, 'phonetic' codes) receive technical treatment.Singh rounds out the historical discussion with the discoveries (or re-discoveries) of 'key exchange' by Diffie-Hellman-Markle, and complex cryptographic systems like DES and RSA encryption architecture. Phil Zimmerman and PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) rate more than a dozen pages, bringing the book right into the Internet age.The author concludes with a discussion of the Future of Cryptanalysis and Quantum Computing (including a brief tutorial on Quantum Physics for Dummies).The book has swell appendices, a glossary, a comprehensive bibliography and an index.

Congratulations!"},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"The Author uses key events in history to explain how the codemakers were engaged in a battle of wits with the codebreakers (cryptanalysts) of the opposite camp, and why at different times either side prevailed, thus influencing the course of history.While codemakers started with upper hand from the era of Romans to Arabs, the codebreakers start to strike back by deciphering cipher codes like the substitution and vignere ciphers using techniques like frequency analysis. We then see how codebreakers played their role in victory during protestant-catholic power struggle in England , and other occasions including Crimean war, World War I . It was with the mechanised encrypting machine Enigma that the Codemakers made a comeback, presenting a severe challenge to the cryptanalysts during World War II. Though Navajo language based codes were successfully employed by the US during WW II, this period marked the time when cryptanalysis slowly moved away from the domain of linguists to the mathematicians. Enigma was eventually cracked by the expert mathematicians from Poland and England. Turing who cracked the modified Enigma so crucial to allied victory, was a key figure in early development of computers (a Turing award is equivalent to a nobel prize in computers).With Enigma cracked, the codebreakers had once again the upperhand. Key distribution was a weak link often open to theft and spying, which always left it vulnerable. Diffie-hellman-Merkle came up with the solution of public key cryptography, where the common key was calculated locally without being distributed on any medium. It would take enormous resources of distributed computing to break the key, which requires either government organisations like NSA or large collobaration in Internet.Finally the ethical dilemma of privacy vs security is discussed. Should Governments allow private citizens to have the capability to generate unbreakable codes, or should it retain its capability to break into any codes.The promise of Quantum crytography to provide unbreakable code guaranteed by physical law, will be a headache for future government policy makers."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"I'm sure there are countless technical books that deal with cryptography in a lot more detail.

It includes examples and stories of the earliest, most primitive cryptography, to a discussion on what the future holds (e.g., the effect of quantam computers on code-making and -breaking).Most importantly, however, Singh has made this book very easy to read. Singh is a very effective teacher, breaking down the complicated aspects of cryptography into step by step processes, requiring a very limited background in mathematics to be understandable.Anyone curious about cryptography or espionage, or any other subject of that sort should make this book their starting point, from which they will develop a very good background for cryptography and cryptanalysis."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This is an incredible book that speaks on all major subjects concerting cryptography.

Illustrated mathematical ideas with nice analogies and went for intution rather than mathematical rigor. You can find the exciting turns of history of code making and breaking."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This book is not just for geeks! It's very readable, no difficult math, plenty of figures supporting the text, many witty asides. Not the least bit dull. It traces the development of message concealment - and discovery - from early times to the near-present, and credits those who played notable parts in this history. Of special interest to me was the account of the WWII codebreakers at Britain's Bletchley Park, their methods, nachinery(!) and accomplishments. The sheer wartime volume of intercepted encrypted messages meant that great numbers of men (and women) had to be recruited to Bletchley, and they had to be promising producers; you'll be amused at how they were chosen.I especially liked the long chapter on the decyphering of the Rosetta Stone and the \\"Linear B\\" texts, and the light that such cast on our knowledge of ancient civilizations, their societies and languages."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"I bought this book because I'm interested in cryptology but do not have the time to dig deep into specialist books. The book did not dissapoint me - it is well written, not too technical but doesn't 'dumb down' the essence of cryptology too much. The only reason why I wouldn't want to give it 5 stars is that it is a bit dated. Written quite obviously before 9/11, it is a bit too optimistic on the outcome of the battle between code makers and code breakers.A good book, fun to read, and relatively easy to grasp."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"\\"The Code Book\\" presents readers with a beautifully composed account of the history of cryptography. It is written in such a way to keep the technically inclined satisfied without overloading the average reader.

It's an excellent read."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"More than a history of cryptography, this book could be called a set ofstories about the topic. Which is not a demerit, on the contrary, addsamenity to a topic that on one hand is interesting and entertaining (whodoesn't like to keep one's secrets and break those of others?) but onthe other hand may be hard (the mathematics and algorithms). The authorcopes very well with the fun part and really quite well with the otherpart, taking into account that this is not a text book but a informationaland even recreational book.A reader not familiar with algorithms or computing may still be able tograsp most of the ideas and every reader will surely enjoy of the welldocumented stories on which the book is built. The language is clearand simple (I am not an English native speaker and nevertheless I canread it quite easily) so I think that even children of about 12 y.o.and up may find the book interesting."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"In the Code Book, Simon Singh takes us on a fascinating journey through cryptography from ancient Egypt to to the modern. He touches on many historical figures and their contributions to modern day cryptography. Personalities such as: Charles Babbage (the grandfather of computing), Alan Turing (creator of the Turing Machine, the father of modern computer science), Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leon Adleman (the men behind RSA encryption), and Phil Zimmermann.This book was enlightening as it put the cryptography mechanisms we employ today into a historical context while describing their complex inner workings and presenting the rich history that lies behind all innovation.

I was turned on to Singh's The Code Book simply because it mentioned quantum physics in the title, a happy intersection between my two new hobby subjects. Soon after cracking it open, I realized that I'd picked up one of my favorite books in the past few years.Singh does a great job of laying out the history of cryptography (code writing) and cryptanalysis (code breaking, essentially) as well as explaining the logic behind each of the codes he discusses. It's a fascinating history that builds and builds upon itself, making it clear to the reader how the cryptography readily available to him/her now was born. All the while, Singh's explanation of the thought behind the codes is clear enough for a non-math major to quickly grasp (i.e. myself).I admit that the subject matter was right up my alley and this might not be the case for everyone, but I feel Singh's ability to weave a narrative into a convoluted subject (as it would be) is excellent and warrants a pick up. The history is sturdy enough to support just about any reader and the analysis of the logic is clear and simple to latch on to, even as it delves into some deeper details.In all, this was a great read and I'd highly recommend picking it up."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This book does a really nice job tracing the history of cryptography and cryptanalyis (codemaking and codebreaking) through the ages.

You get to know many interesting personalities from the crypto world and it's full of curiosities and stories about how cryptography changed the course of history and how it evolved over the centuries till today. If you are looking for a technical book on cryptographic algorithms, this is not that kind of book. It's meant to be read by everyone, therefore the technical part is kept easy and doesn't do any in-depth coverage.Good luck and enjoy it,Leandro"},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Mr. Singh has written a masterpiece of science non-fiction. His writing is terrific - clear, non-technical, entertaining. No doubt some of the ideas he discusses in the book are weighty, like the workings of the Enigma machine and asymetric encryption. But Mr. Singh explains them in a way that anyone can understand and enjoy. He uses nice analogies where appropriate, but doesn't dumb down the science or the math.

The end of the book may get too technical for the non-technical reader, but even they will be more than pleased with the first 3/4 of the book.

Placing its evolution in a historical context, the author describes the need for encryption and how more and more secure systems became necessary as each one was cracked. He takes us to the present day with our need to protect financial and other sensitive information on Internet. Considering the technical nature of his topic, Singh makes cryptography interesting and challenging. I usually read several books at a time, but this one held me to the exclusion of others until I finished it. Extremely lucid and fascinating."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"The Code Book provides a comprehensive view of cryptographic technology. If you are looking to becoming a master of cryptography, this book along with Bruce Schneier's \\"Applied Cryptography\\" is a must. While the Code Book is not a technical and mechanical tome like Applied Cryptography, it does give some of the basis in understanding how cryptographic functions from ancient to modern work. More importantly, by giving historical accounts of the art of message encoding, Singh manages to present the world of cryptography as the tool of politics and war that makes the U.S. government classify many cryptographic algorithms as weapons. He also has some wonderful examples of the impact of cryptography on archeology and science.This book, while a little dated, will bring most people up to speed on code breaking. The Code Book also contains a Cipher challenge which consisted of 10 encrypted messages placed at the end of the book. This challenge was completed on October 7th 2000. Those who wish to find out how the team cracked the codes can go to http://www.simonsingh.com/Cipher_Challenge.html"},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"I will be the first to admit that I only have a passing interest in the field of cryptography. In addition, I am not an expert in any of the related disciplines: mathematics, computer science, linguistics, etc. However, as a libertarian concerned with the issues of personal liberty and privacy, my curiosity in the subject matter surfaced when I saw this book at the store.With this book, Simon Singh has weaved a captivating account on the importance of and the development of cryptography over time. He portrays the evolution of the science as a see-saw battle between the code makers and the code breakers. He drives the point home by introducing key events in history (e.g. execution of Mary Queen of Scots, WWI, WWII) that were severely affected by the security, or lack thereof, of private communications. He ties these historical events together with explanations and anecdotes on the development of the particular encryption methodologies employed and the weaknesses/obstacles that led to their downfall. Of special interest, he highlights in his writings the contributions of key figures in the development of crytography that would otherwise be historical footnotes due to the secrecy of their work (e.g. GCHQ's development of modern public key cryptography).In the final section of the book, Singh spends some time speculating on the future direction of cryptography. If history is any indicator, it is only a matter of time before what is considered &quot;unbreakable&quot; will also be decoded. Perhaps, it already has...For further reading, Singh has included a comprehensive reading list that covers both the history and science in greater detail."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This book was far better than I imagined it would be.Singh (the author) discusses the use/importance of code and cipher throught the ages by using historical events to illustrate the importance of secure communication. In several of his examples, security breaches affected the course of history (e.g. outcome of WWII; fate of Mary, Queen of Scots).I'm not what you would call a &quot;math person.&quot; Regardless, I was still able to enjoy this book. Singh is wonderful at explaining complex processes in steps and illustrations we all can understand. For example, instead of launching into a discussion about the algorithms associated with authentication and encryption schemes, Singh first tells you to picture a metal box affixed with several locks. I found each of his examples are relevant, clever, and helpful.For those in the security trade, this is an invaluable book, as it explains the &quot;why&quot; behind the &quot;how&quot; with regard to information security. (Ever wonder what RSA stands for? Thought about how our national standards for bit encryption came about? This book will explain.)Highly recommended to security-saavy persons, puzzle lovers, or anyone interested in history. Excellent!"},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"We now live in the Age of Information. The protection of information transmission from interception and use by unintended recipients might be the most important issue during our lifetimes.This book tells us where we were, where we are, and where we are going with the protection of information. The history of encryption of information has been the history of code makers and code breakers fighting to get the upper hand. We explore the Caesar shift and the Vigen&egrave;re square to RSA encryption and quantum cryptography.Monoalphabetic substitution ciphers are rather easily deciphered using frequency analysis of the most often used letters of the plaintext language. Polyalphabetic ciphers such as the Vigen&egrave;re square require longer text to break, but eventually the keyword is discernable and the rest of the message is decipherable. Although the onetime pad cipher is absolutely secure, it suffers from a practical and logistical problem of random key generation and key distribution.The German Enigma machine of WWII provides an example of mechanized machine encryption. This inspired the Allies to construct the first programmable computer in 1943, named Colossus. It is interesting to note that the very machine that would be the first computer of the Information Age was itself created to decrypt information.Presently, our data transactions can be protected with a system of asymmetric cryptography, known as RSA, also known as a form of public key cryptography. With a sufficiently large number derived from the factor of two prime numbers, RSA is presently impregnable.Thanks to Phil Zimmermann, in 1991 his program incorporating RSA and called Pretty Good Privacy, or PGP, was posted on the internet as freeware. We can now encrypt messages and send digital signatures using certification authorities with a high degree of security.The greatest threat to our privacy seems to be from our own government restricting or weakening the use of encryption. This is where policy questions and politics becomes an issue. Do we side with privacy of individuals? Or do we side with law enforcement?According to the author, whatever the decision today, it can be changed tomorrow to accommodate changing circumstances. Personally, I prefer not to give up any privacy rights at any time. Restoring rights to citizens once those rights are surrendered is probably as difficult a task as repealing the income tax laws. If I am not mistaken, the U.S. federal income tax was proposed as a temporary measure for generating government revenue in 1918.The holy grail of cryptography is quantum cryptography. Although quantum computers and quantum cryptography are only theoretical ideas, if quantum cryptography becomes a reality, then a truly unbreakable system of encryption would exist."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Mr. Singh's outstanding book is the one that started it all for me in cryptology. I had read a review of the book in Forbes, I believe, and saw the book in a bookstore, so I decided to get it. I was hooked! I didn't understand the all the math, and I kind of skimmed thru some of the cryptanalysis, but since then, I have purchased virtually every obtainable book in his bibliography, and I am a long way toward understanding more of the math. This book is a much easier read than Kahn's &quot;The Codebreakers&quot;, but if you're like me, you'll want to read that one too! And then, you'll search out other crypto resources like the American Cryptogram Association, with it's excellent Classic Crypto Book Service (yep, I bought quite a few of those too!). OK, maybe not everyone will fall for such a nerdy hobby, but Singh's book is still a great read, and who knows. . .you may get hooked as well! PS. . .make sure you check Mr. Singh's web page if you intend to try and solve the challenges in the back, as he points out some typos that could save you lots of frustration."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Singh's book is great. It is easy to read (I finished it in just two sittings). Singh has a wonderful writing style which makes the book hard to put down. He has a good coverage of material, but leaves out some of the more interesting applications of cryptography such as zero-knowledge proofs, digital cash, certification authorities, etc (for a more complete coverage of these topics read Bruce Schneier's book &quot;Applied Cryptography&quot;). He also has no mention of AES and puts too much faith in PGP (after stating that no encryption scheme is entirely safe). I'm being a bit picky, the book is excellent and well worth the read."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This book is a solid and well-written look at the history of cryptography. While laced with liberal doses of code-breaking processes and theories, Singh takes care to make sure that even readers unfamiliar with crypto can keep up with his narrative.

Highly recommended for any with an interest in cryptography, no matter what level their understanding of the theories is currently at."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This book is a good primer for anyone interested in an introduction to the history, personalities and methods in cryptography. I'm not very adept at math but that didn't hamper me in reading this book. Simon Singh, as he did with his book on Fermat, takes us 'innumerates' into mind when writing his books and gives clear and concise explanations that don't get lost in jargon or presume his readers are math heads.A fun and informative book on an important and facinating subject!"},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"As a novice in the code world, I was fascinated by the history and the details Singh provided in the book. As mentioned earlier, I too noticed the mistakes in the text, however, were they really mistakes? Did Singh somehow imbed a code within the book itself? I am naively trying to break the codes in the back of the book, and I looked to the website mentioned and found nothing. I don't want to continue with the work if it has already been done. Does anyone have any idea about it? When will the website be up and running? Read the book, it was great."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Yes. Singh again accomplishes his self-set task of opening and making intelligible a world most find at best ponderous and at worst impenetrable. His brief history of encryption methods and means of penetration of the same is both easily read and satisfying for those at almost any level. (If you think you're too knowledgeable about the subject, check out the cipher decryption contest in the back of the book. If you still think the book too elementary, you probably work for the NSA.) My only complaint is that the book is not as complete as some (including myself) would like. But it satisfies the desire to learn about an arcane and interesting subject, and yet it served to keep me up late reading rather than getting me to nod off in the middle."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"I'm on a non-fiction kick at the moment, and I'm loving reading books that tell you about anything science-y. Of the stack of 5 or 6 I've recently read, this one was the best. Firstly, Singh is an excellent writer - the writing just draws you in. Secondly, you learn how easy it is to crack the sorts of codes people write to each other as kids. And thirdly, I loved learning how Elizabeth 1st's spymaster outwitted Mary Queen of Scots by using decryption. Other books in my stack (which weren't quite as good) included The Perfect Storm, and The Making of the Atomic Bomb. Now, both of these were great. But that just shows how good I think The Code Book is."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This was a great book. It may be slightly less entertaining if you are an expert in the subject matter -- it's definitely written for the lay person. However, having an interest in science, history, and math (but a degree in lit not a background in cryptography) I found this a page turner. I particularly like Singh's side trips into ancient languages and quantum physics. Even a relatively minor explanation of light theory was enough to make me call a friend and read pages over the phone. The appendices were good! And an excellent suggested reading list is included. If you're interested in cryptography and don't know what to read, this is the book you want. It's a very good overview, clearly written. If you read Cryptonomicon and liked it this is the background information to much of that story."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Mr. Singh has done a well-concerted effort in presenting a very lucid explanation of the science of cryptography. He gives you a clear historical perspective alongwith an insight into some of the great minds behind cryptanalysis and codemaking. A most enthralling account of the decoding of Enigma cipher is given plus many important landmarks in the history of cryptography like discovery of frequency analysis by Al-Kindi and the conceptual development of public key cryptosystem by the team of Diffie-Merkle-Hellman are given their due share. Despite being a non-fiction work it reads a thrilling detective novel."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"When I was a boy, I was obsessed with secret writing (as, I imagine, almost every child with at least one nosy sibling becomes) and read everything the local library's Juvenile section had on the topic. I was disappointed to discover, when I went looking for more material, that there was apparently more cryptography material for kids than for grown-ups! This book not only took me back to those days with its discussion of secret writing throughout history (scytales, Playfair, Vignere...), it's also got an excellent section on cryptography in the World Wars (an excellent companion to Neal Stephenson's novel &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot; in that regard!) and also explains the fundamental concepts of public-key cryptography in a readable, understandable format. As in Singh's earlier work on Fermat's Last Theorem, the people involved in creating and in breaking codes are often the focus, and some of these peope are fascinating. (Singh takes a break from strict cryptography at one point to discuss the &quot;breaking&quot; of ancient writing systems such as Egyptian hieroglyphics and Linear B, and this reminded me most strongly of &quot;Fermat's Enigma,&quot; as Singh's narrative carried the mysteries of interpretation from one researcher to the next.) The final chapter on quantum cryptography is a fascinating glimpse into what may be the &quot;final frontier&quot; of cryptography. Of course, any book like this one that discusses a still-evolving field gets dated pretty quickly; it is silly to expect Singh to mention the recent expiration of RSA's public-key patents or the relaxation of US export restrictions on strong cryptography, since these have all occurred within just the last few months, but the book nevertheless feels somehow incomplete without them!"},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"I found The Code Book an extremely interesting and informative read. I think Singh did a phenomenal job at bringing together the numerous length of history and presenting it to the common reader in a easy, readable fashion. I am impressed once again at Singhs' ability to create such a organized and clear work like he accomplished in Fermats' Enigma. I knew nothing of cryptography before reading The Code Book, but now I know not only the history, but many techniques of encoding and decrypting as well. The figures behind the process were equally fascinating and I found out about many people that I previously knew nothing about. I found the explanations behind Mary Queen of Scots, the Enigma, the Navajo code, Bletchly Park, RSA, and quantum cryptography to be both intriguing and educational. I would highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"I want to echo the idea that this is an excellent book for the layperson.

It exceeded my expectations in how interesting the author describes the events and algorithms."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This book is basically an examination of how codes (vis-a-vis secrecy) developed from the ancient world through to today's modern encryption systems.I initially began reading this book to help my neighbor's daughter with a school project, but by the first chapter it was clear that I would be reading this for myself.For anyone with a layman's interest in historical spy rings, medieval kingdom communication, or modern encryption systems (i.e. fans of Dan Brown's \\"Digital Fortress\\"), this book will explain the contextual reasons this kind of secrecy was developed as well as how codes technically work.Admittedly, I have a professional predilection for having an interest in the history of encryption, but this book can be enjoyed by a wide readership if the curiosity exists for the topic. The author has a very accessible writing style which I found to be key to unlocking (pun acknowledged) this technically difficult subject matter.One of my favorite examples the author uses to describe the idea of \\"security through obscurity\\" is of the Dark Ages-era messenger whose head is shaved and tattooed with a secret message. Then the messenger's hair is allowed to grow back and then he is set on his way to his destination. The idea is that the recipient of the messenger will have his head re-shaved to reveal the tattoo message, while being able to pass through checkpoints and endure physical searches successfully.A secondary insight of that anecdote is the timeline - i.e. how slow communication and decision making moved in that era in stark contrast with today's instantaneous messaging systems.For those wanting to know what \\"encryption\\" really is, now that it has entered the public vernacular, this is the book which will explain it at both the high and low levels. Be prepared for some puzzle and math concepts/exercises, but it is not intimidating or exclusionary."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"I tremendously enjoyed reading this book, which explores perhaps the most fascinating aspect of cryptology: its role in society. From Queen Mary who was executed because her cypher was vulnerable to previously unheard-of frequency analysis, continuing with the war-altering influence of Enigma code breakers, to the advent of public-key cryptology in use today, the author paints a rich picture of historical events, personalities, and government interests.Mr. Singh's account of the people behind the cypher breakthroughs was the most valuable to me. For example, while I had heard of the formidable Alan Turing, my CS education neglected to include the sad bit that he had committed suicide, on account of his being homosexual- a sin at the time. There are more gems of information like this to be found, making this book interesting to a wide array of people, from historians to conspirationalists.. For the latter group, the author for example offers the juicy bit that the British Empire actively spread the use of Enigmas, particularly after they had broken the code, lulling countries and colonies into a false sense of security.I also liked the nod towards archeologists, a welcome relief from the otherwise politically and militarily motivated encryption landscape. I learned more about Knossos in Crete from this book than when I went there in person!Here's the best part: the text is easily understandable. Even for someone very rusty in his/her high school math, it is accessible as the author assumes practically nothing and even defines concepts such as prime numbers and modulus arithmetic. The precise example of an RSA code exchange is relegated to the appendix, meanwhile the author found an analogy involving buckets of paint. Brilliant.If I have to find one flaw with Singh's work, it is the age of the publication. 11 years spell \\"ancient\\" in the computer world and it's nothing short of bizarre to read that \\"the Internet is in its infancy\\" when I can access my bank accounts on a remote island - on my cell phone. An update of the last two chapters would do this otherwise priceless book good."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"I bought this book several years ago and enjoyed every aspect of it.

This is one of the best books on a scientific subject in recentyears- along with Green's Elegant Universe- Singh does an excellent job describing the various ciphers used over the last 200 years ( from the roman empire to modern methods). What makes this book different than other books on the subject is that Singh introduces each encryption 9and decryption) method in a historeical context and gives the reader a glimpse into the motoves of the cryptographer.Great reading. The weakest section is that on decicipherng hieroglyphics. It is well written but fails to adequately explain the magbitude of the task and the intellectual achievement involved.The book also includes a competition for readers interested in testing their skills at deciphering codes. There are 7 ciphes in the appendices with a substantial prize to the first person that solves them ( unsolved as of 12/2000)."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Simon Singh books usually hold you from the first page and till the end. \\"The code book\\" is very well written and very informative.

Using his skill as an author he weaves history, technology, and methods of encryption together to explain topics that normally would leave many of us in the blind.The most interesting thing about the whole book is that as you begin to read up on forms of encryption and decryption you begin to absorb yourself into the whole culture. One chapter describes the Beale Ciphers, a set of ciphers that gained popularity especially in the early 1900s and still are significant today linking to a fabulous treasure and yet still remaining unbroken. I remember spending the day after reading up on it thinking of ways I'd try to break the cipher.

Dr. Singh traces cryptography from Ceaser's time (the Ceaser Cipher) to what lies in the future of this science: Quantum Cryptography. The material is presented in an engaging manner, and mathematical terms, when used, are first explained for the layman. To me, this was a very interesting read. For instance, I knew that the folks at Bletchley Park -- Turing, et al. -- were instrumental in cracking the Enigma, Germany's substitution and transposition cipher machine. However, I was not aware that they built upon the work of the Polish Biuro Szyfrow, especially one Martin Rejewski in particular (unexplicably, when Churchill formed Bletchley Park, Rejewski was absent from it.) Those practicing in the field of cryptography and security, will be absolutely fascinated with the chapters involving the breakthrough on public key cryptography by Diffie, Hellman, and Merkle. Their discovery had to wait until Rivest, Shamir and Adleman could come up with the RSA algorithm for factoring large primes to make public key cryptography feasible. Phil Zimmermann's aggregation of public key cryptography and RSA into PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is also detailed, as is his struggle against the FBI, NSA, and the RSA corporation. Other rich details in the book include the use of the an American Indian dialect of Navajo to perform ciphering that proved to be unbreakable during WW II (this particular use of Navajo was also made into a movie starring Nicholas Cage -- Windtalkers.) I would recommend this book for anyone that has an interest in cryptography; it is eminently readable."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This book is superb! I'm telling everyone to buy every single book of Simon Singh. He has great talent in explaining things!!You could also check out it's CD for free!(Only works on 32 bit OS)[...]"},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"A very interesting read when it comes to reading about different aspects of cryptography. But several conspiracy theories have been accepted as historical truths. If you believe the book, even the RSA algorithms and asymmetric keys was actually invented by the British but that they had to destroy all evidence to give themselves an unfair advantage. This, apart from what is claimed that every German code was broken by the British during the war. Infact it is claimed that throughout the war, the British were only trying very hard to keep up pretences of fighting a tough war. They would send in a reconnaisance plane before blowing up a U-boat whose location they, ofcourse, already knew.I was wondering at one point, whether I would turn a page to find that it describes how the IPhone was actually invented just after the Second World War by the scientists working for the British cryptographic division (the men of Betchley park as described in this book), but that they had to destroy all evidence in order to keep things hush-hush.However, I still completed the book because the author is a good story teller, like the uncle you have who tells you interesting bawdy stories in a bar when both of you are drunk, and you listen to him even though you do not believe the truth of those stories. I have a strong suspicion that this is how the author got his tales. There is a certain amount of romanticism involved in stories of secret writing and ciphers. Usually, cipher solving is cryptic and difficult to understand. Simon Singh has a done a fantastic job making the codes often used in history understandable for layman, even those not mathematically inclined. Therefore, it is possible for every one to enjoy the art of secret writing by reading this book.I am not particularly sure of the historical accuracy of certain claims made in the book.. For example, for certain historical events like the trial of Mary, Queen of Scots, she was alleged to have corresponded in secret with a conspirator who wanted to kill the protestant Queen Elizabeth and restore to the throne the catholic Queen Mary. But that allegation made by Walsingham, the spy master of Queen Elizabeth, was rejected by Mary. The letters used for the trial which were apparently written in code cracked by Walsingham's cipher expert could have been forgeries made by Walsingham's man under his orders. My reason for suspecting this is because frankly the letter allegation does not hold water. The letters were apparently written in code by the conspirator and Queen Mary apparently could break that code and reply in the same cipher. Since Queen Mary was not a cipher expert herself, how could she or her maids crack the coded letters from an English conspirator outside her castle prison without ever having met the conspirator and therefore never having had agreed on the cipher system being used. Also apparently that cipher was not a well known cipher at that time. And the possibility that the cipher key was passed along with the letter smuggled inside a wine barrel (as what was alleged) does not make sense because who would pass a coded letter and also the cipher key through the same channel of communication. Therefore, I believe that the letter story was a sham. It is just one more cleverly resourceful way of falsely accusing someone that we have often seen in history. Ofcourse, Simon Singh, the author of this book does not investigate whether the story of Queen Mary having used secretly coded letters to communicate with conspirators as claimed by Queen Elizabeth's spy master is actually historically accurate. The story was too \\"juicy\\" for him not to have included it in his book, even if the story might be actually historically inaccurate and the letters were forgeries used by Walsingham and Queen Elizabeth to murder her cousin, Queen Mary, who was a political threat to her. My condolences to Queen Mary of Scots though I am several hundred years too late. She would have made a good queen of free Scotland if she could have reigned longer.Another point, which I am not sure of in terms of historical accuracy is the Betchley Park story. All the documents and machines, allegedly made there during World War II, which apparently broke every German code used in German communications (including Hitler's comms to his generals), are said to have been destroyed. If there is absolutely no evidence left, except the claims of a few guys after about thirty years, then how can these claims be trusted? If all German code was broken during the war, why did the British have such a tough time fighting? Ofcourse, the author, Simon Singh, does not care. He gets another to story to write about.Despite the historical lack of credibility of the book, I enjoyed reading it as it helped me understand several codes used and raised my level of interest in the subject. The book highlights how important persistence is in all human endeavors.Desclaimer: I have read this book by borrowing from a library. I did not actually buy the book from Amazon. But I did want to leave my review because I felt I had some important things to say about it. Thanks for reading till so far down that you came to this line."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"For many years those of us who were cryptophiles had little resources to consult except oblique references in histories or very dense and technical mathematical descriptions. I am glad this book is now on Kindle. I loved the paper version of it. Singh has the gift of explaining what seems at first glance confusing in a way that makes it accessible and fun. Through his narrative we come to understand the absolutely vital role that ciphers and codes played in history as we learn how these systems were constructed and then deconstructed only for the process to begin again. By all means, get a piece of paper and enjoy playing along. It's a timely topic since we now live in an age awash with information and are learning the hard way what can ensue if we don't find ways to protect it. If nothing else learning the Playfair cipher is one way to defeat the snoops in your corporate email system.

Well described coding techniques for amateur cypher nuts."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"For anyone interested in the history of codes and ciphers -- from ancient times right up to the efforts to develop quantum computing in the 21st century -- this is the ideal book.It starts with an account of the efforts to decipher the coded messages between Mary Queen of Scots and the plotters conspiring to release her from imprisonment and restore her to power. This was necessary for Walsingham, Queen Elizabeth's spymaster, because he couldn't have Mary executed without the approval of the Queen, Mary's cousin, which would not be forthcoming without uncontestable evidence that Mary was aware of the conspiracy. All of the classic ingredients were there -- treachery, spying, opening sealed letters and resealing them, and, of course, deciphering.The book then moves far back in time, describing the methods used by the Greeks in their wars with the Persians, and later by the Romans. These methods seem primitive to our eyes -- with hindsight -- but they were effective enough in their times, and it was only later that Arab cryptanalysts realized the power of frequency analysis. Since then there has been a continuous battle between the cryptographers to develop unbreakable ciphers and the cryptanalysts to break them. It is a story with many heroes, some of them now known,like Georges Painvin in the First World War, Marian Rejevski in the years leading up to the Second, and Alan Turing during it, others whose names will probably never be known: the whole field is characterized by secrecy -- governments and armies don't want you to know what techniques are available to them.The book is mainly about the history of ciphers and the people who made the history, with less emphasis on the ciphers themselves, and the techniques needed to break them. One could perhaps wish for more examples and more detail about the methods used, but that would be a different book, and readers interested in these aspects will need to turn to Helen Fouch&eacute; Gaines'sCryptanalysis: A Study of Ciphers and Their Solution."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Mr Simon tells the history of cryptography in a away every one will understand and maybe love!I started read this book by recommendation of a friend who is &#34;crypto nerd&#34;.

When I finally got my hands on it, it certainly did not disappoint.Intelligence (in the military sense and otherwise) or the lack of it has determined the course of wars and the fate of many lives for centuries. Espionage has been the glamorous arm of intelligence gathering, but cryptography has been the backbone on which nations have conducted their military operations and the fundamental building block of the digital world in which nations, corporations and individuals operate today.Cryptology has always been a battle between those who encode (cryptographers) and those who try to break the code (cryptoanalysts).This books traces the evolution of cryptography from the times of Mary of Scot (who was executed as her communication was intercepted and deciphered, proving that she was plotting to assassinate the English Queen), through substitution ciphers in the 19th and 20th centuries and how they were finally broken in the Arab world to modern times and the impact of Enigma on the outcome of WWII and finally the current use of RSA encryption and cutting edge quantum cryptography.I would recommend this book to only those genuinely interested in this topic as it requires a certain amount of concentration and effort to understand how the various encryptions work and how ingenious the logic to break those codes is.

Not just that, but also to know how codes have been developed, evolutioned, and either been broken or still being a challenge.This book shows you how codes (and ciphers) have been related to queens, treasures, religion, war, languages and much more. It gives you stories of fear, hope and will. This makes the reading very interesting. Have you wondered who was the Man in the Iron Mask?You'll find a lot of references for further reading. The book is excellent as an introduction to codes and you'd want to read more about the subject; the book shows and explains to you the ways to take.I didn't like some opinions from the author in the last chapter, but I do agree that there are many points of view about privacy, code breaking, and science, and these are continuosly changing.You would finish the book agreeing or not; nontheless, you will know a lot more about codes, ciphers and writing systems."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"I read this book few months back.

And it provides fundamental information, needed for good knowledge on the subject. Certainly modern day CTO's need to go through this book.The author has touched on all aspects of encryption - its progression from the Egyptian civilization many thousand years ago to current breakthrough's in Quantum computing. His account of competition between code-makers and code-breakers is interesting and informative.Now, I am beginning to be skeptical about RSA's encryption.

Thanks Mr. Singh."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"The book traces the history of ciphers;its origins ,evolution.Right from ancient times man has sought ways to conceal his confidential correspondence.This, author says ,gave birth to cryptology:the art of secret writing.So cryptology,unlike other branches of knowledge,has a rich past.Over the centuries it has passed through several stages.From manual ciphers of ancient times,progressing towards mechanical encryption during Industrial age and finally to electronic encryption with the dawn of computer era.First step in this direction was Steganography.Then evolved different forms of substitution ciphers.Substitution ciphers can be further classified into monoalphabetic and polyalphabetic ciphers.The author has given schematic representation of evolutionary structure of secret writing.At this juncture, I wish to add the development of cryptology predominantly hinged upon advances in the field of cryptanalysis.Cryptanalysis is the art of cracking ciphers.It reminds me of perpetual rivalry between ballistic experts and armour specialists.While former seeks to perfect projectiles capable of piercing thickest and strongest of all armour , latter tries to find ways to make armour impervious to penetration.This engendered the development of superior forms armour.Same too is the case with cryptology.Arab cryptanalysts , in the middle ages using frequency analysis ,were able to destroy the security of monoalphabetic cipher.This development led to cryptologists developing superior forms of encryption. Thus came polyalphabetic ciphers and homonyms.A reader of this book will find how successful penetration of ciphers had a profound impact on the course of history.Among incidents narrated - to mention a few -assassination of Mary queen of scots, Zimmermann Telegram ,cracking of Nazi Enigma ciphers by British cryptanalysts working at GCCS at Bletchley Park considerably shortend the duration of Second World War.There is a excellent account of German Enigma machine cipher.The operation of Enigma, given by other authors , has always baffled me.But after reading author's version I could understand its intricacies better.Few pages in the book have been devoted to how code breaking has enriched our knowledge of the past.Decipherment of Egyptian Hieroglyphics by French linguist Champollion and cracking of Minoan Linear B by Michael Ventris .In the concluding chapters of the book author dwelts upon complexties of computer encryption especially how cryptologists were able to overcome 'key exchange problem . Each encryption has something called algorithm or key which specifies the meathod for encrypting the message.In electronic encipherment conventional ways of exchanging keys would have caused immense logistical problems.But thanks to enthusiasm and perseverance shown by a group of American engineers the problem was solved which again shows that human ingenuity knows no bounds.In our internet age encryption assumes prime importance as this could only ensure the safety of e-commerce transactions.Finally, Mr Singh has prophesied the shape of things to come.Quantum cryptography which I found trifle difficult to understand.Author says quantum encryption is virtually impervious to hackers.So he ends the book in an optimistic note.Author deserves felicitations as he endeavoured to make abstruse subject as simple as possible.The book is a sheer delight to read .However reader wanting to draw more information on the subject must turn to David Kahn's monumental Code Breakers or his recently published voluminous tome History of Secret Writing."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This in an excellent book that shows how messages were written, sent and intercepted through different ages, what were the implications of being/not being able to decipher them and what is the latest in security.

But Simon Singh describes and analyzes the history of coding in a very captivating and understandable way, the result of both thorough research and funny anecdotes he found along the way.He starts with the earliest known accounts of coding in ancient Egypt, Greece and Rome at around 450 BCE where this new ability lead to some decisive military victories. As well as to treason and intrigue in love matters of course. The methods used at that time are well explained and amazingly easy to reproduce if you know how they work. At the time most didn't of course , so the secrets were well kept. Until up to around the year 800 CE when Muslim scholars took coding to the next level and dominated the field for 400 years. Then the Europeans woke up from their slumber and this new interest in cryptography and cryptoanalysis culminated in the 'chiffre ind&eacute;chiffrable' (the unbreakable cipher). But it was only a question of time when it would be broken and so it was indeed in the 19th century. Which meant a big victory for the cryptoanalysts over the cryptographs. And cryptography was temporarily shattered. Until the early 20th century when technical and mechanical advances let it rise from the ashes. This also decisively influenced, and shortened, the two World Wars. Especially the story of the Enigma machine is mind-blowing. There then was a new lull after WW2 but the Information age brought new interest and needs which resulted in the current Internet encryption standard PGP (Pretty Good Privacy). Finally Singh then briefly explains how Quantum cryptography could work and what it would mean for the future.That's about it. As I've said, it's very readable, enlightening and entertaining though there are parts where it gets a bit too theoretical but you can skip those pages without missing too much. It doesn't prevent understanding what follows. It should yet be noted that one interesting, somewhat off-beat, chapter shows how cryptoanalytical methods were used to decode the hieroglyphs and 'Linear B'.So, if after reading this book you think that you've got real code cracker skills, then you might want to try to solve the \\"Beale Papers\\" mystery ... Happy treasure hunting! ;)"},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"I cannot put it down as soon as I started to read this book. The historical development of cryptography was presented in a highly logical and easy to understand manner. At each stage in history the problem facing codebreakers and codemakers are presented in such a precise way such that when the solution was described, you feel like you would have solved them by yourself. As in most of the problems, when the solution are found it makes the problem looks so trival that you do not understand why you stuck with it at the first place. The technical detail are interwoven with fastinating historical stories. You can read it as a novel or a collection of mind-boggling puzzles. As a person who loves solving puzzles, this is my first book on crytograpghy and it certainly raised my interest to read more about the topic."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Reading a book about cryptography over a weekend that was relegated to the recycle bin thanks to an annoying bout of flu was not something I expect to dream about, leave alone end up actually doing. Well, read that book I did. And how. Friday night through Tuesday morning I looked like a law student cramming for a bar exam, except I was enjoying every moment of it.Rhetoric apart, The Code Book, a well-written chronology of cryptology, is one more of those excellent near-fiction but non-fiction reads on the market today. Simon Singh's alternative profession as a PBS documentarian is betrayed as the book unfolds almost like a televised series on the evolution of cryptography and cryptanalysis. Singh unearths some intriguing stories involving the Queen of Scots, World War II, Hitler, Navajo Indians, and asymmetric key cryptography. The intriguing but heavy social aspect of cryptography is clearly surfaced and is something that is bound to keep the reader thinking about.In summary, this is a reasonably easy read aimed at the average inquisitive reader but there are enough technical details to keep the &quot;power readers&quot; satisfied.In one line: a highly recommended read for anyone who can hold up a book and turn pages."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"I really can't remember enjoying a book more than this one, if I have, it's been years.I have seen Simon Singh's production of &quot;Fermat's Last Theorem&quot; on PBS as well. I'm convinced that Mr. Singh is a genius at conveying difficult information to the masses. May his writing career be a long one. I look forward to anything else he writes, whether it be a book or a television show.Simon Singh has a special gift, the gift of being able to explain what could easily be a dry and boring subject. Some of the cryptography in the book is technical and complicated, but he always manages to simplify it to a reasonable level without losing what is special about it. You end up completely understanding the methods used to break each of the progressively more difficult codes.I loved the inclusion of people's notes, original paintings and photographs too. There are photos of the original Linear B tablets and tables of different characters, the Rosetta stone, the original Enigma machine and the designer and all of the code breakers. While reading it, you think of the photos as an aside, I realized near the end that it is a spectacular collection (and selection) of photos.I promise you, if you have even the remotest interest in the subject of codes and code breaking, you'll love this book."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This is a book that should have tremendous appeal to everyone with an interest in history, technology, basic human endeavor, or all three. On the surface it would appear to have limited appeal, but this book is well researched, well written, and accessible on every level to novices with little background in cryptography or the complex mathematics upon which much of it is based.The author in a concise manner, though never at the expense of relevance, brings the reader through the evolution of cryptography from its earliest uses to the present and beyond. He mixes the science of discovery and un-covery (to coin a phrase) with very relevant, interesting and oftentimes suspenseful historical vignettes.The evolution of cryptography described is of iterative one-ups man-ship. \\"Codes\\" created to conceal, codes broken to reveal, again and again. The author makes many \\"history in the balance\\" points throughout the text, occasionally overemphasizing the importance of the code-breakers at the expense of other contributors to successful operations.This is an excellent text for anyone with even a passing interest in the subject of cryptography."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Singh does a great job of keeping the reader involved in a storyline as well as presenting some fairly intense logic and math theories. If you're looking to get your head around the ideas of crypto, this book rocks."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"I was just on a 8-hour flight that turned into a 13-hour flight with delays.I was able to read the Code Book in it entirely. This is the only time I did not mind the delays, since it is such a interesting and captivating book."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Read this a couple years back and I remember I could not put it down. Singh is a great writer and knows how to tell a story.The strongest point of the book is that it is NOT meant to be a technical learning device. It's nice to see the historical background in which a particular cryptographic method evolved for a change. The Mary Queen of Scots and Enigma sections were particularly well written.Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Wow, wow, wow. I have never read a book faster than this one. I couldn't put it down!I don't want to spoil any of the incredible stories found within, so I'll just describe the book's two main strengths.Firstly, the explanations of increasingly complex cyphers, all the way down to quantum cryptography, were insanely good. As an example, the workings of Enigma, the sophisticated encryption machine used by the Nazis, became transparent after reading this book.Equally important, the encryption methods described in the book are masterfully tied in with their historical context, much of which is not widely known because much of the material was classified for a very long time. I think you will be amazed by how much of history was decided by the strength and weaknesses of various cyphers. I was.In short, go read this book. It is extremely entertaining and (bonus!) extremely informative."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This was a very easy reading book-- in spite of the level of sophistication of some of the ideas. It is also very good how the author reviews just enough math for what you will need to know in order to understand some of the ideas in codebreaking.There are also lots of nuggets of knowledge for people who like trivia-- such as the contribution of the Navajo to the war effort by the use of their language, or the Poles to codebreaking technology because of their being in between two hostile neighbors. It is also often not understood the level of aggression of the Germans during WWII and how much thought went into the military strategies of the various nations.The prose is clear and concise. This is defnitely worth a second read.As a final testatment to how absorbing this book was: I read most of it on a train traveling through China while seated in a car that held about 150 other people (in spite of being designed for 105), and that was so crowded that it was not possible to move down the aisles. This book kept me busy for almost the whole train ride."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Like many nerdy types, I've been interested in codes and ciphers since adolescence -- in my case, the mid-1950s. Being also a history junkie, in high school I read Chadwick's The Decipherment of Linear B, and in college, Tuchman's The Zimmerman Telegram, which confirmed my interest. (Both are covered here.) I picked up this book on a recommendation from a friend because of the accessible discussion of more recent topics, including \\"Pretty Good Privacy\\" and quantum cryptography, and while I found it necessary to skim lightly over some of the mathematical explanations, Singh's straightforward style and mastery of his subject made for an enjoyable weekend."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"I thought it got off to a bit of a slow start, but about a quarter of the way through it, it became almost impossible to put down. The history of code makers and code breakers is very well put together with inteesting stories. The details on the methods used to break the Enigma ciphers (finding cycles that allow automated searching for correct wheel alignments independent of the scrambling patch cables) was new to me and fascinating. Good description of quantum techniques (which would be the ultimate win for the code makers side of the \\"arms race\\")."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Cryptography does not involve large numbers of men hacking each other to pieces with swords and spears or blowing each other to bits with powder and shot. Furthermore, the most significant achievements in cryptography are often covered in layers of government secrecy that take decades to be removed. Therefore, very few know how great a role it has played in the resolution of armed conflict. Singh lays out the history of cryptography, explaining the basics of the various codes while listing where they were used.Without question, the expertise of small numbers of code breakers has dramatically altered the course of history. The famous Zimmerman note from a German diplomat to the leadership of Mexico during World War I offered German support for Mexico reclaiming the American southwest if Mexico would declare war on the United States. The anger that it engendered in the U. S. swept away the last isolationist sentiment and precipitated U. S. entry into World War I. It was encrypted before being sent, but the code was cracked by the British, who then made the contents public.The incredible expertise of the British code breakers in cracking German codes in World War II may have been the difference in keeping Britain fighting during those dark days when she stood essentially alone against the mighty German military. In fact, many technical historians argue that the person most responsible for Britain surviving the German onslaught was not Winston Churchill, but the chief code breaker, Alan Turing. Turing's group was able to break the German military codes, thought to be unbreakable by the Germans, and the British were then able to concentrate their forces where the threats were greatest. So accurate was the British intelligence that one of their greatest problems was deciding when not to use it so that the Germans would not learn that they were reading the messages.In one of the most interesting stories in the book, Ian Fleming, the creator of the fictional super-spy James Bond, devised a scheme whereby the British would crash a German plane near a German ship. The British crew of the plane would then bail out and capture the German ship, capturing all the code books. The plan was ultimately scrapped, to the disappointment of Turing and his group.The cast of characters who have been significant in the advancement of cryptography contains some very unusual people. This is best summed up by the comment Winston Churchill made to the head of the Secret Intelligence Service when he visited the code breakers at Bletchley, \\"I told you to leave no stone unturned, but I didn't expect you to take me so literally.\\" Some of the pictures in the book also reinforce this view. Nevertheless, they were brilliant people, and you learn how they were able to literally conquer incredible odds. Most started with situations where the number of possibilities was astronomical, and yet with ingenuity, persistence, luck and occasionally dirt tricks, they were able to reduce the numbers down to a level where it was possible to find a solution.This is a superb popular history of cryptography, written at a level that everyone can understand and shows a history of human conflict that is often deeply hidden from view. It also demonstrates how critical mathematical knowledge can be in the life of a nation.Published in the recreational mathematics e-mail newsletter, reprinted with permission."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"The Code Book, by Simon Singh, is a tantalizing peek at the history of cryptography. He begins with the brilliance of the Egyptians, moves through the breakthrough discoveries of Arab scholars, to the European aristocratic intrigues of the middle ages, wartime use in WWI and II, to today; where security and encryption is part of our everyday lives and daily transactions. The author is skilled at presenting both \\"sides\\" of the drama - the needs and desires of the code-makers coupled with the motivations and thought processes of the code- breakers! He has taken an amazingly complex topic and presented it in a way that is mostly accessible to the average interested reader. I was mainly captivated by the historical documentation and the wartime code use. I found the quantum leap less understandable, although Singh does an excellent job at bringing up questions about civil liberties and the responsibilities and consequences of living in a \\"secure\\" world. It is important to include that Singh explains \\"Public Key Encryption\\" - arguably, the very most important development in security in recent times, along with the personal stories of the men who were credited with public key discovery, and those unsung heroes who were not.A fascinating off shoot of The Code Book is the Cipher Challenge consisting of 10 cyphers of increasing difficulty that the author provides in the appendix. Singh understands that nothing is as engaging as a secret to be uncovered or a mystery to be solved. Over 10,000 people participated in his challenge and it was finally solved 18 months later by a team of Swedish researchers. One of the amazing facts of their solution was their ability to crack the most difficulty RSA cipher by writing a number field sieve algorithm thereby letting an \\"ordinary\\" computer crack the code! Will the development of a truly unbreakable code ever exist? If it does, Simon Singh will be able to tell us about it. His website is even more fascinating than The Code Book. It has joined my \\"favorites' list! ..."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"It's said that a good writer can make any subject interesting. In \\"The Code Book\\", Simon Singh takes an interesting subject and makes it not only fascinating - but understandable.Singh has a PhD in physics as well as a talent for incorporating lucid explanations into a well-told story. His book offers a historical survey of the ongoing struggle between those who create encrypted (disguised) messages and the enemies who would decode those messages. The book is a only a survey, not an authoritative history, but it gives a tremendous feel for the subject. It ranges from ancient times to present-day efforts in the mysterious world of quantum cryptography. Throughout, Singh's thorough and illuminating analogies and explanations make the encryption and decryption techniques themselves accessible to the intellectually curious layperson.\\"The Code Book\\" was published before 9/11/01, but after reading it, you'll wonder if the US National Security Agency (NSA) is focused right now on building a quantum computer that can crack encrypted terrorist messages. I'm guessing they are, with as much urgency as Alan Turing and his colleageus in England worked to crack Germany's \\"Enigma\\" machine in World War II (read all about that in Singh's book). And if they succeed, it will have enormous implications for online privacy and security. Which, incidentally, is a subject that Singh also covers in an effective, objective manner when he recounts the development of \\"Pretty Good Privacy\\" in the 1990's.\\"The Code Book\\" should appeal broadly to anyone who is the slightest bit curious about this fascinating subject. Encryption isn't just the stuff of spies and nerdy mathematicians, it is (and has been) of vital importance throughout history. Side note: Technology managers who want to gain a fuller appreciation for the methods and circumstances of modern-day, computer-enabled encryption should read this book."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Another book from Simon Singh that successfully combines history and mathematics. The Code Book delivers on its promise to tell the science of secrecy (secret messaging) from ancient times to the present. It does so in clear, understandable prose. The continual struggle between cryptographers (those encoding messages) and cryptoanalysts (those decoding them) engages the reader's interest and heightens intensity. A subject worth reviewing in present times, with the threat of terrorism and war in the air.The book includes some very specific mathematics, in easy to follow format. (I love math, but am quite rusty; I found this aspect refreshing because the author assumes we're all intelligent.)I almost took off a star, however, in my rating, because of the contest at the end of the book. About ten coded messages are given and the reader is invited to decode them and send responses to the contest address. After reading the book, I was so enthralled with the subject, that I immediately took up the challenge, cracked the first two codes in record time and then, buoyed by this success and feeling confident, worked through the night and day on the third code--totally absorbed. I forgot what day it was (it was Sunday and I missed church), I let my daughter fix her own meals (she's seven!)--and suddenly realized I would just have to put the book away and NEVER look at the contest puzzles again. I didn't take off the rating star, though, because I remembered in retrospect that the book includes a story of a man who likewise was consumed by a coded message he intended to decipher. So fair warning!!Enjoy the read, enjoy the challenge of the puzzles, be prepared to deepsix your copy to return to more mundane work and life!"},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This book is exactly what I was looking for. It's equal parts history, mystery and science. I read it in about two days, which is quite a rarity for me. On only two occasions did I need to reread a passage to understand the mathematics involved, which was quite an accomplishment for the author.I'm off to the bookstore to buy Singh's other book at lunch today, and if it's half as good as The Code Book I'll have it done by the end of the weekend.Buy the book."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"What great reading! I hope Singh comes up with a second book, he says that there were a great number of stories which he left out because there just wasn't room. The stories he used this time were so interesting.Singh calls this a book on the evolution of codes and he presents it as that - showing the various developments of ciphers and codes from Caesar right through history including Mary Queen of Scots, Enigma &amp;c. to today. His explanations are so simple - stripped of too much technical jargon to make those of us who aren't had no ideas about codes and codebreaking before (like me) - don't feel thick and inadequate.I first heard this book read in chapters on the radio, and that was pretty good stuff - the book is so much better though. Singh is a great writer, I loved his initial scene setting with Mary, Queen of Scots. This book isn't just about codes, Singh also tells the story about the deciphering of various old ancient texts.All the chapters flow on well from one another in the evolutionary way he describes - but you can read each chapter independently if you just want to browse through the book reading for a particular interest."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"The Code Book traces the evolution of secret messages from simple hidden messages to modern computer/mathematical cipher techniques. Using interesting historical examples of different cipher techniques, Singh explores not only the cipher techniques but also the people that developed them or succeeded in making contributions to breaking them. There are certainly some fascinating characters! The secretive nature of the work consigned them to the shadowy peripherals of history, undermining the importance of their work. The decipherment of Linear B was an incredible achievement and the success and importance of breaking Enigma can not be understated.Singh does a remarkable job at making such a complex topic relevant, interesting and fairly easy to understand.

The explanations of the Enigma Solution and Public Key Cryptology were most clearly written. The section on Linear B was also beautifully written; especially memorable is when Singh talks of &quot;ancient languages once again whispering their messages to us...&quot;.Even in sections where one can disagree with the viewpoint of the author, such as how credit for cryptologic advancement should be allocated, or the absolute value of who knows what when (especially as it relates to World War II), the sheer interest in the topics keeps one riveted to the text and eager for more. This book is certainly comparable to David Kahn's masterpiece The Codebreakers, and in some respects more up to date, though hardly as comprehensive.This book has more traction to it than Mr. Singh's book on Fermat's Last Theorem, but this might be due to the very nature of the subjects involved. Certainly that book aided in the desire to read this one, which proves more rewarding from an intellectual vantage point. This can be compared to a book such as &quot;The Universe and the Teacup&quot; which has so turned me off to that author that I can't imagine ever wanting to read anything from her again.

Among the chapter heading are: The Cipher of Mary Queen of Scots, The Mechanization of Secrecy, and Cracking the Enigma.Anyone interested in computer privacy, identity theft, government or corporate snooping and the like, will find a lot to think about here.The author, Simon Singh, is worthy of note, too. He has a Ph.D. in physics, and he is a former BBC producer. Singh, also directed a documentary shown on PBS's &quot;Nova&quot; series about Fermat's Last Theorem. Singh, is also the author of the book &quot;Fermat's Enigma&quot;.At some points the book gets too elementary. Apparently, the author and the publisher are attempting to appeal to the widest possible audience, ... Simple, obvious points are sometimes pedantically repeated, while repitious, step by step exposition of obvious points occasionally becomes tedious.Don't be put off, though. Despite the obvious fine grinding of the normally chunkey subject matter, for the delicate digestion of students with hyphenated majors and Hollywood hedonists, this is a good read."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"I ordered this book, and it came in the mail. You can read it, or use it as a weight to make sure things don't blow around. It's not too heavy so you can conveniently carry it around in a bag, but be advised it cannot fit in a regular sized pocket. The jacket is nice, slightly grippy, so it's easier to hold it if that's what you want to do with it, or throw it, if you decide to do that. I didn't try tasting it.

Singh's masterful work is anything but. It is exciting, nerve-wracking and perfectly understandable even to the mathematically challenged.The underlying theme of the book is the incessant battle between those who would create unbreakable codes and those would strive to break them. His captivating anecdotes describe the historical uses of encrypted messages for purposes of romance, war-making and business... and they are all delightful.It's testament to Singh's ability that even topics such as one-time pad ciphers, the inner workings of the Nazi's Enigma device, the incredibly complicated language of the Navajo code talkers and even quantum cryptology become almost easy to digest. Throw in bonus topics like the Beale code (a fantastic story!) and the deciphering of heiroglyphics (the Rosetta Stone was not a panacea!) and you have the makings of a truly exceptional work.Singh's work is as unique as it is stellar. This is one book that anyone interested in history _must_ read."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Simon Singh is an incredible writer. While I was already familiar with much of the material he covered (many of these ciphers will be used in a college class on cryptography or computer security), I simply couldn't put this book down; his skill in telling the history of cryptography makes this a must-read.While this is an easy-to-read book, not a textbook, the interested reader will find instructions for solving various ciphers, letter frequency charters, and even a famous unsolved cipher. I highly recommend this for anyone interested in codes and ciphers."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"I read this book after reading 'Cryptonomicon' by Neal Stephenson, which is a fictional novel that also deals with secret codes and cryptography (and is an excellent read by the way). I wanted to know more about the subject of cryptography, so I tried this book out. It a very good introduction to the subject. It simplied the concepts enough so that they were easy to understand. Another good feature of this book, is that it wasn't all technical - there are historical aspects of secret codes and how those codes were broken.Simon Singh has done an excellent job of taking a complex subject, and making it an enjoyable read. If you're a curious mind who enjoys understanding how things work, read this book."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"I don't really have anything bad to say about this book. Well, it could've been a bit longer... When I got my copy and opened the first page I just couldn't stop reading. The book serves great as an easy readable and entertaining primer to the history of codes and code breaking.Kahn's Codebreakers is said to also be worth reading on the subject, but it seems to lack the newest twists of codebreaking, namely the last 30 years or so. Singh's book covers those nicely."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This is a really good book for beginners in criptography.It has the story of criptography (the explanations of ciphers and how to break them) since the first ciphers."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"A very well written book on a fascinating subject. I've read a lot of books on cryptography, particularly the historical aspects of the subject. This is by far the best one.All the others either skim over the details of how each cypher works, or ignore it all together. Not Singh! Wonderful details very well explained. Whether you have a good math background or not, you'll find it interesting."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This is one of the greatest histories of cryptography that I have ever read. It discusses many of fundamentals and also simple substitution ciphers and how they are broken. It keeps you in pace with the story so much so that when I learned how the Viegnere cipher was broken I originally thought it to be impossible. It is a fun read and it is clear to understand unlike some other cryptographic books and explains concepts very well. I especially enjoyed testing out trying out the Diffie Hellman key exchange and learning about the possible futures of Cryptography in Quantum Computers and Quantum Cryptography. A must read for anyone interested in learning the basics of cryptography. Definately a great place to start!"},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"I also read Fermat's Enigma.

And there is even more, because the main focus isn't on the techniques, but on the history of coding, and I can assure you there is plenty of it. After all keeping secrets has always played an important role in our life, beeing them innocent paper messages on schooldesks or war-resolving &quot;Enigma-encrypted&quot; messages.So my advice is : if you were thinking about reading it, definitely do.

Simon Singh is usually more exciting, but in this book he is a little bit too UK-centered. For instance, he gives an extensive description and history of the decoding of the German ENIGMA code by the British, but only a few words on the American decoding of the Japanese Purple code. As a general introduction to coding and decoding, it could have been shorter, as a detailed introduction, then it should have covered more areas."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This is a good book to provide a minimal background for most people for the subject of encryption. For many this might not be an exciting subject. But thanks to this book it helps explain its relevance and history. Besides providing a background on encryption it highlights a story about a true hero of great genius. Unfortunately as the story unfolds he will be maligned and harassed until he ends his life, just because he was homosexual. Regardless of his choice of partners, his work and mind were brilliant."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"as (they say) Albert Einstein said (referring to some conceptual framework in quantum mechanic (which BTW he didn't initially get right)). Anyone reading the \\"popular\\" (quite a bit biased/peppered) account of the WWII and the parallel \\"word/messaging\\"/intelligence war, might come to the conclusion that the amusing British secrecy games and the D-day invasion, delayed by the US. Gov. to the point you couldn't tell if it was tactic or strategic, won it. When the NAZI army were being defeated and bent to the ground by the \\"Red\\" army on the Eastern front, which was actually the turning point of the war..In fact you may find books out there which would have a narrative more into trying to show you how the NAZIs would have won WWII. Ach! Yeah, Sure!.Most wrong things (or at the point they get to be wrong) naturally come to terms by themselves to a large extent and within. Even if you may hear some people say stuff like Pr. Ronald Reagan defeated communism with his silly star war arm race or Pr. Bush \\"liberated/democratized\\" Iraq (I bet there are books about that too), I think the two main factors that brought to an end NAZI Germany were:.1._ their most basic premises were wrong, both in \\"their mind\\" (culturally speaking) and \\"on the ground\\" (as it so similarly happened with Pr. Bush's Iraq's engagement).2._ the Red army beat the hell out of pesky NAZI offensive.Also Mr Singh, do you really believe the British \\"intelligence\\" didn't know Alan Turing was gay? Really? Give me a break! They just used him as they would have anyone else. I found quite excessive, abusive and sad that his life was tormented to the point of committing suicide (or probably killed?) by the same people he so dutifully and wholeheartedly served. On the other hand I am glad that the Polish Mathematician Marian Rejewski took credit for having actually been the one who deciphered the so called freaking NAZIs \\"Enigma\\" machines..In general this is a -good- book directed at the masses not the specialist, but taking historical circumstances into consideration, the soap-opera-like writing style is more than half way off. The WWI primarily and most fundamentally was a very bloody historical reality not just a mathematical/secrecy play..I think it is worthy to recall that millions of people died/were killed in this large-scale nonsense, which as historically documented, was being performed already in full swing by the British empire in their colonial overseas territories, the only difference being that NAZIs were less imaginative and decided to throw the party home, right in Europe..It is also baffling to see the nonsensical stupidity by so-called \\"intelligence\\" services and \\"Deutschland ueber alles\\" mentality still happening in our times..otf"},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"So OK, I'm one of those people that has to read the book all the way through. I can't stop reading something once I've started because then it would be like some kind of defeat or something. And with this book I had gotten into a big discussion with my brother about whether I would really read it or if I was just clicking away on Amazon at things that I might like but wasn't really, really interested in. So I had something to prove. The upshot is that I wanted to stop reading this book but I couldn't, so it started to annoy me. I liked the subject a lot and I think the author's style was very accessible, his writing was &quot;readable&quot;, as they say. What annoyed me unfortunately was his enthusiasm. At times he would strive to point out what geniuses these guys were and how their contribution changed the course of history and how cryptography is this great unheralded scientific and cultural discipline. Alright already, I get it. It's all so amazing. Got it. I can see that the men and women that made great strides in cryptography had minds that worked in &quot;special&quot; ways. I enjoyed hearing the stories. It just got old in the end and the world of cryptography started to seem less like spies and covert-Op's and more like a Trekkie convention."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"The cover of the book is obviously designed to resemble &quot;The Bible Code,&quot; and I suspect that people who like it are impressionable folk like the ones who bought &quot;The Bible Code.&quot; Much more could have been done in a book about such an important and interesting topic. Perhaps in the U.K there is much interest in Mary, Queen of Scots. I would have liked to see deeper explanations of the theory of coding. The material on quantum cryptology was especially weak, I thought. Perhaps someone else will write something on this fascinating topic."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"For the most part... it was a very interesting book. It's biggest FAILURE was not having a better understanding of 'WHAT' the mystery is really about... 'WHO' created the mystery and 'Why' it was created... 'Where' the mystery will ultimately take you to. Mr. Singh and others like him have no idea that the one 'allegedly' deciphered message STILL HAS parts that have as yet not been divulged to any one other than myself. IF he were truly serious about an accurate understanding of the B...eale mystery... he should have spoken to me first."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Singh's book on a topic that many would find boring is actually a delight.

Discusses the Enigma Machine, the Rosetta Stone, Linear B, and several other code-breaking classics (some remain unsolved!)"},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Fantastic introduction to science of cryptography and it's history. Goes into a lot of information about how various codes work, how they're broken, and so on.I only have a couple of criticisms of the book, namely that it leaves out some very important encryption systems. Very little is talked about the coding systems used by the US and the Allies, and by the Japanese, in WWII. The use of the Navaho language is extensively covered, but the more traditional systems are hardly mentioned. Also, there is virtually no mention at all about how modern symmetric cyphers, such as DES or the new AES (Rjindael).All in all though, a great read an a good introduction to the field and it's history."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"I had no idea of the significance cryptography/cryptanalysis has played in the history of the world, especially WWII.

Singh is a great story teller and this book is as engrossing as the latest Grisham novel. I happen to like how he leads us right into the internet cryptology process which is must reading for anyone who has ever ordered a book on Amazon! By the end of this book, you'll understand the mechanics behind a &quot;secure transaction.&quot; I can't wait to read his book on Fermat."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Excellent book for anyone interested in history, current events and behind the scenes view of things. Technical aspect well discussed for the layman. Highly recommended."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"I happen to work in the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) environment so perhaps my view on this book is biased. I liked it so much though, that I recommended it to friends and family not involved with cryptography or even security in any way whatsoever. Their unanimous feedback was just as I suspected; this is a GREAT read regardless of your vocation and knowledge of the subject of codes and cryptology.

The only errors I found in it were petty ones (and probably placed there intentionally to test the readers.) They are as follows: pg. 256 The word &quot;the&quot; was left out of &quot;...there is ___ problem...&quot; On pg. 268 the word &quot;person&quot; has a space instead of an &quot;r&quot; making it &quot;pe son&quot; And on pg. 324 the word &quot;parable&quot; is used when, in my opinion, the word &quot;paradigm&quot; is a little better when discussing Schrodinger's cat that is both dead and alive at the same time. My views are far too classical on this subject to seriously entertain such a thought without the use of mind altering drugs. ;-) As a strictly personal matter the mention of Plato on pg. 218 instead of Socrates who taught him is something I would change. But I've always been a big Socrates fan and will admit my bias. I hope that when the encryption software my wife and I have developed hits the market within the next year or so that it will find a place of honorable mention in a future book by Dr. Singh. He seems to me to be a genuine gentleman and a scholar who I'd be honored to meet. All the best to you Dr. Singh!

It starts off with tellingthe story of the so called 'cipher of Mary Queen of Scots', thensuccessively deals with, for instance, the initial invention of atheoretically unbreakable code (through using random numbers) and itspractical drawbacks, the rise and fall of the Enigma code, the usage ofcodes in the form of unusual (hopefully unknown to the enemy or opponent)languages, the analysis of ancient forgotten languages, privacy issuesincluding safe transfering of code keys and, finally, ends withdiscussions of modern, and possibly future, cryptography/cryptanalysis-techniques based on quantum computers and theory.Moreover, additional interesting, and in some instances somewhat moretechnical, material is referred to several appendices.Note: The swedish translated edition includes quite a lot of Sweden-specificinformation.

He explains the complicated mathematics in a way that makes the discussion easily understood.In the case of \\"The Code Book,\\" I already found the topic of codes to be fascinating, and Singh's talent for making complicated subjects comprehensible is in full form. His story-telling ability once again shines.There's quite a bit of interesting and well-written historical overview, from the codes of Mary Queen of Scots up to the cutting edge science of quantum cryptography. The book is absolutely riveting on the subject of Engima and the Allies' quest to break it.I started off the book with a basic fascination for the mechanics of codes, and by the end I was drawn into the stories and people behind the codes.Excellent and fascinating reading."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This book is just very well done. Singh takes a topic that could easily be dry and confusing and instead makes it fascinating and clear. He accomplishes this seemingly difficult task with apparent ease by using colorful and relevant historic tales to go along with the use and breaking of each cipher he discusses in his book. Singh also demonstrates a rare gift for explaining complex mathematics in a manner that is clear and engaging even for a rank amateur reader.The result of all this is a book that goes into genuine depth on a very complex and technical topic without ever leaving the layperson behind or resorting to writing that would bore a more advanced reader to tears.This is simply a very impressive book and a really fun one to read.

From Egypt to Mary Queen of Scots to present day public key cryptography to future quantum concepts, Simon Singh offers a typewritten drama unparalleled by many novels. The historical aspects of cryptography set together with the technical details offer the charm of a story and the depth of a dissertation.

The intent of the book as a high-level explanation and evolution of secrecy in communications is spot on. More technically inclined readers may be a bit disappointed in the lack of depth into the mathematics behind more modern encryption standards (Diffie-Hellman-Merkle or RSA), but the author does provide additional resources for those interested in the details.

It makes amply clear need of good encryption mechanism especially in information age. Two points, which I found very useful, are:1) Algorithms can be broken in a radically different and un-expected way. For example just by looking at rate of occurrence of characters in a plain text, substitution cipher was broken. This highlight need for out of box thinking.In contrast, natural language of tribal people used by USA in Second World War instead of mechanized encryption turned out to be difficult to break.2) Al least one way exists to safely encrypt/decrypt data. Use different random numbers to encrypt/decrypt each character of data using simple substitution cipher mechanism. Practical complexity is another thing but fact that such logic exists makes me feel good."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This book is about cryptology (a term that includes both code making or cryptography and code breaking or cryptanalysis). However, the primary focus is not the science of cryptology or its history although both are covered in sufficient detail. It is, rather, on people; the people who made the codes, the people who broke the codes and the people whose lives were affected by the codes. The book proceeds in a chronological manner as it follows the age old war between code makers and code breakers from the distant past to well into the future.Singh explains the not-so-easy mathematics and technology behind code making and breaking in a vivid and very accessible style. Elusive topics such as the operation of the Enigma, the mathematics of RSA and the principals of quantum cryptology are so well explained that most readers will grasp them with a single reading. It is hard not to be inspired by this book. Many times you will find yourselves grabbing a sheet of papers and attempting to work out the codes yourself. The book provides a set of ciphers to work on your own and a list of further reading for those interested to follow up on Alice, Bob and Eve (hypothetical characters used to explain techniques in cryptology).\\"Uijt jb b gjof cppl\\" replace each letter by the one that precedes it in the alphabet and you get \\"This is a fine book\\". This simple cipher, called the Cesar shift cipher, is one of the earliest known ciphers and is discussed in the first chapter which covers cryptology from ancient Greece until the fourteenth century and narrates the gripping tale of Mary Queen of the Scots. The second chapter covers the evolution of both cryptology and cryptanalysis until the 20th century and narrates, among others, the mysterious tale of Beale's ciphers. The third and fourth chapters cover the evolution of cryptology during the first and second world wars and mainly concentrate on the operation and the cracking of the famous German Enigma machine. The fifth chapter covers the Navajo code talkers used by the US in WW2 as well as the inspiring tales of decipherment of Hieroglyphics mainly by Champollion and of Linear B by, among others, Michael Ventris. Chapters six and seven are about Modern Cryptology. They covers the story behind the ground breaking advancements in cryptography, e.g. public key cryptography, that fueled internet communication and commerce. It also ponders in some detail over the issue of privacy versus security. Chapter eight is about the future of Cryptology and how both code makers and code breakers are starting to make use of Quantum mechanics to take cryptology to a whole new level.As mentioned earlier, this book is about people and it does a good job in paying tribute to many of the usually unsung heroes of cryptology.All said, this is one of the most gripping, amusing and rewarding general science books; it even has instructions on how to hide a message within a hardboiled egg!!"},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This is an incredible book that walks the reader through the history of Cryptography in a form that is very easy and enjoyable to read.

I have re-read it a secondtime just to pickup all the information presented.if you are a novice cryptoanalyst, I highly recommend this book."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This book is a fantastic primer and historical perspective on cryptoanalsis. It digs deep into the primary events of the evolution of this discipline. It is very focused on making it accessible to the lay person. This is important, especially in the new digital age, the technological ramifications on privacy are at a critical mass. We as citizens must be aware of our right to privacy. Encryption technology such as PGP make it possible. Although it is a short mention in the book. The lead up is perfect. We become aware of the importance of privacy through the evolution of codemaking and codebreaking. The world would certainly be a different place if the Allied Forces did not break the Enigma cipher. Some day the RSA cipher will also be broken. It is inevitable. This book makes you want to learn more. As any great primer will do. Buy this book if you want to a great read and be excited to delve deeper into a fascinating subject. Kudos and much appreciation to Mr. Singh!"},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"The author has done the impossible. He's taken a complex subject and explained it in a clear and often entertaining way. At the same time, he did not oversimplify or water down the material.It has as much information as a textbook, yet I found myself reading it as if it were a novel. If it were possible to give more than 5 stars I'd do it without hesitation."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Mr. Singh has managed again to tell an enthralling tale not just of the history of codes, but of the evolution of code theory and how they have grown together over the past thousand years. This is an extremely well-written text that focuses not just on the history of code making or the theory behind it, but tells both stories at once in a lively and engrossing manner. This book is a true page turner, not just because it is so interesting, but also because it is so educational.The book is laid out in four basic sections, codes before machines, codes with machines before computers, the breaking of &quot;language&quot; codes, and encryption with computers. The first part talks about the earliest basic codes, used by the Romans and Renaissance courts which were conquered with basic frequency analysis and other slightly more elaborate methods. The discussion of mechanized encryption focuses on the cracking of the German Enigma machine in WWII and the situations that led up to it. As always, Mr. Singh tells the essentials of the story in a fast-paced manner while not losing sight of the fundamental analysis and theory behind the work that was done. The third section regarding the cracking of language codes is introduced through WWII Navajo code-talkers, and Mr. Singh then walks us through the decipherment of Egyptian hieroglyphics and the Linear B scripts of ancient Greece. The fourth section discussing encryption in the age of computers is absolutely fascinating. The description of the solving of &quot;key distribution&quot; problems was amazing, and I am happy to now finally understand the importance of large prime numbers with regards to modern data encryption. There is also a brief fifth section, in which the author discusses quantum encryption theory and discusses some of the significant advances that have occurred in this field.There are some astounding themes which resonate throughout this book (1) the amazing co-development that occurred between private and public sector encryption agencies, and the tremendous silence of government agencies as their &quot;secrets&quot; became public knowledge, (2) the methods in which these encryption problems were attacked in an organized fashion, especially during war times, bringing together analytical minds of many different backgrounds, and finally (3) the way in which this teamwork was ultimately trumped through the breakthrough of a single individual who merely saw things differently and digested the problem in a few simple steps. There are many solid lessons about problem solving in this book.Mr. Singh's first book, &quot;Fermat's Enigma&quot; was outstanding. It is amazing to see that he has replicated his success. &quot;The Code Book&quot; is very much worth reading."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This book is a fascinating introduction to the history of cryptography. It is very easy to read, yet still provides sufficient depth for readers to gain a real feel for some of the cryptographic techniques discussed. This book turned my mild interest into true fascination for the subject. I would definitely recommend this to anyone interested in history and/or cryptography."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Absolutely a top class review of history of cryptography, fascinating, very well structured and written. Precise references with clearly described explanations and captivating descriptions of most important ciphers and cryptoanalysts.

The information and examples he presents drive the point home that, when it comes to sensitive information, you can never be too safe. With the proliferation of the Internet, this message is more true than ever. The book's biggest disappointment is that it doesn't always seem to follow logical trains of thought or narration--Mr. Singh gets distracted from his subject easily, and never seems to completely cap off all of his ideas in a satisfactory way. No matter--The Code Book is an engrossing book with vital tips and warnings for just about everyone in the Information Age."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"The Code Book is a wonderful, high level introduction to cryptography, and to some of the women and men who have played a role in code making and breaking throughout history. It is worth reading just for the surprises and human elements that will please almost any reader.It did disappoint me in one way. Singh's assertion, made in the final chapter, that quantum cryptography is absolutely unbreakable jarred my estimation of him. That statement, from a man of science who is well aware of the fate that scientific dogma has met throughout history, was an unfortunate way to end this wonderful book."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Simon Singh's Code Book is a wonderful book. The most obvious joy is how he is able to take a very complicated subject (for me, at any rate) and make it readable, interesting and fun. I was able to understand the workings of codes much better than expected beacuase of his clear explanations and was a only lost when it came to quantum cryptography. Even here, though, Mr. Singh was very able in holding my interest through the way he weaved in the personal stories of the cryptographers. In fact, this book is as much about the cryptographers as it is about crpytography and that, in the end, is the book's marvelous charm. Anyone who can make this subject so entertaining to a non-logical, math-hating reader such as myself has wrought a miracle. A very impressive, highly recommended book."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"An excellent introduction to the world of cryptography. It shows not only the methods cryptography but also the reasons why they were so important. Singh brings out the hidden history of cryptographers and the politics that have surrounded them. The first chapter with Mary, Queen of Scots demonstrates the power of cryptography to save or take lives. The book demonstrates the power of secrets and how cyphers have kept secrets beyond the lifetime of the cryptographers.The book is an easy to read history of cryptography from monoalphabetic cyphers to modern cyphers like PGP. It's an written in a style that accessible to people with little to background in cryptography. _The Code Book_ is an excellent tribute to the men and women who have contributed to the art of cryptography over the centuries, and the genius it has taken to make and break their cyphers."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"The book is absolutely brilliantly written. It has lots of real-life stories starting with a story of the Mary Queen of Scots who was beheaded for using too a weak cipher. Between those stories author explains actual ciphers starting from Julius Caesar's and methods to crack them in the terms understandable by a pedestrian. I tried to explain the simplest ones to my 7-year old and he's got them. Meantime, the appendix J contains concise and clear enough description of the strongest existing RSA algorithm, clear enough to reproduce it. Highly recommend for those interested in history, history of science, math, spy stories, history of computers - this book combines it all."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"I read Singh's Fermat's Enigma and loved it. This book is also great. The text describes in understandable terms the science of cryptography. Examples of what is being described are provided throughout the book. Singh has managed to create a fascinating account of the evolution of cryptology and he shows how significant historical events were effected by the use of codes. Despite the technical content of some of the material, Singh has created an easily readable absorbing book."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This book is an excellent read containing much to interest those who wish to see how cryptology has interacted with history. The author does a good job of setting straight many of the historical misconceptions about episodes involving cryptology. The story of Mary Queen of Scots is well known but the historical context is put across better than by many authors. The evolution of cryptology through the ages is well documented. However, the serious student may find the discussion of cryptanalysis lacking. The story of the breaking of the German Enigma code is covered in detail but other aspects of code breaking are less well covered. The subject is technical but other books such as Kahn's &quot;The Codebreakers&quot; though dated now give a better flavour of the mindset of the cryptanalyst and the fact that a code that seems resistant to brute strength attacks may fall easily to a more subtle attack.Overall a good read and the list of resources is to be commended."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"The author sets up a contest between crytographers and cryptanalysts and shows how this competition has evolved, favoring one side and then the other over the course of hundreds of years. Through anecdotes and details about individual contributors he creates a genuine sense of drama as he shows how codes and ciphers have literally changed the course of history. He also provides enough technical details to allow the reader to appreciate the evolution of cryptology from one &quot;generation&quot; to the next. The most interesting aspect of the book is the insight offered into the minds and perservence of the incredible people who have devised, and broken, seemingly impenetrable encryption schemes. As a computer professional and a very occasional completer of the Sunday Times crossword puzzle, I was awed and humbled."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"A book with yellowish pages, matching cover, and the title \\"The Code Book\\" makes a very appealing strong statement, at least to me!The book presents cryptography to the general public. It may also help specialists interested to know the history behind some of the material they have studied or teaching in cryptography.I felt, when holding this book for the first time that it will provide me with an interesting and a wholesome story behind this intriguing subject. Well, I was right, it did.The author, Simon Singh an avid story teller, has succeeded in bringing the \\"What, Who, How and Why\\" all together in an interesting and enlightening manner. The book consists of eight chapters comprising more than 400 pages with an easy-to-read language. It covers data communication security techniques from the first known methods of scrambling messages (Cryptography) and message hiding techniques (Steganography) to the current state-of-the-art \\"Quantum Cryptography\\".The book contains a large number of figures, tables and pictures of the people involved in coding and code breaking. It presents the tale of communication security by means of very fascinating and enlightening examples and historical facts."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Riveting history of code making and breaking. There is enough explanation of how the processes take place, but not too much. In other words, the details do not drown the flow of this wondeful work. I have learned a lot and gained a healthy paranoia regarding the safety of my own privacy. It is also a wonderful primer to read before delving into Neal Stephenson's &quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"I have thoroughly enjoyed reading this, not only for its fascinating content, but also for the author's superb writing. Additionally, I am having a great time working solutions for the problems he sets at the end! I thoroughly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This book is one of the most highly-rated non-fiction books on Amazon, and for good reason. I won't reiterate the other reviews except to say that the clarity of presentation of complex material is extraordinary. The one caveat is that the book is now ten years old, so you'll need to look for something beyond this to bring you up to the present."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"If you guys have seen David Kahn's Codebreakers, then you must understand that the subject of cryptography is deep in variable and can be seen as one of the genius things occuring in history. However, if you prefer a smaller, quicker read, then this would definitely be it.You'd think that something like this would be boring with all it's mathematical structures and algorithmic matrices, and even confusing at times, but Simon Singh describes his target subject very well. You will learn of the first methods of hiding methods, and several different methods of scrambling a method. You will learn about the DES (Data Encryption Standard), and about the many people that made such things possible. You will understand that there were several political figures in the past that have used ciphers to discover someone planning to conspire against them or planning to assassinate them, and it will even give you some history on the mysterious Beale cipher that supposedly has never been solved because a key was never given, although the man given these papers successfully deciphered one of these papers with the Declaration of Independence.Overall, this book was a very engaging read, an excellent covered subject, and was definitely worth such explanation. I hope in the future when they create the newer and bigger Data Encryption Standard, I'm there to understand how it came about and where it originated from (Maybe being a second version of the RSA cipher (Or in simpler terms the Rivest-Shamin-Adleman cipher))."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"As always Simon Singn takes the reader on a fantastic trip through History. Filled with entertaining stories, puzzles and heroic events, the author skillfully covers the history of secret writing. If you liked his coverage ofFermat's Enigmathen you will definitely enjoy this book.The prose is capturing, deep enough to fascinate technical readers and light enough to just entertain the casual reader. I specialized in Quantum computers while studying Mathematics and I am astonished that the author manages to explain such non-trivial subjects as quantum computers and cryptography to the degree where ordinary readers can actually understand how they work and their impact on ciphers such as RSA/DSA. In short another great read from one of the best and most entertaining technical writers who ever lived."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Simon Singh does a very clever thing. He takes comlex topics and makes them understandable without dumming down the science or math."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"I also read Simon Singh's book on the Fermat theorum, and I think he has an excellent very readable style of writing. He certainly makes code writing very, very interesting. No doubt at all that this is a five star book for me -I'm eagerly awaiting the next topic that Simon tackles.On the really (really) picky side, I would have expected to have seen some more questioning and possible lines of attack on the PGP system -especially after the entire book seems to be devoted to pointing out that after many ciphers were considered unbreakable they were eventually cracked.Hats off to Simon Singh again."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This is written as well as his previous book which became a PBS Nova documentary produced by him. His previous book about Fermat's theorem was on narrative side because of the shere depth of mathmatical understanding required to intepret Andrew Wile's ground breaking paper. I know a math professor who admitted that he didn't understand it at all! Anyway, this one is more technical. That is to say, he gives fairly detailed information on each code. Some of you who are interested in the technical aspects of the code will really enjoy this book. But there are enough interesting stories for those who are not keen on the subject to appreciate this book."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Singh has achieved an awesome feat: to write a book about a heavy weight technical topic that is almost impossible to put down. He portrays the evolution of codes as a struggle between those wanting to ensure privacy of communication (the cryptographer) versus those who want to pry (the cryptanalysts). The ever more complex enciphering and encoding is demonstrated in a very lucid way. Great book, money well spent."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Simon Singh has done a terrific job of making this book insightful for a lay reader as well as to someone who's interested in Mathematics and Cryptography.He traces the history of cryptography and cryptanalysis, in a very engaging settings, begining from Queen Mary of Scott to the modern day information security standards and policies.He has presented the evolution of cryptography, alongside the evolution of mathmatics, languages and techonolgy innovations, in a very naturally fluent manner which puts, an essentially mathematical and academic subject, in an interesting and readable perspective.Singh has also described, in a very thought provoking manner, the role of WWI and WWII, which played a significant role in accelerating the developments in this field.Towards the end, there is a balanced analysis of opposing schools of thoughts, on the free development and use, versus restricted development and monitored use to cryptography.A must for everyone determined to play a role in the emerging information economy."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This is the way I like to read history. I seek out books that span the ages, and this is definitely one of those. I've read so much history over the span of my life that I begin to look for texts that hit the highlights and add detail. The Code Book does just that. It is an exciting book to read even if you know how the battle of Midway was won or that Mary Queen of Scots was beheaded. I highly recomend this book to those who know their history, but enjoy a good yarn!"},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"No, I'm not an aspiring codebreaker, but Singh captured my attention immediately. I was hoping to find a book which described the codemaking and codebreaking processes in an elegant, yet simple, way, and this book delivers! I highly recommend it!"},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This is one of the few books in the last year that I actually couldn't wait to get home from work to finish reading. As a history of Cryptography and how it works it is a good book. But when injected with the effects of Cryptography on all History and short stories about the genesis behind creating and breaking the codes, makes this a fascinating read. Also the book does a great job of explain cryptography without making it to technical. I would tell anyone interested in History, Science, Language, or just a good story to read this book."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"I must admit to some bias, since I am a former cryptanalyst myself (I cracked Captain Midnight's secret code when I was 12 years old--that was the beginning and end of my career--and I was delighted to see a picture of the Code-o-Graph which I never had to order, in Singh's new book). The Code Book is every bit as fascinating as Fermat's Enigma, and it was a treasure-trove of annecdotes which spiced my conversation every day while I was reading it, such as Churchill's inadvertent encouragement of the German military to adopt Scherbius' new Enigma machine by describing in one of his books how the British had broken German codes during WW I, a fact of which Germany was unaware until then."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This is the most interesting, and entertaining book; fiction, or non-fiction book that I've read in a long time. I plowed through it in about 5 hours of reading across a couple days. The blend of history, technology, and narrative is excellent. Even computer neophytes should find the material fun to read and tractable. The chapter on cracking Enigma is simply fabulous. It gives you a healthy respect for the intellectual giants from whom we derive most anything related to the modern computer."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This is one of those rare books which you can open at any page and find something which keeps you reading on. Particular good is its explanation of Turing's technique for breaking Enigma. It also explains a few loose ends from recent TV programs on Bletchley Park. For example, why sink all 9 U boat supply ships whose position was revealed by Enigma decrypts and so arouse German suspicions? In fact the Admiralty only intended to sink seven, but other destroyers unconnected with the operation came across the other two independently. Each chapter has up to date coverage and lucid explanations, which leave you believing you know a bit about the Navajo language or quantum computers."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"\\"The Code Book: The Evolution of Secrecy from Mary Queen of Scots to Quantum Cryptography\\" by Simon Singh is a wonderful book about the history of code-making and code-breaking. What is most impressive about Singh is he is able to take the most complicated mathematical information (in my opinion) and explain it in layman's terms. Another more suitable name for \\"The Code Book could be Code-Making and Code-Breaking for Dummies: A Historical Perspective\\". Singh covers the history of encryption, tracing its evolution throughout time and outlining the impact cryptography and cryptanalysis has had on the world. World War II, the Enigma machine and how the fate of the world rested upon whether or not secret knowledge would fall into enemy hands, is discussed in great detail. From Singh's perspective, it would seem that the outcome of all military battles could be pre-determined by who had employed better cryptanalysis, as the most powerful weapon, is secrecy. Personally, what interested me most about \\"The Code Book\\" is its discussion about the Navajo Code Talkers, hieroglyphics, Linear B, and quantum cryptography. I also thoroughly enjoyed the author's humor and wit, ability to break things down so that a non-technological mind could grasp some of the most complicated of codes and his affinity for making the personalities who discovered the codes as well as the personalities who broke the codes, come to life. I would highly recommend \\"The Code Book\\" to anyone who is interested in cryptography, cryptanalysis, security, telecommunications, math, science, history or simply a good read."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This is one of the best examples of popular applied science I have ever read. An excellent, brilliantly written, fast-paced page-turner. From the basics of frequency analysis it leads the reader to the complexities of quantum cryptography - never letting us down, always trying to explain the most difficult scientific and technical concepts in the most accessible way. The detours to natural languages (alive, as in the case with the Navajo code talkers, or dead, as with Middle Egyptian and Linear B) provide excellent background for the main theme of the book.With my background in history and linguistics, I found the book very sound from the academic standpoint - given my limited knowledge, of course. However, the author has an uneasy relationship with all things Russian - whenever he touches the subject, it's a blunder. The Russian alphabet has 32 or 33 letters (depending on whether you count an optional one), but definitely not 36; Gorbachov came to power in 1985, not '89; if Yeltsin would have shelled the Latvian parliament in 1993, that would have been a full-blown international conflict; instead, he shelled his very own Russian parliament (whether with justification or not, I am not going to discuss here).Otherwise - a tour de force."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"THE CODE BOOK is a beatuful overview of the history of cryptography. The book takes the reader from the simple ciphers of history (this is where Mary Queen of Scots comes in, but I thought that story was fairly far in the background), through the fairly radical improvements of the rennaisance, and truly shines in the discussion of the WWII Enigma machine and the truly amazing response of the English decoding aparatus. It appears that much material only recently became declassified, allowing Singh to discuss Enigma and the English code-breaking operation. Finally, Singh gets to the efforts to produce computer cryptography and the recent innovations that culminate in the &quot;public key&quot; encryption and the controversy over the PGP (pretty good privacy) program. This book was so exciting that I could not put it down. It is easy to read--no math in the text and plenty of appendicces with the formulas--yet reveals so much. On top of the beautiful exposition on cryptography, Singh also visits the public policy conflicts between national security and privacy. Not that those have any easy answers, but the conflict is very palpable."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"I read the book from cover to cover in one sitting and then eagerly dashed to the website to learn more about the cipher challenge that author Singh poses to those of us who think, gee this seems easy, I could take a crack at it. From Egyptian hieroglyphics to Elizabethan intrigue to modern-day Internet encryption, the book eloquently covers the ways in which humans have used codes and ciphers to conquer and cover up their activities. While I was vaguely aware of the Rosetta Stone and the role of Navajo codetalkers during the War, the book made me realize how complex the field is and how slow the progress has been over centuries to refine and evolve these secretive methods of communication. Singh's style is never stuffy or dry. I will be sure to read Fermat's Last Theorem."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Simon Singh has written another great book (after Fermat's Enigma). He presents a detailed and interesting history of cryptography. Stories and anecdotes make for nice diversions, although there were a couple of instances where the book seemed to stray. The code challenge at the end of the book is a nice touch, allowing the reader to apply his/her code-breaking skills using information presented in the book."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"I tried reading Cryptonomicon. Hated it. I tried this book. Couldn't put it down. Singh is a tremendous writer who takes a fascinating yet challenging topic and makes it understandable to all. This is a MUST READ for anyone interested in crypto."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"As a quantum cryptographer I was delighted to find so clear and accurate an exposition of my field. I may actually have to start using that chapter for my Doctorate students. The rest of the book, which I thought would interest me less, in fact was fascinating."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Singh has provided the reader a delightful history of encryption, beginning with 16th-century codes, proceeding with the mechanized ones, and concluding with modern computer-based systems. He points out how modern encryption is being used to thwart the counterfeiting of dollars, and rejects the so-called Bible Code.Singh also touches on the intricacies of language, and discusses the difficulty of deciphering the Egyptian hieroglyphics. This involved the decoding of a language that no one speaks today, and one which has no close relatives among modern languages. He also has a fascinating account of the Navajo Indians and their unique language, and how their conversations were used to keep the Japanese in the dark during WWII.When in comes to the German ENIGMA code of WWII, and in contrast to some English-language books on this subject, Singh gives credit squarely where it is due. He traces the Polish successes with code-breaking, beginning with the cracking of Russian codes by the Biuro Szyfrow (the Bureau of Ciphers) during the 1920 Polish-Bolshevik War (p. 144). In the years before WWII, a Polish team of mathematicians headed by Marian Rejewski recognizably solved the ENIGMA (p. 155). The Poles were ten years ahead of anyone else in this field (p. 160). The later successes of the British at Bletchley relied on Rejewski's work (p. 170), and followed the lead of the Poles (p. 243). Alan Turing followed Rejewski's strategy (p. 171)."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This book is a wonderful blend of technical writing with allied history, story telling and myth. The author traces the evolution of code making and code breaking from historical times with interesting stories regarding their development and usage and the great minds who were behind the codes.The author has a flair of explaining technical stuff to lay people. It was a pleasure to read through the technical details of codes right from the Vignerre cipher right upto RSA. There is even a chapter on decryption of Egyptian hieroglyphics and other lost languages, even though technically they are not codes (since they were not used to hide information). I loved the description of the German code machine used in WW2 and how it was broken, quite ingeniously, by Polish and British cryptoanalysts. There are even some exercises for budding cryptoanalysts.In summary, this book gets a wholehearted thumbs up and I now plan to read other books of the same author."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Frankly speaking, I got interested in cryptography after reading \\"The Da Vinci Code\\"; and so I \\"set upon\\" a task to master as much of Cryptography as possible. I was seaching for cyptography books on Amazon.com and none of the books seemed to suite me. Some of them were either too complex for an amateur or too costly for a student like me, until I came across this masterpiece. Although the cover of the book does not justice to the quality of writing Simon Singh has produced, this is without doubt one of the best books for amatuer \\"budding\\" cryptographers.Without baffling the reader with technical terms and complex words, Simon Singh has made the apparently \\"complex\\" Code-Book surprisingly readable and that's where the genius of this man lies. This book makes for a wonderful read if you're new to the world of Cryptography. This book virtually traces the entire evolution of codes from the time of Mary Queen Of Scotts to modern day computer cryptography and Quantum Computers of the future. Although at first sight the book might seem \\"incomprehensible\\", everything in the book is so well explained that even a ten year old can get it. And once you do, I bet you'll start preparing your own codes, encrypting your name maybe!Anyway, from the first page of the book you tend to get the true essence of what codes meant to people since the beginning of civilisation. The \\"steganographic\\" techiniques, the \\"Caesar's cipher\\" and so many others and everything is so deftly explained!Overall I would say, you won't lose a penny if you buy this book."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Before Singh's &quot;Code Book&quot; came on the scene, the only other book I knew about is Kahn's &quot;Codebreakers&quot;. I don't have the time to read such a large text as Kahn's book, so I was very pleased when this book became available.Singh has done a very nice job of demonstrating how deep an impact cryptography has on history. He opens the book by recounting Mary Queen of Scots' conspiracy to have Queen Elizabeth murdered and how she attempted to use encryption to cloak her intentions. It was a very exciting way to open the book.Singh has found the right combination of technical detail, historical detail, and character development.Singh's explanation of how the German WWII Enigma functioned is exceptional. He made it very easy (and fun) to understand.Singh's last chapter is also very neat on the subject of quantum cryptography. Though I have a BS in computer science, I'm no physics genius and Singh did a nice job of making (what I consider) difficult physics concepts easy to understand and of showing how they can be applied to modern cryptography.Although I don't know a thing about &quot;Fermat's last theorem&quot;, I've been so pleased with Singh's writing style that I'm considering reading that book also just to see what it is all about.If you like codes/ciphers and want to read about their impact on history without reading a thousand pages then get this book. You'll be happy you did."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Mr. Singh traces the history of cryptography from its recorded inception in roman times up through current applications. While all of the chapters held my interest it was Mr. Singh's work in chapters 4 through 6 that I feel deserve particular note.Chapter 4 deals with the war effort at Bletchley Park and the work on the Engima machine. Here Mr.Singh adds an additional dimension by providing some insight into the work of Alan Turning, the development of Colossus, the first (now reported) electronic programmable computer and the unrecognized cryptanalysts who broke Ultra and the other codes of WWII. Chapter 6 brings us up to present day cryptographic issues from RSA and PGP to philosophical issues of personal privacy in modern society with web centric commerce and online book reviews. At each step in the process Singh successfully combines the elements of a technical treatise with a human values and features. For those wanting to go a little further under the hood and look at the processes and algorithms in some of the codes mentioned in the text, several appendices at the end of the book should fill that yearning. I found the book informative and enjoyable to read."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"It took me a while to finding to the time to read this because I was expecting a rather dry book on cryptography. The subject was somewhat interesting to me, but I didn't feel like plodding through a long book on the subject.Once I started reading I realized The Code Book was totally different. Singh takes you on a tour of the history of cryptography through the history of the world. You will find that cryptography was an unexpected key element in several historical events.Through the entire history, Singh's writing is exceptionally clear and easy to follow. The material in the book is accessible to all levels of reader -- even those with no knowledge of cryptography."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"If you like to read about how secrets, the protection of and the finding out, have affected and altered the course of history, this is a fun book to read. If you're interested in a very good, enjoyable overview of the history of secrets, this is a good book.Ultimately, though, it's light. The history of cryptography is enormous, and a book this size can only summarize. If you're into the history, then The Codebreakers by David Kahn is the more definitive work.If you're more interested in the personal stories of people involved with code making or breaking, there are some excellent works, such as Between Silk and Cyanide by Leo Marks, which give you more detail of particular people or times.If you're interested in modern-day issues with computer security and encryption, Bruce Schneier has written two outstanding books, one for the programmer and one for the layman, detailing modern cryptographic techniques and security issues.And if you're interested in a gripping fictional work, they don't come better than The Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson.That's not to take away from Singh's book at all. It's extremely enjoyable, and it was a perfect vacation read for me. If you're not seriously into cryptography the way I am, you might not find the above books interesting, but find Singh absolutely fascinating. Recommended to anyone."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Not really in any substantive sense a history of cryptography, this book gives one very much the same feeling as if watching a well done television documentary. This is not particularly surprising, as the author works on programs such as PBS' &quot;Nova&quot; in his day job. This makes the book an easy and pleasant read, but it chooses its focus rather oddly, often emphasizing persons and events out of all logical proportion to their real historical significance. In fairness, the author does concede that he is not attempting to write a history of cryptography, as that has already been done comprehensively by others, especially David Kahn (&quot;The Codebreakers,&quot; recently reprinted). While Americans are given inappropriately little attention until the chapter on public-key cryptography -- I think William F. Friedman is mentioned once in passing, and Herbert O. Yardley perhaps twice -- the selection of subject matter is a refreshing change from the usual stories that are rehashed over and over in most books on cryptography. It is particularly nice to see the British WWII cryptanalytic efforts at Bletchley Park being given their due, since Bletchley's people such as Alan Turing and Tommy Flowers have had to suffer from their work being kept secret until several years after Kahn's and most of the other principal histories had been written. The acknowledgement of the early Polish effort with German Enigma which made the British effort possible is also comparatively rare, again mostly because of the secrecy which until recently surrounded the matter, but it is likewise long overdue. I was also pleased to see the chapter on the decipherment of Cretan Linear B, which the late Otto Neugebauer -- probably then the world's leading expert on Babylonian Cuneiform and no slouch himself -- told me made his work look like &quot;child's play.&quot; (Neugebauer's popular &quot;The Exact Sciences in Antiquity&quot; is still in print, too.) It would have been nice to see some discussion about the success with which cryptanalytic techniques similar to those used in connection with Linear B have been applied within just the last few years to Mayan inscriptions, but one cannot have everything. The tie-in between Linear B and Navajo &quot;code talkers,&quot; both of which depended upon cultural influences, was a most unusual perspective. Interestingly, there is some hint at the same basic issue in connection with Judaism, where Martin Hellman's experiences with anti-semitism are discussed and it is noted that the critical insight which led to the RSA cryptographic system occurred immediately following a Passover seder where Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir, and Leonard Adelman were all present together. Ultimately, the approach of the book is, in &quot;human drama&quot; television documentary style, to choose some story or person as respresentative of each aspect of cryptography in history, including some of world-making historical importance such as the execution of Mary Queen of Scots or the breaking of German ciphers in WWII, some of great importance within their field such as the work on Linear B, and some of entirely marginal importance other than as curiositis such as the Beale letters. The technical explanations of cryptographic systems such as the Vignere Cipher are excellent and should be clear to anyone, and are much better done than in the average book on the subject. Where the explanation would be so involved as to be distracting to the reader, the technical issues are relegated to one of the many appendices as is appropriate. Even the discussions of speculative techniques such as quantum-state transmission are relatively easy to follow. Overall, I cannot recommend this book as a serious history of the subject -- read Kahn for that -- but it is a fun and entertaining read for someone knowledgable and a respectable introduction for anyone else fascinated with cryptography and cryptanalysis."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"As a mathematician in the early 1970s, I saw many advertisements recruiting mathematicians for the CIA. I knew that it had to do with cryptography and number theory but it was all very mysterious and since I never got a job with them I didn't see precisely how the disciplines fit together. As Singh describes the discover of the RSA coding system it all becomes very clear.The story he tells is particularly interesting because it starts with the ancient Romans and the decoding of the conspiracy messages of Mary Queen of Scots in Elizabethian England.Singh also wrote an very interesting account in layman's terms of the discoveries that led to the proof of Fermat's last theorem. That skill is also demonstrated in this book where the key concepts of cryptgraphy are discussed as they were developed through history. The uses of cryptography in World War I and World War II are brought out. We learn of the men in England at Bletchley Park who were able to decypher the German Enigma Machine and play a major role in the latter success of the allies. The gain of information from the U boats enabled the Americans to transport supplies and soldiers to Europe to fight the war. The U boats were very successful at destroying American ships prior to the breaking of the code.It is interesting that after the war the academic community in the United States solved the problem of key passing for computer networks and developed the RSA code. These discovery were developed earlier and independently in England at their secret agency the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) based on the unheralded ideas of James Ellis. Their work was kept secret until the late 1990s when their achievements were finally brought to light.The book also discusses the archaeological work on the Rosetta Stone and Linear B. This work uncovered the meaning of the hieroglyphics and showed that the Minoans language was a form of Greek. The techniques were very much akin to deciphering code.Also of interest is the Navajo code talkers who used their language as an unbreakable code during the war in the Pacific in World War II.Recent developments and conjectures about future breakthroughs are discussed in the last few chapters. The book provides very useful information about other books and interesting web sites including one that allows you to download Zimmerman's Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) which provides RSA level security."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This book has many fascinating and important stories to tell, and some of them are told remarkably well. Still, if you're expecting \\"The Code Book\\" to be as compelling or well-fashioned as Singh's thoroughly absorbing \\"Fermat's Enigma,\\" you will likely be disappointed. Which is not to say it's a waste of time. \\"The Code Book\\" demonstrates Singh's ability to bring historical characters and events to life, sometimes to great effect. And it covers a respectable amount of territory. That said, I think Singh can do better, and I hope one day he decides to revisit this one and work it over a bit.I have three main issues with the book.First, Singh glosses over or completely ignores significant details. For example, while he expertly tells the story of Mary Queen of Scots, he forgets to address one crucial question: How did Mary and her scheming cohorts agree upon a key for their cryptography? The way Singh tells the story, it seems impossible for them to have established a secret key, for their correspondence was intercepted from the start. Those reading their encrypted messages would already have had the key. Yet, Singh's narrative relies on there having been a secret key, because he makes a big deal about when and how their cipher was broken. So how was the secret key established? Singh doesn't say. This simple omission makes Singh's otherwise well-told story deeply problematic. Another example: Singh does not explain the Enigma machine very well, leaving out many details which could have at least been relegated to another appendix. The book has ten appendices already. What's one more?Second, Singh is inconsistent at times. It often feels like he didn't have the time or patience to carefully organize his thoughts. To take one example, he believes that quantum cryptography is absolutely secure, because it cannot be broken even in theory; yet, he also notes that there are ways of intercepting messages before they are encrypted (for example, by reading electromagnetic signals from a computer as its keys are being struck). The logical conclusion is that no form of encryption can guarantee absolute privacy, even if it is theoretically unbreakable. Yet, Singh suggests that global quantum encryption could mean the end of privacy and thus of civilization as we know it. This could be a case of choosing drama over accuracy, or it could just be the result of sloppy thinking. Either way, it's annoying.Lastly, Singh feels the need to spell out a good many concepts repeatedly, in excruciatingly simple detail. This might be necessary for a small percentage of his readers, but I found it mind-numbing. Eventually I decided to completely skip over paragraphs that began with the words, \\"To understand this more clearly . . .\\" or anything of that sort.All in all, I'm not sorry I read this book, and I would not discourage most people from reading it--especially those looking for a very basic introduction to the history of codes and ciphers. To his credit, Singh explains at the outset that this is not meant to be a comprehensive treatment of its subject. Yet, I cannot help but think that he could have done a better job if only he (and his editors) spent a little more time on it. A revised edition is in order, in which the flaws in the original are corrected, and in which the present (and future) of codes and ciphers is given an update."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"The Code Book, Simon Singh's introduction to the race between cryptologists and cryptanalists, code-makers and code-breakers, is probably one of the most pleasant popular science reads of the year.The first chapter starts with the description of the monoalphabetic substitution ciphers, its failure and the consequence of the latter, the execution of Mary Queen of Scots. From then we proceed to polyalphabetic ciphers, the Vigenere Cipher and the Babbage's method of breaking it; as an added bonus Singh has thrown in the three Beale papers, allegedly leading to over a ton of gold buried in the hills of Virginia. The third chapter describes the path Germans made between the world wars, from the Zimmerman note disaster to the construction of Enigma. Closely related to it is the next chapter, a story about the Poles and the Brits cracking Enigma.The fifth chapter is a step aside: on deciphering texts that are not purposely encrypted, but simply written in extinct languages and scripts, like Egyptian hieroglyphics or Minoan Linear B script. From then on, we are probably already on the more familiar territory; the discovery and re-discovery of public key cryptography, and its application in Phil Zimmerman's PGP. The last chapter tries to provide a peek into the future: quantum computers that can break currently uncrackable codes in linear time, and quantum encryption, which cannot be broken without violating the laws of physics.Apart from the Beale treasure papers, Singh added another gem for aspiring cryptanalists: they can test what they have learned with ten ciphertexts in the appendix, and the author promised to pay 10.000 GBP to the first one who solves all of them. And Singh proved to be a good teacher: to date, nine stages out of ten are solved already (the last one involves a massive amount of CPU time).True, David Kahn's Codebreakers contains a more exhaustive treatment of the historic development of cryptography, and Bruce Schneier's Applied Cryptography will provide you with a knowledge needed by a working specialist. However, if you share just a casual interest in the area, this is the book for you. It's much more than just stories about people involved in the cryptography and other related trivia - you will be surprised that Singh's lucid explanations will actually make you understand how the algorithms work."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"The fine popular science writer Simon Singh (author of _Fermat's Enigma_, about the proving of Fermat's Last &quot;Theorem&quot;) has just put out _The Code Book_, a quick survey of the basics of cryptography from a historical perspective.Singh's book is an enjoyable and well-done overview of the basics of cryptography. He begins with a story about how Mary Queen of Scots was doomed because her crypto was bad, and continues up to the present day. He describes the 16th Century French Vigenere cipher, World War I cryptography, including the Zimmerman telegram, and lots of detail about Enigma. There is a fascinating side branch into the related issue of deciphering ancient languages. He does a good job describing the Rosetta Stone and the work in deciphering that, and a good job discussing Linear B. The concluding chapters discuss computer based cryptography, particularly the Data Encryption Standard, Public-key Cryptography, the RSA algorithm, and Pretty Good Privacy. I was a bit disappointed in the final chapter, on Quantum Cryptography, which didn't explain things as clearly as I would have liked. Their is also a set of ciphers in the back, and a contest for readers to try to decode them.Singh does a good job describing the characters involved, in the best tradition of popular science. And though I've known a bit about this subject for some time, he still taught me lots of new stuff. I was particularly surprised to learn that British researchers had invented both Public-key Cryptography and an equivalent to RSA several years before the more famous inventor, but that the British government had classified their work, denying the researchers credit for their discoveries.This is a sound, entertaining, and informative introduction to the basics of cryptography."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"A combination of easy-to-understand explanations, history, suspense, and just plain fun made this the best history book I've ever read. Singh starts with Mary Queen of Scots and her fumbled plot to kill Queen Elizabeth. The history behind the plot was explained, and then he back-tracked all the way to the fifth century b.c. to give us an idea of where it all started from in documented history. The author's style of creating suspense surrounding a particular event and then giving you history on that event before he tells you the outcome was an excellent way to keep a non history buff glued to the pages.The characters were well written within the history. Instead of falling asleep to a list of names and dates, I was saddened to read of the fate of Alan Turing when they discovered his secret, all fired up about the buried treasure surrounding the Beale Papers, and laughing at the quandry of the poor Navajos who were 'captured' by Americans who mistook them for Japanese spies.The other high quality aspect was the cryptography explanations. Never having known much about cryptography beyond the absolute basics behind Enigma, I found it extremely easy to understand his explanations of how this or that cypher worked, and how historical figures went about cracking them. Even his explanations of how Enigma worked were simple to comprehend. Based on his explanations I'm confident I could create coded messages myself - maybe even decipher one!It probably has a lot more to do with my ignorance of Egyptology than the authors explanations, but the only portion of the book I didn't like was the explanation of how the hieroglyphs were deciphered. The explanations themselves were clear, but it seemed to me there were some assumptions made about why people in ancient Egypt did certain things that just seemed a bit off to me. The author was clear enough and accurate enough about everything else that I'm assuming the fault is mine, and I'll be reading some Egyptian history sometime soon."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"mr singh's exposition of the history of secret codes and their cracking is ambitiously aimed squarely at the popular market and hits right on target with a tight, enjoyable, instructive and readable book. well done!"},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"I really enjoyed this book because it blended history and science in such a provacative way.Is this book better than _The Codebreakers_ by Kahn?

The Code Book is a historical book with a mathematical bent, in which the author goes out of his way to make sure the reader understands what he is talking about. It piqued my interest to see that this particular book did not confine itself to the twentieth century, but rather searched for the development of codes as civilization and military intrigue demanded them. It was always a little surprising to find out why some codes are so easily understood by some people, and yet others with good backgrounds could not see the key, even if it was dangling right in front of them. Not only is the history of code-work interesting, but the type of people involved in development or breakdown of codes. It seemed like you could almost profile the type of persons who were going to be successful at this type of stuff. For a book that is way out of my field, this was really interesting and enjoyable.

It bored me then. I'm glad I stuck through that minor hump this time around; this is an engrossing, fascinating book about cryptography's role in history.Singh begins the history with Mary Queen of Scots and how she used a cipher to encrypt letters to her cohorts to plan the assasination of the Queen of England. Besides learning a lot of history, Singh describes the ciphers used in an easy to follow manner, using lots of useful examples.For those with a computer science background, the book gets really interesting about two-thirds of the way in, when computers come into play for breaking codes developed during World War II. The history of DES, RSA and PGP are compelling, especially when you already know about those standards but didn't know the history of them; and the author describes how all are implemented in layman terms; it is easy to follow if you know little mathematics, although it will make the programmer in you want to start coding the algorithms he describes.The author has published a less technical version of the book: The Code Book for Young People: How to Make It, Break It, Hack It, Crack It.I picked up this book because I read the author's previous book, Fermat's Enigma, which is a lot more technical than The Code Book, but it's an interesting tale nevertheless; non-technical readers can skip the meaningless stuff.

I rate it at 5 stars out of 5."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This is the second book by Simon Singh, and he readily admits that he was surprised by the success of the first; \`Fermat's Last Theorem'. If you enjoyed that, then this will delight and entertain you, as well as lead you forward in an easy manner. There are some very complex ideas and processes encountered, yet each is tackled not as a whole, but as a series of small steps, explained in simple terms. It seems that the author subscribes to the notion that there is no such thing as a hard subject - the only hard part is the number of simple steps that are used, and the order they are combined, in order to reach the complex picture.Singh states from the beginning that the book has two aims; to chart the evolution of codes, and to show that the study of codes and cryptology is as relevant for today as ever. Information always has had a high value, and there have been divers means employed throughout history to keep matters private where appropriate. The reasons for this secrecy are not always the same, but whether it is political, military, security or commercial, organisations and governments want to know that their information is safe, and at the same time strive to read similar matter from opponents. The history of codes and code breaking has been a struggle between the code makers, and the code breakers, with sometimes one and sometimes the other having the ascendancy. Sometimes intrigue and espionage have enabled a foothold to be gained to enable code breaking to continue.The early use of codes and ciphers are explained well, and the author uses imaginative illustrations to convey his ideas. The chapters on modern developments, with private and public keys, for example, are brought to life with the example of mixing the colours of private paint stores. A mental picture is much better than mere words to describe the one-way functions that are used in encrypting and deciphering messages using public and private keys. It is also necessary to understand some of the early developments in code making and code breaking to grasp what happened at Bletchley Park, in the breaking of the Enigma codes during World War II. Singh admits to simplifying the Enigma story, but this does not detract from a particularly absorbing part of the book. There is also good list of books and web sites, for those wishing to gain more information. This applies to many of the code stories, whether this is from archaeology (the Rosetta Stone, or Linear B), or the actual use of encryption (the Zimmermann telegram, Pretty Good Privacy).\`The Code Book' was published prior to the events of September 11th 2001, but asks some pertinent questions on the nature of security. Just as code breaking and code making have been battling for many years, now that there are \`unbreakable codes' available, the debate has moved on to the need for security or the protection of individual freedoms. It is believed that the Data Encryption Standard (DES) was weakened to enable this to be broken by US government agencies. This book is not just a popular and populist history; it also raises questions that are relevant to us all. That is why the second of Singh's aims has been met. The first is achieved in a hugely entertaining read.Incidentally, the cipher challenge is still an integral part of the book, although the prize is no longer available. It took 1 year and 1 month for the challenge to be successfully claimed, a tribute to the difficulty of the ten parts. If you have read the book, and have a few idle moments, perhaps you would like to try to crack the Beale ciphers and claim the huge cache of gold and silver that the documents describe. Oh, and when you have finished that, there is always the breakthrough that is waited for Linear A.Peter Morgan, morganp@supanet.com"},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"This book is truly an achievement! SimonSingh takes up a seemingly esoteric, difficult, mysterious, exhaustive subject of Cryptography (or in simple terms Coding and decoding) and backed up by exhaustive research , he has written an engrossing book; The 400page read is a fascinating journey for the reader. The journey spans a broad range and time period. The hallmark of this book apart from the wealth of information it has, is the facile style of writing of SimonSingh which doesn't smother the lay reader with verbiage or technicalities; The structure of chapters is period wise, starting with the basic codes used during the middle ages, with the advancement of monoalphabetic ciphers and then polyalphabetic ciphers (including the vignere ciphers); then the automation of ciphers which happened during WWII with the famous Enigma machine; Then comes the intresting phase of cat and mouse game between the cryptographers and cryptoanalysts, which has always happened, but took a intense phase during the WWII, primarily between the camp at BletchleyPark,London (which housed a motley crowd ranging from Mathematicians to Linguists, all in a hectic pursuit to break the German code) and the Germans. The simple explanation behind the logic of Enigma is a demonstration of SimonS's ability to express the technical in the simplest of terms.I found the description and concept of DES , the breakthrough of asymmetric ciphers , the concept of public key and Private keys, digital signatures especially illuminating.The background leading to the development of PGP by Zimmerman and its features is an highlight and very topical. Next time I buy anything from the Web, i will appreciate the technology of security which happens in the backend;The politics of encryption between the camps for free speech vs Government control is fascinating and becomes all the more urgent in the light of 9/11 and Govt attempts to curtail and control.Even if you have a passing intrest in science, you will find this book worthwhile to spend time on .

This is a book aimed at the layperson who has some interest in mathematics and linguistics. He mixes the science behind codes and cyphers with a stronhg dose of history, which puts the amazing achievements in this science in the context of changing human history.The history in the book ranges from Roman codes through the middle ages and finally arriving to the 2nd world war and the Enigma machine. Not only is the history told in great detail, but also with some attention the reader understands exactly the process that was taken to arrive at the cyphers and their breaking. An addition portion of history told is that of the decyphering of hieroglyphics and Linear B, ancient forms of writing on which some of the tools of cryptology (especially mathematics and linguistics) were used.Simon Singh uses a formula similar to the one he uses in Fermat's Enigma (another outstanding book for amateur mathematicians): he tells a story on a subject that is tremendously complex, but makes it simple enough so that someone who is dedicated to understanding it can at least grasp the main concepts.This is a great book for amateur mathematicians, statisticians and linguists.

A second reading of the public key cryptography related chapters confirmed this impression. Why so? The rhythm of the sequences. Picture the following sequence of events. A narration consisting of a brief introduction to a central figure is given, followed by an interview with that figure. The interview captures some emotion re. the critical time of \\"discovery,\\" and invites some questions re. the nature of the problem the figure faced. The narrator steps in again and explains what the problem means and implicates. A momentary lapse at the apex of achievement. Enter the party that builds upon the results of the initial figure, another interview with that party, and so on.I enjoyed the Triumph of the Nerds very much and also this book. Just as Cringely had, the author possesses a fine pedagogic instinct for technical matters, and definitely understands how to \\"herd\\" the crowd. He has made interesting a topic that may have been too technical for lay readers. I was so enthralled by this book at my time of reading that upon finishing it I immediately went out to purchase his other book, \\"Fermat's Last Theorem\\" (Singh's formula didn't quite work there, perhaps because there weren't enough contemporary parties to throw interviews at -- thus losing the dynamism present in this book -- but that's a different story).This much said, a word of caution. This is after all a pop science book, light reading. It is difficult to imagine how a chapter about public key cryptography can be written without mentioning certificate authorities or hashing, but here is one.Sit back, relax, and enjoy. This may very well be the pop science book of the decade."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"Simon Singh can describe tails of drama, history, and common mathematical sense into a great book. While most people take cryptography for granted, Singh provides historical and simple examples to illustrate it's importance to mathematics and history. He details it's use in wars, especially World War 2, and commerce. He even delves into the political ramifications of strong versus weak encryption when discussing PGP.Singh also provides easy to understand ways on how encryption works and even more intriguing, how to break it. He shows how all various encryption algorithms are done, and then how code breakers can decipher them, both in practical and historical consequences.In the end, he even provides a challenge for would be decipherers out there. Granted, it's already been solved, it's still education and exciting that he offered a considerable amount of money for this challenge....All in all, it's a fascinating book that will capture anyone's imagination, even if they hate history or math."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"I haven't read all this book, just the chapter on linear b. After having read the other two books on the decipherment of linear b, I thought this book added something and clarified some things. It made it clear for me finally, how the chart of symbols which appeared to share consonants or vowels was begun and developed, and then how the initial foray into actual translation with names of towns unlocked the power of the chart. Each book on this story has its own value, including this one."},{"Title":"Code Book: The Science of Secrecy from Ancient Egypt to Quantum Cryptography","review":"the educational writing of the author was simple to comprehend and was well delivered. the book contains multiple diagrams, pictures, and examples of dozens of codes and ciphers, all of which aided in understanding the material. the appendices in the back also gave great explanations of crytographic technique. this is definitely a book to read for all the nonfictions readers out there."},{"Title":"This Week I Married John Wayne Bobbitt: Extraordinary Stories about an Ordinary Life","review":"A distinction should be made between the persona described in memoir and the author of that memoir. Although they may seem to be one and the same person, they are not, and here is why. A memoir or an autobiography is an attempt to put down in writing one's life and to do so in a more or less nonfictional way. However, in addition to the inevitable lapses in recollection, it is psychologically impossible to be objective about one's life. What we always have is an interpretation of a life. Not only that, but autobiographers always lie.I know to some people that may seem a startling statement; nonetheless it is true. Sometimes they lie by omission, sometimes by coloration, sometimes inadvertently, and sometimes deliberately. Finally, it takes a writer of unusual skill to actually capture herself on paper.Dottie Brewer is not without skill, and with a title like \\"This Week I Married John Wayne Bobbitt\\" one would expect a humorous book. There are some chuckles here, but most of them are unintentional, and I am afraid that the laugh is mostly on the lady herself, although I don't think she really minds. However if she had played this more deliberately for laughs, I think it would have been a better book.But what Dottie Brewer is about in this pop culture, self-help/inspirational, New Age-ish memoir is a justification for the many ups and downs and misadventures of her life including the matrimonial ones. John Wayne Bobbitt, he of the missing...uh, anatomy, was husband number four for the energetic Ms. Brewer, and failure number four as well. One gets the sense that the star of this memoir is the kind of person who will try almost anything--at least once. But to her credit she is also the kind of person who senses when things are not working out and is able to move on. And move on she does, from husbands, from careers, and from friends. This book is her latest enterprise, it along with her optimistically named publishing company, \\"Billion $ Baby Publications.\\"She describes experiences and attempts to explain why they happened. Some of her interpretations left me a bit astonished, as when she \\"channeled\\" an \\"A\\" on an essay exam that she hadn't studied for, or when she gave her guardian angels credit for the fact that the driver's side was locked when some teenagers with knives approached her car. (The passenger's side was not.)I have known a few people like the ever-ambitious Ms. Brewer. They tend toward the adventurous and the impulsive, their lives filled with both excessive triumphs and excessive disasters. But they always manage to land on their feet. For Dottie Brewer this cat-like ability apparently comes from those angels that look out for her and because of her communication with \\"the Masters of the Universe\\" along with imbibing ideas from the self-help literature of the popular culture--sprinkled liberally throughout the book, e.g., \\"things do not equal happiness\\"; \\"if it isn't easy, you aren't doing it right\\"; \\"knowledge equals power\\"; etc.What she does very well here is make her life interesting to the reader by perhaps revealing more of herself than she realizes. Her prose is chatty and moves right along. I read the book in an hour or so and was not put off by some of the typos (she twice has \\"breath\\" when she means \\"breathe\\") or the sometimes ungrammatical constructions (for example, she apparently thinks the nominative \\"I\\" should follow the preposition \\"between\\") or confusing Plato with Socrates (p. 29). The fact that she is always able to find something positive, some lesson, some measure of growth from even the most disagreeable experience is also to her credit.What she doesn't do so well is convince--this reader at least--that she has any kind of consistent understanding of who she is and how she should conduct her life. I got the sense that sometimes she just lived from day to day, and at other times she had delusive ideas about love and happiness causing her to pursue exactly the wrong sort of partner or friend.Her misadventure with fidelity-challenged Mr. Bobbitt is a case in point. Nine years his senior, Brewer claims that she fell in love with his boyish charm. However in the aftermath of their relationship she notes that one of the things that she got from him was the title for this book! Yes, Brewer knows that the surest road to literary success is through celebrity. Book publishers are loath to take a chance on a new writer, but if the writer has built-in publicity, then a lot of the gamble is taken out of the publication. Here however, Brewer is doing her own publishing. I think she would have been better off with a professional editor and a mainstream publisher because she does have talent and a good narrative ability, and she writes about things that would interest a lot of like-minded readers.Brewer does tell us about Mr. Bobbitt's anatomical problem and how it was fixed, and she tells us what it's like being with him in the Biblical sense. But she wisely saves all that until the last chapter, so as to better whet our appetite.Bottom line: interesting and worth reading for sociologists and especially for the New Age supermarket tabloid crowd."},{"Title":"This Week I Married John Wayne Bobbitt: Extraordinary Stories about an Ordinary Life","review":"Ahead of the trend...Brewer's \\"stream of conciousness\\" style brings to mind the current focus on opinion style books. Much in the vein of Terri Hatcher's \\"Burnt Toast\\" and the like.This woman's down-to-earth, unjaded look at her world and the world around her is endearing. Dottie's writing style is like dishing with your best girlfriend...she will make you cry and leave you laughing.Brewer's story is the story of everywoman growing up today, learning as she goes and faced with a comnpletely new set of options and obstacles from those that went before us. Dottie looks at each one and moves through them (from breast implants to abusive relationships), of course hindsite is 100%. Because this is written after-the-fact it allowed her to step back and take a more complete look at some situations...and probably was a little cathartic....and then there is that part about John Wayn Bobbitt, inquiring minds want to know!"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:A},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],W={key:0},x={key:1};function O(n,o,s,c,r,i){const u=f("PoemCard");return e(),t("section",null,[o[1]||(o[1]=a("div",{class:"top-banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[a("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your reviews 🥳")])],-1)),a("div",H,[(e(!0),t(g,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(e(),w(u,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(e(),t("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:o[0]||(o[0]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(e(),t("span",x,"Loading...")):(e(),t("span",W,"See more"))],8,C)):p("",!0)])}const M=d(B,[["render",O],["__scopeId","data-v-04525a74"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/62.md","filePath":"library/62.md"}'),L={name:"library/62.md"},N=Object.assign(L,{setup(n){return(o,s)=>(e(),t("div",null,[b(M)]))}});export{j as __pageData,N as default};
