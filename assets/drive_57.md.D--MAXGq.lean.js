The Klondike stampede was a wild interlude in the epic story of western development, and here are its dramatic tales of hardship, heroism, and villainy. We meet Soapy Smith, dictator of Skagway; Swiftwater Bill Gates, who bathed in champagne; Silent Sam Bonnifield, who lost and won back a hotel in a poker game; and Roddy Connors, who danced away a fortune at a dollar a dance. We meet dance-hall queens, paupers turned millionaires, missionaries and entrepreneurs, and legendary Mounties such as Sam Steele, the Lion of the Yukon. Pierre Berton's riveting account reveals to us the spectacle of the Chilkoot Pass, and the terrors of lesser-known trails through the swamps of British Columbia, across the glaciers of souther Alaska, and up the icy streams of the Mackenzie Mountains. It contrasts the lawless frontier life on the American side of the border to the relative safety of Dawson City.

It is the first novel by William March, pen name for William Edward Campbell. Stemming directly from the author's experiences with the U.S. Marines in France during World War I, the book consists of 113 sketches, or chapters, tracing the fictional Company K's war exploits and providing an emotional history of the men of the company that extends beyond the boundaries of the war itself. William Edward Campbell served courageously in France as evidenced by his chestful of medals and certificates, including the Croix de Guerre, the Distinguished Service Cross, and the Navy Cross. However, without the medals and citations we would know of his bravery. For it is clear in the pages of \\"Company K\\" that this book was written by a man who had been to war, who had clearly seen his share of the worst of it, who had somehow survived, and who had committed himself afterward to the new bravery of sense-making embodied in the creation of major literary art. It is of that bravery that we still have the record of magnificent achievement, the brave terrible gift of Company K. A native of Mobile, AL, William March (1893-1954) studied law at The University of Alabama. After serving in the U.S. Marine Corps during World War I, he worked as an executive with the Waterman Steamship Corporation and published novels and short stories.

With Soviet forces on the outskirts of Warsaw, the Polish capital revolted against five years of Nazi occupation, an uprising that began in a spirit of heroic optimism. Sixty-three days later it came to a tragic end. The Nazis suppressed the insurgents ruthlessly, reducing Warsaw to rubble while slaughtering some 200,000 people, mostly through mass executions. The Red Army simply looked on. Bia?oszewski s blow-by-blow account of the uprising brings it alive in all its desperate urgency. Here we are in the shoes of a young man slipping back and forth under German fire, dodging sniper bullets, collapsing with exhaustion, rescuing the wounded, burying the dead. An indispensable and unforgettable act of witness, A Memoir of the Warsaw Uprising is also a major work of literature. Bia?oszewski writes in short, stabbing, splintered, breathless sentences attuned to  the glaring identity of  now.

The second plot unfolds in parallel through the footnotes of the translator of the text. As he proceeds with his work, he becomes increasingly convinced that the original author has hidden a second meaning, which can be brought to light by interpreting certain repeated words and images.

With its stress on the Bible, the cross of Christ, conversion and the urgency of mission, it quickly spread throughout the Atlantic world and then became a global phenomenon. Over the past three decades evangelicalism has become the focus of considerable historical research. This research companion brings together a team of leading scholars writing broad-ranging chapters on key themes in the history of evangelicalism. It provides an authoritative and state-of-the-art review of current scholarship, and maps the territory for future research. Primary attention is paid to English-speaking evangelicalism, but the volume is transnational in its scope. Arranged thematically, chapters assess evangelicalism and the Bible, the atonement, spirituality, revivals and revivalism, worldwide mission in the Atlantic North and the Global South, eschatology, race, gender, culture and the arts, money and business, interactions with Roman Catholicism, Eastern Christianity, and Islam, and globalization. It demonstrates evangelicalism s multiple and contested identities in different ages and contexts.

Even after Trudeau left office, he remained a player, his infrequent speeches and public appearances sufficient still to alter the course of events. Now, in commemoration of the 30th anniversary of Trudeau's coming to power, Andrew Cohen and J.L. Granatstein have commissioned 23 new, never-before-published essays from a diverse group of Canadians, all of whom in some way or another have been influenced by this enigmatic leader. Among the esteemed essayists are Larry Zolf, Max Nemni, Michael Bliss, Richard Gwyn, Linda Griffiths, Mark Kingwell, Robert Mason Lee, Jim Coutts, Rick Salutin, Andrew Coyne, Linda McQuaig, Bob Rae, Donald Macdonald, James Raffan and B.W.

In this unique book, the first of a series that decade by decade will review the history of motorsport's ultimate championship through to the 2000s, it is above all the portraits that speak, giving a face to men who have truly written the history of the blue ribbon series, all thanks to an incomparable repertoire of previously unpublished photos accompanied by texts by Gianni Cancellierii, one of the leading motorsport experts. 7 February 1960, Bruce McLaren wins the GP of Argentina at the wheel of a rear-engined Cooper that the year before had carried Jack Brabham to the World Championship title. This was the first great novelty of the decade: in order to be successful the cars had to have their engine behind the cockpit. Then, in 1961, came the 1.5-litre engines and even Ferrari followed the rear-engine trend. This was an epochal revolution. A decade was underway that would see great feats, great victories and great tragedies and of course great drivers of the calibre of Phil Hill, Jack Brabham, Jim Clark, John Surtees, Graham Hill, Denny Hulme, Jackie Stewart and many others. However, in this \\"gallery of faces\\" there are also designers, team managers, mechanics, women in the pits as well as the ever-varied world of the tifosi.

And the traditional most significant challenge in the Middle East is the Arab-Israeli conflict and its core, the dispute between Israelis and Palestinians. It is a center of gravity around which the region has revolved, and remains of vast political and symbolic significance. Both in its own right and due to its (positive or negative) signaling effects, reinvigoration of the peace process is a key challenge for regional and international policy-makers in the coming years. So, what is the origin of this Israeli-Palestinian old conflict? Why did we reach this point in that region? Who to blame? How we can find a just solution? What will be the consequences if the conflict is not resolved? Can a viable state be made in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip? Gabriel Tabarani, who is a specialist on Middle East affairs, will try to find the answers in this book where he takes us back to that region through its history and facts, analyzes some turning points in it, which affected that region, discovers the causes and the important aspects of the conflict and the obstacles to peace. He presents all current events details and information from both sides of this conflict.

This is perhaps understandable given the debates concerning Mary's \\"place\\" in the documents of Vatican II. In an ecumenical age, it was argued, the church needed a less triumphalist Mariology and piety with a greater focus on Mary as model disciple. In certain respects this has led to a dichotomy between the continued Marian piety of many faithful (and, truth be told, the piety of the post-conciliar popes) and a theological timidity concerning Mary. This collection of chapters seeks to address the current situation of Mariology. Taken as a whole these chapters represent a welcome call for renewal and reawakening in Mariology. The collection is also delightfully eclectic, both in terms of topics covered and in terms of the denominational and academic backgrounds of the authors.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=OPbEDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ask Me Anything About the Presidents (Avon Camelot Books)","description":"Questions and answers supplying curious facts about each of the presidents are accompanied by brief descriptions of each man's life and career","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=44ZaPQAACAAJ&dq=Ask+Me+Anything+About+the+Presidents+(Avon+Camelot+Books)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Bred Any Good Rooks Lately?

It also traces her extraordinary posthumous career as the earliest famous woman in British history.

The outcome is both startling and impressive. It is an expression of contemporary female identity - self-aware, distinctive and thoroughly positive, in a series of nude photographs that inexorably capture and hold our attention, revealing at the same time the artist's highly creative approach to the medium of photography and to the individual selves of the women portrayed. The author describes his project in this way: \\"We are inundated with pictures of women in the media. Ordinarily, the pictures we see seek to achieve a kind of 'sameness' based on unwritten ideals of beauty; physical perfection, total fitness become the determining factors. These images of women, provoked as they are by the media industry, awakened in me the urge to confront both that industry and myself with something else. I chose to set aside my own ways of thinking and do a series of 100 women in which it was not I who would put together the photographs, but the women themselves. For this purpose, I gave them each a shutter-switch and left the room. That represented the beginning of the attempt to enable the women to become photographic subjects rather than objects; they were left to decide on their own which personal image of themselves they wanted to convey. The conditions were the same for all of the women: the same lighting, the same white background and the same unchanged camera position. It was essential to fix the location of the camera, so that the women did not perceive themselves as being pursued by an 'observer'; instead, they were able to establish distance and camera angle themselves with the aid of a video screen that showed them each camera exposure as a still photo.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=0pxTAAAAMAAJ&dq=Self-Images:+100+Women&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"His Father's Son","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Real Aim of Our Life","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=A3cPAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A Biblical Theology of the Covenant Priesthood : The priest as Son, Father, Bridegroom and Brother","description":"John Paul II on the mission and the formation of the priests of the future","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=I8H6GgAACAAJ&dq=A+Biblical+Theology+of+the+Covenant+Priesthood+:+The+priest+as+Son,+Father,+Bridegroom+and+Brother&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Windows 98 Registry for Dummies","description":"Explains the features of the Windows 98 Registry, and tells how to avoid losing system information, customize the Registry, and handle problems","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_sgCAAAACAAJ&dq=Windows+98+Registry+for+Dummies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Cal Ripken, Jr.: Play Ball!","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Ghosts of Nova Scotia","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Chassis Engineering: Chassis Design, Building & Tuning for High Performance Handling","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Lie Like a Rug","description":"While escorting Bryn Derwyn Academy s most infamous student downtown to be scared straight by a Federal judge, Ginger Barnes is shocked to find her childhood babysitter, textile professor Charlie Finnemeyer, on trial for fraudulently aging an Oriental rug.

Representing one of the first publications of journalists' and advertising practitioners' response to the Defining Issues Test (DIT), this book compares thinking about ethics by these two groups with the thinking of other professionals. This text is divided into three parts: *Part I includes chapters that explain the DIT and place it within the larger history of three fields: psychology, philosophy, and mass communication. It also provides both a statistical (quantitative) and narrative (qualitative) analysis of journalists' responses to the DIT. *Part II adds to scholarship theory building in these three disciplines and makes changes in the DIT that adds an element of visual information processing to the test. *Part III explores the larger meaning of this effort overall and links the results to theory and practice in these three fields. The Moral Media pursues connections among various intellectual disciplines, between the academy and the profession of journalism, and among those who believe that what journalists do is essential. As a result, this book is appropriate for aspiring journalists; scholars in journalism and mass communication; psychologists, particularly those interested in human development and behavior; and philosophers.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5iWRAgAAQBAJ&dq=Morality+and+the+mass+media&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Thy friend, Obadiah (Children's Braille book club)","description":"Obadiah, a young Quaker boy living in colonial Nantucket, is constantly followed by a sea gull that he wishes would leave him alone.

Is this happenstance, providence, or coincidence? According to cosmologist Martin Rees, the answer depends on the answer to another question, the one posed by Einstein's famous remark: ''What interests me most is whether God could have made the world differently.'' This highly engaging book explores the fascinating consequences of the answer being ''yes.'' Rees explores the notion that our universe is just a part of a vast ''multiverse,'' or ensemble of universes, in which most of the other universes are lifeless. What we call the laws of nature would then be no more than local bylaws, imposed in the aftermath of our own Big Bang. In this scenario, our cosmic habitat would be a special, possibly unique universe where the prevailing laws of physics allowed life to emerge. Rees begins by exploring the nature of our solar system and examining a range of related issues such as whether our universe is or isn't infinite. He asks, for example: How likely is life? How credible is the Big Bang theory? Rees then peers into the long-range cosmic future before tracing the causal chain backward to the beginning. He concludes by trying to untangle the paradoxical notion that our entire universe, stretching 10 billion light-years in all directions, emerged from an infinitesimal speck. As Rees argues, we may already have intimations of other universes. But the fate of the multiverse concept depends on the still-unknown bedrock nature of space and time on scales a trillion trillion times smaller than atoms, in the realm governed by the quantum physics of gravity. Expanding our comprehension of the cosmos, Our Cosmic Habitat will be read and enjoyed by all those--scientists and nonscientists alike--who are as fascinated by the universe we inhabit as is the author himself.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tg8mDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Deepest Depths of Shallow Ponds","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Xlk1AAAACAAJ&dq=The+Deepest+Depths+of+Shallow+Ponds&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"In Quest of Words and Legal Terms of Common Origins: Ancient Egyptian, Arabic, Indo European and Turkish Cognates","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SQx8tAEACAAJ&dq=In+Quest+of+Words+and+Legal+Terms+of+Common+Origins:+Ancient+Egyptian,+Arabic,+Indo+European+and+Turkish+Cognates&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The New Commandments","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"When Children are Abused: An Educator's Guide to Intervention","description":"This book is an invaluable resource for educators who are concerned about how to recognize and intervene effectively in situations of child abuse and neglect.

The late antique world possessed no voice like that of Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius (121-180 CE). His private meditations on what constitutes a good life have withstood the centuries and reach us today with the same penetrating clarity and shining light as the words of Shakespeare, Emerson, or Thoreau. In this remarkable new translation, bestselling religious philosopher Jacob Needleman and classics scholar John P. Piazza have retained the depth of Marcus's perspective on life. They have carefully selected and faithfully rendered those passages that clarify Marcus's role as someone who stood within the great religious and ethical traditions that extend throughout every culture in human history. The voice that emerges from their translation is a universal one, equally recognizable to students of Christ, Buddha, the Vedas, the Talmud, and to anyone who sincerely searches for a way of meaning in contemporary life.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=ULBPEAAAQBAJ&dq=Marcus&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Let's Go 2003: New Zealand","description":"The Resource for the Independent Traveler For over forty years Let's Go Travel Guides have brought budget savvy travelers closer to the world and its diverse cultures by providing the most up-to-date information.

The Shakespeare Book has visual plot summaries of each one, with diagrams to show the intricate web of relationships in plays such as A Midsummer's Night Dream. Commentaries explain Shakespeare's sources and set each drama in context, revealing, for instance, how the warring Protestants and Catholics of his day are mirrored in Romeo and Juliet's Montagues and Capulets. Written in plain English and packed with graphics and illustrations, The Shakespeare Book illumines the Bard's world - his marriage, businesses, and friends - and explains how his works became an enduring phenomenon. Whether you need a guide through complex plots and unfamiliar language, or you're looking for a fresh perspective on his well-loved plays and sonnets, this indispensable guide will help you fully appreciate Shakespeare, the man, and the writer.

Set in 1876, right after the Battle of Little Big Horn, her new novel tells of Eleanor Peterson, a scientific illustrator in her late thirties, and her friend and mentor Augustus Starwood, an aging portrait painter with a passion for Shakespeare, who join a diverse band of adventurers heading west to Montana to work on a dinosaur fossil dig. Told through Eleanor's remembrances years later, the story recounts the experiences of this ambitious and at times contentious field crew, as they argue over prevailing theories of evolution, contend with rival scientists, and worry about Indians moving north after their defeat of Custer. A vivid portrait of both the natural environment and the issues and ideas of the time, Smith's novel is ultimately a story of personal discovery, revealing the redemptive power of the land and its rivers.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HbW1i1shq3cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Pigeon Loves Things That Go!","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Restoring the Fallen: A Team Approach to Caring, Confronting and Reconciling","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Everything You Need To Know About Economics (The Pocket Professor)","description":"A comprehensive overview of world religion offers a detailed look at the tenets and rituals of the major religions and denominations, along with a profiles of the world's great religious leaders, a discussion of the five classical arguments for the existence of God, and a helpful reading list.

Until this thorough and authoritative study, literature on the subject in English has been limited to a few chapters in multiauthored works. Chronologically, Wandycz traces the histories of the lands under Prussian, Austrian, and Russian rule, pointing out their divergent evolution as well as the threads that bound them together.

Charleston (SC) Post and Courier In the first reissue of these documents since 1865, A City Laid Waste captures in riveting detail the destruction of South Carolina s capital city. William Gilmore Simms (1806-1870), a native South Carolinian and one of the nation s foremost men of letters, was in Columbia and witnessed firsthand the city s capture and destruction. A renowned novelist and poet, who was also an experienced journalist and historian, Simms deftly recorded the events of February 1865 in a series of eyewitness accounts published in the first ten issues of the Columbia Phoenix and reprinted here. His record of burned buildings constitutes the most authoritative information available on the extent of the damage. Simms historian David Aiken provides a historical and literary context for Simms s reportage. In his introduction Aiken clarifies the significance of Simms s articles and draws attention to factors most important for understanding the occupation s impact on the city of Columbia.  A shrewd viewer of the war scene in Columbia, famed Southern writer William Gilmore Simms published stinging, courageous expos s of the doings of the Northern forces, even when threatened with arrest. The restoration of his candid firsthand accounts of the destruction wrought by Sherman s forces against the South Carolina capitol and its inhabitants is a great service to all who study and appreciate Southern history and literature.

Tragedy unfolds as Anna rejects her passionless marriage and thereby exposes herself to the hypocrisies of society. Set against a vast and richly textured canvas of nineteenth-century Russia, the novel's seven major characters create a dynamic imbalance, playing out the contrasts of city and country life and all the variations on love and family happiness. While previous versions have softened the robust and sometimes shocking qualities of Tolstoy's writing, Pevear and Volokhonsky have produced a translation true to his powerful voice. This authoritative edition, which received the PEN Translation Prize and was an Oprah Book Club? selection, also includes an illuminating introduction and explanatory notes.

In a series of incisive, closely argued chapters he explores the way in which the senior commanders and ordinary soldiers responded to the extraordinary challenges posed by the mass industrial warfare of the early twentieth century.In 1914 the French army went to war with a flawed doctrine, brightly-colored uniforms and a dire shortage of modern, heavy artillery How then, over four years of relentless, attritional warfare, did it become the great, industrialized army that emerged victorious in 1918?To show how this change occurred, the author examines the pre-war ethos and organization of the army and describes in telling detail how, through a process of analysis and innovation, the French army underwent the deepest and fastest transformation in its history.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XQPMDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"IE Underst Interper Comm-CD","description":"In this original and provocative book, Bogdan proposes that the ability to interpret others' mental states should be viewed as an evolutionary adaptation.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BafunQEACAAJ&dq=IE+Underst+Interper+Comm-CD&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Elisabet Ney, sculptor,","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EzgEAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Ubu Roi","description":"A stunning, controversial work that immediately outraged audiences with its scatological references during the 1896 premiere, the farce satirizes the tendency of the successful bourgeois to abuse his authority and become irresponsibly complacent.

He tells a compelling story of rural misery caused by the war, which in turn offers a fertile ground for its continuation. Finnegan's narrative includes historical background and critical analysis of the Mozambique government whose policies have not created an inclusive framework for the nation. Finnegan is drawn to the conclusion that Mozambique's peasants long have been denied the fruits of peace: first under centuries of Portuguese colonialism; and now as they are exposed to the current war that is destroying their future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=obYwDwAAQBAJ&dq=A+Complicated+War:+The+Harrowing+of+Mozambique+(Perspectives+on+Southern+Africa)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A dictionary of fishes","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Collectable Paperback Books : 10,000 Prices Realized","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=STtIPQAACAAJ&dq=Collectable+Paperback+Books+:+10,000+Prices+Realized&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Siege","description":"Set against the turbulent backdrop of Leningrad in 1941, an intricately woven tapestry of love and war follows the Levin family--twenty-two-year-old Anna, her young brother Kolya, and their father, Mikhail--as they struggle to survive during the German siege.

In 1887, twelve-year-old Eliza Yates disguised as a boy sets out with her faithful dog Caesar to search for her missing father. Along the way, she falls in with gentleman outlaw Calvin Featherbone.  Together, they make their way to Tinville, Colorado, where, coincidentally, Calvin s father was killed by a certain Sheriff Yates. Calvin plans to avenge the murder, but he gets himself and Eliza in so much trouble with his amateurish schemes that the pair arrives in town ready to be hanged as horse thieves.

The plotting is . . . tight and fast paced, and Hahn does a fine job of recreating the atmosphere of the days of cowboys and miners  (Booklist).

In the course of little more than a hundred years from the day Commodore Matthew Perry arrived in his black ships, this insular, preindustrial realm mutated into an expansive military dictatorship that essentially supplanted the British, French, Dutch, and American empires in Asia before plunging to utter ruin, eventually emerging under American tutelage as a pseudo-Western-style democracy and economic dynamo. What explains the seismic changes that thrust this small island nation so violently onto the world stage? In part, Ian Buruma argues, the story is one of a newly united nation that felt it must play catch-up to the established Western powers, just as Germany and Italy did, a process that involved, in addition to outward colonial expansion, internal cultural consolidation and the manufacturing of a shared heritage. But Japan has always been both particularly open to the importation of good ideas and particularly prickly about keeping their influence quarantined, a bipolar disorder that would have dramatic consequences and that continues to this day. If one book is to be read in order to understand why the Japanese seem so impossibly strange to many Americans, Inventing Japan is surely it.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Su-OV8UEyvwC&dq=Inventing+Japan,+1853-1964+(Modern+Library+Chronicles)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arafat: From Defender to Dictator","description":"A biography of the Palestinian leader","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=-WeB1Wq-2Y0C&dq=Arafat:+From+Defender+to+Dictator&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Anger of Achilles: Mnis in Greek Epic (Myth and Poetics)","description":"In Gender and Genre in the Folklore of Middle India, Joyce Burkhalter Flueckiger analyzes six representative Indian folklore genres from a single regional repertoire to show the influence of their intertextual relations on the composition and interpretation of artistic performance.

The focus is on the interplay between traditional toys and play, and toys and play that are mediated by or combined with digital technology. As well as covering the technical aspects of computer mediated play activities, the authors consider how technologically enhanced toys are currently used in traditional play and how they are woven into childrens' lives. The authors contrast their findings about technologically enhanced toys with knowledge of traditional toys and play. They link their studies of toys to goals in education and to entertainment and information transfer. This book will appeal to students, researchers, teachers, child care workers and more broadly the entertainment industry. It is appropriate for courses that deal with the specialized subject of toys and games, media studies, education and teacher training, and child development.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=gHKRAgAAQBAJ&dq=Toys,+Games,+and+Media&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"On photography","description":"Winner of the National Book Critics' Circle Award for Criticism.

It has had an enormous impact on cultural studies and work across many disciplines on gender, sexuality, and the body. Bringing a new set of questions to this key work, Ann Laura Stoler examines volume one of History of Sexuality in an unexplored light. She asks why there has been such a muted engagement with this work among students of colonialism for whom issues of sexuality and power are so essential. Why is the colonial context absent from Foucault's history of a European sexual discourse that for him defined the bourgeois self? InRace and the Education of Desire, Stoler challenges Foucault's tunnel vision of the West and his marginalization of empire. She also argues that this first volume ofHistory of Sexuality contains a suggestive if not studied treatment of race. Drawing on Foucault's little-known 1976 College de France lectures, Stoler addresses his treatment of the relationship between biopower, bourgeois sexuality, and what he identified as  racisms of the state.  In this critical and historically grounded analysis based on cultural theory and her own extensive research in Dutch and French colonial archives, Stoler suggests how Foucault's insights have in the past constrained and in the future may help shape the ways we trace the genealogies of race. Race and the Education of Desire will revise current notions of the connections between European and colonial historiography and between the European bourgeois order and the colonial treatment of sexuality. Arguing that a history of European nineteenth-century sexuality must also be a history of race, it will change the way we think about Foucault.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=vGRDpKo4JoUC&dq=Race+and+the+Education+of+Desire:+Foucault&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pawn Endings","description":"At age 97, Yuri Averkakh is the World's Oldest still living chess grandmaster and is still active in chess.

The Dr. Kevorkian trial of the 19th century, with a bit of O.J. Simpson mixed in for good measure, the scandal entranced nearly the entire population of the British Isles. Everyone had an opinion on the case--including esteemed poet and historical fabulist Robert Graves. They Hanged My Saintly Billy is true crime as only a true literary master could write it, with exquisitely rendered portraits of Palmer's era and milieu, told from the shifting perspectives of all who came into contact with the notorious doctor. Just as his renowned I, Claudius opened a window onto a case of history once thought to be closed, Graves's account of Palmer's life recasts the surgeon as a victim of yellow journalism and overzealous judges. But ultimately it's left up to the reader to decide whether or not Palmer's mother is in the right, or merely duped along with the rest of Palmer's supporters, when she laments: \\"Yes, they hanged my saintly Billy! He was a bit of a scamp right enough, but a good son to me; the best of the brood . . . and no murderer.\\" Seven Stories' Robert Graves Project spans 14 titles, and includes fiction and nonfiction, adult, young adult and children's books, in a striking new uniform design, with new introductions and afterwords. They Hanged My Saintly Billy joins our recent re-publication of The Reader Over Your Shoulder, Ann at Highwood Hall, The Golden Fleece, and Homer's Daughter. Among the works still to come are Count Belisarius, Hebrew Myths, and Lawrence and the Arabs.

As a leading member of the republican regime and signatory to Charles I s death warrant, he was hanged, drawn and quartered by the Restoration government in 1660; a spectacle witnessed by Samuel Pepys who recorded him  looking as cheerful as any man could do in that condition . Beginning with this grisly event, this book employs a thematic, rather than chronological approach, to illustrate the role of millenarianism and providence in the English Revolution, religion within the new model army, literature, image and reputation, and Harrison s relationship with key individuals like Ireton and Cromwell as well as groups, most notably the Fifth Monarchists. Divided in three parts, the study starts with an analysis of Harrison s last year of life, the nature of his response to the political collapse of the Interregnum regimes, and his apparent acceptance of the Restoration without overt resistance. Part two considers Harrison s years of  power , analysing his political activities and influence in the New Model, especially with regard to the regicide. The final part ties Harrison s political retreat to his initial emergence from obscurity; arguing that Harrison s relative political quietism during the later 1650s was a reflection of the development of his millenarianism. Unlike the only two previous full length studies of Harrison the present work makes use of a full range of manuscript, primary and secondary sources, including the huge range of new material that has fundamentally changed how the early modern period is now understood. Fully footnoted and referenced, this study provides the first modern academic study of Harrison, and through him illuminates the key themes of this contested period.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=uN0oDAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Perfect Ride","description":"More than a racetrack reminiscence, this is the remarkable comeback story of a man who has triumphed over a lifetime of adversity, and who stunned the world with a jubilant return to racing in 2000. of photos.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=dZA2SrvIbm8C&dq=The+Perfect+Ride&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Salt Covenant","description":"SALT symbolizes blood and life, the supreme gift from a Supreme Giver.

So why did he always cite his 1-9 A&M team of 1954 as his favorite? This is the story of a remarkable team - and the beginning of the legend. The Junction Boys tells the story of Coach Paul \\"Bear\\" Bryant's legendary training camp in the small town of Junction, Texas. In a move that many consider the salvation of the Texas A&M football program, Coach Bryant put 115 players through the most grueling practices ever imagined. Only a handful of players survived the entire 10 days, but they braved the intense heat of the Texas sun and the burning passion of their coach, and turned a floundering team into one of the nation's best. The Junction Boys is more than just a story of tough practices without water breaks. An extraordinary fellowship was forged from the mind-numbing pain. The thirty-five survivors bonded together like no other team in America. They profited from the Junction experience; the knowledge they took back with them to College Station, about themselves and what they were capable of, would be used for the rest of their lives. In vivid and powerful images reminiscent of Friday Night Lights, Hoosiers, and The Last Picture Show, these young men and their driven coach come to life. The Junction Boys contains all the hallmarks of a classic sports story, and it combines America's love of college football with an extraordinary story of perseverance and triumph.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=09mXlyijC_cC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Intermediate Perl","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Karina Has Down Syndrome: One Family's Account of the Early Years with a Child who has Special Needs","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical Science : A Historical and Critical Essay","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oQY6AAAAMAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Boats On The River","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Treasury Enforcement Agent Exam","description":"Joining the U.S. Secret Service, U.S. Customs Service, the IRS, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, or the U.S. Marshal Services requires passing the challenging Treasury Enforcement Agent Exam.

Augustine of Hippo (354 430), theologian, priest, and bishop, is one of the most important figures in the development of Western Christianity. He is known as much for his long interior struggle that ended with conversion and baptism at age thirty-two as for his influential teachings on human will, original sin and the theology of just war. Cherished as a model for the pursuit of a life of spiritual grace and criticized for his theory of predestination, Augustine is recognized as a living expression of the passion to understand and communicate the deeper meanings of human experience. With fresh translations drawn from Augustine's voluminous writings and probing facing-page commentary, Augustinian scholar Joseph T. Kelley, PhD, provides insight into the mind and heart of this foundational Christian figure. Kelley illustrates how Augustine s keen intellect, rhetorical skill and passionate faith reshaped the theological language and dogmatic debates of early Christianity. He explores the stormy religious arguments and political upheavals of the fifth century, Augustine s controversial teachings on predestination, sexuality and marriage, and the deep undercurrents of Augustine s spiritual quest that still inspire Christians today.\\"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=FnnvO743FlwC&dq=Confessions%3B+(Writings+of+Saint+Augustine)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Gathering Storm (The Second World War, volume 1)","description":"Book I: From war to war : 1919-1939 Book II: The twilight war : Sept. 3, 1939- May 10, 1940.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5NxjPgAACAAJ&dq=The+Gathering+Storm+(The+Second+World+War,+volume+1)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Raise the dead!","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"White Horses over France: From the Camargue to Cornwall (Isis Series/6 Audio Cassettes)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Poem for What's Her Name","description":"In this fast-paced romance that combines flirty fun and situational comedy, a spunky heroine must navigate secret crushes, high school hijinks, and of course, Shakespeare. Understudies never get to perform...which is why being Juliet's understudy in the school's yearly Shakespeare production is the perfect role for Emily. She can earn some much-needed extra credit while pursuing her main goal of spending time with Wes, aka Romeo, aka the hottest, nicest guy in school (in her completely unbiased opinion). And she meant to learn her lines, really, it's just: a) Shakespeare is HARD, b) Amanda (the \\"real\\" Juliet) makes her run errands instead of lines, and c) there's no point, since Amanda would never miss her chance to be the star of the show. Then Amanda ends up in the hospital and Emily, as the (completely unprepared!) understudy, has to star in the most famous scene from Romeo and Juliet opposite the guy of her dreams. Oops?

Appointed to reconstruct the battered kingdom, Lord Philip and his wife, Lady Rachelle, are in disbelief at the magnitude of their undertaking as poverty-stricken citizens greet them with rotted teeth, filthy clothing, and pathetic living conditions. As the lord and lady settle into their new residence, Lord Philip is confronted with the peasants' belief that Bogotah is to blame for Wilkinshire's misfortunes. In order to put the citizen's superstitions to rest, he must discover who is responsible for the kingdom's bad luck. Meanwhile, Lord Thaddeus of Lancaster, an evil soul consumed by greed, waits for the opportune moment to claim Wilkinshire for himself.

Addressing a wide spectrum of questions raised by this rich new cultural landscape, Mixing It Up brings together the observations of ten noted voices who have experienced multiracialism first-hand. From Naomi Zack's \\"American Mixed Race: The United States 2000 Census and Related Issues\\" to Cathy Irwin and Sean Metzger's \\"Keeping Up Appearances: Ethnic Alien-Nation in Female Solo Performance,\\" this diverse collection spans the realities of multiculturalism in compelling new analysis. Arguing that society's discomfort with multiracialism has been institutionalized throughout history, whether through the \\"one drop\\" rule or media depictions, SanSan Kwan and Kenneth Speirs reflect on the means by which the monoracial lens is slowly being replaced. Itself a hybrid of memoir, history, and sociological theory, Mixing It Up makes it clear why the identity politics of previous decades have little relevance to the fluid new face of contemporary humanity.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=sQfUAAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Let's Go 2003: Peru, Ecuador & Bolivia","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Leaving Ireland","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Propaganda;: The formation of men's attitudes","description":"From one of the greatest French philosophers of the 20th century, comes a seminal study and critique of propaganda.

Not only is the influence of Greek drama palpable in everything from Shakespeare to modern television, the insights contained in Greek tragedy have shaped our perceptions of the nature of human life. Poets, philosophers, and politicians have long borrowed and adapted the ideas and language of Greek drama to help them make sense of their own times. This exciting curated anthology features a cross section of the most popular and most widely taught plays in the Greek canon. Fresh translations into contemporary English breathe new life into the texts while capturing, as faithfully as possible, their original meaning. This outstanding collection also offers short biographies of the playwrights, enlightening and clarifying introductions to the plays, and helpful annotations at the bottom of each page. Appendices by prominent classicists on such topics as  Greek Drama and Politics,   The Theater of Dionysus,  and  Plato and Aristotle on Tragedy  give the reader a rich contextual background. A detailed time line of the dramas, as well as a list of adaptations of Greek drama to literature, stage, and film from the time of Seneca to the present, helps chart the history of Greek tragedy and illustrate its influence on our culture from the Roman Empire to the present day.

It is 65 million years ago, during a cataclysmic moment in the earth s evolution, and Dusk, just months old, has no way of knowing he will play a pivotal role in creating a new world. What he does know is that he is different from the other newborn chiropters. Not content to use his large sails to glide down from the giant sequoia tree, Dusk discovers that if he flaps quickly enough, he can fly. But this strange gift that makes him feel like an outcast from the colony will also make him its saviour. After most of the colony is savagely massacred by the felids the earth s first mammalian carnivores Dusk must lead his fellow chiropters to a new home, and a new life.

When the same Indians petitioned for Federal recognition and assistance in 1915, the Senate tasked the Office of Indian Affairs to report on the \\"tribal rights and conditions\\" of those Robeson County Indians. Special Indian Agent Orlando McPherson, a Midwesterner who was in the final stages of a long career as a civil servant, was commissioned to investigate. The resulting federal report is essentially literature review in the guise of fact-finding. It relies heavily on Robeson county legislator Hamilton McMillan's musings on the relationship between Sir Walter Raleigh's Lost Colony and the Indians around Robeson County. The report reaches many erroneous conclusions, in part because it was based in an anthropological framework of white supremacy, segregation-era politics, and assumptions about racial \\"purity.\\" In fact, later researchers would establish that the Lumbees, as Malinda Lowery writes, \\"are survivors from the dozens of tribes in that territory who established homes with the Native people, as well as free European and enslaved African settlers, who lived in what became their core homeland: the low-lying swamplands along the border of North and South Carolina.\\" Excavations would later establish the presence of Native people in that homeland since at least 1000 A.D. Ironically, McPherson's murky colonial history connecting Lumbees to early colonial settlers was used to legitimize them and to deflect their categorization as African-Americans. The McPherson report documents one important phase of an Indian people's long path to self-determination and political recognition, a path that would designate them variously as Croatan, Cherokee Indians of Robeson County, Siouan Indians of the Lumber River, and finally, Lumbee--the title of their own choosing and the one we use today.

Pure, bracing ventilation they must have up there at all times, indeed: one may guess the power of the north wind blowing over the edge, by the excessive slant of a few stunted firs at the end of the house; and by a range of gaunt thorns all stretching their limbs one way, as if craving alms of the sun. Happily, the architect had foresight to build it strong: the narrow windows are deeply set in the wall, and the corners defended with large jutting stones. Before passing the threshold, I paused to admire a quantity of grotesque carving lavished over the front, and especially about the principal door; above which, among a wilderness of crumbling griffins and shameless little boys, I detected the date ?1500,? and the name ?Hareton Earnshaw.? I would have made a few comments, and requested a short history of the place from the surly owner; but his attitude at the door appeared to demand my speedy entrance, or complete departure, and I had no desire to aggravate his impatience previous to inspecting the penetralium. One stop brought us into the family sitting-room, without any introductory lobby or passage: they call it here ?the house? pre-eminently. It includes kitchen and parlour, generally; but I believe at Wuthering Heights the kitchen is forced to retreat altogether into another quarter: at least I distinguished a chatter of tongues, and a clatter of culinary utensils, deep within; and I observed no signs of roasting, boiling, or baking, about the huge fireplace; nor any glitter of copper saucepans and tin cullenders on the walls. One end, indeed, reflected splendidly both light and heat from ranks of immense pewter dishes, interspersed with silver jugs and tankards, towering row after row, on a vast oak dresser, to the very roof. The latter had never been under-drawn: its entire anatomy lay bare to an inquiring eye, except where a frame of wood laden with oatcakes and clusters of legs of beef, mutton, and ham, concealed it. Above the chimney were sundry villainous old guns, and a couple of horse-pistols: and, by way of ornament, three gaudily-painted canisters disposed along its ledge. The floor was of smooth, white stone; the chairs, high-backed, primitive structures, painted green: one or two heavy black ones lurking in the shade. In an arch under the dresser reposed a huge, liver-coloured bitch pointer, surrounded by a swarm of squealing puppies; and other dogs haunted other recesses.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=b3ctQ5L7zNoC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Titan Training Manuel","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"National Geographics How Things Work","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Scroll of Seduction","description":"Manuel is a man of many talents; an art historian and professor, he is also an exquisite storyteller. When he meets 16-year-old Luc a on an outing from her boarding school, he offers to narrate a story of dire consequences that of the Spanish Queen Juana of Castile and her legendary love for her husband, Philippe the Handsome. Promised to Prince Philippe the Handsome to solidify ties between the Flemish and Spanish crowns, Queen Juana immediately fell in love with her betrothed with all the abandon and passion of her fiery personality. Theirs was one of the most tumultuous love stories of all time. But Juana, who was also one of the most learned princesses of the Renaissance, was forced to pay a high price for being headstrong and daring to be herself. Those at court who could not fathom Juana as heir to the throne of the most important empire of its day conspired against her and began to question her sanity. Eventually she came to be known as Juana the Mad. But was she really insane, or just a victim of her impetuosity and unbridled passion? As the novel unfolds, Luc a and Manuel become enmeshed in a complex psychological web that seduces and incites them to relive Juana and Philippe's story, and eventually leads them to a mysterious manuscript that may hold the key to Juana's alleged madness.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FP42hjKG8nMC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Complete Guide to Rock Climbing (Practical Handbook)","description":"This is a fully comprehensive, illustrateed guide to rcock climbing, with topics ranging from basic indoor wall-climbing techniques to the ultimate adventure of scaling sea cliffs and high mountain crags.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=mUYHAAAACAAJ&dq=Complete+Guide+to+Rock+Climbing+(Practical+Handbook)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Government: Brief Version","description":"This popular brief edition text maintains the framework of the Wilson, DiIulio, and Bose complete text, emphasizing the historical development of the American political system, who governs, and to what ends.

Sharply separating encoded grammar from inference in discourse, it proposes a unitary meaning for si, including impersonals, passives, and reflexives. Si signals third-person participancy but makes no distinctions of number, gender, or case role. The analysis advances the Columbia School framework by relying on just these straightforward oppositions, attributing variety of interpretation largely to language use rather than to grammar. The analysis places si within a network of oppositions involving all the other clitics. Data come primarily from twentieth-century and more recent published and on-line literature. The book will be of interest to functional linguists, students of reflexivity, and scholars of the Italian language.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ab0zDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A land born in a day;: Or, Irrefutable proof that the Holy Bible is the inspired word of God and offers the only way to eternal life","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Indians of the Yosemite Valley and Vicinity: Their History, Customs and Traditions","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6ugNAAAAIAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Fat Cat","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Dangerous Love (Swanlea Spinsters)","description":"He was playing a dangerous masquerade...Griff Knighton s found the perfect way to avoid being trapped into marriage with one of the Earl of Swanlea s daughters: he ll swap identities with his man of affairs during their next visit to Swan Park, and be free to pursue his own desires!

This Penguin Classics edition is translated from the Russian by David McDuff, with an introduction by William Mills Todd III. Returning to St Petersburg from a Swiss sanatorium, the gentle and na?ve epileptic Prince Myshkin - the titular 'idiot' - pays a visit to his distant relative General Yepanchin and proceeds to charm the General, his wife, and his three daughters. But his life is thrown into turmoil when he chances on a photograph of the beautiful Nastasya Filippovna. Utterly infatuated with her, he soon finds himself caught up in a love triangle and drawn into a web of blackmail, betrayal, and finally, murder. Inspired by an image of Christ's suffering Dostoyevsky sought to portray in Prince Myshkin the purity of a 'truly beautiful soul' and explore the perils that innocence and goodness face in a corrupt world. David McDuff's new translation brilliantly captures the novel's idiosyncratic and dream-like language and the nervous, elliptic flow of the narrative. This edition also contains a new introduction by William Mills Todd III, which is a fascinating examination of the pressures on Dostoyevsky as he wrote the story of his Christ-like hero. Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoyevsky (1821-1881) was born in Moscow. From 1849-54 he lived in a convict prison, and in later years his passion for gambling led him deeply into debt. His other works available in Penguin Classics include Crime & Punishment, The Idiot and Demons. If you enjoyed The Idiot, you might like Anton Chekhov's Ward No. 6 and Other Stories, also available in Penguin Classics.

A story of a way of life that will long be remembered - with people and places as real as the emotions of the heart. Eager to begin her first teaching position, lovely Linnea Brandonberg stepped off the train looking as grown up and worldy as her eighteen years would allow. The golden fields and fragrant wheat of Alamo, North Dakota, were as new and different as the Westgaard family with whom she would live. Farm life in 1917 was hard and bitter - but tiny, spirited Linnea was determined to brave its challenges. And as World War I threatened to take those she held dear, Linnea grew to womanhood in the arms of Teddy Westgaard, a man who thought he'd never find love.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1o8gMQAACAAJ&dq=Years&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Honorable Enemies","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=JEjSAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"A modern course in model cutting and shoe designing","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=BV-HtAEACAAJ&dq=A+modern+course+in+model+cutting+and+shoe+designing&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Messages, Signs, and Meanings: A Basic Textbook in Semiotics and Communication (Studies in Linguistic and Cultural Anthropology)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Outdoor Leadership: Technique, Common Sense & Self-Confidence","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"World of Genetics (2 volume set)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Oak Island and Its Lost Treasure","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Tree Magick: Fifty-Two Magical Messages for Inspiration, Protection and Prediction","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Logic/Reading Review:GRE,GMAT,LSAT,MCAT (Peterson's Logic & Reading Review for the GRE, GMAT, LSAT, & MCAT)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"St Mark's: The Art and Architecture of Church and State in Venice","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Jimmy Streater Story: The Saga of an All-American","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=RegyAQAAIAAJ&dq=The+Jimmy+Streater+Story:+The+Saga+of+an+All-American&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Lake Michigan's Railroad Car Ferries","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=Pa3hAAAAMAAJ&dq=Lake+Michigan%27s+Railroad+Car+Ferries&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Richard Wright's Native Son & Black Boy (Barron's Book Notes)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Bow Dazzlers: 39 Charming Bows & Baskets for Today's Decorator Look (Plaid #8388)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4c5JwgYTu1EC&dq=Bow+Dazzlers:+39+Charming+Bows&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Giant Write Every Day","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"My Life's Soul-Journey: Daily Meditations for Ever-Increasing Spiritual Fulfillment","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Time-Saver Standards for Landscape Architecture CD-ROM : (Single-User version)","description":"Access to the entire range of design and construction data","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=_n5UAAAAMAAJ&dq=Time-Saver+Standards+for+Landscape+Architecture+CD-ROM+:+(Single-User+version)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Securities regulation: Cases and materials : 1979 supplement to fourth edition, containing selected cases and releases under the Federal securitites laws (University casebook series)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=uyTgAAAAMAAJ&dq=Securities+regulation:+Cases+and+materials+:+1979+supplement+to+fourth+edition,+containing+selected+cases+and+releases+under+the+Federal+securitites+laws+(University+casebook+series)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"1968 in America: Music, Politics, Chaos, Counterculture, and the Shaping of a Generation","description":"From assassinations to student riots, this is  a splendidly evocative account of a historic year a year of tumult, of trauma, and of tragedy  (Arthur Schlesinger Jr.). In the United States, the 1960s were a period of unprecedented change and upheaval but the year 1968 in particular stands out as a dramatic turning point. Americans witnessed the Tet offensive in Vietnam; the shocking assassinations of Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy; and the chaos at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago. At the same time, a young generation was questioning authority like never before and popular culture, especially music, was being revolutionized. Largely based on unpublished interviews and documents including in-depth conversations with Eugene McCarthy and Bob Dylan, among many others, and the late Theodore White s archives, to which the author had sole access 1968 in America is a fascinating social history, and the definitive study of a year when nothing could be taken for granted.  Kaiser aims to convey not only what happened during the period but what it felt like at the time. Affecting touches bring back powerful memories, including strong accounts of the impact of the Tet offensive and of the frenzy aroused by Bobby Kennedy s race for the presidency.

This historical and political analysis covers the period from the division of the peninsula in 1948 to the future of North Korea beyond 2003. Topics include the Korean War, Kim Il Sung, famine, the economic collapse of the 1990s, Kim Jong Il, South Korea's sunshine policy, nuclear ambitions, \\"rogue state\\" status, George W. Bush's \\"axis of evil\\" remark made during his 2002 State of the Union address, and the current state of diplomatic relations. The final chapter considers the case for reconciliation.

Despite the great power of the hidden rulers, I found that only one group has the power to issue life or death sentences to any American-our nation's physicians. I discovered that these physicians, despite their great power, were themselves subjected to very strict controls over every aspect of their professional lives. These controls, surprisingly enough, were not wielded by any state or federal agency, although almost every other aspect of American life is now under the absolute control of the bureaucracy. The physicians have their own autocracy, a private trade association, the American Medical Association. This group, which is headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, had gradually built up its power until it assumed total control over medical schools and the accreditation of physicians. The trail of these manipulators led me straight to the same lairs of the international conspirators whom I had exposed in previous books. I knew that they had already looted America, reduced its military power to a dangerously low level, and imposed bureaucratic controls on every American. I now discovered that their conspiracies also directly affected the health of every American. This conspiracy has resulted in a documented decline in the health of our citizens. We now rank far down the list of civilized nations in infant mortality and other significant medical statistics. I was able to document the shocking record of these cold-blooded tycoons who not only plan and carry out famines, economic depressions, revolutions and wars, but who also find their greatest profits in their manipulations of our medical care. The cynicism and malice of these conspirators is something beyond the imagination of most Americans. They deliberately mulct our people of millions of dollars each year through ''charitable'' organizations and then use these same organizations as key groups to bolster their Medical Monopoly. Fear and intimidation are the basic techniques by which the conspirators maintain their control over all aspects of our health care, as they ruthlessly crush any competitor who challenges their profits. As in other aspects of their ''behavioural control'' over the American people, their most constantly used weapon against us is their employment of federal agents and federal agencies to carry out their intrigues. The proof of this operation may be the most disturbing revelation of my work.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WFzLjwEACAAJ&dq=Murder+by+Injection:+The+Story+of+the+Medical+Conspiracy+Against+America+(Hardcover)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dear Mr. Henshaw","description":"Newbery Medal Winner * Teachers  Top 100 Books for Children * ALA Notable Children s Book Beverly Cleary s timeless Newbery Medal-winning book explores difficult topics like divorce, insecurity, and bullying through the thoughts and emotions of a sixth-grade boy as he writes to his favorite author, Boyd Henshaw.

The enforcement of law is simple, quick, and inevitable: death by decapitation, from an explosive torc clamped around each citizen's neck by authority of a single man -- the Anome. For millennia Anomes have ruled Shant, dealing death as they see fit -- and none dares defy them, until Gastel Etzwane risks his head to expose the Anome's identity -- and end the tyranny of these faceless men forever. - Jack King On the fringes of the Gaean Reach, the cantons of Shant on the planet Durdane are ruled by the reclusive Anome -- who coerces the population using explosive rings around the neck of every adult citizen. The Durdane trilogy (The Anome, The Brave Free Men, and The Asutra) follows the life of Gastel Etzwane, who grows from childhood in the dust of Rhododendron Way to become a musician of renown, and almost against his will, a man of action. When remote cantons are brutalized by the depredations of inhuman Roguskhoi, Etzwane goes before the Anome with a case for response. The Anome proves oddly reluctant to act, and Etzwane must stage a coup to turn Shant against the hordes. Eventually he discovers the sinister fact that the Roguskhoi tribes are pawns of the Asutra, alien elements who seek to bend all of humanity to a disturbing end. The Durdane trilogy traces the rise, struggles and ultimate triumph of Gastel Etzwane-and through him, of humanity itself-over alien subjugation. - Joel Hedlund The Anome, originally published as The Faceless Man, is Book I of the Durdane trilogy, and Volume 43 of the Spatterlight Press Signature Series. Released in the centenary of the author's birth, this handsome new collection is based upon the prestigious Vance Integral Edition.

He vividly describes the tough choices and subtle pleasures that come the way of every fighter, from perennial underdogs on the tank-town circuit to the one-time heavyweight champion Larry Holmes, who still spars to retching exhaustion daily. Rotella uncovers the often startling light that boxing sheds on the world beyond the ring. A college student's brief fistic career pinpoints the moment when adulthood arrives. The serenity of a fellow fan shows Rotella how to process the trauma of a car crash. The persistence of a wizened ex-champion reminds him of his grandmother and helps him accept her death. Throughout, Rotella achieves moving resonances between the worlds inside and outside the ropes. He also tackles fascinating questions that have gone largely unexplored until now: How do boxers endure the brutal punishment that is the sport's essence? And why do they come back for more, again and again? As Rotella traces his immersion in the fight world, he achieves what few other writers in that world have: he makes it relevant to us, whether we're fans or not.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=8s0NmfLhefYC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Puppy Care & Training: An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet","description":"If puppies are on the way, you want those newborns to have the best possible chance of survival and good health.

It is an account of the life, death, and resurrection of a real person, whose links with history are firmly signalled in the creeds of the early church, which affirm that Jesus \`suffered under Pontius Pilate'. Contemporary historical scholarship has, however, called into question the reliability of the church's version of this story, and thereby raised thequestion as to whether ordinary people can know its historical truth. This book argues that the historicity of the story still matters, and that its religious significance cannot be captured by the category of \`non-historical myth'. The commonly drawn distinction between the Christ of faith and Jesus of history cannot be maintained. The Christ who is the object of faith must be seen as historical; the Jesus who is reconstructed by historical scholarship is always shaped by commitments offaith. A reconsideration of the Englightenment epistemologies that underlie much historical scholarship shows that historical knowledge of this story is still possible. Such knowledge can be inferential, based on historical evidence. A careful look at contemporary New Testament studies, and the philosophical and literary assumptions upon which it rests, shows that this scholarship should not undermine the confidence of lay people who believe that they can know that the church's story about Jesus is true.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=OCYSDAAAQBAJ&dq=The+Historical+Christ+and+the+Jesus+of+Faith:+The+Incarnational+Narrative+as+History&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Roth IRA Book: An Investor's Guide","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Principles of Numerical Taxonomy (A Series of Books in Biology)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Burma: The State of Myanmar","description":"Long isolated by rigid military rule, Burma, or Myanmar, is one of the least known, significantly sized states in the world. Possessed of a rich cultural history yet facing a range of challenges to stability and growth, it has struck the imaginations of those concerned not only with geopolitical or trade affairs but also with poverty, health, and human rights. David I. Steinberg sheds new light on this reclusive state by exploring issues of authority and legitimacy in its politics, economics, social structure, and culture since the popular uprising and military coup of 1988. Exploring the origins of that year's tumultuous events, Steinberg analyzes a generation of preceding military governments and their attempts to address the nation's problems. He focuses on the role of the military, the effects of Burma's geopolitical placement, the plight of the poor, the destruction of civil society, and rising ethnic tensions. While taking into account the importance of foreign observers as counterpoints to official views, suppliers of economic aid, and advocates of reform, Steinberg contends that ultimately, the solutions to Myanmar's varied problems lie with the Burmese themselves and the policies of their government. The paperback edition includes a postcript that reveals the most current and critical issues facing Burma since the publication of the original hardcover in March 2001. Steinberg brings readers up to date on the recent release of political prisoners, economic and military conditions, United Nations actions, and the complex, ever-changing relationship between Thailand and Myanmar.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=WkfdnQEACAAJ&dq=Burma:+The+State+of+Myanmar&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"What to eat--and when, (Rosicrucian library)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cf36nQEACAAJ&dq=What+to+eat--and+when,+(Rosicrucian+library)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Coping With Survivors and Surviving","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"dinosaurs to the rescue","description":"Text and illustrations of dinosaur characters introduce the earth's major environmental problems and suggest ways children can help.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=G11IHQAACAAJ&dq=dinosaurs+to+the+rescue&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Make your own modern furniture;: Working plans and room designs for more comfortable and convenient living","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=LaFRAAAAMAAJ&dq=Make+your+own+modern+furniture%3B:+Working+plans+and+room+designs+for+more+comfortable+and+convenient+living&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Angry Mountain","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=4gRxtAEACAAJ&dq=The+Angry+Mountain&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Whistling Death: The Test Pilot's Story of the F4U Corsair","description":"Whistling Death is the true story, by the test pilot, of the rush to produce the F4U Corsair, the Navy fighter that brought America air superiority over the Japanese Zero in World War II.

Though it may profitably be used with any translation of Aeschylus, the commentary is based on the acclaimed Chicago translations, The Complete Greek Tragedies, edited by David Grene and Richmond Lattimore. James C. Hogan provides a general introduction to Aeschylean theater and drama, followed by a line-by-line commentary on each of the seven plays. He places Aeschylus in the historical, cultural, and religious context of fifth-century Athens, showing how the action and metaphor of Aeschylean theater can be illuminated by information on Athenian law athletic contests, relations with neighboring states, beliefs about the underworld, and countless other details of Hellenic life. Hogan clarifies terms that might puzzle modern readers, such as place names and mythological references, and gives special attention to textual and linguistic issues: controversial questions of interpretation; difficult or significant Greek words; use of style, rhetoric, and commonplaces in Greek poetry; and Aeschylus's place in the poetic tradition of Homer, Hesiod, and the elegiac poets. Practical information on staging and production is also included, as are maps and illustrations, a bibliography, indexes, and extensive cross-references between the seven plays.

From ancient times to the present, Mesoamericans have made pilgrimages to caves for ceremonies ranging from rituals of passage to petitions for rain and a plentiful harvest. So important were caves to the pre-Hispanic peoples that they are mentioned in Maya hieroglyphic writing and portrayed in the Central Mexican and Oaxacan pictorial codices. Many ancient settlements were located in proximity to caves. This volume gathers papers from twenty prominent Mesoamerican archaeologists, linguists, and ethnographers to present a state-of-the-art survey of ritual cave use in Mesoamerica from Pre-Columbian times to the present. Organized geographically, the book examines cave use in Central Mexico, Oaxaca, and the Maya region. Some reports present detailed site studies, while others offer new theoretical understandings of cave rituals. As a whole, the collection validates cave study as the cutting edge of scientific investigation of indigenous ritual and belief. It confirms that the indigenous religious system of Mesoamerica was and still is much more terrestrially focused that has been generally appreciated.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=WUxfkC0MWtsC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Motifs: An Introduction to French (Teacher's Edition)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Balkans: A Short History (Modern Library Chronicles)","description":"Throughout history, the Balkans have been a crossroads, a zone of endless military, cultural and economic mixing and clashing between Europe and Asia, Christianity and Islam, Catholicism and Orthodoxy. Subject to violent shifts of borders, rulers and belief systems at the hands of the world's great empires--from the Byzantine to the Habsburg and Ottoman--the Balkans are often called Europe's tinderbox and a seething cauldron of ethnic and religious resentments. Much has been made of the Balkans' deeply rooted enmities. The recent destruction of the former Yugoslavia was widely ascribed to millennial hatreds frozen by the Cold War and unleashed with the fall of communism. In this brilliant account, acclaimed historian Mark Mazower argues that such a view is a dangerously unbalanced fantasy. A landmark reassessment, The Balkans rescues the region's history from the various ideological camps that have held it hostage for their own ends, not least the need to justify nonintervention. The heart of the book deals with events from the emergence of the nation-state onward. With searing eloquence, Mazower demonstrates that of all the gifts bequeathed to the region by modernity, the most dubious has been the ideological weapon of romantic nationalism that has been used again and again by the power hungry as an acid to dissolve the bonds of centuries of peaceful coexistence. The Balkans is a magnificent depiction of a vitally important region, its history and its prospects.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iWgfMZhi-x0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The March of the Twenty-Six (Pen & Sword Military Classics)","description":"Between the years 1804 and 1815, Napoleon created twenty-six Marshals of France.

Roy Lichtenstein: History in the Making, 1948-1960 is the first major museum exhibition to investigate the early work of one of the best-known American artists of the twentieth century. Co-organized by Colby College Museum of Art and Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University, the exhibition will include approximately ninety works from the artist's fruitful and formative early career, many never before seen by the public. The show and accompanying catalog will include paintings, drawings, sculptures, and prints which reveal an artist, even in the earliest stages of his career, with a keen interest in visual culture, culling--with a critical eye--from a wide range of sources. These inspirations were the essential but little-known precursors to the artist's later sourcing of comic books and advertisements. Likewise, his exploration of abstraction, just before the artist's abrupt turn to Pop Art in 1961, straddles the line between unabashed lyricism and wry critique of second-generation Abstract Expressionism. The catalog, with new scholarship by leading experts in the field, provides a new understanding of Lichtenstein's influential techniques of appropriation and offers the opportunity to more fully assess the artistic and cultural dynamism of postwar America.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=9_AFEAAAQBAJ&dq=Roy+Lichtenstein,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The kids first microwave cookbook","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Wealth of Family: An Adopted Son's International Quest for Heritage, Reunion, and Enrichment (Family Success)","description":"This inspiring adoption and reunion saga delivers provocative viewpoints on multicultural families and powerful insights on overcoming racism and poverty.

The Anarchists' Convention is his first short story collection, providing a prism of America through fifteen stories. These everyday people a kid on the road heading west, aging political activists, a lonely woman in Boston go about their business with humor and resilience, dealing more in possibility than fact. In the widely anthologized and O. Henry Award-winning \\"I-80 Nebraska,\\" Sayles perfectly renders the image of a pill-popping trucker who has become a legend of the road.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=b5uix_Z5iwIC&dq=The+Anarchists%27+Convention:+Stories&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Come Ninevah, Come Tyre: The Presidency of Edward M. Jason","description":"The Advise and Consent series is a landmark of political fiction, displaying a depth of insider Washington knowledge and a canvas of compelling characters that catapulted each novel to the top of the bestseller lists. At the end of the previous novel, Preserve and Protect, Allen Drury left his readers with one of the greatest cliffhangers of all time. After an assassin's bullet rings out, we are left to wonder who was killed-the Liberal Vice President Ted Jason, or staunch Conservative Presidential Candidate Orrin Knox? The answer to that question was so large that Pulitzer-Prize winner Drury had to write two novels, one exploring the full ramifications of each outcome. In Come Nineveh, Come Tyre, China and the Soviet Union are waiting and watching for any sign of weakness from the untried Ted Jason, survivor of the assassination attempt that took the life of Orrin Knox and catapulted him into the Presidency. Ted Jason has been thrust into this position of power-is he up to the challenge of leadership in such a time of crisis? Or will he bend too far toward appeasement, at the cost of freedom around the world? Looking at the stakes for the United States against the backdrop of war, politics, and scandal, President Jason must play winner-take-all in this game of politics.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=MNj2oQEACAAJ&dq=Come+Ninevah,+Come+Tyre:+The+Presidency+of+Edward+M.+Jason&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Herbal Preparations and Natural Therapies: Creating and Using a Home Herbal Medicine Chest (Books and VHS Cassettes)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=HEkbAQAAMAAJ&dq=Herbal+Preparations+and+Natural+Therapies:+Creating+and+Using+a+Home+Herbal+Medicine+Chest+(Books+and+VHS+Cassettes)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Antonin Artaud: Poet Without Words","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=2xNKtAEACAAJ&dq=Antonin+Artaud:+Poet+Without+Words&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The poetical works of Rupert Brooke,","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Why the Possum's Tail Is Bare, and Other North American Indian Nature Tales","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Long Way by Bernard Moitessier","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Mysterious Flame: Conscious Minds In A Material World","description":"In recent years the nature of consciousness our immediately known experiences has taken its place as the most profound problem that science faces.

Their destination: the former Spanish colony of Equatorial Guinea. Their mission: to remove one of the most brutal dictators in Africa in a privately organised coup d'etat. The plot had the tacit approval of Western intelligence agencies and, according to Mann, the backing of a European government. Simon Mann had personally planned, overseen and won two wars in Angola and Sierra Leone. Everything should have gone right. Why, then, did it go so wrong? When Simon was released from five years' incarceration in two of Africa's toughest prisons, he made worldwide headlines. Since then, he has spoken to nobody about his experiences. Now, he is telling everything, including: * His belief that the CIA deliberately compromised the coup to court favour with Equatorial Guinea's President Obiang, in return for access to the country's vast oil resources. * How the British government approached Simon in the months preceeding the Iraq war, asking him to suggest ways in which a justified invasion of Iraq could be engineered. * The real story behind the involvement of Mark Thatcher in the coup plot * Simon will also tell of his pain when he had to tell his wife, Amanda, who gave birth to their fourth child while he was incarcerated, that he believed he would never be freed.This is Simon's remarkable first-hand account of his life: an account that will read like a thriller as it takes us into the world of mercenaries and spooks: of murky imternational politics, big oil and big bucks; of action, danger, love, despair and betrayal.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ZyGtDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"W.I.T.C.H.

The British entered the picture in 1969 only to be caught in the middle. No one could see a resolution. Rory McCaan, a young man raised in Londonderry, and transplanted in the U.S. after becoming an orphan, leads an obscure band that only a few in his homeland know exists. He acquires vast resources and, with his companions, he attempts to redress crimes that both sides commit. As the story unfolds, one sees that Rory is not simply a vigilante. He has a larger purpose, one that he seeks to fulfill through his fortuitous association with Nealen McGowen, a young congressional staffer with equal fervor. While Rory returns to Ireland to inflict his various forms of retribution, Nealen ascends to fill his boss's seat. As Nealen's fixation on \\"the troubles\\" haunts him, he conspires with Rory to bring the conflict to America. His goal... to stir the passion of Irish-Americans and to get the U.S. involved.

Introd. by William Stringfellow","description":"To become and be a mature human being, to be alive, in the midst of such a drama in which all people do in truth live, describes a radical participation. To be alive means, as Father Berrigan puts it, enduring the crisis of grace. The fruit of the gift of Christ to this world is an unequivocal and utterly vulnerable immersion in the world as it is. . . . It means living in such a way that life is welcomed as the extraordinary gift which life is and, then, honoring that gift by extravagance: by giving one's own life away. They call us dead men, and we live, wrote St. Paul. Berrigan's immersion into Pauline theology has allowed him to present his deepest concerns for the Church's role in the world. Knowing that the Church can not live in retreat from life, he illuminates the implications of the Triple Revolution-race, peace, and technology- for committed Christians who wish to see true renewal within ecclesial life. --From the Introduction by William Stringfellow","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Rg5MAwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Combat Poets of Maya","description":"The Combat Poets of Maya have had enough of the MiliTechs, bureaucrats genetically designed to manage the poets' chaotic lives.

His legend as the Great Emancipator has grown to mythic proportions as hundreds of books, a national holiday, and a monument in Washington, D.C., extol his heroism and martyrdom. But what if most everything you knew about Lincoln were false? What if, instead of an American hero who sought to free the slaves, Lincoln were in fact a calculating politician who waged the bloodiest war in american history in order to build an empire that rivaled Great Britain's? In The Real Lincoln, author Thomas J. DiLorenzo uncovers a side of Lincoln not told in many history books--and overshadowed by the immense Lincoln legend. Through extensive research and meticulous documentation, DiLorenzo portrays the sixteenth president as a man who devoted his political career to revolutionizing the American form of government from one that was very limited in scope and highly decentralized as the Founding Fathers intended to a highly centralized, activist state. Standing in his way, however, was the South, with its independent states, its resistance to the national government, and its reliance on unfettered free trade. To accomplish his goals, Lincoln subverted the Constitution, trampled states' rights, and launched a devastating Civil War, whose wounds haunt us still. According to this provacative book, 600,000 American soldiers did not die for the honorable cause of ending slavery but for the dubious agenda of sacrificing the independence of the states to the supremacy of the federal government, which has been tightening its vise grip on our republic to this very day. In The Real Lincoln, you will discover a side of Lincoln that you were probably never taught in school a side that calls into question the very myths that surround him and helps explain the true origins of a bloody, and perhaps, unnecessary war.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=5B9qs5dAnuwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Peking Battles Cape Horn","description":"This classic sea adventure, first published in 1932, is now back in print in hardcover and softcover editions from Sea History Press, with new photos and with an Introduction by Exy Johnson.

Christians are taught that God is love and are commanded to love, their neighbors and their enemies. These truths are not controversial. What is controversial and, indeed, has been controversial throughout the history of Christianity is the meaning of this love. This book explores the tradition of Christian reflection on the meaning, and experience of love, loving, and being loved. Many books have been written about Christian love, but no book has gathered together this kind of primary source material and covered such a wide range of perspectives, allowing the reader to engage directly with the thought and experience of some of the greatest Christian minds on the topic of love. Bernard Brady covers with remarkable clarity the breadth and depth of discussions on Christian love from the Bible to contemporary experience to create this-a survey of how Christians through the ages have understood love. Beginning of course with the Bible, Brady examines the key writings and thinkers on the nature of Christian love: St. Augustine; mystics such as Bernard of Clairvaux, Hadewich, and Julian of Norwich; the great tradition and literature of courtly love, Thomas Aquinas, Martin Luther, S?ren Kierkegaard, and others. In addition, Brady devotes chapters to several 20th century figures whose lives seemingly embodied Christian love: Mother Theresa, Martin Luther King, Jr., and Pope John Paul II. Finally, Christian Love addresses contemporary deliberations over the meaning of love with an analysis of the modern writings of Martin D'Arcy, Reinhold Niebuhr, Jules Toner, Gustavo Guti rrez, Gene Outka, Margaret Farley, Edward Vacek, and Don Browning. In a synthesizing concluding chapter, Brady offers his own insightful and introspective understanding of the substance of Christian love, suggesting that it is an affective affirmation of another, that it is both responsive and unitive, and that it is steadfast and enduring. As a beautiful contemplative companion to one's own spiritual understanding, or as a thoughtful and meaningful gift, Christian Love is in every sense a treasure to behold, read, and share with those you love.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=bnRpeNVw8HcC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Arrangement","description":"A Pretty Woman tale turns toxic and deadly in this provocative thriller of sex, obsession, and murder from Robyn Harding, the  master of domestic suspense  (Kathleen Barber) and the USA TODAY bestselling author of The Swap and Her Pretty Face.

His writings on the war have never been collected in a single volume, and a number of them are published here for the first time. Although he was a vice president of the Anti-Imperialist League from 1901 to 1910, until now no thorough study had been made of his relationship with the organized opposition to the war.\\" \\"Drawing upon the unpublished manuscripts of Mark Twain and various leaders of the League, Jim Zwick's Introduction and headnotes provide the most complete account of Twain's involvement in the anti-imperialist movement.\\" \\"Mark Twain's writings sparked intense controversy when they were written. Readers will appreciate the continuing relevance and quotability of his statements on the abuse of patriotism, the \\"treason\\" of requiring school children to salute the flag, the right to dissent, the importance of self-government, and the value of America's democratic and anticolonial traditions.\\" \\"This book will prove valuable to all who are interested in Twain and his works as well as to teachers of literature, peace studies, and history.\\"--BOOK JACKET.Title Summary field provided by Blackwell North America, Inc.

In this masterful work of history, Evan Haefeli and Kevin Sweeney reexamine the Deerfield attack and place it within a framework stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes. Drawing on previously untapped sources, they show how the attack grew out of the aspirations of New England family farmers, the ambitions of Canadian colonists, the calculations of French officials, the fears of Abenaki warriors, and the grief of Mohawk women as they all struggled to survive the ongoing confrontation of empires and cultures. Haefeli and Sweeney reconstruct events from multiple points of view, through the stories of a variety of individuals involved. These stories begin in the Native, French, and English communities of the colonial Northeast, then converge in the February 29th raid, as a force of more than two hundred Frenchmen, Abenakis, Hurons, Kahnawake Mohawks, Pennacooks, and Iroquois of the Mountain overran the northwesternmost village of the New England frontier. Although the inhabitants put up more of a fight than earlier accounts of the so-called Deerfield Massacre have suggested, the attackers took 112 men, women, and children captive. The book follows the raiders and their prisoners on the harsh three-mile trek back to Canada and into French and Native communities. Along the way the authors examine how captives and captors negotiated cultural boundaries and responded to the claims of competing churches and empires - all against a backdrop of continuing warfare.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=VxR1AAAAMAAJ&dq=Captors+and+Captives:+The+1704+French+and+Indian+Raid+on+Deerfield+(Native+Americans+of+the+Northeast:+Culture,+History,&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Dake Annotated Reference Bible : Large Note Size (Genuine Leather, Black, Indexed) [LN56RIS]","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Assessment of Children and Youth","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Mirror, Mirror: Reflections on Who You Are and Who You'll Become (invert)","description":"Offers information and advice, with personal anecdotes, on what girls think of themselves and why, emphasizing a faith-based perspective on self-image.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1CDDuxAh0UoC&dq=Mirror,+Mirror:+Reflections+on+Who+You+Are+and+Who+You%27ll+Become+(invert)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Collectible Cats: An Identification and Value Guide (Collectible Cats Bk.

What brings these threads of the discussion together is the question of how advances in computer science  which are otherwise largely incomprehensible to researchers from other fields  can be effectively translated and capitalized on so as to make them beneficial for society as a whole. In this context, Rii Forum and Rii Forum proceedings offer an essential venue where diverse stakeholders, including academics, the think tank sector and decision-makers, can engage in a meaningful dialogue with a view to improving the applicability of advances in computer science. In brief, Rii Forum takes the imperative inherent in the 4th industrial revolution seriously, in that it identifies ways of making technology usable and therefore inclusive.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ute5DwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Story of Borge (The Library of Scandinavian Literature, V. 23)","description":"Beginning with 1953, entries for Motion pictures and filmstrips, Music and phonorecords form separate parts of the Library of Congress catalogue.

First published in 1934, it is here available for the first time in an authorized English translation. A realistic tale in the best tradition of the novels of social protest of Zola, Dosto-evsky, Jos  Eustasio Rivera, and the Mexican novels of the Revolution, The Villagers (Huasipungo) shocked and horrified its readers, and brought its author mingled censure and acclaim, when it was first published in 1934. Deeply moving in the dramatic intensity of its relentless evolution and stark human suffering, Icaza's novel has been translated into eleven foreign languages, including Russian and Chinese, and has gone through numerous editions in Spanish, including a revised and enlarged edition in 1953, on which this translation is based, but it has never before been authorized for translation into English. His first novel, but not his first published work, The Villagers is still considered by most critics as Icaza's best, and it is widely acclaimed as one of the most significant works in contemporary Latin American literature. Thirty years after its original publication in Ecuador, The Villagers still carries a powerful message for the contemporary world and an urgent warning. The conditions here portrayed prevail in these areas, even today. The Villagers is an indictment of the latifundista system and a caustic picture of the native worker who, with little expectation from life, finds himself a victim of an antiquated feudal system aided and abetted by a grasping clergy and an indifferent govern-ment.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tZyu-pN0yz4C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Preaching God's Word: A Hands-On Approach to Preparing, Developing, and Delivering the Sermon","description":"Learn to develop and deliver a biblical sermon that connects with today's audiences.

To this end, the book describes and explores those elements that are specific to pediatric psychopharmacology; this defines and positions the volume at the nexus of child and adolescent psychiatry, pediatrics, and pharmacology. A stellar roster of contributors addresses new treatments for youths with disruptive behavior disorders, mood disorders, anxiety disorders, pervasive developmental disorders, and psychotic illnesses and tackles some of the most important emerging issues in the field. For example, advances in understanding the long-term treatment effects of medications in pediatric populations are thoroughly reviewed, including not only maintenance studies that consider the durability of efficacy but also clinical trials of greater duration designed to specifically evaluate long-term safety. In addition, recent studies of combination therapies are examined, helping clinicians better understand how to treat the complicated patients that arrive every day at a prescribing clinician's office. Finally, because research designs now include a broader base of patient populations to make the data more applicable to everyday clinical practice, the book focuses on head-to-head studies with multiple active comparators. The book offers clinicians comprehensive, accessible information and boasts a multitude of helpful features: The book is organized by diagnosis instead of agent class. This makes it a true clinical desktop reference that allows clinicians to quickly and efficiently search treatment options and the evidence base on a case-by-case basis. DSM-5 criteria and information on comorbidities are also included. The American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Practice Parameters are integrated into the discussion, where applicable, in support of standard of care. The book has been updated to include the latest research at the time of publication. A new chapter has been added to address eating disorders, an area where psychopharmacological research that may apply to children and adolescents is now being pursued. Useful features to help the reader understand and retain the material include clinical summary points, easy to read tables, and current and carefully vetted references. The Clinical Manual of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology, Third Edition, is an indispensable guide to the substantive research that has been done in nearly every area of pediatric psychopharmacology, as well as the major improvements that have been made to the evidence-based practice of treating youths with psychiatric illness.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wHebDgAAQBAJ&dq=Child+and+Adolescent+Psychopharmacology,+1e&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Arithmetic Made Simple","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Uncle Shelby's ABZ Book (A primer for tender young minds)","description":"Writing for an adult audience, the popular children's book author presents a humorous satire of alphabet books.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=aPEfnSNCURwC&dq=Uncle+Shelby%27s+ABZ+Book+(A+primer+for+tender+young+minds)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"St. John of the Cross & the Bhagavad-Gita (Church and the World)","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Firefox Secrets: A Need-To-Know Guide","description":"Take Firefox to the next level.

Whitcomb is the first HRT member ever to write about his experience. With breathtaking immediacy, Whitcomb describes the brutal training, the weapons and tactics, and the unbreakable camaraderie of the HRT. In short order, after joining HRT in 1991, Whitcomb was sent on missions to Ruby Ridge and Waco, and his frank assessment of those missions is must reading for anyone interested in modern law enforcement.

He would be far enough away from home to be anonymous. He was ready! And the ladies did cluster: sensuous, gorgeous movie star Fifi; tempestuous dancer Rosie Blaze; and the lovely, unsettling Connie. So what if Calvin didn't get exactly the accountant's job he'd hoped for at the brassy Toluca Casino. Being a busboy-shill-exotic dancer-Romeo had rewards he'd never dreamed of. Big Time!

The selections span twelve centuries, from Homer to Saint Jerome. The texts and translations are reproduced as they appear in Loeb volumes. The Loeb Classical Library is the only existing series of books which, through original text and facing English translation, gives access to all that is important in Greek and Latin literature. The Loeb Classical Library Reader offers a unique sampling of this treasure trove. In these pages you will find, for example: Odysseus tricking the Cyclops in order to escape from the giant's cave; Zeus creating the first woman, Pandora, cause of mortals' hardships ever after; the Athenian general Nicias dissuading his countrymen from invading Sicily; Socrates, condemned to die, saying farewell; a description of Herod's fortified palace at Masada; Cicero's thoughts on what we owe our fellow men; Livy's description of the rape of the Sabine women; Manilius on the signs of the zodiac; Pliny's observation of the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 CE. Here you can enjoy looking in on people, real and imaginary, who figure prominently in ancient history, and on notable events.

It is the story of socially forbidden love between an idealistic young Frenchman and an apparently white American woman with African ancestry. The couple's idealism fades as they repeatedly face racial prejudice and violence, and are eventually forced to seek shelter among exiled Cherokee people. Notable as the first abolitionist novel to focus on racial prejudice rather than bondage as a social evil, Beaumont's work was also the first to link prejudice against Native Americans to prejudice against blacks. This translation, with a new introduction by Gerard Fergerson, provides modern readers with interesting insights into the inconsistencies and injustices of democratic Jacksonian society.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=SE_FQmoxCs8C&dq=Marie,+or+Slavery+in+the+United+States:+A+Novel+of+Jacksonian+America&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"From Rural Village to Global Village: Telecommunications for Development in the Information Age (LEA Telecommunications Series)","description":"From Rural Village to Global Village: Telecommunications for Development in the Information Age examines the role of information and communication technologies (ICTs) on both the macro level--societal, socio-economic, and governmental--and sector level--education, health, agriculture, entrepreneurship--emphasizing rural and developing regions.

Deep Time of the Media takes us on an archaeological quest into the hidden layers of media development dynamic moments of intense activity in media design and construction that have been largely ignored in the historical-media archaeological record. Siegfried Zielinski argues that the history of the media does not proceed predictably from primitive tools to complex machinery; in Deep Time of the Media, he illuminates turning points of media history fractures in the predictable that help us see the new in the old. Drawing on original source materials, Zielinski explores the technology of devices for hearing and seeing through two thousand years of cultural and technological history. He discovers the contributions of \\"dreamers and modelers\\" of media worlds, from the ancient Greek philosopher Empedocles and natural philosophers of the Renaissance and Baroque periods to Russian avant-gardists of the early twentieth century. \\"Media are spaces of action for constructed attempts to connect what is separated,\\" Zielinski writes. He describes models and machines that make this connection: including a theater of mirrors in sixteenth-century Naples, an automaton for musical composition created by the seventeenth-century Jesuit Athanasius Kircher, and the eighteenth-century electrical tele-writing machine of Joseph Mazzolari, among others. Uncovering these moments in the media-archaeological record, Zielinski says, brings us into a new relationship with present-day moments; these discoveries in the \\"deep time\\" media history shed light on today's media landscape and may help us map our expedition to the media future.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=cL9NEAAAQBAJ&dq=Deep+Time+of+the+Media:+Toward+an+Archaeology+of+Hearing+And+Seeing+by+Technical+Means&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Working With Anger","description":" Inspiring and humble in its approach,  this book applies Buddhist philosophy to overcoming and preventing anger in our lives (Sharon Salzberg, author of Lovingkindness) Anger plagues all of us on a personal, national, and international level.

His reacquaintance with Venice, a city he loved, provided the inspiration for Across the River and into the Trees, the story of Richard Cantwell, a war-ravaged American colonel stationed in Italy at the close of the Second World War, and his love for a young Italian countess. A poignant, bittersweet homage to love that overpowers reason, to the resilience of the human spirit, and to the worldweary beauty and majesty of Venice, Across the River and into the Trees stands as Hemingway's statement of defiance in response to the great dehumanizing atrocities of the Second World War. Hemingway's last full-length novel published in his lifetime, it moved John O'Hara in The New York Times Book Review to call him \\"the most important author since Shakespeare.\\"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=TY8BgIdcUAwC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Too many books!","description":"Maralou's idea to reduce her enormous book collection benefits many people.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=5HUGMdXp66IC&dq=Too+many+books!&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Pride of Lions","description":"Lion of Ireland was the breathtaking chronicle of Brian Boru, the Great King who led the bickering chiefs of Ireland to unity under his reign.

Now, with all the fire and brilliance for which her writing is known, Morgan Llywelyn takes us there, to the battlefield where Brian died, and to Brian's fifteen-year-old son, Donough, whose mother is the voluptuous and treacherous Gormlaith, with her lust for life and power undiminished by age: Donough, the son who is determined to make the High Kingship of Brian Boru's Ireland his own. \\"I know he's too young, but he's all we have left,\\" says Fergal, and thus the boy takes his first command, on the bloody ground of Clontarf. From there he must move to establish his right to rule in Kincora and to make the kings of Ireland accept him as their High King.

Secretly, we all hold grudges, but most of us probably think we shouldn t, and many of us deny that we do. To bear a grudge is too negative, right? Shouldn t we just forgive and move on? Wrong, says prolific crime novelist and self-appointed grudge guru Sophie Hannah, in her groundbreaking and irreverent self-help guide. Yes, it s essential to think positively if we want to live happy lives, but even more crucial is how we get to the positive. Denying our negative emotions and experiences is likely to lead only to more pain, conflict, and stress. What if our grudges are good for us? What if we could embrace them, and use them to help ourselves and others, instead of feeling ashamed of our inability to banish negative emotions and memories from our lives? With contributions from expert psychotherapists as well as extracts from her own extensive catalog of grudges, Sophie Hannah investigates the psychological origins of grudges and also offers not-so-obvious insights into how we should acknowledge and embrace them in order to improve the quality of our interpersonal relationships and senses of self. Grudges do not have to fill us with hate or make us toxic, bitter, and miserable. If we approach the practice of grudge-holding in an enlightened way, it will do the opposite we will become more forgiving. For fans of Sophie Hannah s bestselling crime novels who have ever wondered what is going on in her unusual, brilliant mind, How to Hold a Grudge is  a perfect document  (The New York Times) that also reveals everything we need to know about the many different forms of grudge, the difference between a grudge and not-a-grudge (not as obvious as it seems), when we should let a grudge go, and how to honor a grudge and distill lessons from it. Hannah s practical, compassionate, and downright funny guide can turn us into better, happier people.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=KlXDDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+grudge&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Take my life","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Call and Response: The Riverside Anthology of the African American Literary Tradition","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A Sum of Destructions: Picasso's Cultures and the Creation of Cubism","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Brazilian Cookery: Traditional and Modern","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Turning","description":"One of the greatest ghost stories ever told, The Turn of the Screw is now a feature film from Universal Pictures premiering January 24th, produced by Steven Spielberg and starring Finn Wolfhard and Mackenzie Davis This unsettling collection brings together eight of Henry James's tales exploring ghosts and the uncanny, including his infamous ghost story, \\"The Turn of the Screw,\\" a work saturated with evil.

These three words form the bottom line and top drawer of all his teachings. And they remain the three hardest words in the world to get right. Two pronouns and a verb have never been so difficult to grasp, much less to practice. Popular culture has ruined love s reputation by redefining it first as romance, and then as lust. But it s not just the meaning of the word love that causes so much confusion. To fully understand love, we also need to find out who we are in God s eyes and whom we are commanded to love. Following Jesus can be described as the daily practice of all three words: I. Love. You. There is nothing more rewarding, and nothing more risky. Join Leonard Sweet in this eye-opening, life-altering exploration of three simple, one-syllable words. After all, the lifestyle of love is the only life that Jesus calls you to live. There is nothing more challenging than adopting the three-word lifestyle of Jesus as your own. Perhaps you have wondered why love seems to work for everyone else, but not for you. Or maybe you ve done your best to love those around you, but it seems that life has drained your last drop of trust and affection. Nothing is better than love when it s right; and nothing is more destructive than attempts at love that fail to follow the Jesus prescription for a healthy life. Jesus devoted his earthly life to saying these three wordsI love youand teaching us how to say them. As Jesus defined love, it takes everything you ve got and then even more, which only God can give. The lifestyle of love is not something you can master on your own, but Jesus is ready to show you how. Starting today, you can learn to live  I love you the three hardest words in the world to get right. Leonard Sweet, PhD, serves as the E. Stanley Jones Professor of Evangelism at Drew Theological School in Madison, New Jersey.

Mr LeBon, who has 'published a book on the subject, Wise Therapy, said philosophy was perfectly suited to this type of therapy, dealing as it does with timeless human issues such as love, purpose, happiness and emotional challenges. \`Wise Therapy, is part of a series aimed at promoting an integrative attitude as its ethos.

Wise Therapy is well written and engaging.

Tim LeBon's book contains helpful suggestions, practical information, and useful examples, and would make a good addition to the library of any counsellors willing to allow philosophy to turn mere client sessions into wise therapy' - Peter Raabe, Practical Philosophy Wise Therapy is an original and practical guide to how philosophy can benefit counselling and psychotherapy. Tim LeBon argues that therapy, informed by philosophy, can help clients make better decision and achieve emotional wisdom. He uses philosophical approaches to explore issues of right and wrong, the emotions and reasons, well-being and the meaning of life, and develops a 'counsellor's toolbox' of techniques that can help practitioners apply the wisdom of philosophy to good therapeutic practice. For counsellors who may find philosophical approaches to therapy useful, this work addresses key philosophical topics - the emotions, free will, the meaning of life and ethics. It is jargon-free where possible and assumes no previous philosophical training. From The Independent, 16th November 2004 Plato is my agony aunt It was the end of a love affair that broke her heart. Could the wisdom of the great philosophers show her how to be happy again? Claire Smith tries a novel form of therapy \\"The unexamined life is not worth living,\\" Socrates said. Nor is the life you're left with after your boyfriend has left you for another woman - at least, that's how it felt in October last year when mine broke rank and went off with an art student from Cleveland, Ohio. We were over there for the opening of his new art exhibition. He'd flown over four days before me and had met her at a party. Supposedly, they \\"connected\\". The five months that followed were a roller-coaster of confusion, vitriol and despair. I knew there'd been problems in our relationship. We saw the world very differently; he delighted in the charm of the ordinary, I wanted maximum divinity. He walked; I galloped. He drank tea; I loathed the stuff. But, along the banks of the Thames, we'd made a promise to always stick together. Our love was something unique: \\"transcendental\\", I called it. And besides, we recycled. Surely a commitment to save the world would save our relationship? Alas, no. So there I was, a woman scorned. Hell truly hath no greater fury. And what made it worse was that I still believed in our transcendental love. If I wanted to change the way I was feeling, I needed to alter the way I was thinking. But how? A few bottles of wine and a sharp blow to the head might have done the trick. Fortunately, there's an older, more trusted way of turning your head on its head that counsellors are starting to use: philosophy. The idea of employing Plato as an agony aunt was begun in 1981 by the German philosopher Gerd Achenbach. Although philosophy spends a lot of its time asking real-life questions that affect real-life people - What is happiness? And is it always wrong to lie? - most of the debate goes on in ivory towers. What Achenbach and subsequent philosophers including Tim LeBon, the chairman of the UK's Society for Philosophy in Practice, wanted to do was \\"give practical application\\" to this gigantic library of great thoughts. So how does it work? Like most types of therapy, you sign up for a set of sessions. \\"Two would give you a new perspective on one issue; six would help you to make a major life-decision, like a career change; with 12 you can start to rethink your entire life philosophy,\\" explains LeBon. Each session lasts 50 minutes and costs  50 - and, no, you don't have to have any previous knowledge of philosophy. \\"If you think of Friends, it would suit Ross and Chandler more than Joey,\\" LeBon says. \\"It's for anyone who wants to make their emotions more intelligent. Or for those who have tried other kinds of therapy, and want something more cerebral.\\" The first session begins with the patient venting off about whatever's troubling them. The rant over, the counsellor then picks out some key concepts that are crucial to the problem - in the case of heartbreak, it is love and happiness that come hurtling to the fore - and then gets the patient to define what they mean. So, what is love? What is happiness? To kick-start the patient's thinking, LeBon describes what a great philosopher had to say about it. In my case, he tells me what Plato wrote about love in his Symposium: that to stop man fighting the gods, Zeus decided to cut each human in two, so they would lose their strength. \\"This, then, is the source of our desire to love each other,\\" Plato said. \\"Each of us is a 'matching half' of a human whole, because each was sliced like a flatfish, two out of one, and each of us is always seeking the half that matches him.\\" This method of probing what we might think are \\"obvious\\" ideas, such as love and happiness, was devised by Socrates in the squares of Athens. \\"The only I thing I know is that I know nothing at all,\\" he boasted. What Socrates showed was that although many of the thinkers of his time thought they knew what justice, happiness and goodness meant, their understanding was tied in to their personal agenda and world view, and, what's more, when pushed, their ideas often contradicted themselves. A bit like me on love. Whereas part of my understanding of love was something that gave life meaning, made it worth living and bound us together, I also believed that true love was \\"transcendental\\": that it was out of this world, and it didn't matter if the two people who loved each other couldn't get along in the day-to-day. Love was bigger than the mundane. But when it came to the next stage of the therapy, critical thinking - \\"to check out whether your assumptions stand up to examination\\" - I walked head first into a contradiction. If I think love's purpose is to make life worth living, but then say it's irrelevant to daily life, surely my two ideas of love are not compatible? As the cogs in my brain start to creak into motion, I feel myself taking a step back from my predicament: thinking about how I've been thinking. This idea I had of transcendental love might have started off as a romantic dream. But when the relationship stopped working, and I found myself feeling trapped and frustrated, I used it to justify the mechanics of a relationship that just didn't work in the daily grind. I used it to lie to myself. In the final stage, LeBon gets me to start thinking about how to go forward. \\"You can't change what has happened,\\" he says. \\"You can't change that he's left you, or how you behaved in the relationship. So, as the Stoics did, let's work on controlling the controllables: the things that you can change.\\" To work out what can be changed, he gets me to try out a thought experiment, a method often used in philosophy to imagine other worlds where people can have different codes of behaviour. Thought experiments shatter your preconceived ideas of how the world should be and let your imagination run wild to how the world could be. \\"I find Viktor Frankl very useful here, the Austrian psychiatrist and concentration-camp survivor who actually believed that everything in life happens for a purpose,\\" LeBon says. \\"Suppose this break-up did happen for a reason that will work to your benefit,\\" he suggests. \\"What might that be? The answer might be that you can now focus on something important that was denied in the relationship. Or - the Hollywood version - so you'll meet someone who is really right for you.\\" Temporarily freed of any sense of responsibility for the relationship that was, and its sorry demise, the list came fast. I could now travel more; he didn't like me travelling on my own, but too often he didn't want to go anywhere, preferring to stay in his studio and make art. I'd love to meet someone with a similar sense of adventure to mine. For the first time in two years, I was being honest with myself about what I really wanted - listening to those voices that we all have inside our heads, and too often try to muzzle. So did philosophy save me? Well, I'm now dating a travel writer I have to run to keep up with. I still haven't got over the fact that my replacement came from Cleveland, Ohio. But I guess I never will.

But there is also always some reason in madness\\" - Friedrich Nietzsche   \\"That man shall live as his own master and in happiness who can say each day 'I have lived'\\" - Horace   \\"The good of man is the active exercise of his soul's faculties in conformity with excellence or virtue... Moreover this activity must occupy a complete lifetime; for one swallow does not make spring, nor does one fine day; and similarly one day or a brief period of happiness does not make a man supremely blessed and happy\\" - Aristotle   \\"There is nothing on this earth more to be prized than friendship\\" - Thomas Aquinas   \\"Whatever you do... love those who love you\\" - Voltaire   \\"Happiness is not an ideal of reason but of imagination\\" - Immanuel Kant   \\"Happiness is a state of which you are unconscious. The moment you are aware that you are happy, you cease to be happy\\" - Jiddu Krishnamurti   \\"Love is an ideal thing. Marriage is a real thing\\" - Johann Wolfgang von Goethe I shrink, therefore I am Therapy has many answers, but some questions require the help of a philosopher, says Clint Witchalls Sunday November 21, 2004 The Observer Danny had worked in the City of London for 10 years. As a research analyst, stockbroker and fund manager, he'd made a lot of valuable contacts, earnt a lot of cash, and learnt some important business skills. However, as he approached his mid-thirties, he no longer felt good about himself or what he did for a living, and he found his colleagues cold and unfriendly. A chronic illness made him realise his mortality, and he began to reassess his priorities. Danny had been struggling with his career conundrum for nearly five years when he met David Arnaud, a philosophical counsellor. After a few soul-searching sessions, Danny arrived at a decision. Today, he teaches economics to sixth-formers, and he loves it. 'It's a much better lifestyle,' he says. Many people are turning to philosophical counsellors to get answers to questions such as: 'How do I make sense of myself?' 'What is important to me?' 'Where am I going?' These are perhaps not the sort of questions that require psychiatric intervention, but Arnaud, who recently completed the first empirical study of philosophical counselling in the UK, has found that within just five sessions the majority of clients, with important decisions to make, tend to move from a state of concern and confusion to a resolution. Modern philosophical counselling can be traced back to 1981, when the philosopher Gerd Achenbach opened the first practice near Cologne. Achenbach referred to the new discipline as 'therapy for the sane.' Today, there are hundreds of philosophical counsellors around the world, with the movement particularly strong in the US, Britain and the Netherlands. 'The dilemmas people face aren't always primarily psychological,' says Alex Howard, a philosophical counsellor from Newcastle. 'If people face problems that are social or economic, it doesn't make sense to define their problems in purely psychological terms.' Tim LeBon, a founder member of the Society for Philosophy in Practice (SPP) and author of Wise Therapy, adds: 'We are faced with far more life choices than our grandparents, yet have far fewer resources to deal with them. Our grandparents may have gone to a priest or to other family members for advice; most people don't trust these solutions any more and so want to make their own well-informed, well thought-out choices. Philosophical counselling can help these people - people in mid-life crises who are wondering how to make the most of the rest of their life. People who want to take stock of their values.' Where stressed executives might once have been prescribed a course of tranquillisers or antidepressants, they can now get a dose of Bertrand Russell instead: 'Success is too dearly purchased if all the other ingredients have been sacrificed to obtain it.' While some philosophical counsellors do recommend books for their clients to read, most sessions are about helping the client identify faulty thoughts. For example, a briefing in Aristotelian logic might show a client why their beliefs are erroneous. The person might infer that they're a screw-up because they've screwed up. The counsellor could point out that they're making an error called 'fallacy of composition' - that is, what's true of the part isn't necessarily true of the whole. In philosophical counselling, problems aren't pathologised as they are by the psychiatric profession, and the dialogue between client and counsellor is more like a meeting of equals, compared to many therapies where the client is treated like a patient and seen as someone who is, in some way, inadequate. 'Anybody can benefit from philosophical counselling,' says Howard. 'But it does require someone who is willing to take stock.' Lou Marinoff, author of international bestseller Plato Not Prozac! has done much to promote philosophical counselling. 'Some people who have stabilised their neurochemistry and validated their emotions now wish to examine or re-examine the criteria of their beliefs, the principles of their conduct, or the meaning of their lives,' he says. 'With whom shall they do this? Psychologists and psychiatrists can shed light on such issues - as can rabbis, priests, imams and gurus. Philosophers are now rejoining the ranks of helpers.' LeBon believes certain therapies (such as cognitive behavioural therapy) don't go far enough in helping their clients. 'For instance, if you are anxious about your relationship, a cognitive therapist would try to dispute your catastrophising and jump to conclusions to make you feel less anxious,' says LeBon. 'A philosophical counsellor would do this, but would also look for existential meaning in your anxiety - perhaps you really don't want to be in the relationship and that is what your anxiety is telling you.' LeBon also gives short shrift to psychoanalysts. 'There's very little evidence for the Freudian unconscious, and it's time to move on to more intellectually satisfying and helpful therapies,' he says. However, Alain de Botton, the man who popularised philosophy as self-help, isn't ready to bury psychologists and their ilk just yet. 'The truth is that psychoanalysis grew out of philosophy - it's not some completely new idea, and in fact, done properly, psychoanalysis is philosophical anyway. It may even be dangerous to the mental health of some people to suggest a philosopher rather than a properly trained analyst. The knowledge of analysts when it comes to many emotional problems is now much greater than that of most philosophers.' Guardian Unlimited ?

Our twentieth century then produced the theory that has been serving physicists so faithfully for over sixty years -- quantum mechanics. The landscape of the new world is quire unlike our own. So different that phsyicists frequently lack words to describe it. Quantum mechanics had to create new conceptions for the world of the ultrasmall, bizarre conceptions beyond the scope of pictorial imagery. Customary physical laws cease to operate in the new world. Particles lose their dimensions and acquire the properties of waves. Electrons and the other building stones of matter can pass through impenetrable barriers, or they can vanish altogether leaving only photons in their place. Those are the things quantum mechanics dealt with. This book will tell you about the origin and development of quantum mechanics, about its new concepts. It will describe how the new theory deciphered the secrets of the structure of atoms, molecules, crystals, atomic nulei, and how quantum mechanics is dealing with the problem of the most fundamental of all properties of matter --the interaction of particles and the relationships between fields and matter.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=wWDzMfn9NUQC&dq=ABC%27s+of+quantum+mechanics&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Study Skills For Learning Power, Second Edition And Myer Briggs Type Indicator","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Woodstock: History and Hearsay","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Laser Spectroscopy: Techniques and Applications (Practical Spectroscopy)","description":"This work describes experimental techniques using laser spectroscopy and presents specific practical applications for this technology in many fields, including physics, engineering, chemistry, medicine and bioscience.

A new history reveals how and why. Wiretapping is nearly as old as electronic communications. Telegraph operators intercepted enemy messages during the Civil War. Law enforcement agencies were listening to private telephone calls as early as 1895. Communications firms have assisted government eavesdropping programs since the early twentieth century and they have spied on their own customers too. Such breaches of privacy once provoked outrage, but today most Americans have resigned themselves to constant electronic monitoring. How did we get from there to here? In The Listeners, Brian Hochman shows how the wiretap evolved from a specialized intelligence-gathering tool to a mundane fact of life. He explores the origins of wiretapping in military campaigns and criminal confidence games and tracks the use of telephone taps in the US government s wars on alcohol, communism, terrorism, and crime. While high-profile eavesdropping scandals fueled public debates about national security, crime control, and the rights and liberties of individuals, wiretapping became a routine surveillance tactic for private businesses and police agencies alike. From wayward lovers to foreign spies, from private detectives to public officials, and from the silver screen to the Supreme Court, The Listeners traces the long and surprising history of wiretapping and electronic eavesdropping in the United States. Along the way, Brian Hochman considers how earlier generations of Americans confronted threats to privacy that now seem more urgent than ever.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=LH5dEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Samson Occom and the Christian Indians of New England","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=SYACAAAAYAAJ&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"American Archives","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Daimler-Benz in the Third Reich","description":"This is a study of the experience of one of Germany's most important armaments manufacturers - and automotive companies - during the period of the Third Reich.

The book quantifies the loss due to lack of quality of a performance characteristic by directly relating it to its deviation from target performance, and shows efficient experimental and analytical techniques to minimize it. Unlike other books on quality and industrial experimentation which treat the subject specialty in a localized manner, this book encompasses all major activities of an industry, and links them together with a common objective of reducing quality loss. Chapters of the book progress smoothly and build upon the previous chapters. Each chapter introduces the subject matter, then a real life case study follows and ends with question and answer session between Dr. Taguchi and the student in a typical class. The techniques shown are powerful but easy to apply, and does not require statistical background or any other prerequisites; thus, the subject can be taught to engineers in an industry or in engineering schools.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=1NtTAAAAMAAJ&dq=Introduction+to+Quality+Engineering+-+Designing+Quality+Into+products+and+Processes&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Civil War Generals of the Confederacy (History Makers (Lucent))","description":"Focuses on the military careers of influential generals of the Confederacy during the Civil War.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=zEQqb1cnQr4C&dq=Civil+War+Generals+of+the+Confederacy+(History+Makers+(Lucent))&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Alamosa Trail (Trail Drive Series, 15)","description":"","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=hivgAAAAMAAJ&dq=The+Alamosa+Trail+(Trail+Drive+Series,+15)&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Michelin USA Map (Rolled) No. 931, 8e","description":"","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=hWGS5M9ppVkC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Now You See Me","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"Air Courier Bargains: How to Travel World-Wide for Next To Nothing","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"A short history of the Chinese (The New Home Library)","description":"In this learned, yet readable, book, Joseph McDermott introduces the history of the book in China in the late imperial period from 1000 to 1800. He assumes little knowledge of Chinese history or culture and compares the Chinese experience with books with that of other civilizations, particularly the European. Yet he deals with a wide range of issues in the history of the book in China and presents novel analyses of the changes in Chinese woodblock bookmaking over these centuries. He presents a new view of when the printed book replaced the manuscript and what drove that substitution. He explores the distribution and marketing structure of books, and writes fascinatingly on the history of book collecting and about access to private and government book collections. In drawing on a great deal of Chinese, Japanese, and Western research this book provides a broad account of the way Chinese books were printed, distributed, and consumed by literati and scholars, mainly in the lower Yangzi delta, the cultural center of China during these centuries. It introduces interesting personalities, ranging from wily book collectors to an indigent shoe-repairman collector. And, it discusses the obstacles to the formation of a truly national printed culture for both the well-educated and the struggling reader in recent times. This broad and comprehensive account of the development of printed Chinese culture from 1000 to 1800 is written for anyone interested in the history of the book. It also offers important new insights into book culture and its place in society for the student of Chinese history and culture. 'A brilliant piece of synthetic research as well as a delightful read, it offers a history of the Chinese book to the eighteenth century that is without equal.' - Timothy Brook, University of British Columbia 'Writers, scribes, engravers, printers, binders, publishers, distributors, dealers, literati, scholars, librarians, collectors, voracious readers   the full gamut of a vibrant book culture in China over one thousand years   are examined with eloquence and perception by Joseph McDermott in The Social History of the Book. His lively exploration will be of consuming interest to bibliophiles of every persuasion.' - Nicholas A. Basbanes, author of A Gentle Madness, Patience and Fortitude, A Splendor of Letters, and Every Book Its Reader Joseph McDermott is presently Fellow of St John s College, Cambridge, and University Lecturer in Chinese at Cambridge University. He has published widely on Chinese social and economic history, most recently on the economy of the Song (or, Sung) dynasty for the Cambridge History of China.

The Curse examines the culture of concealment that surrounds menstruation and the devastating impact such secrecy has on women's physical and psychological health. Karen Houppert combines reporting on the potential safety problems of sanitary products--such as dioxin-laced tampons--with an analysis of the way ads, movies, young-adult novels, and women's magazines foster a \\"menstrual etiquette\\" that leaves women more likely to tell their male colleagues about an affair than brazenly carry an unopened tampon down the hall to the bathroom. From the very beginning, industry-generated instructional films sketch out the parameters of acceptable behavior and teach young girls that bleeding is naughty, irrepressible evidence of sexuality. In the process, confident girls learn to be self-conscious teens. And the secrecy has even broader implications. Houppert argues that industry ad campaigns have effectively stymied consumer debate, research, and safety monitoring of the sanitary-protection industry. By telling girls and women how to think and talk about menstruation, the mostly male-dominated media have set a tone that shapes women's experiences for them, defining what they are allowed to feel about their periods, their bodies, and their sexuality.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6IlCwf5BgJ0C&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"The Book of Shamanic Healing","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"I Want to Be an Astronaut","description":"Blast-off!

From before statehood, Swedish immigrants flooded into the small frontier towns of St. Paul and Minneapolis. Encouraged by agents who promised inexpensive and fertile farmland, they came by the thousands. By the turn of the twentieth century, over 126,000 Swedes lived in Minnesota--d their impact on everything in the state continues to today. In this concise history of Swedes in Minnesota, the newest addition to The People of Minnesota series, Anne Gillespie Lewis tells the rich history of this ethnic group in the state they would make their own. Swedes in Minnesota recounts the story of the great Swedish migration through numbers-- the census reports and settlement patterns. It also tells the story through the cultural institutions Swedes founded--e churches, schools, and lodges, the Swedish-language newspapers and businesses, the neighborhoods and the associations. But mostly this book tells the story through the people: the anecdotes, letters, and interviews from the immigrants themselves and from their grandchildren. For the many Minnesotans of Swedish ancestry, Lewis provides a remarkably concise portrait of an ethnic group striving to become American while struggling to maintain its ties to tradition.","infoLink":"https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=yZ3pETKBmFEC&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blood Run","description":"","infoLink":""},{"Title":"The Briary-Bush","description":"Unlike some other reproductions of classic texts (1) We have not used OCR(Optical Character Recognition), as this leads to bad quality books with introduced typos.

The Second Part to The Temple of Kubla Khan A Path Unearthed For long years the Temple of Kubla Khan stood, a lonely edifice in the waste. Here the Khan's priests had paid homage to the demi-god of war. But in time of years their numbers dwindled and eventually the Temple fell into ruin. It stood unoccupied for ages until Yuggilv, the Crawling Queen, came to reside there, making the Temple a nightmarish prison. Unknown to the Queen, her prison's foundation were a Tomb's ceiling. Over all these long years the Tomb of Kubla Khan, long ago sealed to prying eyes, lay forgotten, hidden beneath the Temple's floors. But in time, a band of doughty adventurers managed to win their way into the Prison of Yuggilv. Through horrific struggles they came to her den and cast her and her foul minions to the abyss. Unbeknownst to them, they unearthed the hidden portals that led to the entrance of the Tombs themselves, far below the surface. War in the Lands of the Dead A horror lies within the Khan's Tomb.

Ethnic Studies.(Book review): An article from: American Review of Canadian Studies","description":"In the United States, some populations suffer from far greater disparities in health than others. Those disparities are caused not only by fundamental differences in health status across segments of the population, but also because of inequities in factors that impact health status, so-called determinants of health. Only part of an individual's health status depends on his or her behavior and choice; community-wide problems like poverty, unemployment, poor education, inadequate housing, poor public transportation, interpersonal violence, and decaying neighborhoods also contribute to health inequities, as well as the historic and ongoing interplay of structures, policies, and norms that shape lives. When these factors are not optimal in a community, it does not mean they are intractable: such inequities can be mitigated by social policies that can shape health in powerful ways. Communities in Action: Pathways to Health Equity seeks to delineate the causes of and the solutions to health inequities in the United States. This report focuses on what communities can do to promote health equity, what actions are needed by the many and varied stakeholders that are part of communities or support them, as well as the root causes and structural barriers that need to be overcome.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=AIKPDgAAQBAJ&dq=Force+of+Choice:+Perspectives+on+Special+Operations.+Ethnic+Studies.(Book+review):+An+article+from:+American+Review+of+Canadian+Studies&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Chasing Ghosts: The Remarkable Story of One Man's Investigation of the Assassination of President John F.

David Graeber reexamines a century of anthropological thought about value and exchange, in large measure to find a way out of ongoing quandaries in current social theory, which have become critical at the present moment of ideological collapse in the face of Neoliberalism. Rooted in an engaged, dynamic realism, Graeber argues that projects of cultural comparison are in a sense necessarily revolutionary projects: He attempts to synthesize the best insights of Karl Marx and Marcel Mauss, arguing that these figures represent two extreme, but ultimately complementary, possibilities in the shape such a project might take. Graeber breathes new life into the classic anthropological texts on exchange, value, and economy. He rethinks the cases of Iroquois wampum, Pacific kula exchanges, and the Kwakiutl potlatch within the flow of world historical processes, and recasts value as a model of human meaning-making, which far exceeds rationalist/reductive economist paradigms.","infoLink":"http://books.google.com/books?id=nJPmwAEACAAJ&dq=Toward+an+Anthropological+Theory+of+Value+The+False+Coin+of+Our+Own+Dreams&hl=&source=gbs_api"},{"Title":"Blood Lure","description":"Straddling the border between Montana and Canada lies the Waterton-Glacier International Peace Park ?
